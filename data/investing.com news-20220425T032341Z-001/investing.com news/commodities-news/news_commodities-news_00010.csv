Crude Oil WTI Futures for April delivery were trading at $61.08 a barrel in Asia at 11:35pm ET, up 0.20%. Brent Oil Futures for May delivery, traded in London, were up 0.08% at $64.94 per barrel. 
Prices were supported by healthy demand. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said on Wednesday that oil consumption was expected to grow by 1.62 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018. 
But overshadowing this market optimism is the relentless increase in U.S. crude output, which hit another record last week by climbing to 10.38 million bpd, up by more than 23% since mid-2016. Commercial crude rose by 5 million barrels, at 430.93 million barrels. 
U.S. crude production has already topped that of top exporter Saudi Arabia, and by late 2018 is expected to surpass 11 million bpd, overtaking top producer Russia. 
This is undermining OPEC efforts to prop up prices by cutting output. OPEC has been reducing output by around 1.2 million bpd since January 2017, but with the U.S ramping up production, the cuts eat into OPEC's market share. 
On Wednesday, OPEC raised its forecast for non-member oil supply to almost double the growth predicted four months ago. The group said non-OPEC producers would boost supply by 1.66 million bpd in 2018. 
But OPEC expects demand to grow by only 1.62 million bpd this year, leaving the market oversupplied and in need of more supply restraint. 
Estimates by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) also show global supplies will rise above 100 million bpd for the first time in the second quarter of this year, while demand will only surpass that level in the third quarter, implying an oversupplied market. 
Currently, oil markets remain relatively weak. Prices have strayed far from their January highs of almost $67 for WTI and over $70 per barrel for Brent. "

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose on Thursday after early losses, supported by a pickup in equity markets, but limited by evidence that supply will overtake demand this year. 
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) rose 44 cents to $65.33 a barrel by 1357 GMT, clawing their way back from a drop in early European trading, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were up 52 cents at $61.48 a barrel. 
Global oil demand is expected to pick up this year but supply is growing at a faster pace, leading to a rise in inventories in the first quarter of 2018, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. 
""Oil and (the stock market) have been moving hand in hand ... which basically means oil is extremely sensitive to the growth outlook,"" SEB commodity strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said, adding he still expected demand growth to reach 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) this year.
U.S. stocks rose, driven by financial and energy blue-chips (SPX), helping to boost the oil price, which has moved in sync with equities uninterruptedly for the past 99 trading days, the longest such stretch in two years. 
OPEC and several other non-OPEC producers led by Russia began cutting supply in January 2017 to erase a global glut of crude that had built up since 2014.
The IEA and OPEC both reported a modest rise in global inventory levels in January. 
Looming over markets has been a relentless climb in U.S. crude output , which hit another record last week by rising to 10.38 million bpd, up by more than 23 percent since mid-2016. Commercial crude inventories  were up by 5 million barrels, at 430.93 million barrels.
""Surging U.S. output levels will continue to undermine OPEC's efforts for stronger oil prices,"" said Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures in a note on Thursday.

U.S. crude production, which has already overtaken that of top exporter Saudi Arabia, is expected to rise above 11 million bpd later this year, taking the top spot from Russia, according to the IEA.
The IEA believes non-OPEC supply, led by the United States, will grow by 1.8 million bpd this year, while demand will grow by about 1.5 million bpd. 
The OPEC cuts combined with rising U.S. output mean OPEC is losing market share.

""In 2018, demand for OPEC crude is forecast at 32.6 million bpd, down by 0.2 million bpd from the previous assessment and 0.2 million bpd lower than a year earlier,"" OPEC said.(GRAPHIC: World oil supply and demand balance - http://reut.rs/2FIxGvP)

2,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Differences on North Korea key to Trump's Tillerson decision: sources,"By Steve Holland and Lesley Wroughton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Differences over how to deal with North Korea's nuclear challenge were a key factor in President Donald Trump's decision to replace Rex Tillerson as U.S. secretary of state, according to sources familiar with the internal deliberations.
Tillerson had been an early advocate of talks with North Korea to the annoyance of Trump, who wanted to keep applying maximum pressure on Pyongyang before responding to an invitation to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the sources said.
That had led to fear that Tillerson might be too willing to make concessions to North Korea, the sources said.
""He's got to have somebody in there that he totally trusts,” said a senior U.S. official.
In recent weeks Trump spent time putting in place a succession plan, lining up Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo to take over at the State Department and CIA deputy director Gina Haspel to replace Pompeo as the head of the spy agency, the source said.
A key aim was to get the team in place prior to moving ahead with North Korea.
Trump and Kim have committed to meeting at a time and place to be determined before the end of May to discuss North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
In a snub, Tillerson was left out of the loop regarding the North Korean invitation and was on his first trip to Africa when Trump sat down at the White House with a visiting delegation from South Korea last Thursday and agreed to meet Kim.
The next day, Friday, Trump told White House Chief of Staff John Kelly to tell Tillerson he needed to resign, White House officials said.
One source said Kelly had been trying to protect Tillerson as long as he could, but that Trump had grown weary of Tillerson's tendency to contradict the president on a variety of issues and had been telling friends he was about to dump him.
Tillerson, who was in Nairobi at the time and still had two stops to go - Chad and Nigeria - asked that he first return to the United States before it was announced. 
Hours after Tillerson landed in Washington on Tuesday, Trump announced on Twitter that he was being dismissed and replaced by Pompeo.
State Department officials said Tillerson did not know why he was being pushed out. One of them, Steve Goldstein, was fired later on Tuesday after he contradicted the White House's version.
Tillerson, whose tenure ends on March 31, returned to the State Department on Wednesday to hand over responsibilities to John Sullivan, his deputy, and to meet with senior officials, a State Department official said.
The official said Tillerson's chief of staff, Margaret Peterlin, and deputy chief of staff, Christine Ciccone, had resigned. 

It was not immediately clear whether Tillerson's policy chief, Brian Hook, would stay on beyond March 31. The department announced on Wednesday that Hook would travel to Vienna to participate in a meeting on Friday on the Iran nuclear deal.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for April delivery rose 25 cents to settle at $60.96 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent rose 0.11% to trade at $64.78 a barrel.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by 5.022 million barrels for the week ended March 9, well above expectations for  a rise of 2.023 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – fell by 6.271 million barrels, confounding expectations for a decline of 1.176 million barrels, while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – fell by 4.36 million barrels, beating expectations for a decline of just 1.519 million barrels.
The large draw in product inventories helped offset a gloomy report on oil outlook after OPEC nearly doubled its estimate on non-OPEC production for 2018.
OPEC raised its growth forecast for non-OPEC production in 2018 by 280,000 barrels a day (bpd) to 1.66 million bpd this year, warning that non-OPEC supply growth, led by the U.S., will outstrip growth in global oil demand in 2018. That echoed the EIA’s report Monday, estimating output from major shale formations to rise by 131,000 bpd in April to an all-time high 6.95 million bpd.
In sign that the oil-cartel's production cuts could by waning, inventories across the most industrialized countries rose in January for the first time in eight months, according to OPEC's monthly report.
Goldman Sachs, however, remained bullish on oil prices as the investment bank's commodity research team said it expects global crude oil inventories to continue to decline. 
""Combined with our expectation for strong oil demand growth and high OPEC compliance, we reiterate our constructive forecast on oil prices with global inventories set to fall further below their 5-year average levels through 3Q18,"" Goldman Sachs said."
4,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 02:18PM ET</span>","Gold Prices Unchanged Despite Weaker US Economic Data, Tariff Woes","Investing.com – Gold prices traded roughly flat Wednesday as the precious metal struggled to capitalize on dollar weakness despite weaker economic data and growing fears that Trump’s wish to slap tariffs on Chinese production could trigger a trade war. 
Gold futures for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $2.10, or 0.16%, to $1,325 a troy ounce. 
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that retail sales fell 0.1% last month. That confounded economists’ forecast for a 0.3% rise. That weighed on risk-on sentiment as market participants slashed their expectations for first-quarter economic growth. 
U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors, Reuters reported Tuesday. 
That drew a sell-off in riskier assets Tuesday as traders feared that China would be force to retaliate, leading to a tit-for-tat trade war between the world’s largest two economies. 
Yet, offsetting those fears somewhat were reports that Trump is set to pick television commentator and economic analyst Larry Kudlow to replace Gary Cohn as the top White House economic adviser. 
Mr Kudlow - a free trade advocate - reportedly accepted the position Wednesday, and conceded that he was “in accord' with Trump's policies.
“Kudlow is for free trade, low taxes, light regulation,” Amherst said. 
With just a week remaining until the Federal Reserve makes a decision to stick or twist on interest rates, gold prices have struggled for upside momentum. 
In other precious metal trade, silver futures fell 0.49% to $16.55 a troy ounce, while platinum futures lost 0.40% to $963.40 an ounce.
Copper added 0.54% to $3.16, while natural gas fell 2.26% to $2.72."

HOUSTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. energy pipeline developers say they intend to pursue exemptions to the Trump Administration's proposed steel tariffs, as concerns grow for those companies and from key exporters to the United States like South Korea.
""We have a number of pipeline projects that would be impacted significantly by this cost increase,"" said Adam Bedard, chief executive of Arb Midstream, an energy transportation and marketing company. If exemptions become available, ""we'd certainly try and qualify for it.""
He was referring to the U.S. Commerce Department's effort to devise a procedure for companies to apply to avoid paying a 25 percent tariff on imported steel or 10 percent on imported aluminum. 
Commerce has 10 days to come up with the procedure to apply for exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariff declaration issued last week. There is a national security exemption for U.S. companies to buy steel items that domestic manufacturers do not produce in the volumes or quality required. The president also said exemptions would be available to certain countries. 
Imports account for 77 percent of the steel used in U.S. pipelines, according to a 2017 study conducted for the pipeline industry. Some manufacturers already have customers waiting two years for pipeline to construct lines to carry shale oil and gas from West Texas fields to U.S. Gulf Coast export hubs. 
Energy trade associations fought for a way around the tariff. They argued that U.S. manufacturers either do not offer key metal grades or diameters, or have long production times that would impede development of shale oil and gas pipelines. 
NAmerico Partners LP, which is proposing a multibillion dollar pipeline to move natural gas from west Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast, estimates the steel tariff would raise the cost to its customers by between 2 percent and 4 percent.
""We will do everything we are capable of to limit the impact to our shippers,"" said Jeff Welch, the company's managing partner. NAmerico has not yet made the final decision to begin construction of the 468-mile (753 kilometer) pipeline, he said.
Even with exemptions, tariffs could still raise costs and slow down projects, said Nicolas Adrian McTyre, an Austin, Texas attorney and former trial attorney for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
""You are looking at a new regulatory hurdle potentially and there are a lot of unknowns to that process currently."" 
SOUTH KOREA LOOKS ELSEWHERE 
One of the primary providers of steel for pipeline companies is South Korea. Manufacturers there have said they are considering sending exports to other parts of the world due to difficulties with shipping to the United States, even before the tariffs go into effect.
John Stoody, a spokesman for the U.S. Association of Oil Pipe Lines, said at least one member firm, which he did not name, tried to buy steel from South Korea in recent days, but was rebuffed due to tariff uncertainty.
""Foreign pipe sellers are hesitant to sell pipe,"" he said.
Executives at steel companies in South Korea say the move is nudging them toward non-U.S. markets. Seah Steel (KS:003030), whose sales to the United States account for 20 percent of total revenue, is exploring other markets, a company official said. 
Trump's tariff “will inevitably impact our exports, and make it necessary for us to find a new channel for exports,” the Seah official said. He declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Seah acquired two U.S. plants in 2016 to reduce any tariff burden, according to the company, but still has to rely on its Korean manufacturing lines for U.S. sales.
The U.S. Commerce Department said in April 2017 that it had found that Korean steel producers had been unfairly dumping OCTG in the U.S. market. 
Imports of oil country tubular goods (OCTG) from South Korea - which includes drill pipes, casing and tubings - were valued at about $1.1 billion for the mid-2014 to mid-2015 period it examined. That accounted for nearly 25 percent of all OCTG U.S. imports, ahead of all other countries, Commerce said at the time. 
Commerce responded by raising duties as high as 24.9 percent from a previous range of about 4 percent to 6.5 percent.
""The best case is to get exempted but there’s nothing else we can say,"" said Park Hoon, CEO of Husteel, on the sidelines of a meeting between Korean government officials and industry executives to discuss the tariffs. 

He said nearly 80 percent of the company's business relies on U.S. sales, and the company also is looking to other export markets.

Crude oil for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 26 cents, or 0.43%, to trade at $60.97 a barrel by 10:34AM ET (14:34GMT) compared to $60.89 ahead of the report.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 5.022 million barrels in the week ended February 10. Market analysts' had expected a crude-stock build of 2.023 million barrels, though the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a build of just 1.156 million.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, increased by 0.338 million barrels last week, the EIA said. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 430.9 million barrels as of last week, according to press release, which the EIA considered to be “in the lower half of the average range for this time of year”.
However, the report also showed that gasoline inventories decreased by 6.271 million barrels, compared to expectations for a draw of 1.176 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles fell by 4.360 million barrels, compared to forecasts for a decline of 1.519 million.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for May delivery was unchanged at $64.64 by 10:39AM ET (14:39GMT), compared to $64.67 before the release.
Meanwhile, Brent's premium to the WTI crude contract stood at $3.95 a barrel by 10:40AM ET (14:40GMT), compared to a gap of $3.93 by close of trade on Tuesday.
The inventory data arrived amid lingering concerns over increasing U.S. shale production.
Earlier on Wednesday, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) raised its forecast for oil supply from non-member countries in 2018 as higher prices encourage U.S. shale drillers to pump more, offsetting an OPEC-led deal to clear a supply glut and a collapse in Venezuelan production.
“For 2018, higher growth is expected on the back of the projected increase in U.S. shale production following a better price environment not only for shale producers, but also for other countries such as Canada, the UK, Brazil and China,” OPEC said in its monthly report released on Wednesday.
This would lead to ""a higher quarterly distribution throughout the year with a record-high level projected for the fourth quarter,"" OPEC predicted.
OPEC, along with some non-members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 in an effort to reduce the global supply cut.
However, higher prices have encouraged U.S. shale producers to ramp up output, stoking worries that the increase would upset OPEC attempts to rebalance markets.
The U.S. passed the 10 million barrel production mark earlier this year, surpassing the OPEC output leader Saudi Arabia.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for April delivery rose 1.7 cents to $1.9083 a gallon by 10:41AM ET (14:41GMT), while April heating oil gained 1.0 cents to $1.8841 a gallon."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP) will cut hundreds of jobs at its overseas trading and export offices, including Britain, and move them to St Petersburg, according to two sources familiar with the plan, which comes at a time of rising tensions with the West. 
One of the sources said the decision reflected a broader trend of Russian state firms retreating from the West as part of President Vladimir Putin's drive to repatriate capital to reduce exposure to sanctions and also shore up the domestic economy. 
""In Russia, this story can be sold as a job creation exercise on home turf. This is useful, especially ahead of the presidential election,"" said the source, referring to the vote on Sunday that Putin is widely expected to win.
The reorganization comes as relations between Russia and Britain, where Gazprom has the largest trading office by far, have hit a new low after Prime Minister Theresa May said Moscow was to blame for the attempted murder a former Russian double agent in an English city.
However the jobs decision was taken earlier this year, long before the spy scandal erupted, according to the sources who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
Gazprom, which has its headquarters in St Petersburg, said it was too early to comment on numbers and moves. The company last month that it planned to reorganize its overseas trading and export operations but gave no details.
""This work is aimed at strengthening the company's position abroad,"" a spokesman said.
Gazprom's overseas trading and exports divisions employ around 2,000 people, with the bulk of them - around 1,000 - in London. It also has offices in locations including Paris, Houston, Singapore and cities in Germany. Not all employees are traders, as they also include finance and logistics specialists.
The reorganization will see the number of people more than halved, while about the same number of people will be hired in St Petersburg from where many trading operations will be executed, according to one of the sources who did not give more specific details about where the cuts would happen.
Since setting up Gazprom's trading offices in London in 2005, Gazprom has hired dozens of top traders from rival companies such as  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Gunvor. 
REPATRIATING CAPITAL
Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 triggered a series of U.S. and EU sanctions against the Kremlin and its companies, and ties have worsened further after Russia was accused of meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Russian state banks such as VTB and companies such as Rosneft have since scaled back their presence in the West, while some of Putin's closest allies such as businessman Gennady Timchenko have sold their assets in the West and repatriated capital to Russia.
The West has repeatedly accused Putin of using Gazprom as a economic and political weapon after the gas behemoth cut supplies to Ukraine, thus disrupting deliveries to Europe. Moscow denies that charge.
Europe gets a third of its gas from Russia, and Gazprom has spent 15 years on building a mighty trading division to help it further boost that share. 
The plan to move Gazprom's trading headquarters from London to St Petersburg was first considered by the company's management in 2015 but it was put on ice due to concerns about an exodus of people and the difficulties of raising credit for a capital-intensive operation, according to Gazprom sources.

The last time Gazprom's marketing and trading division published its results, for 2014, it said it made a net income of $613 million and a return on equity of 41 percent while staff costs stood at $162 million. The unit has not published results since.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 10:29AM ET</span>","OPEC sees oil supply surge from rivals, countering its cuts","By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC on Wednesday raised its forecast for non-member oil supply this year to almost double the growth predicted four months ago as higher prices spur U.S. shale drilling, offsetting OPEC-led output cuts and a collapse in Venezuelan production.
In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said non-OPEC producers would boost supply by 1.66 million barrels per day in 2018. That was the fourth straight rise from 870,000 bpd forecast in November.
""For 2018, higher growth is expected on the back of the projected increase in U.S. shale production following a better price environment not only for shale producers, but also for other countries such as Canada, the UK, Brazil and China,"" OPEC said of the outlook for non-OPEC supply. 
This would lead to ""a higher quarterly distribution throughout the year with a record-high level projected for the fourth quarter"", OPEC said.
OPEC, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers, but not the United States, began to cut supply in January 2017 in an effort to erase a global glut of crude that had built up since 2014. They have extended the pact until the end of 2018.
The deal has helped boost oil prices (LCOc1), which topped $71 a barrel this year for the first time since 2014 and were near $65 on Wednesday. But it has also encouraged a flood of shale, fuelling a debate about the curbs' effectiveness. 
Oil pared much of an earlier gain on Wednesday after the release of the OPEC report.
The Iranian oil minister said OPEC could agree at its next meeting in June to start easing the curbs in 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported. He also said OPEC should aim for oil around $60 to contain shale growth.
Top exporter Saudi Arabia, however, said in February it was premature to discuss an exit strategy.
Faster-than-expected growth in demand due to a robust world economy has added a tailwind to the OPEC supply effort.
Although OPEC in the report slightly raised its estimate of growth in world demand to 1.6 million bpd, it now projects the expansion in supply outside the group will exceed gains in demand.
This brings OPEC's view closer to that of the International Energy Agency, which expects a less rosy 2018 supply/demand balance.
VENEZUELAN PLUNGE
While rivals are pumping more, OPEC's production in February fell, according to the report.
Total output dropped by 77,000 bpd to 32.186 million bpd, led by declines in Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela, according to figures OPEC collects from secondary sources.
Adherence by the 12 OPEC members with output targets rose to 147 percent, according to a Reuters calculation based on the OPEC figures, higher than 137 percent in January based on last month's report. 
The figures that OPEC members reported themselves showed some deeper declines in production.
Venezuela, whose output is dropping amid an economic crisis, told OPEC its production sank by about 183,000 bpd to 1.586 million bpd in February. The number is believed to be the lowest in decades. 
With outside producers expected to increase supply by more than demand, OPEC cut its estimate of the global requirement for its crude in 2018 by 250,000 bpd to 32.61 million bpd.
Should OPEC keep pumping at February's level and other things remain equal, the market could move into a deficit of about 420,000 bpd, suggesting inventories will be drawn down. This is less than the deficit of about 560,000 bpd implied last month.
The supply cut's original aim was to shrink oil inventories in developed economies to their five-year average. The latest figures gave a mixed picture on stock movements.
Stocks rose by 13.7 million barrels in January to 2.865 billion barrels, although this was only 50 million above the five-year average, the closest yet OPEC has come to the original target.

OPEC is now talking of looking at other metrics to assess the market's rate of return to balance.

Oil production fell by 77,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the last month, to an average of 32.19 million barrels per day, the report said.
Meanwhile the organization said non-OPEC supply growth for 2018 was forecast at around 1.60 million barrels per day compared to 1.40 million barrels per day prior.
OPEC said its efforts to cut supply continued to support rebalancing the market. The price of oil has been caught between a supply agreement by OPEC and the rise in U.S. crude. The U.S. overtook Saudi Arabia as the biggest oil producer in January. The news eased investor concern that the rise in U.S. crude could dampen the efforts made by OPEC to end a supply glut.
OPEC agreed in December to cut oil output by 1.8 million bpd until the end of 2018. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.

(Reuters) - After almost three barren years for investors who have poured millions into the U.S. oil sector, producers are finally opening the floodgates to a wave of share buybacks that will return money to shareholders this year.
U.S. oil production topped 10 million barrels per day earlier this year, approaching a record set in 1970, but until recently many investors in the shale oil revolution were still waiting for their payday. (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oil-record-strategy-analysis/u-s-shale-investors-still-waiting-on-payoff-from-oil-boom-idUSKCN1G70IE)
Since the beginning of year, 11 companies have promised buybacks, with six alone in the past three weeks including  Devon Energy  (N:DVN),  Hess Corp  (N:HES) and  Noble Energy  Inc (N:NBL). In all, companies have committed to buy back about $3.6 billion worth of shares since February. 
(Graphic - Buyback mania: http://reut.rs/2Gq50ZF)
The United States' second largest producer  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) also weighed in last week, hinting it would start buying back shares if it produced stronger cash flow in 2018.
The payouts come courtesy of a combination of higher and more stable oil prices and pressure from investors.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (CLc1) has more than doubled, crossing $60 per barrel. Back in Feb. 11, 2016, oil fell to $26.05, its lowest in 13 years. 
""There was a time when the consensus was that we'd be stuck at around $45 a barrel for oil, and obviously conditions have improved since then,"" said Derek Rollingson, a portfolio manager at ICON Advisers. 
""There is a disconnect between commodity prices and returns from exploration and production companies."" 
Before oil started to take a downturn in 2014, energy companies had spent billions of dollars in exploration and new projects. When oil fell below $30, producers in North America sought to raise cash by selling more shares, pushing down stock prices.
The S&P 500 Energy Index (SPNY) is down about 32 percent since mid-2014, when oil prices topped $100 a barrel.
Wall Street finally put its foot down last year (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oil-record-strategy-analysis/u-s-shale-investors-still-waiting-on-payoff-from-oil-boom-idUSKCN1G70IE), with investors demanding a shift to dividends and share buybacks.  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) was punished for ignoring the demands and focusing on its expansion plans.
""I've seen companies going to Boston to get yelled at. That's how angry shareholders are,"" David Beard, lead energy analyst at research firm Coker and Palmer, said.
Reacting to market sentiments, Hess and Devon said they would either buy back $1 billion worth of shares, or add that much to existing programs. Anadarko added a further $500 million to its $2.5 billion-share buyback program, while Noble Energy authorized a repurchase of $750 million.
For Hess, the announcement was also a way to avoid a skirmish with activist hedge fund Elliott Management ahead of nominations for its board.
Elliott, which owns more than 6 percent of Hess, had criticized the company for ""continuing underperformance,"" but supported the buy back program earlier this month.
""We believe that repurchasing our shares represents a highly compelling return opportunity for our shareholders,"" said Hess Energy Chief Executive Officer John Hess.
U.S. shale producers have started believing they can drill more profitably as crude prices hold steady at around $60 a barrel. Propping up share prices also makes sense if they do want to raise more funds to invest over the next year. 
As long as oil holds to current prices (LCOc1) (CLc1), companies can afford to keep focusing on shareholder returns, analysts said.

""I think we're likely at the beginning of a theme ... there is a lot of room to improve in terms of equity,"" ICON Advisers' Rollingson said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to keep its crude oil production in April below 10 million barrels per day (bpd), and maintain exports under 7 million bpd, the energy ministry said on Wednesday, as the top OPEC producer wants to end a global supply glut and boost prices.
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, has been pumping below its OPEC target since January and reducing its crude shipments, particularly to the United States, as it turns its focus on cutting exports in an attempt to drain global oil stocks.
""Despite nominations coming in at 100,000 barrels a day, higher than the previous month, allocations were maintained on par with their March levels,"" the ministry said in a statement.
A spokesman for the energy ministry said that Saudi Arabia along with the OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers participating in a global supply cut agreement ""remain committed to pursuing the common objective of restoring inventories back to their normal levels.""
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia have agreed to maintain oil output cuts until the end of 2018 aiming to reduce global inventories and support prices.
OPEC has made the five-year average its main target and managed to reduce the glut to around 74 million barrels above that benchmark, from above 300 million when the cuts began in 2017.
OPEC has delivered more than 100 percent of the output cuts that members pledged under the deal, according to figures from OPEC and other analysts, helped in part by an involuntary drop in Venezuela, where output is falling amid an economic crisis.
""We are happy with the excellent overall conformity levels and look forward to all participating countries maintaining or exceeding full conformity with their commitments as agreed,"" the Saudi energy ministry spokesman said.
But the relentless rise in U.S. production has this year put pressure on oil prices. U.S. oil is also increasingly being exported, including to the world's biggest and fastest growing markets in Asia, eating away at OPEC and Russian market share. 
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were trading at around $64.93 per barrel on Wednesday, down from above $70 in January. [O/R]
U.S. crude oil production, pushed up largely by shale oil drilling, has risen by almost a quarter since mid-2016 and output soared past 10 million bpd in late 2017, overtaking production by Saudi Arabia.

OPEC meets next in June to decide its output policy. Global oil producers agreed they should continue cooperating after their agreement expires at the end of this year, Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih said in January.

Support came from China, where January-February domestic crude oil production dropped 1.9% on the year to 30.37 million tonnes, equivalent to 3.77 million barrels per day (bpd), according to data from the National Statistical Bureau. Meanwhile, crude oil throughput increased 7.3% to 93.4 million tonnes, pointing to a need for more imports.
China’s industrial output rose 7.2% in the first two months of the year compared with the same period last year, surpassing expectations of a 6.1% growth.
At the same time, during the spring season now starting, U.S. crude inventories are not rising as much as expected, implying healthy demand.
However, oil markets remain relatively weak. Prices have strayed far from their January highs of almost $67 for WTI and over $70 per barrel for Brent.
While the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has been propping up prices by cutting output, the U.S. has been capping prices by ramping up production.

China announced plans to create the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei northern super-region, also known as Jing-Jin-Ji, in 2014, as it sought to upgrade the heavy industrial economy of the smog-prone Hebei province while easing congestion, pollution and overdevelopment in the capital.
Firms would be encouraged to relocate from Beijing to Hebei and Tianjin by introducing unified regulations, social services and an integrated transport network. The government also established the new Xiongan economic zone in Hebei last year where some of Beijing's ""non-capital"" government functions and industries will be relocated.
But at this year's full session of parliament, delegates have called for the program to be accelerated, especially when it comes to transportation, with Hebei hoping for improved access to a new international airport under construction in Beijing. 
They also said not enough has been done to resolve the innovation gap between Hebei and the capital, which benefits from several high-tech industrial parks. 
But the plan has already helped reduce a chronic income gap that forced Hebei to rely on low-end polluting industries while its workers flooded into Beijing in search of better-paid jobs, said Dang Xiaolong, head of Hebei's economic planning body.
""The central government's vigorous promotion of integrated development in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei... has brought immeasurable development potential to our province,"" said Dang, who also chairs Hebei's special office to promote regional integration. 
""Because of gaps in development, industrial layout, innovation capability and the endowment of natural resources, the income gap between Beijing and Hebei has existed for a long time - this is a long-term, historical problem,"" he said in written comments. 
But integration efforts have already helped to raise average annual disposable income in Hebei to 21,484 yuan ($3,401.30) in 2017, up 41.4 percent since 2013, he said. Average income in Beijing, by comparison, stood at 57,230 yuan last year. 
""It should be said that through the positive implementation of this national strategy.. the three regions have entered into their best development period in history through aspects such as integrated transportation development, industrial coordination and environmental protection.""
Dang said the focus this year was on the creation of cross-regional transportation networks and the establishment of a unified pollution prevention system. 
Hebei will also work to improve communication and coordination with Beijing and Tianjin and sign more cross-regional strategic cooperation agreements, he added.

Politico, citing unnamed officials, said the tariffs were expected to be rolled out as soon as next week.
It said the Trump administration was considering tariffs on more than 100 Chinese products, as well as possible restrictions on Chinese visas or the tightening of controls on exports of goods or technologies with both military and civilian uses.
""We don’t comment on internal meetings, but no final decisions have been made on content or timing,"" a White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters when asked about the report.

That renewed investor fears that rising U.S. production would likely offset OPEC and Russia’s efforts to slash excess supplies which has narrowed the gap between crude supply and demand.
The downbeat session comes as crude prices retreated from session highs of $61.97 a barrel which followed president Donald Trump’s decision to replace Rex Tillerson with CIA director Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State. Pompeo reportedly shares similar views on the Iran nuclear deal to Trump.
“I wanted to either break it [the Iran nuclear deal] or do something and he felt a little bit differently, so we were not really thinking the same,” Trump told reporters following his decision to oust Tillerson.
RBC said Trump’s decision to remove Rex Tillerson will have important implications for Iran and Venezuela.
“For Iran, Pompeo has had a hawkish position on the nuclear deal. For Venezuela, it may set the stage for additional US measures to isolate Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro's government and potentially promote a leadership change there,” RBC said.
Also adding to negative sentiment on oil prices was a lower incentive to sell rather than store crude as current prices shifted from trading at a premium to forward prices to a discount – a shift from backwardation to contango - raising the prospect of a build of crude supplies."

Futures fell as much as 1.8 percent to a session low of $60.27 a barrel, after fluctuating in morning trading. The U.S. government expects major shale regions to boost output by 131,000 barrels a day in April, spurring fears that surging supplies will undermine OPEC’s efforts to clear a glut. Sentiment is being soured further by a forecast increase in U.S. inventories, a third consecutive weekly gain.
“The EIA report yesterday about the expected increase in shale output next month certainly weighed on things,” John Kilduff, founding partner at Again Capital, said in a phone interview.“And apparent discourse among OPEC producers, specifically the Iranians, is showing that the patience is running out with the accord, partly because of what the shale players are doing in terms of grabbing more market share.”
Oil has struggled to recover losses from last month’s broader market slump after topping $66 a barrel in January. While a brighter economic outlook has underpinned demand expectations, expanding American production remains a challenge to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, which are trying to prop up prices via output curbs.
West Texas Intermediate for April delivery traded at $60.46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, 90 cents lower, at 11:14 a.m.
Brent for May settlement was down 70 cents at $64.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a $3.80 premium to May WTI.
Production from shale regions will reach 6.95 million barrels a day next month, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its monthly drilling report. The Permian Basin is seen leading the way with an 80,000-barrel increase. Total American output has passed 10 million barrels a day, beating a record set in 1970.
U.S. crude inventories probably expanded by 1.9 million barrels in the week through March 9, according to a Bloomberg survey before EIA data on Wednesday. Meanwhile, stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI futures, probably held steady after 11 straight weeks of declines.

25,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 12:55PM ET</span>",Is OPEC moving the goalposts for its oil market scoreline?,"By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's proposals of new metrics to determine when the oil market is balanced signals a shift in OPEC's targets for a pact on supply cuts that has almost achieved the initial aim of reducing bloated inventories.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and nine other producers cut output from January 2017 by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) with the aim of reducing crude stocks in industrialized OECD nations to the five-year average.
From a record 3.1 billion barrels in July 2016, OECD stocks dropped to 2.851 billion barrels in December, falling 216 million barrels during 2017 and now stand just 52 million barrels above the five-year average, International Energy Agency (IEA) data show.
OPEC and its allies have been helped because the five-year average is a moving target and has risen even as output curbs were in place. The average climbed to 2.86 billion barrels in September 2017 from about 2.73 billion barrels when the supply pact was sealed in late 2016.
""After a period of surplus, the target becomes easier over time as more surplus years are included,"" said  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) head of commodities research Paul Horsnell.
But as the OECD inventory target has shifted so has thinking in Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter that worked with Russia to forge the global pact on cutting supplies.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih says OPEC and its partners should look at metrics such as non-OECD inventories, oil in floating storage and crude in transit as they consider the future of the pact that is due to expire at the end of 2018.
Those measures, however, are more difficult to monitor.
Non-OECD oil demand has outstripped OECD consumption since 2014. But inventories in non-OECD nations tend to be held as strategic not commercial assets, making them less transparent and less likely to shift with changes to demand or supply.
FORWARD DEMAND
Falih has said it would be better to ""overbalance"" the market, by which he means allowing OECD stocks to drop below the five-year average, rather than end the supply deal too early, another hint that the pact's expiry could be pushed back.
To assess whether supply and demand had achieved a sustainable balance, OPEC could measure the amount of oil in storage against days of demand it covers. This would show whether consumption was enough to avoid rebuilding inventories.
(Graphic: Global oil supply and demand fall into line - http://reut.rs/2Dm6vF7)
The amount of oil stored in OECD nations is now equivalent to 61 days of forward demand, the lowest since February 2015.
In the two years to mid-2014 when the oil price hit about $115, the number of days cover remained below 60. When OPEC and its partners sealed the supply deal in late November in the wake of an oil price plunge, there were nearly 64 days cover.
But measuring forward cover may still only offer limited help to OPEC in determining the right time to reopen oil taps, given output from the United States and other non-OPEC producers is climbing. This has capped oil prices around $65 a barrel now, after rising from below $30 at the start of 2016.
PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga said OPEC and its partners must ""constantly remind the market that the alliance formed at the end of 2016 is more than a marriage of convenience and no divorce is contemplated even after stability is achieved.""
The IEA says oil producers outside the supply pact raised output by about 700,000 bpd in the 12 months to January. If OPEC members Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from supply curbs, are included, the total rises to 1.4 million bpd. 
By comparison, world demand grew 1.6 million bpd in 2017.
OPEC forecasts global demand will grow by 1.59 million bpd in 2018, compared to the IEA prediction of 1.4 million bpd. OPEC also sees non-OPEC supply rising by 1.4 million bpd in 2019, compared to the IEA forecast of 1.7 million bpd.
""OPEC and Russia would probably be better off signaling a gradual approach or a 'tapering' of sorts,"" analysts at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said, adding they should signal output would only rise once the pact ends if oil prices held steady.

PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Renewable fuel credits for 2018 rebounded from an earlier drop on Tuesday, fluctuating after a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted a bankrupt Philadelphia refiner significant relief from its biofuel obligations.
Prices for renewable fuel (D6) credits for 2018 traded at 35 cents on Tuesday morning before rising to 39 cents, little changed from Monday, traders said. Prices were already around 40 percent lower than just two weeks ago as President Donald Trump called several White House meetings centered around reforms.
The EPA and the Carlyle Group-backed Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery agreed on Monday that the refiner will have to satisfy only roughly half of its $350 million in outstanding compliance obligations under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard. The RFS requires refiners to blend biofuels such as ethanol into their fuel or buy credits from those that do. 
The settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge and faces a public comment period, says PES does not have to go into the market and buy some 250 million compliance credits covering 2016, 2017 and portions of 2018. 
That has raised concerns among biofuels producers that other independent refiners may also seek relief.
The EPA will also require PES to buy credits semi-annually, rather than annually going forward. That makes it more difficult for the refinery, the largest on the U.S. East Coast, to build up a large short position or defer its obligations and risk getting into a hole, as it did in 2017.
PES, which lacks blending facilities, entered into bankruptcy owing 467 million credits from 2016 and 2017, with only 210 million credits in hand, the filing showed. 
The settlement alleviates fears that the refinery was going to be exempt from the program moving forward or be allowed to dump millions of credits onto the market, traders said.
""I can run my numbers now, and I know that PES will be buying credits moving forward. There was a lot of uncertainty,"" one credit trader said.
The EPA has signaled that it is willing to exempt a larger number of small refineries from the program, limiting the number of potential buyers and putting even more credits into the market.
The EPA said PES could comply with the program by turning over its available credits and would be excused from any shortfall, a huge win for the refiner. 
PES has blamed its financial woes on the cost of buying the credits.. But Reuters reported that other factors played a role in the bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the company by its investor owners.

Private equity firm Carlyle rescued the refinery from shutting in 2012, putting up $175 million for majority control. Most of the dividends paid to the investor group were backed by loans taken against the refinery's assets.

Comex gold futures were up 0.36% at $1,325.6 a troy ounce by 09:00 a.m. ET (13:00 GMT).
The dollar weakened after data showed that U.S. consumer prices slowed last month, confirming that an anticipated pickup in inflation will probably be only gradual.
The report came after data on Friday showing a slowdown in wage growth dampened concerns over inflationary pressures and dampened expectations for four rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.13% at 89.77.
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

29,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>","Shell, Eni preempt any U.S. probe over Nigeria with filings","By Libby George
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil giants Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Eni have voluntarily filed to U.S. authorities internal probes into how they acquired a giant field in Nigeria as the companies seek to fight corruption allegations in Europe and Africa.
    The filings, to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), do not mean U.S. authorities are investigating Shell or Eni.
    But the move shows the companies are trying to preempt questions from the United States as they face one of the oil industry's biggest-ever graft trials in Italy, to begin in May in Milan, a pending trial in Nigeria and an investigation in the Netherlands.
    The case revolves around the purchase of a huge block off oil-rich Nigeria, known as OPL 245, which holds an estimated 9 billion barrels in reserves. [http://reut.rs/2Fveiph] 
    Italian prosecutors allege that bribes were paid in an effort to secure rights to the block in 2011. A number of top executives from both companies – including Eni Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi and former Shell Foundation Chairman Malcolm Brinded – will face trial.
Under Italian law a company can be held responsible if it is deemed to have failed to prevent, or attempt to prevent, a crime by an employee that benefited the company.
Both companies' shares are traded on U.S. stock exchanges, putting their foreign dealings in the scope of U.S. authorities.
Shell and Eni, on behalf of subsidiaries, in 2010 entered deferred prosecution agreements with the DOJ over separate Nigerian corruption allegations. 
Those pacts dismissed charges after a certain period in exchange for fines and an agreement to fulfill a number of requirements. They concluded in 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
""A company's disclosure of alleged foreign corruption to both the SEC and the DOJ in the U.S. typically means the company believed U.S. authorities needed to be made aware of this, and both agencies have the authority to prosecute under the (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA),"" said Pablo Quiñones, executive director of the New York University School of Law program on corporate compliance and enforcement.
Quiñones previously worked as chief of strategy, policy and training at the DOJ's criminal fraud section, a role that included helping to develop FCPA enforcement policy.
The SEC and the DOJ declined to comment on the company disclosures or whether they were looking into any allegations surrounding the block. 
Eni noted its disclosure in an SEC filing, in which it said ""no evidence of wrongdoing on Eni side were detected"". Shell has said publicly that it submitted the investigation to U.S. authorities and to Britain's Serious Fraud Office. 
Shell and Eni deny any wrongdoing. They say their payments for the block, a total of $1.3 billion, were transparent, legal and went directly into an escrow account controlled by the Nigerian government. 
The companies and legal experts say the trial will last more than a year, with potential appeals stretching several years beyond that. 
""The risk for companies is of a prolonged period of exposure to open court allegations from a state prosecutor of impropriety,"" Anthony Goldman of Nigeria-focused PM Consulting said. ""That will be painful and damaging.""
The Milan prosecutor charges that roughly $1 billion of the payments were funneled to a Nigerian company called Malabu Oil and Gas, which had a disputed claim on the block, and former oil minister Dan Etete, who British and U.S. courts have said controlled Malabu. Reuters has been unable to reach Etete or Malabu for comment.
Shell has since said it knew some of the money would go to Malabu to settle its claim, though its own due diligence could not confirm who controlled the company. Eni said it never dealt with Etete or knew he controlled the company, but that the government promised to settle all other claims on the block as part of their deal. (http://reut.rs/2Fr6G3y)
""If the evidence ultimately proves that improper payments were made by Malabu or others to then current government officials in exchange for improper conduct relating to the 2011 settlement of the long standing legal disputes, it is Shell's position that none of those payments were made with its knowledge, authorisation or on its behalf,"" Shell said in a statement. 
CONTROL AT RISK 
The proceedings have also brought together investigators in several countries, with authorities in Nigeria and the Netherlands sending information to Milan. 
A Dutch anti-fraud team in 2016 raided Shell offices as part of the investigation, and a Dutch law firm has asked prosecutors to consider launching a criminal case in the Netherlands.
""I'm not aware of many cases where this many jurisdictions have been at work for so long helping each other out. The amount of cooperation is very unusual,"" said Aaron Sayne of the Natural Resource Governance Institute, a non-profit group that advises countries on how to manage oil, gas and mineral resources. 
A case by Nigeria's financial watchdog, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, against defendants including the former attorney general, ex-ministers of justice and oil and various senior managers, current and former, from Shell and Eni, will continue in June. 
There has also been at least one effort to take away the asset. Experts say it is worth billions, and Shell has spent millions developing it. Eni intends to make a final investment decision this year on developing the block and said in corporate filings that the asset has a book value of 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion). 
The Italian court does not have the ability to rescind rights to the block, and Nigerian oil minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu has said the companies should continue to develop it.
But in a lawsuit filed by the Nigerian government against JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in London for the U.S. bank's role in transferring money from the deal, it called the agreement that facilitated Shell and Eni's purchase ""unlawful and void"". (http://reut.rs/2FxBFOR)
A JPMorgan spokeswoman previously said the firm ""considers the allegations made in the claim to be unsubstantiated and without merit"".
Additionally, a Nigerian court last year briefly ordered the seizure of the block. 
That decision was later overturned, and Shell and Eni say they are not worried about losing the asset. But the ruling and the language in the government's suit against JPMorgan underscore the risk. [http://reut.rs/2D88rRe]
""It's a nice, stable asset that could produce a lot of oil for a long time,"" Sayne said.

30,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 06:02AM ET</span>","Havens Just Aren't Safe Any More as Markets Rumble, Goldman Says","(Bloomberg) -- Traditional safe havens haven’t been working out for investors in the latest ructions in financial markets, strategists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Inc. warned.
With the rise of inflation and interest rates, and the end of an era of low volatility, investors looking for effective hedges have to look beyond traditional havens such as bonds, the yen and gold, the Goldman analysis indicates. The problem is a lack of assets with ""positive beta"" to the VIX index of stock volatility -- in other words, assets that rise in value along with an increase in swings, such as when the S&P 500 Index tumbles.
“No safe havens -- and no assets or equity sectors -- have had a positive beta to the VIX recently, and few have had a positive beta to 10-year yields, leading to diversification desperation,” Goldman strategists including Ian Wright wrote in a March 12 note.
While bonds have typically offered a cushion for stock investors in time, the strategy may not work well as central banks roll back quantitative easing and raise rates -- especially when the U.S. government is going on a borrowing spree. One potential hedge for higher yields could be cyclical stocks, though -- Goldman found that consumer discretionary companies, for example, had a positive beta to 10-year Treasury yields.
The yen, a reliable refuge in times of turmoil thanks to Japan’s massive net-creditor position, could be less dependable thanks to the Bank of Japan’s determination to keep going with monetary stimulus.
And gold proved a loser during the late-January to early-February sell-off in U.S. stocks that spread round the world.
""Finding effective hedges in the cash space will continue to be difficult going forward as rates rise"" and the Goldilocks scenario of non-inflationary growth fades, the Goldman strategists wrote. ""Active risk management via derivative overlay trades will become more important for portfolios.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A farm lobbying group is spending $500,000 to air television ads on channels near U.S. President Donald Trump's home in Florida to encourage free trade, with the group worried recent metal tariffs could result in retaliation against U.S. agricultural goods.
Farmers for Free Trade, a bipartisan group, on Tuesday said it would run ads on programs the president is known to watch - including ""Fox and Friends"" and MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" The ads will first run in Washington, D.C. and then in southern Florida where Trump's Mar-a-Lago home is located. The ads will start this week and run for four weeks, including late March through early April when Congress is out of session and the president is more likely to visit Mar-a-Largo. 
""Farmers are increasingly worried about what they are seeing from Washington D.C. on trade,"" said Democratic former U.S. Senator Max Baucus of Montana, a co-founder of the Farmers for Free Trade coalition. “When the U.S. engages in a tit-for-tat fight with our trading partners, farmers pay the price.""
Trump last week signed import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. Critics of the move, including members of his own Republican Party worry it could result in retaliatory measures.
Chinese officials have said U.S. soybeans are a prime target for retaliation against the tariffs, according to the American Soybean Association.
Farm groups hold sway with Republicans and overlap heavily with Trump's political base. They are also pushing for the president not to exit the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The United States exported $138 billion in agriculture commodities in 2017 - which resulted in a surplus for agriculture goods, according to the U.S. Census. 
The ad depicts farmers making a direct appeal to Trump. 
""The crops that we grow here on this farm are exported across the globe. Policies that restrict trade would be devastating for farms like ours,"" Montana farmer Michelle Erickson-Jones says in the 30-second ad. ""Someday I’d like to pass the farm down to my boys. Mr. President, protect free trade and keep our agriculture economy strong.""
While Trump has already signed off on the tariffs, they could still be subject to changes and some countries could be exempted.

When Trump was on the brink of exiting NAFTA, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue was credited with convincing Trump to remain in the pact by showing him maps of agriculture-heavy areas overlapped with maps of his election results.

LONDON (Reuters) - When temperatures rise and winds drop in the coming weeks, a band of explorers will hunt for copper riches in Mongolia's Gobi Desert.
For years  Rio Tinto  has been the sole international copper mine operator in Mongolia, bound closely to a country where it has bet billions of dollars on the giant Oyu Tolgoi project. Others have steered clear due to the risks of operating in a nation with an unpredictable and young democracy and judiciary, a frail economy and extreme weather. 
Now rising global demand for a metal used in electric cars and renewable energy, at a time of increased costs and depleted deposits in the world's biggest copper producer Chile, is driving miners to riskier locations. 
Some are looking to Mongolia.
Geologists say deposits like Oyu Tolgoi - meaning Turquoise Hill because of the staining of the rocks by oxidized copper - rarely occur in isolation. That means, for some miners, the chances of finding another make the east Asian nation worth a calculated gamble, especially given its proximity to the world's biggest copper consumer, China. 
The new charge is led by a group of about half a dozen smaller players, including Australia's Xanadu Mines (AX:XAM), Canada's  Kincora Copper  (V:KCC) and U.S. company Wood Capital Partners, which have higher risk appetites and are seeking to steal a march on competitors. 
Wood Capital Partners, set up by two former  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) bankers and specialized in acquiring distressed assets, told Reuters it had invested ""several million dollars"" in exploration territory in the Southern Gobi. 
Co-CEO and Managing Partner Stephen Dizard said the firm bought the concession - which is 364 square km, or about six times the size of Manhattan - from a frontier markets fund which was in liquidation.
He wanted to get into Mongolia ahead of a rush driven by the global hunt for new copper. He said miners would become increasingly confident in buying assets in the country because the economy was slowly improving, aided by an International Monetary Fund bailout.
""It (Mongolia) was distressed financially and distressed across the sector,"" Dizard added. ""We took the view, the situation had to improve. It has.""
Beginning in March and April, he said the company's drilling budget would be ""a minimum of a seven-figure number"". 
Sam Spring, CEO of Kincora, said it raised about $4.5 million last year to fund its Mongolian exploration. The company, which has licenses for more than 1,400 square km of land, drilled 6,000 meters last year and results were promising, and that it would step up activity in late March or early April. 
""We've started to see a change of investor sentiment. There is increasing infrastructure and hopefully we are seeing tailwinds rather than headwinds,"" added Spring, who describes Mongolia as one of the last frontiers for top-quality copper assets.
Andrew Stewart, CEO of Xanadu, thinks he will be able to gather enough information over the coming months to determine whether he can justify establishing a mine in the country.
He is planning drilling using four rigs compared with two last year. ""Mongolia is very good because it has the prospectivity,"" he said. 
DESERT LABYRINTH 
The dream is another discovery on the scale of Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi - a chain of deposits in the southern Gobi, about 550 km south of the capital Ulaanbaatar and 80 km north of the border with China.
But even Rio Tinto (L:RIO) (AX:RIO), which is relying on Mongolia to drive growth after committing about $12 billion to the project, only resumed exploration there last year after a five-year hiatus during the copper market downturn. 
The Anglo-Australian miner says it has still to make any return on its investment, but in January it announced an exploration office in Ulaanbaatar, its first formal office in the capital. 
This was a symbolic move intended to underline to the government its commitment to the country, according to industry sources. Rio Tinto says the office will employ 80 staff and cover technology as well as exploration.
To make up for dwindling output at the open pit mine Rio Tinto is building a labyrinth of underground tunnels that will increase annual output to 560,000 tonnes, about three times current production from the open pit. Ramping up the underground operations will begin around the start of the next decade.
As well as the market downturn, Rio Tinto has had to contend with wrangles with the Mongolian government over taxes and power supply. The mine is jointly owned by the government, with 34 percent, and  Turquoise Hill Resources  (TO:TRQ) with 66 percent. Turquoise Hill is in turn 51 percent-owned by Rio Tinto.
Rio Tinto CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said problems were inevitable but his company was there for the long haul.
""My personal experience over the last five years is, that you know, lots of issues as you would expect, but each time we have been able to work through them,"" he said last month. 
""I'm not saying it's going to be easy."" 
-40C TO 40C
Miners and political analysts say that, while the economy in Mongolia is gradually improving, the legal system is opaque and frequent changes in government since the country became a democracy three decades ago have created policy uncertainty, making investors wary.
The Mongolian mining ministry did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Miners must also deal with temperatures that can swing from -40C to 40C, and ferocious winds that can last for days. As a result, they tend to limit drilling programs in the Gobi to between late March and November.
By contrast, drilling can take place all year round in Chile and other Latin American countries. 
Such considerations have deterred most miners for many years. BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie, for example, told Reuters his preference was for safe jurisdictions, namely the Americas. He described Mongolia as ""potentially very prospective but not without security and geopolitical challenges"".
But copper market conditions are slowly driving change.
Rio Tinto's renewed activity and the exploration of rivals comes as demand increases for a metal needed in large quantities for the electric-vehicle and renewable energy industries.
Copper prices  have rebounded to nearly $7,000 a tonne from lows around $4,300 a tonne hit in early 2016, which was their weakest since 2009.
At the same time, Chile's long-exploited ore bodies are ageing and challenged by arsenic concentrations and proximity to large populations. Mine workers there have also been demanding higher wages, adding to costs. 
Such is the draw of Mongolia - which has the same type of ""porphyry"" rock formations - that even Chile's giant state copper company Codelco has said it is considering investing in the Asian nation.
An advantage of the porphyry formations is that the copper is often accompanied by gold, which can effectively subsidies the copper production. 
""Mongolia represents a very prospective region for copper deposits of the porphyry type,"" said Jamie Wilkinson, research leader in mineral deposits at London's Natural History Museum.
""Oyu Tolgoi was found in 2001. There have been some small discoveries since then but nothing on the same scale. There is lots of potential for future discoveries."" 
'NOT FOR FAINT-HEARTED'
However, while there may be geological potential, there is no guarantee of unearthing commercial volumes of copper, and luck is always a significant factor. 
The interest from overseas explorers, if sustained, could nonetheless prove crucial for Mongolia itself, which is heavily dependent on commodities and had to turn to the IMF last year following a collapse in foreign investment. 
About 30 percent of its 3 million people live in poverty, according to 2016 figures from the World Bank and Mongolia's national statistical office.
Moody's raised the country's sovereign debt rating by a notch in January, following the IMF bailout deal, but it is still deep in junk territory. 
The deal has helped the country pay off its sovereign debt and stabilized the local currency, the tugrik, but required Ulaanbaatar to introduce measures such as higher taxes and cuts to social welfare. 
Iain Watt, CEO of mining business IGI's UK operations, said it too was exploring possibilities in Mongolia, as well as central Asia, and that there was clear potential for investors. 

""Mongolia is definitely on the up - but it's not for the faint-hearted.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Oil majors are evaluating bids for offshore exploration rights in Argentina, a major change in a country that sent Spanish energy giant Repsol (MC:REP) packing six years ago and has seen little offshore exploration for decades.
To secure bids, Argentina will need to show it has moved beyond its historical fluctuations between free-market policies and left-wing populism and that it has made progress in lowering costs for energy firms.
Oil companies including Shell and  Statoil  told Reuters they are looking at bidding in the auctions, to be held later this year, and a government official said Exxon and  Chevron  have also shown interest.
The country faces fierce competition to attract the billions of dollars of investment needed to develop deepwater reserves. Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico and neighboring Uruguay will all auction offshore blocks in 2018 after undertaking oil market reforms or revising contract terms to facilitate the entry of the world's top energy companies.
For Big Oil, the potential access to Latin American energy reserves is unprecedented. In many countries now opening, including Argentina, resource nationalism has long barred their entry or limited opportunities.
Six years ago, former populist President Cristina Fernandez expropriated Repsol's (MC:REP) stake in Argentina's state-owned oil company YPF SA (BA:YPFD). The move sent chills through both the energy industry and the entire private sector.
Interviews with oil industry executives, consultants, geologists and officials point to optimism for Argentina's upcoming auctions and for President Mauricio Macri's government, which has sought private sector and U.S. government help in structuring the process.
""Growing confidence in the current government's policies - their focus on trying to create an environment that is attractive for investments - has been the big change,"" Shell's (L:RDSa) head of deepwater Wael Sawan told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry gathering in Houston. ""It's that focus that has created more interest by the sector to say 'why not, let's look at this.'""
The auction will be a test of company confidence in the longevity of Macri's reform agenda because it can take a decade between an initial investment in offshore exploration and the first production.
Argentina will take bids for three offshore basins from July through November. Exploration rights for blocks in the 130,000-square km Argentina Basin, 90,000-square km Malvinas West Basin and 5,000 square kilometers in the Austral Basin are on offer.
While little exploration has been done outside the Austral basin, YPF has identified 22 million barrels of oil equivalent for further investigation, upstream head Pablo Bizotto said at an event last Wednesday.
""There is a lot of interest from large companies - Chevron,  Exxon Mobil , Shell,"" Daniel Redondo, the secretary for strategic energy planning in Argentina's Energy Ministry, told Reuters on the sidelines of a recent event. 
Consultancy Bain & Company, on a contract with the government to gauge interest, last year interviewed more than 60 companies, including ""all the majors"" and independent explorers including Anadarko (N:APC) and Hunt Oil, said Diego Garcia, a Buenos Aires-based Bain partner. Colombia's Ecopetrol may bid in the auctions, its chief executive told Reuters.
Norway's Statoil (OL:STL), which already has onshore drilling projects in Argentina, is partnering with YPF on offshore seismic studies and is ""considering future licensing rounds,"" a spokesman said.
""Huge areas of the Argentinian continental shelf will be available for bids from companies,"" executive vice president for exploration Tim Dodson said at an event in Buenos Aires last Wednesday. ""We have of course started our evaluations already."" 
Chevron (N:CVX) and Exxon (N:XOM) declined to comment. Anadarko and Hunt did not respond to requests for comment. Firms likely won't decide whether to bid until the full terms of the auction are published.
OPENING TO INDUSTRY
Macri's government has enacted pro-market reforms across the economy. His 'Let's Change' coalition swept to victory in midterm elections last October, taking advantage of divisions within the opposition Peronist movement, which is generally defined by strong defense of labor rights and national sovereignty.
Macri is on course to become the first non-Peronist president to finish his term since Argentina's return to democracy in 1983. He's expected to stand for re-election starting in late 2019.
The decision to hold offshore auctions comes as Argentina struggles to attract investment to its Vaca Muerta shale play, which is in a remote part of Argentina that lacks infrastructure to get oil and gas to consumers.
Argentina is home to the world's No. 2 resources of shale gas and the fourth largest of shale oil, estimates the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Yet oil production peaked in 1998 and gas output topped out in 2004, according to Energy Ministry data. Investment in exploration has dried up since the country's 2001 financial crisis and the populist political response.
Under the terms of a 2014 revision to Argentina's hydrocarbons law, which was well-received by industry, royalties paid to the national government will be 12 percent of the value of hydrocarbons extracted and companies would receive exploration rights for three years, with an option to extend for three years.
Rights for each exploration block would be awarded to the company that pledges the most investment, as laid out in the law, Garcia said.
""Companies will be interested in studying something that has not been explored,"" said Daniel Gerold of G&G Energy Consultants in Buenos Aires, who said the regional competition was unlikely to be an obstacle for Argentina. ""I do not think the big players will have used up all their exploration capital in Mexico."" 
'SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE LONG AGO'
The majors would likely be most interested in the large Argentina Basin, the least explored of the three on offer, Bain's Garcia said.
By contrast, the Austral Basin just off the coast of Tierra del Fuego would be more of a gas play to serve the domestic market and could appeal to local players and Total, which already operates in the area, he said.
The Malvinas West basin could be most appealing to exploration-focused independent oil firms, he said.
Perth, Australia-based Searcher Seismic began analyzing existing data on Argentina's offshore formations in November 2016, smelling opportunity in an economic and political opening, and launched a full database for exploration companies in early February.

""This should have been done a long time ago in Argentina,"" Searcher director Odd Larsen said. ""But the politics and the finances unfortunately held Argentina back for a very long time.""

Gold futures for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange slipped $1.2, or 0.08%, to $1,319.60 a troy ounce by 12:15am ET.
The U.S. dollar index that tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies gained 0.12% at 90.01 in afternoon trade after dropping below the 90 mark earlier in the day as concerns over a potential trade war caused by new U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum faded.
US inflation expectations grew higher last month, as a survey by Federal Reserve Bank of New York revealed an inflation measure hit its highest level in a year, adding to signs of price pressures.
Meanwhile, Asian equities were mostly lower on Tuesday. Nikkei was the exception as it outperformed its peers and jumped 2.2% higher. Japan’s cronyism scandal involving prime minister Shinzo Abe and finance minister Taro Aso continued to receive attention as Aso was reportedly considering to skip a G20 meeting in Buenos Aires next week.

Crude Oil WTI Futures for April delivery were trading at $61.20 a barrel in Asia at 10:15pm ET, down 0.26%. Brent Oil Futures for May delivery, traded in London, were down 0.23% at $64.80 per barrel.
Speculators cut bets on oil, suggesting more selling could be seen. This has reduced some of the enthusiasm for oil, with investors weighing increased U.S. supply against the likelihood that OPEC will maintain production cuts that have been in effect for more than a year. Investors’ bullish wagers on U.S. crude oil fell last week for the first time in three weeks.
OPEC has been reducing output by around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) since January 2017. However, the U.S. has simply filled the supply gap created by OPEC producers by ramping up production. This has posed a challenge for OPEC in propping up prices.
On Sunday, Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said OPEC could agree in June to begin easing current production curbs in 2019.
Output from the U.S. has already risen by 23 percent since mid-2016 to 10.37 million bpd. It has already surpassed top exporter Saudi Arabia, and by 2019 is expected to surpass top producer Russia, which pumps out nearly 11 million bpd.
The increase in rig count in the U.S. also points to more output to come in the future. The U.S. now has close to 800 active rigs, compared to just 616 a year ago.
Oil markets continued to flip back and forth over the past weeks due to excless supply, increasing U.S. production and soaring global demand.
Demand from Asia, particularly China, will continue to support prices.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Wednesday in choppy trade, as a bigger-than-expected U.S. crude stock build pressured prices, but large draws of fuel stocks provided some support.
U.S. crude stocks rose by 5 million barrels, the biggest jump since late January, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. Expectations had been for a 2 million barrel build. The effect was offset somewhat by a larger-than-expected draw on fuel stocks.(For a graphic on Russia vs Saudi vs U.S. oil production click http://reut.rs/2FrFVMF)
""I don't think we have a clear set of directions, and I don't think this (EIA) report gives that much of an insight as to whether the rebalance continues or not. We continue to just chop around here,"" said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy.
Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) were down 18 cents to $64.46 per barrel by 12:45 p.m. EST (1645 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures (CLc1) were down 9 cents at $60.62 per barrel.
""We’re not pressuring the downside that much. Of course, the reason is because we had some unexpectedly large draws in distillates and gasoline that, when added together, are two times bigger than the crude build,"" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho. 
OPEC said in its monthly report that supply from non-members is likely to grow by 1.66 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, almost double the growth it predicted in November, largely due to rising U.S. supply.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also said oil inventories across the most industrialized countries rose in January for the first time in eight months, a sign the impact of its output cuts may be waning. OPEC trimmed its 2018 demand forecast for its own crude by 250,000 bpd to 32.61 million bpd, the fourth consecutive decline.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) strategist Carsten Fritsch said that ""according to the OPEC report, demand for OPEC's oil must be 33 million barrels per day for the rest of the year to get rid of any remaining oversupply.""
Oil prices got a boost early in the session from a broader investor push into commodities after Chinese data showed industrial production in the world's largest importer of raw materials grew more than expected over the first two months of the year.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for April delivery fell $0.68 cents to settle at $61.36 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent fell 0.78% to trade at $64.98 a barrel.
Ahead of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast on oil production from seven major shale regions for the month of April slated for later Monday, investors grew nervous that the recent uptick crude prices above $60 has encouraged U.S. shale producers to ramp up output.
The ongoing uptick in U.S. shale output is widely expected to dampen OPEC and its allies’ efforts to bring global crude supplies down to the five-year average.
That offset recent positive data on oil output after baker Hughes reported the number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell by four to 796, according.
The negative turn in sentiment on oil prices was characterised by data Friday showing traders slashed their bullish bets on oil for the first time in two weeks following the EIA's report Wednesday that U.S. output jumped to a record high per day of nearly 10.4 million barrels.
Traders reduced their WTI net-long position – the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a drop – for the first time in two weeks in the period ended March 9, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data."

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian employers and labor unions embarked on four weeks' of wage talks on Monday to stave off widespread strikes that risk impacting output in western Europe's biggest crude producer.
Unlike most years, in which wages are set on an industry-by-industry basis to reduce complexity, the 2018 round rolls a majority of private sector firms into a single negotiation in a bid to resolve a stand-off over pension reform.
""We've understood that there is no real will among employers to compromise from the outset,"" labor union negotiator Asle Reime, who will represent oil workers, told Reuters ahead of the talks.
""Pension rights are important to all workers regardless of which industry they are in, that's why I think there is more weight behind the demands this year and also more willingness to strike,"" he added.
While employers are willing to discuss an increase in inflation-adjusted pay, it will be more difficult to meet demands for better pensions and change in travel-related compensation, Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (NHO) Chief Executive Kristin Skogen Lund told reporters.
If initial talks break down, a state-appointed mediator will attempt to broker a deal in the final days leading up to an April 7 deadline, after which most workers are allowed to go on strike unless an agreement is found.
A few days in advance, Labour unions must name the companies that would be hit in a first wave of industrial action, making it difficult to predict how extensive an initial walk-out could be.
While Norway's production of oil and natural gas is unlikely to be targeted from the start since the contract for rig workers' is valid until June, unions may still hit the sector by shutting down yards and other suppliers.
Onshore processing and export facilities for natural gas are also at risk of strike, unions said, while offshore oil production workers could become involved in any extended strike.
Western Europe's largest producer of oil and gas pumps about two million barrels of crude, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGL) per day, while its output of natural gas stands at around 320 million cubic meters per day.
Norway's last major strike by oil workers took place in 2012 and lasted for 16 days before the government intervened to force an end to the conflict, citing vital national interests.
Top companies that could be affected by the talks include consumer goods maker Orkla (OL:ORK), fertilizer maker Yara (OL:YAR), metals producer Hydro (OL:NHY) and oil services companies Aker Solutions (OL:AKSOL) and Kvaerner (OL:KVAER).

Also at risk are major oil firms including  Statoil  (OL:STL), Aker BP (OL:AKERBP),  Lundin Petroleum  (ST:LUPE) and Shell (L:RDSa).

Front-month U.S. natural gas futures tacked on 3.0 cents, or around 1.1%, to $2.763 per million British thermal units (btu) by 7:45AM ET (1145GMT).
The commodity notched a gain of around 1.4% last week, its third such advance in a row, as weather forecasting models pointed to colder weather over the eastern U.S. through mid-March.
Despite recent gains, market experts warned that futures are likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term as the coldest part of the winter has effectively passed.
Spring usually sees the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 92 and 104 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended March 9.
That compares with a decline of 57 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 53 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 97 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 1.625 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

While the producer group complied with a pledge to curb output and ease a glut in 2017, U.S. flows that are gaining a bigger slice of the prized Asian market may prompt some nations to boost supplies, said Warren Patterson, a commodities strategist at the Dutch bank. The resulting fallout could drag down crude prices after a rally of more than 40 percent since June, he said.
“The longer the deal goes on, it’s going to start falling apart,” Patterson said in an interview in Singapore, referring to an output-cut agreement between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia. “They continue to give market share away to the U.S.”
Brent crude, the benchmark for more than half the world’s oil, traded at $65.45 a barrel at 7 a.m. in London on Monday, compared with about $45 in June. ING forecasts Brent at $57 in the second half of 2018. Prices were at more than $115 in mid-2014, before a global glut sparked the biggest crash in a generation. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. marker, is currently near $62 a barrel.
Crude's rebound since last year is encouraging American drillers to pump even as they make efforts to be disciplined on spending, Patterson said. “We need to see prices in the short-term trade below $60 to reduce that incentive for U.S. producers,” he said.
As American output continues to expand, more exports will sail to Asia, the traditional bastion of Middle East producers. In February, even Saudi Arabia’s state oil company considered participating in these flows via a U.S. unit, before determining it wasn’t economically viable at the time.
Bullish Calls
ING’s outlook is in contrast to bullish views from Royal Bank of Canada and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). to BMI Research and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA, which see prices supported as strong demand soaks up supply from the U.S. While Patterson does see healthy oil consumption, he said growth may slow and fail to completely absorb gaining American output.
While the U.S. is now pumping more than 10 million barrels a day, surpassing a record set in 1970, that boom is being accompanied by a surge in overseas shipments, helping drain stockpiles at the nation’s largest storage hub. Exports have averaged about 1.5 million barrels over the past six months, almost double the level in the previous six months, Energy Information Administration data show. Asia is the biggest buyer of the supplies.
Click here for a story on how exports are making U.S. oil costly versus rival crude
OPEC should beware as U.S. shale producers are set to steal a bigger slice of the market in Asia, which consumes more oil than any other region, according to industry consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. Crude shipped overseas from the U.S. will soar to almost 4 million barrels a day by the mid-2020s, rivaling shipments from Iraq and Canada, it said last week.
Asia is “a market that the Middle East does not really want to give up,” ING’s Patterson said. “We think compliance is likely to slip. The deal will still officially be in place, but once we get into 2019 there’s no chance that we will see some sort of deal.”

Despite the lower rig count, which is an early indicator of future output, activity remains much higher than a year ago.

52,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 11, 2018 07:16AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices - Weekly Outlook: March 12 - 16,"Investing.com - Oil prices rallied sharply on Friday, scoring a weekly gain, as traders cheered data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs fell for the first time in seven weeks, pointing to a potential slowdown in domestic oil output.
Improved appetite for risk-sensitive assets in the wake of strong U.S. jobs data and news of a potential U.S.-North Korea meeting also contributed to oil’s price rise.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for April delivery surged $1.92, or 3.2%, to close at $62.04 a barrel.
The U.S. benchmark slipped to a three-week low of $59.95 on Thursday, as investors worried over soaring U.S. output levels.
Meanwhile, May Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., jumped $1.88, or roughly 3%, to settle at $65.49 a barrel.
For the week, WTI crude rose 1.3%, while Brent gained 1.7%.
The number of oil drilling rigs fell by four to 796 last week,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.
That marked the first such decline in seven weeks, suggesting the possibility of a fall in future output.
That came after data on Wednesday showed U.S. oil production, driven by shale extraction, rose to an all-time high of 10.37 million barrels per day (bpd), staying above Saudi Arabia's output levels and within reach of Russia, the world's biggest crude producer.
Analysts and traders have recently warned that booming U.S. shale oil production could potentially derail OPEC's effort to end a supply glut.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, have been restraining production by 1.8 million bpd to curb the market of excess supply. The arrangement, which was adopted last winter, expires at the end of 2018.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer and how fast output levels will continue to rise.
Oil traders will also focus on monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency to assess global oil supply and demand levels.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.
Monday
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is to issue a monthly update on shale-oil production levels
Tuesday
The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, is to publish its weekly report on U.S. oil supplies.
Wednesday
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties will publish its monthly assessment of oil markets.
Later on, the U.S. EIA is to release weekly data on oil and gasoline stockpiles.
Thursday
The International Energy Agency will release its monthly report on global oil supply and demand.
The U.S. government will publish a weekly report on natural gas supplies in storage.
Friday
Baker Hughes will release weekly data on the U.S. oil rig count.

53,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 10:42PM ET</span>",Five cabinet chiefs to testify before U.S. Senate on infrastructure,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will send five cabinet secretaries to a U.S. Senate hearing next week to tout its plan to spur $1.5 trillion infrastructure improvements using $200 billion in new federal funding.
The heads of the Transportation, Commerce, Labor, Agriculture and Energy departments will testify on March 14 before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee. Democrats have criticized the plan, saying Republicans must agree to new revenue to fund projects, and that the plan shifts too much of the burden to states and cities.
""Testimony from these five cabinet secretaries will support a comprehensive public discussion with senators about the White House proposal for aligning federal resources with local infrastructure needs and helping complete projects faster,” said Senator John Thune, who chairs the Commerce Committee.
Senate Democrats this week proposed $1 trillion in new federal spending paid for by repealing some tax cuts approved in December. President Donald Trump's proposal would fund the $200 billion federal contribution to infrastructure with cuts from other federal spending. It would also shift more costs to states and cities by reducing federal matching funds.
A separate Senate hearing is planned Tuesday to address state and local transportation infrastructure, including rail issues. Another Senate hearing Tuesday will address broadband infrastructure issues.
Trump's infrastructure plan unveiled in February would also eliminate bureaucratic roadblocks to completing projects that can tie up new roads for years.
Democrats insist that any plan must include new revenue, which could mean raising the federal gasoline tax. That levy has been 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993, and inflation and rising vehicle fuel efficiency have reduced its usefulness in raising enough money to keep pace with repair needs.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that Congress is likely to pass a series of five or six smaller infrastructure measures this year, rather than one big bill. Ryan ruled out a gasoline tax Wednesday, while Trump reportedly backed a 25-cent per gallon hike last month in a meeting with lawmakers.
Congress transferred $140 billion to the Highway Trust Fund since 2008. Lawmakers, to maintain current spending levels, would need to approve an additional $107 billion from 2021 through 2026.

The Trump administration also unveiled workforce training proposals, including expanding apprenticeships and seeking changes to federal work-study programs that typically are used by students at four-year institutions. It would allow more students interested in skilled trades to use them.

54,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 02:31PM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices Settle Higher as US Oil Rigs Fall For First Time in 7 Weeks,"Investing.com – WTI crude oil prices notched a weekly gain after settling more than 3% higher on Friday as traders cheered data showing the number of U.S. oil rigs fell for the first time in seven weeks, pointing to a potential slowdown in U.S. oil output.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for April delivery rose $1.92 to settle at $62.04 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent rose 2.97% to trade at $65.50 a barrel.
The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell by four to 796, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes.
That helped ease investor concerns somewhat that rising U.S. production - largely driven by shale - would continue unabated after data this week showed that U.S. output rose to a record high.
The Energy Information Agency reported Wednesday that U.S. output jumped to a record high per day of nearly 10.4 million barrels last week.
Also adding support to oil prices was data showing the labor market added 313,000 jobs last month, pointing to underlying strength in U.S. economy, raising hopes for an increase in oil consumption.
""Economic optimism and oil consumption go hand-in-hand, therefore, any adverse impact on the health of the global economy will dampen oil demand growth prospects,"" said Stephen Brennock.
The weekly gain for oil prices this week was far from straightforward after slipping on both Wednesday and Thursday as traders feared that with crude prices above $60 a barrel, U.S. shale producers would continue to ramp up output.
“The United States is set to put its stamp on global oil markets for the next five years,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, in a statement. He added that the IEA could revive its estimate for US output upward should oil prices remain above $60."

Gold futures for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $1.80, or 0.14%, to $1,323.70 a troy ounce. Gold prices rebounded after falling to a session low of $1,313.40.
The White House confirmed Friday that President Donald Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
""Trump will accept the invitation to meet with Kim Jong Un at a place and time to be determined,"" said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.
Some questioned of sincerity of Kim Jong Un conciliatory gesture as it was only a few months ago that the two nations exchanged a flurry of verbal threats.
Offsetting easing geopolitical tensions, however, was dollar weakness after U.S. labor market showed the economy created more jobs than anticipated but wage growth remained subdued.
Dollar-denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar – A fall in the dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency and thus, increases demand for the precious metal.
Timid wage growth in the face of tightening labor markets has been a constant conundrum to the Federal Reserve but this is unlikely to alter the expected pace of interest rate hikes.
“February’s data confirmed our suspicion that last month's strong wage figure was largely an illusion,” CIBC said. “The wage numbers should allay fears of a quick pick up in inflation, and as such we still see the Fed hiking interest rates three times this year.”
In other precious metal trade, silver futures rose 0.64% to $16.60 a troy ounce, while platinum futures gained 1.21% to $963.80 an ounce.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Two influential U.S. senators pushed President Donald Trump on Friday to be more nuanced in his approach to trade in the wake of his controversial decision to impose tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports.
Republicans John Cornyn of Texas and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska made their remarks at an energy industry gathering in Houston, a day after Trump imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent for aluminum, but exempted Canada and Mexico. The president offered the possibility of excluding other allies in the future.
More politicians from both major U.S. political parties, as well as executives across industry sectors, have expressed concern that the tariffs could spark a global trade conflict and ravage the recovering U.S. economy. 
Cornyn, Senate majority whip, advised Trump to be more ""surgical"" rather than treat most countries with the same approach.
""I would hope that we would not treat every country like a one size fits all,"" Cornyn said at the CERAWeek conference in Houston, one of the largest gatherings of energy industry executives.
Murkowski, head of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the tariffs caught her by surprise and advised Trump: ""Let's be cautious here.""
The tariffs, Murkowski said, ""are not coming at a good time for us"" given the materials that must be purchased to accomplish Trump's push to spend more than $1 trillion to repair the U.S. infrastructure network.
On Thursday, U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican of Arizona, said he would introduce a bill to nullify Trump's tariffs, warning that ""Congress cannot be complicit as the administration courts economic disaster.""
Cornyn and Murkowski advised Trump to seek better advice on trade and also communicate his decisions better. 
Cornyn said he was ""sorry to see"" Gary Cohn resign this week as the president's top economic adviser. He said economist Peter Navarro, another Trump adviser who favors protectionist measures and has been characterized as anti-China, ""has a lot of wrong ideas when it comes to trade.""
Murkowski said Trump and the White House must do a better job of making policy and communicating changes to Congress and the public.
""I'm not one that believes that tweeting is a holistic communications strategy,"" Murkowski told reporters after her speech. Trump regularly announces policy changes on the  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) social media platform. 

The pair said they agreed with Trump that changes should be made to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), though both said they disagreed with scrapping the pact entirely.

57,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 11:41AM ET</span>","In the cellars of eastern Ghouta, Syrians wait in fear","EASTERN GHOUTA, Syria/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Abu Alma has holed up in a basement for two weeks with his wife and baby daughter. Ten other families stay with them, hiding from the bombs that fall on Syria's eastern Ghouta. 
They only venture out to find medicine or bring food they had stored at home months earlier, he said. 
""We are living in the basement always,"" said Abu Alma, 30, an engineer and local aid worker. ""We're trying to make it work. What can we do?"" 
Warplanes and artillery have battered the rebel enclave near the capital Damascus for over two weeks in one of the bloodiest assaults of the seven-year war. The bombing has killed hundreds and pushed people into makeshift underground shelters.
Syrian government forces have chewed off bits of farmland and marched into towns, squeezing the pocket in the eastern suburbs of Damascus. 
As the battles creep closer, thousands of families fled their homes and moved deeper into the enclave, residents say. The cellars were already packed before that. 
Russia, the Syrian government's key ally, has offered insurgents safe passage out. The proposal echoes evacuations in other parts of Syria, where fighters and civilians withdrew to rebel territory near the Turkish border. 
Such deals - accept state rule or leave - have helped President Bashar al-Assad's military claw back control of major cities, with support from Russia and Iran. 
Some in eastern Ghouta said they dreaded a similar fate. 
""There's a lot of fear that the regime will enter, and on the other hand people don't want to leave. They want to stay in their homes,"" Abu Alma said in the town of Douma. ""It's harsh in the basements, but it will be much harder in the camps."" 
""WE RAN IN THE NIGHT""
Since 2013, troops have encircled eastern Ghouta, where the United Nations estimates 400,000 people live without enough food, water, or medicine. It remains the only big rebel enclave near Damascus, the seat of Assad's power. 
Khalil Aybour, a member of the local opposition council, said more than 16,000 people arrived in Douma alone in two weeks. He has prepared an emergency kit in case he has to suddenly run.
""There are families displaced five times, like my parents,"" he said. ""People are having to open up their shelters."" 
Abu Firas, a farmer from the village of Shifouniyeh, escaped to Douma last week when the front lines reached his house. 
""The forces advanced into the farms...We lifted the kids and ran in the night...We don't even have clothes,"" he said. ""The warplanes and rocket launchers pounced. The bullets were reaching our building.""
With their three children, he and his wife also live in a basement. ""It's disgusting,"" Abu Firas added. ""We want to return home...We have our lands. We abandoned them, our cows, our sheep."" The army now controls the village. 
Moscow and Damascus say their forces only target armed militants and seek to stop mortar salvoes by Islamist insurgents that have killed dozens of people in the capital. 
Russian and Syrian forces have opened corridors for civilians to exit the suburbs. But there are no signs that anyone has, and they accuse the Ghouta insurgents of preventing residents from leaving. The two main factions deny this. 
Abu Alma said people do not trust the route and worry about an uncertain fate if they go to government territory. ""Because there are no guarantees except from the Russians and the regime, and they are the same ones bombing Ghouta."" 
To pass the time in the cellar, they read the news or try to check on the status of relatives, he said.
""A MILLION DEATHS""
Some people said they did not doubt that a small part of the population wanted to get out, at least for survival. 
One resident in Douma said that many now wanted the bombs to stop falling at any price. Their despair has grown and the government onslaught has intensified so much that they now resent the insurgents, the resident said. 
Ahmad al-Meshrif, an ex-rebel, left his town of Nashabiyeh with 14 relatives including his mother, wife and son. Air strikes followed them as they moved across towns over the course of two weeks, he said. 
""This latest attack...has not spared anything. If only you see the sheep and the cows in the streets, how the shrapnel tore them to pieces."" 
When his family stayed in a shelter in Mesraba, he said, they could barely step out to the water pump because of the shelling. ""That's aside from the psychological state they put us in. I cannot find the words to describe it."" 
Meshrif, 35, has taken care of his nephews and nieces since two of his brothers died fighting against the army in recent years. His third brother was in a government prison. 

""We can no longer bear it. We put our hope in God,"" he said. ""I would rather die a million deaths than live under (the state's) control and stop battling it - impossible.""

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude April contract was up 94 cents or about 1.60% at $61.12 a barrel by 10:00 a.m. ET (14:00 GMT), off the previous session's three-and-a-half month low of $59.97.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London advanced $1.12 cents or about 1.75% to $63.89 a barrel.
Market sentiment was boosted after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday announced his willingness to accept an invitation to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un before May, with hopes of achieving “permanent denuclearization”.
South Korea's National Security Office said Kim ""expressed eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible"" and that the North-Korean leader pledged to ""refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests"" while talks are underway.
Meanwhile, concerns over a potential global trade war due to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports eased after President Trump signed a more tempered version of the plan on Thursday.
Trump signed the imposition of 25% tariffs on steel imports and 10% for aluminium but announced exemptions for Canada and Mexico and left the door open for exceptions for other countries.
Oil prices had come under pressure after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Wednesday that crude oil inventories rose by 2.408 million barrels for the week ended March 2.
While that was below expectations for a rise of 2.723 million barrels, it was the second-straight weekly build in crude stockpiles, adding to concerns that rising U.S. output could dampen global efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Britain has circulated a draft agreement on procurement at the World Trade Organization, trade diplomats told Reuters, one of three WTO documents it needs to finalize as it leaves the European Union.
The EU is a member of the WTO's government procurement (GPA) agreement, whose members have liberalized access to each other's procurement markets, with an estimated $1.7 trillion annual spend, but Britain is not a member in its own right.
To continue its GPA membership when it leaves the EU on March 29, 2019, Britain needs to persuade the other 45 countries in the GPA to keep it in the club. It will need its own membership terms, set out in documents known as ""schedules"".
""We have issued a draft set of schedules, which makes clear to other GPA members that we will continue our current rights and obligations to provide continuity and certainty for businesses and our trading partners,” a British trade official said.
Keeping Britain in the club should be mutually beneficial, but other members could make new demands for greater market access in Britain.
Britain remaining in the GPA means its companies will be able to continue bidding for U.S. federal government contracts, which would otherwise be off-limits because of the U.S. Buy American Act, which has a waiver for GPA members.
British voters supported leaving the EU in a referendum in June 2016, forcing it to disentangle its affairs from those of the EU, which has represented Britain at the WTO since the Geneva-based trading body was set up in 1995.
Apart from rolling over its GPA membership, Britain also needs to agree two other new ""schedules"" - one setting out its commitments for trade in goods and one for trade in services.
Without agreement on those, British trade officials will lack a baseline from which they can negotiate new trade agreements with other countries. 
Britain circulated a draft services schedule among WTO members at the end of February.
It has not yet formally submitted its services schedule or its GPA schedule to the WTO, and talks on the much more difficult goods trade are still stuck on the thorny issue of agriculture.
To get agreement on the new terms, Britain is expected to make sure other WTO members are not adversely affected by its divorce from the EU, so it may have to compensate them if they are not happy, or face a long-running legal dispute.

Crude Oil WTI Futures for April delivery were trading at $60.23 a barrel in Asia at 10:50pm ET, up 0.18%. Brent Oil Futures for May delivery, traded in London, were up 0.25% at $63.77 per barrel.
South Korea’s national security chief briefed White House officials on talks between Seoul and Pyongyang on Thursday, and said that Kim has pledged to refrain from further nuclear or missile tests. Kim and Trump would likely meet by May at a place and time to be determined. The White House said Trump would accept the invitation.
Asian stock markets rose following the news, pulling crude oil futures along with them.
Beyond geopolitics, oil markets were mainly affected by soaring output from the U.S., which has risen by 23 percent since mid-2016 to 10.37 million barrels per day (bpd).
U.S. oil production has already surpassed that of top exporter Saudi Arabia, and is expected to surpass that of top producer Russia by 2019.
This would pose a significant challenge for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has been trying to prop up oil prices by cutting output.
OPEC has been reducing output by around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) since January 2017. However, the U.S. has simply taken the market share from OPEC producers by ramping up production, dragging down prices.
Oil markets remained volatile due to excess supply. The American Petroleum Institute estimated inventories had risen by 5.66 million barrels last week, further weakening oil prices amid growing concerns that a trade war is on the horizon.
Major powers including the European Union and China have warned that the Trump administration’s new protectionist import tariffs could lead to retaliatory action, triggering a global trade war that could bring economic growth to a standstill. This would, by extension, drag down oil consumption.

Still, both Brent and WTI are on course for weekly losses of around 0.5 percent and 1.34 percent, respectively.

""Our overall short-term view is bearish,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB, noting the gains followed ""two solid days of sell-off"". 
Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed crude output  rising 23 percent since the middle of 2016 to 10.37 million barrels per day (bpd).
Analysts at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said they expected U.S. weekly rig count data, due later on Friday, to show further increases, adding pressure on oil prices.
""After all, it is attractive to drill for shale oil at prices above $60,"" they said in a note.
Thanks largely to shale, the United States now produces more crude than top OPEC exporter Saudi Arabia. Only Russia pumps more, at almost 11 million bpd.
""It seems only a matter of time before the U.S. becomes the biggest oil producer in the world,"" Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at Dutch bank ABN Amro, said in a note to investors.
Unlike Middle East producers, where output is largely dictated by state-owned oil companies, U.S. producers drill and sell purely based on economics. If prices remain at current levels or rise further, U.S. drillers are profitable and will raise output; if prices stumble, U.S. production will fall.
""The correlation between the U.S. oil production and the oil prices will remain considerable,"" van Cleef said.
As much as production, oil prices will also depend on demand.

Here, there are signs of a slowdown, although much of this could be seasonal as the northern hemisphere winter ends.

66,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>",U.S. Metal Stocks Hold Losses as Exemptions Blunt Tariff Boost,"(Bloomberg) -- After fluctuating in the past week amid uncertainty over planned tariffs, U.S. steel and aluminum stocks barely moved as President Donald Trump finally announced the measures.
U.S. Steel Corp., AK Steel Holding Corp. and  Nucor  Corp (NYSE:NUE). held losses Thursday as Trump confirmed a 25 percent duty on steel shipments and 10 percent on aluminum, while giving conditional exemptions to Canada and Mexico.
Those steel stocks surged a week ago when news of the tariff plans emerged, before swinging between gains and losses amid fears that retaliatory measures and exemptions to allies would water down the benefits. Century Aluminum Co. recovered some ground Thursday as Trump said the Chicago-based company would bring back capacity, before falling back to close down 7.5 percent.
The president signed a formal proclamation for the tariffs, excluding Mexico and Canada as long as they renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The measure gives Trump the flexibility to raise tariffs on other countries if the two Nafta partners are excluded long term.
Earlier Thursday, Trump noted that the U.S. has a trade surplus with Australia and called the nation a “long-term partner.”
For aluminum, such exemptions would render the tariffs useless by thwarting the ability of U.S. smelters to restart capacity, according to Harbor Intelligence.
Senator Jeff Flake said he’s incredulous about confusing signals from the White House on how it might proceed with the tariff proposal: “Flexible tariffs? What does that mean? One day you wake up and say, ‘I don’t like Australia?’ It’s unbelievable.”
The Arizona Republican plans to introduce legislation that would nullify the tariffs.
Trump announced the planned tariffs on March 1, after a Commerce Department investigation found that imports of the metals pose a risk to national security. The probes were authorized under the seldom-used Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act that gives the president broad powers to impose trade restrictions on domestic security grounds."

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for April delivery fell 1.68% to settle at $60.12 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent fell 0.84% to trade at $63.80 a barrel.
Crude prices looked set for a second-straight weekly decline as negative sentiment on oil prices continued after the Energy Information Administration weekly crude totals Wednesday showing crude supplies rose less than expected failed to lift sentiment amid persistent rise in U.S. output.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by 2.408 million barrels for the week ended March 2, below expectations for a 2.723 million barrels increased but that was offset by a rise in U.S. output to a record high per day of nearly 10.4 million barrels last week.
The dollar also played its part in keeping oil prices languishing at lows as the greenback rose sharply after the euro slumped on dovish ECB remarks.
Dollar-denominated assets such as oil are sensitive to moves in the dollar – a rise in the dollar tends to make oil more expensive for holders of foreign currency and thus, reduces demand.
Upbeat comments from Saudi oil minister Khalid Al-Falih suggesting that OPEC together with Russia could continue agreed production cuts after 2018 failed to stem losses in crude prices as investors continued to bet that with oil prices at $60 barrels, U.S. shale producers would add to oil output.
""When it’s time to lift, we will lift gradually’ Al-Falih said. “We adjust to the seasonality. If we lift the curbs in the first quarter, we will need to be conscious of refining maintenance season and lower demand. So we cannot lift all of the curbs and flood the market at a time when demand is less.""
The oil cartel together with Russia agreed in November to extend the 1.8 million bpd output cuts through 2018, to rid the market of excess supplies."

Gold futures for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $5.70, or 0.44%, to $1,321.70 a troy ounce. Gold prices are on track to post their third weekly loss.
The White House confirmation that Trump will sign the trade tariffs at 3:30 p.m. ET Thursday, comes on heels of Trump telling reporters that he would stick to his previously announced tariffs.
""I'm sticking with 10 and 25 (percent) initially. I'll have a right to go up or down, depending on the country, and I'll have a right to drop out countries or add countries,"" Trump told reporters at the beginning of a Cabinet meeting at the White House.
With both the EU and China reaffirming intentions to undertake retaliation action should Trump follow through on trade tariffs, the prospect of global trade war intensified somewhat but safe-demand remained timid.
Safe-haven gold failed to recover losses as trades looked ahead to the release of the nonfarm payrolls data including average hourly earnings data slated Friday, which if strong-than-expected could renewed expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures fell 0.05% to $16.49 a troy ounce, while platinum futures lost 0.29% to $950.40 an ounce.

The action came the same day U.S. President Donald Trump was set to announce tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the United States in a bid to counter cheap imports, especially from China.
Mexico's investigation of Chinese steel pipes predated Trump's tariff plan, beginning in December 2016 at the request of three companies and covering an analysis of the period from May 2013 to April 2016, the notice said. 
The duties replace provisional duties imposed last year. 
Mexico's economy ministry said in a notice in the government's official gazette that the measure applies to imports of carbon and alloy steel pipes from China.
Mexico has imposed duties on steel products from several countries in recent years after local steelmakers announced cuts in thousands of jobs in 2015 and canceled investments.

Trump plans to offer Canada and Mexico a 30-day exemption from his tariffs, which could be extended based on progress in talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a White House official said on Wednesday night.

Thursday’s data compared with a draw of 78 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the preceding week and represented a decline of 680 billion from a year earlier and was also 300 bcf below the five-year average.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.625 trillion cubic feet, 29.5% lower than levels at this time a year ago and also 15.6% below the five-year average for this time of year.
After the report, natural gas for delivery in April on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 2.5 cents, or about 0.9%, to trade at $2.752 per million British thermal units by 10:34AM ET (15:34GMT).
Futures had been down 2.6 cents, or about 0.9%, at $2.751 prior to the release of the supply data.
Natural gas had been trading lower during most of Thursday's session in what appeared to be profit-taking as the commodity is on track for weekly gains of around 2.1% after updated weather forecasting models showed colder weather lingering over the eastern U.S. through mid-March.
Despite recent gains, market experts still warned that futures are likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term as the coldest part of the winter has effectively passed.
Natural gas prices are down nearly 25% since late January amid speculation the end of the winter heating season will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for the fuel.
Spring usually sees the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.

73,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 09:42AM ET</span>","Refiners, traders brace for fuel-market volatility ahead of sulfur caps","By Liz Hampton and Devika Krishna Kumar
HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global executives and traders are bracing for higher volatility in fuel markets as they expect refiners to process more light crude oil in the lead-up to new rules aimed at slashing the use of dirty high-sulfur fuel oil in global shipping.
Beginning in 2020, shipping vessels will not be allowed to burn fuel with a sulfur content higher than 0.5 percent, down from 3.5 percent currently. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) plan is among the most significant changes in decades for global shipping and refining. 
Large shipping vessels have traditionally run on high-sulfur fuel oil, produced after refiners have made higher-quality fuels like diesel or gasoline. High-sulfur fuel emits more pollution. 
""I think there will be a lot of volatility and uncertainty around this,"" Jeremy Weir, chief executive officer of global commodity trading firm Trafigura said at the CERAWeek conference in Houston.
The IMO rule changes will likely prompt refiners to boost processing of sweeter crude grades because they produce cleaner, low-sulfur fuels, several executives said. 
Once the rules take effect, the shipping industry will need to switch to either marine gasoil, low sulfur residual fuel oil or a blend of high sulfur and ultra low sulfur fuel. This could boost margins for companies operating complex refineries with large coking capacity.
Refiners will likely process an additional 2.5 million barrels of crude daily to make additional distillate, said Robert Herman, executive vice president of refining at Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX). 
Increased demand for light, sweet crude could widen its premium over heavier, sour crudes with a higher sulfur content. That wider price gap could boost the advantage some U.S. refiners have gained by configuring their plants to further process heavy, sour crude over the past 20 years, as it cheapens the cost of heavy crude feedstock. 
Heavy crude ""will need to be heavily discounted"" to Gulf refiners that use those grades, said Robert Campbell, head of oil products research at Energy Aspects. 
Earlier this year, the value of light sweet crude on the Gulf Coast was about $4 over medium sour crude. This week, the premium is near $3 a barrel, but that could widen again.
Refiners are not expected to make costly structural changes, such as adding new cokers, to their facilities, Herman said, because price volatility will not last long enough to make such an investment viable. 
“It’s not going to last long enough for people to go out and spend lots of money on cokers and resid hydrotreaters,” he said. 
""We don't need to make investments to meet demand,"" said Tufan Erginbilgic, chief executive of downstream at  BP  (LON:BP), adding that there is ""absolutely enough"" product to meet demand. 
BUNKER FUEL BUMPINESS
Executives do anticipate more ups and downs in the fuel oil market, a less active market than crude trading. 
Forward bunker fuel, or high sulfur residual fuel oil(HSFO) refining margins for 2020 have collapsed in recent months. About 2 million barrels per day of HSFO demand will be lost in 2020 if rule enforcement is strict, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said in a recent research note. 
""You're already seeing in the forward curve for fuel oil a severe discount as this gets implemented,"" said Trafigura's Weir. 
Compliance remains a concern; industry estimates of how much of the world fleet will try to keep using high sulfur fuel range from less than 10 percent to as much as 40 percent. Executives in Houston said they expected high compliance.

Scrubbers, which reduce sulfur content of fuel on-board ships, are seen as an alternative to buying more expensive, cleaner fuel. Weir said Trafigura has invested in 36 tankers with scrubbers.

78,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 10:47PM ET</span>",Oil Prices Rebound With Decline in Gasoline Inventories ,"Investing.com - Oil prices rebounded slightly Thursday morning in Asia, pulled up by a report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) that gasoline inventories had dipped.
Crude Oil WTI Futures for April delivery were trading at $61.30 a barrel in Asia at 10:50pm ET, up 0.25%. Brent Oil Futures for May delivery, traded in London, were down 0.11% at $64.48 per barrel.
Oil prices had dropped following a decline of more than 1 percent in S&P 500 Futures, triggered by the resignation of key free-trade advocate Gary Cohn, economic adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, on Tuesday.
The EIA report came out a day after the 1-percent drop in S&P futures. The authority reported that gasoline stockpiles had declined by 800,000 barrels in the reporting period, compared with a 2.5-million-barrel build in the previous week. Since the start of the year, there has been only one week featuring a drop in gasoline inventories, while the total build since then stood at 17.8 million barrels.
However, oil markets remain volatile due to excess supply. The American Petroleum Institute estimated inventories had risen by 5.66 million barrels last week, further weakening oil prices after the blow from Cohn’s resignation led to growing concerns that a trade war is on the horizon.
Major powers including the European Union and China have warned that the Trump administration’s new protectionist import tariffs could lead to retaliatory action, triggering a global trade war that could bring economic growth to a standstill. This would, by extension, drag down oil consumption.
Meanwhile, increasing U.S. crude oil production continues to be a drag on efforts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to prop up prices by cutting output.
OPEC has been reducing output by around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) since January 2017.
However, the U.S. has simply taken the market share from OPEC producers by ramping up its oil production to over 10 million bpd. Not only is the U.S. moving closer to self-sufficiency, it is also set to become the world’s largest oil producer by 2019, further challenging OPEC’s ability to keep oil prices at comfortable levels."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Thursday, supported by healthy demand, after falling the previous day on the back of record U.S. crude production and rising inventories.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $64.46 per barrel at 0506 GMT, up 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their previous close. That slight rise came after a more-than-2 percent fall the previous day.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $61.26 a barrel, up 11 cents, or 0.2 percent. WTI also fell by more than 2 percent the previous session.
The slight recovery on Thursday came amid a U.S. crude inventory build that was not as big as expected during the current seasonal demand lull at the end of winter, when many oil refineries shut down for maintenance.

""Oil prices bounced back immediately after the release of the weekly oil inventories data from the Energy Information Administration ... (where) the headline figure was better than expected,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at futures brokerage Forex.com.
The EIA reported late on Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories  rose by 2.4 million barrels in the week to March 2, to 425.91 million barrels, less than the 2.7 million barrel increase analysts had forecast.
On the demand side, U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note to clients dated March 7 that the outlook remained for healthy growth, despite recent signs of a slight economic slowdown.
""A still robust growth outlook for 2018 and the recent pattern of 2Q demand acceleration all leave us reiterating our 1.85 million bpd 2018 global oil demand growth forecast,"" the bank said.
Despite this, soaring U.S. production, which last week marked another record, at 10.37 million barrels per day (bpd), is looming over oil markets.
""Crude is ... under pressure from rising U.S. production which hit a new high last week, now firmly above Saudi Arabia's production level,"" said William O'Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia's Rivkin Securities.
Graphic: http://reut.rs/2FrFVMF
At just below 11 million bpd, only Russia produces more than the United States, although the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects even this to change as the United States is set to surge past 11 million bpd by late 2018.
With U.S. output outpacing demand growth, analysts say the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, who together with some other producers have been withholding production in order to prop up prices, are under pressure to keep up the supply restraint, even at the cost of market share.

""OPEC may ... have to extend its production agreement with Russia and co in order to avoid triggering another 2014-style sell-off in oil prices,"" said Razaqzada.

Gold futures for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $10.00, or 0.74%, to $1,325.30 a troy ounce.
The White House said that President Donald Trump may exempt Canada, Mexico from tariffs, easing days of investor fears over the prospect of a global trade war.

And there are potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security and possibly other countries as well based on that process,"" said Press Sec. Sanders Wednesday, when asked if countries will be able to get exemptions from tariffs, CNBC reported.
That eased safe-haven demand, denting appetite for safe-haven gold which had earlier hit one-month highs on political uncertainty in Washington after economic advisor Gary Cohn resigned.
A rise in the dollar also weighed on gold prices after an economic report showed the private sector labor market remained robust, raising the prospect of above-forecast nonfarm payrolls data due Friday.
Private payrolls grew by 235,000 in February, according to a report released Wednesday by ADP and Moody's Analytics. That beat economists’ forecast of 195,000, and raised investor expectations for a bullish nonfarm payrolls print due Friday as ADP data often serves as precursor to nonfarm payrolls.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in the U.S. dollar – a stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, thus, reduces investor demand for the precious metal.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures fell 1.87% to $16.47 a troy ounce, while platinum futures lost 1.78% to $953.80 an ounce.
Copper fell 0.76% to $3.14, while natural gas added 1.16% to $2.78."

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for April delivery fell 2.32% to settle at $61.15 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent fell 2.5% to trade at $64.16 a barrel.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by 2.408 million barrels for the week ended March 2. While that was below expectations for a rise of 2.723 million barrels it was the second-straight weekly build in crude stockpiles, and added to fears that rising U.S. output may scupper OPEC’s efforts to rebalance oil markets.
The rise in crude inventories comes as refineries undergo seasonal maintenance, leading to a drop in demand for crude while raising the prospect of a build in supplies. Some market participants, however, expect crude draws in the U.S. will resume once refineries return from maintenance.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – fell by 788,000 barrels, missing expectations for a decline of 1.2 million barrels, while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – fell by 559,000 barrels, missing expectations for a fall of 1.201 million barrels.
The less-than-expected drop in gasoline stockpiles was surprising to some after the API data on Tuesday estimated that gasoline inventories fell by as much as 4.536 million barrels. 
Also weighing on sentiment was an ongoing uptick in U.S. production as the EIA said that weekly U.S. crude production rose to a record high per day of nearly 10.4 million barrels last week. "

PARIS (Reuters) - Rising biodiesel imports from Argentina and an expected surge in shipments from Indonesia threaten to cripple output in the European Union, the world's top producer of the renewable fuel.
The European Union slashed import duties on Argentine biodiesel last September after Buenos Aires mounted a successful challenge at the World Trade Organisation, weeks after the United States imposed steep duties on the fuel.
The bloc is now considering whether to cut duties on Indonesian biodiesel.
Argentine soybean-based fuel is now entering the EU at much lower prices than rapeseed oil, the main material used by European producers, who say they cannot compete and in some cases are being pushed to the verge of bankruptcy.
Between August last year and January, 852,000 tonnes of biodiesel - around four times the capacity of a large EU plant - worth $617 million, were exported from Argentina to the bloc, customs data showed. Earlier in 2017, nearly all exports were heading to the United States.
Raffaello Garofalo, head of the European Biodiesel Board (EBB), said the impact of Argentine imports was already worse than expected.
""There is huge economic damage and we risk seeing many European renewable fuel producers close down in the face of these unfair import floods,"" he said.
The EU is the world's largest producer and consumer of biodiesel, a fuel made mostly from vegetable oils, which is renewable and aimed at reducing carbon emissions.
EU production of biodiesel was 11.9 million tonnes in 2017, up from 11.7 million a year earlier. But consultancy Strategie Grains, which initially said output would be stable this year, has cut its 2018 estimate to 11.6 million tonnes because of the Argentine imports.
Imports of Argentine biodiesel into the EU could hit 1.5 million tonnes in 2018, with a similar volume from Indonesia if the EU cuts its duties, Strategie Grains said.
DOUBLE WHAMMY
The rise in imports comes as several producers in the European Union are being pressed hard by internal competition and low margins.
The EU's top producer, Saipol, part of oilseed group Avril, said it would cut production by nearly half this year, with around 250 out of 600 staff working reduced hours, mainly because of imports of Argentine biodiesel.
""There is a double impact, on our sales but also on the biodiesel market, where prices are weighed down by the arrival of cheap products,"" Kristell Guizouarn, head of France's biodiesel industry group Esterifrance, said.
Both Argentina and Indonesia impose a higher export duty on the raw material - soybeans and palm oil respectively - than on biodiesel. This allows biodiesel producers in the two countries to ""dump"" products abroad at unfairly low prices, EU producers say.
Since September, European rapeseed oil-based biodiesel prices have fallen 12 percent but are still about 25 percent higher than Argentine soybean oil-based biodiesel delivered to the bloc. <0#BIODIESEL=HBI> 
SPANISH BIODIESEL
The EU was Argentina's largest biodiesel market until the tariffs were implemented in 2013.
The Spanish biodiesel industry could be hard hit. There would be no need to produce the fuel in Spain if cheap biodiesel is available from Argentina, said Christophe Cogny, analyst at Strategie Grains, adding that Spanish companies were already facing severe overcapacity.
Germany, the EU's largest producing country, warned of a massive fall in output this year due to what it called unfairly subsidized imports.
""Immediate measures should be taken by the EU to restrain the imports in order to prevent this threat to the very existence of the German biodiesel industry,"" Elmar Baumann, head of the German Biofuels Industry Association VDB, said.
COUNTER-MEASURES
The EU opened an anti-subsidy investigation into Argentine biodiesel at the end of January, after a complaint by the EBB, potentially offering a way to impose duties on imported biodiesel.
Argentine producers accused the EU of protectionism.
""We are confident that we have a very clear and strong case to defend ourselves,"" said Luis Zubizarreta, president of Carbio, Argentina's biofuels industry chamber.
If the investigation finds that Argentina benefited from unfair subsidies, provisional duties could be imposed late this year. The scope of such duties is unknown. 
In the meantime, pressured by the industry, France adopted stricter environmental rules for imported biofuels, a measure intended to restrict inflows from Argentina.
But since most shipments enter the EU via the Netherlands or Spain and are then distributed internally, it will be hard to track the impact of the French action.
The United States imposed steep duties on Argentine and Indonesian biodiesel last August, saying the fuel was unfairly subsidized. Argentine producers said the move meant an immediate halt in exports on the U.S. markets.
And last month the U.S. Commerce Department imposed more import duties on biodiesel from both countries, making it virtually certain that biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia will not be sold in the U.S. market.

Trump wants to protect American workers against countries that engage in unfair trade practices, but ""I'm not sure he has made up his mind"" on the tariffs, Perry said on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference. 
The key issue for the administration was putting together a plan that ""strategically"" deploys tariffs and regulations, said Perry, who addressed conference executives on the global role of a U.S. energy resurgence. 
The proposal, which involves imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, has been criticized by Republican lawmakers and U.S. trade allies since the president first tweeted his intentions last week. 
Gary Cohn, the president's top economic adviser and a free trade advocate, resigned on Tuesday in a sign of an internal clash on the issue within the administration. 
Perry suggested the proposal could unleash a backlash that draws in other sectors. 

""If you change one rule, it probably has an effect. Does it have unintended consequences? It may do that.""

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 47 cents, or 0.7%, to $62.13 a barrel by 10:34AM ET (1534GMT). Prices were at around $61.85 prior to the release of the inventory data.
Meanwhile, London-traded Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., shed 51 cents, or roughly 0.8%, to $65.32 a barrel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories increased by 2.4 million barrels in the week ended March 2.
That compared with analysts' expectations for a gain of around 2.7 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply-increase of 5.7 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, declined by 605,000 barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 425.9 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be in the lower half of the average range for this time of year.
U.S. crude oil production rose by 0.4% from the previous week to a fresh all-time high of 10.36 million barrels per day, keeping it above Saudi Arabia's output levels and within reach of Russia, the world's biggest crude producer.
Analysts and traders have recently warned that booming U.S. shale oil production could potentially derail OPEC's effort to end a supply glut.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories decreased by 788,000 barrels, compared to expectations for a decline of 1.2 million barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a drop of 559,000 barrels.

85,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 09:33AM ET</span>",UBS Sees Commodities Risks If `Deep Trade War' Breaks Out,"(Bloomberg) -- Raw materials are at great risk as Donald Trump’s White House prepares to pull the trigger on tariffs. UBS Group AG warned metals to energy prices would be hurt if U.S. levies spark a global trade war, while commodity powerhouse Australia forecast only a damaging race to the bottom.
“Obviously, going into a deep trade war, industrial commodities are going to be negatively affected,” Dominic Schnider, head of commodities and Asia-Pacific foreign exchange at the bank’s wealth-management unit, told Bloomberg Television on Wednesday. “It’s still good for gold,” he said.
The risks of a global escalation surged this week as the president sticks to his plan for tariffs, provoking the departure of Gary Cohn as his top economic adviser. The European Union has vowed to respond should steel and aluminum levies be introduced. Separately, the Trump administration is considering imposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods to punish Beijing for alleged theft of intellectual property, according to people familiar with the matter.
If there is a deep trade war “we might not get our acceleration in global growth to 4.1 percent that we expect this year,” said Schnider. “So a deceleration will be bad. What really drives commodity returns on the industrial side is growth momentum.”
Prices of industrial commodities retreated as investors reacted to Cohn’s departure. Copper lost as much as 0.7 percent to $6,953 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, as nickel, aluminum and zinc also declined. Brent dropped and iron ore futures sank in Asia, while gold held recent gains. 
There’s been a chorus of warnings about the potential fallout from the U.S. tariffs, with the International Monetary Fund saying possible import restrictions “are likely to cause damage not only outside the U.S., but also to the U.S. economy.” Australia -- the world’s largest iron ore exporter, with deep trade ties to China, the top commodity user -- weighed in on Wednesday.
‘History Teaches Us’
“History teaches us that there are no winners in a trade war,” Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told a business summit in Sydney. “A trade war is a race to the bottom that makes us all poorer, leaves our citizens with less choice and fewer opportunities.”
For his part, Trump has welcomed the prospect of a trade conflict. “When we’re behind every single country, trade wars aren’t so bad,” Trump said in a press conference on Tuesday. “The trade war hurts them, not us.” Last week, the U.S. president said that such battles are “easy to win.”
Cohn’s move “opens the environment up to whole new wave of uncertainty,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC. “The likelihood of a trade war just jumped dramatically.”

Front-month U.S. natural gas futures tacked on 3.5 cents, or around 1.3%, to $2.784 per million British thermal units (btu) by 9:10AM ET (1410GMT). It rose to its best level since Feb. 5 at $2.788 earlier in the session.
The commodity notched a gain of around 1.7% on Tuesday, as updated weather forecasting models showed colder weather lingering over the eastern U.S. through mid-March.
Despite recent gains, market experts warned that futures are likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term as the coldest part of the winter has effectively passed.
Natural gas prices are down nearly 25% since late January amid speculation the end of the winter heating season will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for the fuel.
Spring usually sees the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 54 and 68 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended March 2.
That compares with a decline of 78 bcf in the preceding week, a drop of 68 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average fall of 129 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 1.682 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
That figure is 680 bcf, or around 28.8%, lower than levels at this time a year ago, and 372 bcf, or roughly 18.1%, below the five-year average for this time of year.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 89.56, after falling to a two-week trough of 89.36 earlier Wednesday.
Gold is sensitive to moves in the dollar. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency.
But investors remained cautious after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he would push ahead with his tariffs on steel and aluminum imports despite growing pressure from political allies to back down from the measures.
Last week Trump announced plans to impose imports tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum in a recommitment to his nationalist trade agenda.
Markets were also jittery after Trump's economic adviser Gary Cohn announced his resignation on Tuesday. The decision was said to have been made following a disgreement between Cohn and the U.S. President over the import tariffs.
Traders fear that the proposed tariffs could spark inflation and provoke retaliation from U.S. trade partners. Major holders of U.S. Treasuries, including China and the European Union, could reduce their holdings of U.S. assets in response.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, said on Wednesday it expects earnings to more than double by 2025 to $31 billion, with crude prices (CLc1) (LCOc1) at or above current levels.
It was the first time Exxon has ever given an earnings forecast so far in advance, highlighting how the Irving, Texas-based company was working to woo Wall Street.
Exxon's shares fell 1.4 percent on Wednesday morning to $75.13 alongside a dip in broader markets and oil prices. 
Investors and analysts have bemoaned that the company's returns have sagged below those of rivals Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) in recent years.
Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods, who took the helm in January 2017 after predecessor Rex Tillerson left to become U.S. secretary of state, said he was committed to being more transparent and improving results.
""There's a lot different today, not just style,"" Woods said at the company's annual analyst day in New York. ""I think that it's my responsibility to make sure this audience and the broader audience understands where we're trying to take the business.""
Exxon said exploration projects in Guyana and the Permian Basin as well as refining and chemical plant expansions, should help boost earnings. Exxon reported an adjusted profit of $15 billion in 2017.
Exxon is also spending money to make money, with plans to spend $24 billion on capital projects this year, $28 billion next year and an average of $30 billion from 2023 to 2025. Peers, meanwhile, are cutting spending.
""If you look across our portfolio today, it's the richest set of opportunities since Exxon and Mobil merged"" in 1999, Woods said. ""We see the full potential of the organization: significant earnings growth will improving return of capital employed.""
Production is expected to grow by about 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), to about 5 million boe/d in 2025 as 25 projects come online, Woods said.
Looking only at the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield, Exxon plans to triple production by 2025 as it taps the low-cost acreage. The plans highlight the increasing importance of U.S. shale to the world's largest publicly traded oil producer alongside its global mega-projects.
Several analysts saw the rising spending as problematic, even as they said they appreciated the transparency by a company many have bemoaned for weak disclosures in recent years.
""To us this highlights that there are no easy fixes to rejuvenate Exxon’s portfolio, and it is likely to take time for this investment to flow through into higher earnings, cash flow and returns,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria. 
Exxon did not announce a stock buyback program on Wednesday, something analysts had been hoping for.

Chevron said on Tuesday it should be able to raise production between 4 and 7 percent this year and buy back shares for the first time in at least three years even without a substantial rise in oil prices.

SINGAPORE/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - East Timor and Australia this week signed a treaty at the United Nations setting their maritime boundary for the first time, and striking a deal on sharing an estimated $65 billion in potential revenues from the Greater Sunrise gas fields in the Timor Sea.
For impoverished East Timor, with a population of just 1.3 million, development of the fields is crucial -- its main source of revenue since 2004, the Bayu Undan gas field, is set to run out of gas by 2022.
The treaty signing in New York on Tuesday marked the first conciliation under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) — a process UN Secretary‑General António Guterres said could offer other countries a path toward resolving contentious maritime boundary disputes.
At current market prices, the Greater Sunrise reserves would be worth more than 23 times East Timor's annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $2.8 billion. 
Graphic on East Timor GDP: http://reut.rs/2tn4pVx
Development of the reserves has been held back by the maritime border dispute between Australia and East Timor, a former Portuguese colony that gained independence from Indonesia in 2002.
""The treaty is an important step that opens the way for developing a rich, shared resource, the Greater Sunrise gas fields. We know this resource is crucial to Timor Leste's development,"" said Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who signed the treaty in New York on Tuesday with East Timor's Deputy Minister of the Prime Minister for the Delimitation of Borders Hermenegildo Augusto Cabral Pereira.
However, the Greater Sunrise joint venture, led by Australia's Woodside Petroleum (AX:WPL), which has been a key party in the long-running negotiation, said it was disappointed that the treaty did not contain a full development plan for the gas reserves.
""It is disappointing that this process has not resulted in an alignment on a development concept,"" the Sunrise joint venture said in a statement on Wednesday.
The Sunrise partners did not specify what they felt was missing in the agreement, but it is likely that Dili insisted on the gas being processed in East Timor for overseas sale, while the joint venture would prefer to pipe the gas to Australia.
Graphic on map of Greater Sunrise gas fields: http://reut.rs/2oVyq9F
Under the terms of the deal, East Timor will get 70 percent of revenues if processing takes place in East Timor, and 80 percent should the gas be piped to Australia.
That compares with an equal share under a 2006 agreement between Dili and Canberra. 
HOW MUCH GAS IS THERE?
The Sunrise and Troubadour gas fields, collectively known as Greater Sunrise, lie beneath waters 100 to 600 meters deep, making them shallow to medium-deepwater developments.
The fields were discovered in 1974 and, according to Woodside, hold around 5.13 trillion cubic feet of gas, the equivalent of more than a third of current annual global LNG consumption.
At current market prices, the LNG would be worth almost $50 billion.
Like most gas fields in the wider region, including Papua New Guinea's and Australia's huge liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports facilities, Greater Sunrise also contains significant amounts of condensate, an ultra-light form of crude oil.
Its 225.9 million barrels of condensate reserves at current market prices would be worth over $15 billion.
WHO GETS WHAT?
Woodside and its partners have long said they would prefer to develop the fields using a floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) platform, considered the most cost-effective option, as the fields are 150km away from East Timor and 450km away from Darwin in Australia.
However the agreement signed on Tuesday lays out just two options -- piping the gas either to East Timor or Australia.
Dili has long pressed for the gas to be processed in East Timor, looking to generate thousands of jobs in construction and, once developed, in the lucrative oil and gas processing, storage, transport and petrochemical industries.
Australia, however, has existing gas infrastructure and an experienced workforce, making it the industry's preferred location.
WHO IS INVOLVED?
The partners in Greater Sunrise are Australia's Woodside, U.S. firm ConocoPhillips (N:COP), Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and Japan's Osaka Gas (T:9532).
Even with the new agreement, development could be years away. Woodside said last May it may only develop Greater Sunrise after 2027.
Energy markets are just recovering from years of oversupply that depressed oil and gas prices and deterred development of new gas projects.
Asia's LNG markets, which Greater Sunrise would serve, are expected to remain oversupplied into the early 2020s as production rises in Australia, North America, Papua New Guinea and also Qatar.
It's likely the Sunrise partners will bide their time before committing billions of dollars to develop such a large project.

SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A deadly earthquake that struck ExxonMobil's $19 billion gas project in the mountains of Papua New Guinea is sparking a backlash against the U.S. energy giant that could prove harder to fix than buried roads and broken pipes.
Some spooked locals blame Exxon (N:XOM) and its project partners of causing, or at least magnifying, the 7.5 magnitude quake on Feb. 26 and a series of intense aftershocks that continue to pound the impoverished and isolated region.
While firmly denied by Exxon and debunked by geologists, the accusations suggest that the project known as PNG LNG, one of the most successful liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments in the world, is sorely lacking goodwill from at least parts of the local population.
The concerns about the project – the country’s biggest revenue earner - are even being expressed at senior levels in the Papua New Guinea government.
PNG's Vice Minister for Petroleum and Energy, Manasseh Makiba, told Reuters in a phone interview there should be an inquiry to respond to local concerns that mother nature had reacted after the ground was disturbed by drilling.
Graphic on Papua New Guinea's earthquakes and aftershocks: http://reut.rs/2tq3zY6
""It could be man-made but that cannot be confirmed until a proper scientific inquiry can be done,"" said Makiba, who represents parts of the quake-hit area. ""We need to resolve that.""
PNG’s Minister for Finance James Marape has also demanded answers from the company.    
""In a world of science and knowledge, I now demand answer(s) from Exxon and my own government as to the cause of this unusual trend in my Hela,"" wrote Marape on his private feed on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), referring to the quake-struck province.
He is among many who have lit up social media in PNG, with blogs and Facebook posts pointing the finger at the oil and gas sector's alleged contribution to the disaster.    
Around Exxon's operation, communities remain fearful as the death toll climbs, with 18 more killed by a 6.7 magnitude aftershock on Wednesday. 
Papua New Guinea straddles the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire.
Chris McKee, acting director of the Geohazards Management Division in Port Moresby, said there was no link between the project and seismic activity, which has included more than 120 quakes of magnitude 4.5 and greater in the week after the initial hit.
Graphic on Papua New Guinea government revenue and LNG income - http://reut.rs/2D3KAlP
""Earthquake activity has been going on much longer than the oil and gas industry presence in the region - there is no connection at all,"" McKee said. 
Scientific evidence strongly suggests the earthquake was ""naturally occurring and consistent with prior events"", an Exxon spokeswoman said in a statement. 
CORPORATE SUPPORT
Led by Exxon, with a one-third stake, and its Australian partners Oil Search (AX:OSH) and Santos (AX:STO), PNG LNG could be shut for months as it inspects pipelines, the processing plant and the gas field for damage. 
Exxon said it was giving $1 million to assist communities affected by the earthquake and was providing on-the-ground support to relief agencies so that resources could reach areas in greatest need.
""Logistics remains a challenge with roads cut and communication with remote communities difficult,"" a company spokeswoman said. ""We are continuing to provide logistics and human resources to help aid agencies to deliver support to our communities for the long term as they recover from this event."" 
Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten said he had not witnessed any local animosity toward the LNG project. Oil Search was constantly balancing the need for relief aid and keeping the community-sustaining business going when allocating post-quake resources, he said.
Graphic on share price performance of oil majors - http://reut.rs/2FeHCRw
""There's a lot of concern the gods have been offended and specifically this is about education, and what earthquakes are about,"" Botten told Reuters in a phone interview from PNG's capital Port Moresby. ""This is a communication issue.""
Most of the nations 8 million inhabitants live in remote communities where traditional beliefs remain strongly held. 
SHAKY GROUND
Exxon has previously faced resentment in PNG, which contains vast natural resources but remains desperately poor.  
Martyn Namorong, national coordinator for landowner rights and governance lobby group PNG Resource Governance Coalition, said the quake had reawakened concerns raised in 2012 when a landslide tore through a quarry used by Exxon, killing at least 25 people. (http://reut.rs/2D48Ggo)
""It's not just a localized thing or an ignorant thing. People are wondering what might be the contributing factor of oil and gas extraction,"" said Namorong, referring to the quake.
Exxon said at the time it had closed the Tumbi quarry five months before the landslide.
""Tumbi was a tragic event that had its own unique set of circumstances,"" Exxon told Reuters in an email, without elaborating.
Concerns flared again last year when the oil major had to evacuate staff due to unrest in Hela province, where the project's Hides Gas processing unit is located. 
The trouble was linked to national elections and disputes over royalties from the PNG LNG project, which generates around $3 billion in sales per year at current LNG prices . 
""PEOPLE ARE TERRIFIED""
The earthquake forced a closure of the Hides Gas processing facility which feeds a 700-km (435 miles) pipeline snaking through the jungle to the LNG plant and export terminal near Port Moresby.
The disruption in Papua New Guinea comes shortly after Exxon reported disappointing results, with PNG LNG a rare bright spot. Its shares have underperformed compared with its main competitors Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa),  Chevron  (CVX),  BP  (L:BP) and  Total  (PA:TOTF).
""PNG LNG had reportedly been running at a very healthy 20 percent above nameplate capacity... There will be some hit to the PNG industry,"" said Readul Islam, research analyst at consultancy Rystad Energy.
If repairs take long, the quakes could even delay plans with France's Total to double output to around 16 million tonnes per annum at an estimated cost of $13 billion.
The companies plan to add three new LNG units, or trains, with two underpinned by gas from the Elk-Antelope fields, run by Total, and one underpinned by existing fields and a new Exxon-run field.
Repairs have been complicated by landslides blocking roads and the closure of the Komo airfield, which is the main lifeline of the region to the outside world.
Oil Search's Botten said, importantly, the integrity of the gas facilities had been maintained and there were no leaks.
Still, the aftershocks have kept the local population on edge.

""The people are terrified,"" said Australian Sally Lloyd, from near the quake zone in Mount Hagen. ""They think the world is coming to an end.""

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude April contract was down 65 cents or about 0.94% at $62.01 a barrel by 03:30 a.m. ET (07:30 GMT), off the previous session's one-week high of $63.27.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London declined 63 cents or about 0.96% to $65.15 a barrel.
The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that crude oil inventories rose by 5.66 million barrels in the week ended March 2, compared to expectations for an increase of 2.70 million barrels.
Market participants were looking ahead to official data by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due later Wednesday.
Oil prices had strengthened after the International Energy Agency said on Monday that global oil demand was expected to grow in the next five years, while output from producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would rise at a much slower pace.
OPEC, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
However, the IEA also upwardly revised U.S. oil output growth, saying the country would be producing a total of nearly 17 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2023.
U.S. crude oil production has already surpassed that of top exporter Saudi Arabia to 10.28 million bpd.
Rising U.S. output has weighed on oil prices in recent months amid fears it could dampen global efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
Meanwhile, sentiment waned after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he would push ahead with his tariffs on steel and aluminum imports despite growing pressure from political allies to back down from the measures.
The tariffs, announced last week, have sparked concerns over a potential trade war.
Markets were also jittery after Trump's economic adviser Gary Cohn announced his resignation on Tuesday. The decision was said to have been made following a disgreement between Cohn and the U.S. President over the import tariffs.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp's (N:XOM) $200 million write-down last month on abandoned ventures in Russia - once its next big frontier - points to challenges facing Chief Executive Darren Woods in his second year leading the world's largest publicly traded oil producer. 
Some of the biggest bets taken by his predecessor Rex Tillerson, now the U.S. secretary of state, have resulted in billions of dollars in write-downs amid falling production and a stock price that has long lagged peers.
That leaves Woods facing the prospect of slow growth and billions of dollars in new spending that could weigh on results for years. In 2018, the company plans capital spending of about $24 billion - up about a quarter since 2016 - suggesting return on capital will get worse before it gets better as the firm waits for a payoff from new exploration under Woods.
Graphic on Exxon's Quarterly Earnings: http://tmsnrt.rs/1WQwElC
Rivals including Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and  Chevron  (N:CVX), by contrast, have capped or cut their spending after finishing expansion projects. Exxon shares are down 18 percent since Woods took over in January 2017. Shell is up 2 percent and Chevron is down about 3 percent during the same period.
Woods is feeling the heat from investors who could have made more if they held shares in Exxon's rivals, as well as activist investors who want to see the company take renewable energy more seriously. Analysts are pushing for more transparency on operations, and some have called for Woods to sell assets.
Graphic on Exxon's Cash Stumble: http://reut.rs/2Ey6S1s
Exxon declined to comment. A State Department spokesperson said Tillerson would have no comment on Exxon matters and referred questions to the company.
Exxon is set to host its annual analyst meeting in New York on Wednesday.
The firm took the $200 million after-tax charge to walk away from its Russia Kara and Black sea ventures with Rosneft (MM:ROSN). Five years ago, Exxon touted plans to spend more than $3 billion in Russia, but the firm halted operations in late 2014 when the U.S. sanctioned the country over its military operations in Ukraine.

Exxon also took $1.3 billion in charges against Tillerson's bets on natural gas in Mexico and Canada this year. Last year, it took a $2.13 billion write-down a year earlier - mostly on Rocky Mountain properties tied to Tillerson's 2010 purchase of natural gas producer XTO Energy Inc. - and disclosed it had reduced estimates of Canadian oil reserves by 3.5 billion barrels.
""There's no question that, over the past handful of years, Exxon has been a relative underperformer,"" said Hank Smith, co-chief investment officer of the Haverford Trust, which has held Exxon's shares for two decades and recently added Royal Dutch Shell to its portfolio. ""It's been frustrating.""
'EPIC FAIL'
Weak results from production have this year cost Exxon its standing as the oil major generating the most cash, a distinction that now goes to Shell.
Now, Exxon is spending more cash on projects that will take time to produce.
In Guyana, where the company is leading development of an offshore field estimated to hold at least 3.2 billion barrels of oil, Exxon and partners have said they must spend more than $4 billion on developing a project not expected to deliver oil until at least late 2019. 
More spending awaits Exxon in Qatar, Mozambique and Papua New Guinea for liquefied natural gas projects, and for oil developments in Brazil, Ghana and Mauritania, the company has said.
Exxon paid more than $6 billion last year to double its acreage in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield. Exxon's production there so far is relatively low compared to peers, about 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Exxon says it plans to triple output there through 2025.
With all Woods' development plans, it seems unlikely Exxon's capital spending will decline after this year, said Simmons & Co analyst Guy Baber.
The company did reverse some of the write-downs it took on reserves as oil prices rose. But the company's inability to translate those gains into robust profits in the final quarter of 2017 was an ""epic fail,"" said Raymond James oil analyst Pavel Molchanov.
LITTLE DATA FOR INVESTORS
Some investors say it's too soon to evaluate Woods' tenure despite Exxon's lagging returns. 
""There are few decisions that any one person, let alone Woods, could make in the first 12 to 13 months that would be able to really affect the company,"" said Mark Stoeckle, portfolio manager of Adams Natural Resources Fund Inc (N:PEO), which holds Exxon's shares. 
Exxon retains supporters on Wall Street. Its shares are recommended for purchase by 29 percent of the 24 analysts that cover the company, according to Thomson Reuters data. Half rate the shares as a ""hold"" and five advise ""sell.""
Analysts recommending the stock cite the strength of Exxon's assets. 
Others, however, want more information on Exxon's operations. Of the world's five largest publicly traded oil producers, Exxon ranks last for providing detailed data to investors, while  BP  Plc (L:BP) is the best, according to an analysis of quarterly earnings regulatory filings by investment researcher Redburn Ltd.
BP and Shell, for example, offer more than twice as much data as Exxon on each segment of operations, Redburn found.

""Exxon Mobil's greatest challenge for 2018 might not its valuation, assets or growth, but opening up to investors,"" said Redburn oil and gas analyst Rob West.

95,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 11:21PM ET</span>",Oil Prices Fall Over Fears of Global Trade War,"Investing.com - Oil prices fell Wednesday morning in Asia, pulled down by concerns that a trade war is on the horizon.
Crude Oil WTI Futures for April delivery were trading at $62.11 a barrel in Asia at 10:45pm ET, down 0.78%. Brent crude futures for May delivery, traded in London, were down 0.82% at $65.25 per barrel.
The drop in prices followed a decline of more than 1 percent in S&P 500 Futures, triggered by the resignation of a key advocate for free trade in the U.S. Gary Cohn, economic adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, said on Tuesday he was resigning, fueling growing concerns that Washington would go ahead with protectionist measures including the proposed import tariffs, which could risk a trade war.
A global trade war could bring economic growth to a standstill, and by extension, drag down oil consumption. Major powers including the European Union and China have warned that if implemented, the new tariffs could lead to retaliatory action.
Oil prices were also pulled down by weaker sharemarkets as well as soaring U.S. crude oil production and rising inventories recently.
Crude inventories increased by 5.661 million barrels in the week to 426.880 million barrels, according to recent data from the American Petroleum Institute.
Oil supplies remain ample despite efforts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to reduce output in order to support prices.
OPEC has been cutting back output by around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) since January 2017, with output falling to a 10-month low in February 2018. The pact will run through the end of this year.
However, the U.S. has simply taken the market share from OPEC producers by ramping up its shale oil production. Once the world’s top oil importer, the U.S. has increased its oil output to over 10 million bpd and is moving closer to self-sufficiency.
The U.S. has already risen past top exporter Saudi Arabia, and is set to overtake Russia as the world’s largest oil producer by 2019 at the latest."
96,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 08:23AM ET</span>","Oil hit by broader market downdraught, U.S. output rise also weighs","By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell on Wednesday as financial markets slid after a free trade advocate in the U.S. government resigned, feeding concerns that Washington's plans for import tariffs could spark a trade war.
Rising U.S. crude output and climbing U.S. inventories have also weighed. The United States is set to become the world's biggest oil producer this year, threatening to offset supply cuts by the OPEC, Russia and other producers.
""Rising U.S. oil output coupled with a simultaneous upswing in domestic oil stockpiles has all the makings for a potent bearish cocktail,"" PVM Oil Associates strategist Stephen Brennock said.
Brent futures slipped 32 cents to $64.47 a barrel by 1232 GMT, while U.S. crude futures fell 33 cents to $62.27, although both contracts had eased off their lows in line with a recovery in S&P futures.
The oil price fall followed weakness in global financial markets after the resignation of Gary Cohn, economic adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, seen as a bulwark against protectionist forces in the government.
Oil's correlation with the equity market has been positive, meaning the two tend to move in tandem, for at least a month, the longest such stretch in a year.
""With the announcement that Cohn was resigning, the S&P futures market dropped and oil went with it,"" Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said. ""The correlation between the (S&P index) and oil has been moving in synchronicity.""
Cohn's resignation came after he lost a fight over Trump's plans for hefty steel and aluminum import tariffs.
Major powers, including the European Union and China, have said such tariffs could lead to retaliatory action and trigger a global trade war, hurting economic growth and oil consumption.
A rise in U.S. crude inventories has also dented sentiment, even though it is typical for oil stocks to rise at this time of year as refineries frequently close for maintenance.
Crude inventories rose by 5.661 million barrels last week to 426.880 million barrels, data from the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday.
Official data by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due on Wednesday.
The EIA has again revised upwards its projections for U.S. oil production, which it now expects to rise by more than 120,000 bpd to 11.17 million bpd by the fourth quarter of 2018.
This would make it a bigger producer than Russia, now ranked No. 1. Last year, the United States surpassed Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

For 2019, the EIA forecast U.S. crude production increase of 570,000 bpd to 11.27 million bpd.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An international project to build a nuclear fusion reactor in France that would start generating electricity in 17 years will face delays if Trump administration cuts are not reversed in a few months, the head of the venture said on Tuesday.
Bernard Bigot, director-general of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project, or ITER, said the administration's budget cuts would reduce the U.S. contribution to the project and lead to construction delays.
""It's not a question of capability, it's a question of political will,"" Bigot said in a telephone interview while he was in Washington to meet with U.S. officials.
The Energy Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
ITER, launched 10 years ago by seven partners: the European Union, the United States, China, India, Japan, Russia and South Korea, would generate electricity from a process similar to the nuclear fusion that powers the sun. 
Conventional reactors split atoms to generate power and create poisonous nuclear waste, for which there is no permanent disposal site in the United States. 
The cost of the experimental project, which its partners hope will reach its first full-power fusion by 2035 is $21 billion to $26 billion. 
The United States has given about $1 billion to ITER so far, and had been planning to contribute an additional $500 million through 2025. 
But with U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed budget cuts, Washington's contribution for 2019 would drop to $75 million from $165 million. Last year, the administration cut the 2018 U.S. contribution to $63 million from a planned $120 million. 
Bigot said he told officials from the Energy Department, the White House's office of science and technology policy and the State Department, that the project will face delays unless Washington promises by June to fund the original amounts. 
If the United States, which provides 9 percent of ITER's funding, does not contribute the planned tens of millions of dollars on time, contracts for assembling large parts of the project will be delayed, he said.

In December Shaylyn Hynes, an energy department spokeswoman, said that the administration is reviewing civilian nuclear policy, including research and development, which will influence its policy toward ITER going forward.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for April delivery rose 3 cents to settle at $62.60 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 27 cents to trade at $65.82 a barrel. WTI Crude futures traded hit a session high of $63.27 a barrel before paring gains.
With refiners undergoing seasonal maintenance, refinery activity is expected to have slowed, lowering demand for crude while raising the prospect of a build in supplies. Investors expect the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday to report US crude inventories rose by about 2.7 million barrels last week.
Also adding to negative sentiment was expectations that US production would continue to increase after the EIA in its previous report said domestic crude production to rose 10.3 million barrels per day. A level that keeps the US's standing as the world’s second largest oil producer behind Russia, and supports International Energy Agency’s claim Monday that US shale production is set to soar for the next five years.
“The United States is set to put its stamp on global oil markets for the next five years,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, in a statement. He added that the IEA could revive its estimate for US output upward should oil prices remain above $60.
Rising US production has been one major concerns threatening to derail major oil producers’ efforts to rebalance oil markets and reduce oil inventories in the OECD countries to the five-year average.
Fears over growing domestic crude stockpiles comes a day after crude prices rose sharply on reports that crude stockpiles declined at the cushing storage hub in Oklahoma.
Inventories at the key U.S. hub – already at the lowest since 2014 – are expected to continue as producers opt to sell rather than store crude as current prices continue to trade at a premium to forward prices – a market structure known as backwardation. The added inventive to sell rather than store crude could help offset the expected build in crude inventories."

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the first weeks after President Donald Trump's latest travel ban was implemented on Dec. 8, around 100 waivers were granted to thousands of applicants for U.S. visas from the eight countries subject to its restrictions, according to State Department data provided to Reuters.
Between Dec, 8 and Jan. 8, more than 8,400 people applied for U.S. visas from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Somalia, Yemen and Venezuela, the countries listed in the ban.
Of those, 128 applicants qualified for visas because they fell into categories exempted from the ban, according to a letter from the State Department sent last month to U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat. Exemptions to the ban are made for lawful permanent residents of the United States and certain other categories of applicants.
The ban contains a provision that those who do not qualify for exceptions can be considered for waivers in special circumstances, such as a need for urgent medical care or to accommodate adoptions. Waivers can also be granted to those previously granted visas who want to return to employment or studies in the United States. Significant business obligations or close U.S. family ties can also be taken into consideration for a waiver.
As of Feb. 15 only two of the initial month’s applicants had been approved for the waivers, according to the letter, which was seen by Reuters. Since then, more than 100 additional waivers have been granted, the State Department told Reuters on Tuesday. It was not clear how many of those additional waivers went to applicants from the initial month.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the issue. A State Department official said the policy is being implemented as called for in the president's proclamation.
(For the text of the State Department letter to Van Hollen, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2Ficpgs)  
Van Hollen, along with Republican Senator Jeff Flake requested information about visas from the State Department in late January, saying in a letter to the agency and the Department of Homeland Security that they had ""received reports of the near uniform denial of waivers for visas.""
""The Trump administration claims that the waiver system can be used by people who pose no threat to our country.... But these facts show that system is a farce designed to hide President Trump's true purpose,"" Van Hollen said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday. ""Appellate courts have found that this is a de facto Muslim ban in violation of our Constitution and our immigration laws, and this high refusal rate bears that out.""
Six of the eight countries included in the ban are majority Muslim. The Trump administration has said the travel ban is needed to protect U.S. residents from terrorism.
Courts struck down the first two versions of the Republican president's travel ban, and the current one is narrower in scope than its predecessors. The Supreme Court will consider its legality this spring, and a decision is expected in June. 
Many visa applications from the eight countries were denied even before the travel ban. And since it took effect, more than 1,700 of the 8,400 visa applications were denied for reasons other than the travel ban, according to the State Department's data.
Exact comparisons with previous years are not possible, because data is not available for all types of visa applications. But for the 2016 federal fiscal year, State Department data shows that applicants from the eight countries were refused tourist and business visas, called B visas, at rates of between 15 percent and 64 percent, depending on the country. North Koreans had the lowest rate of denials, while Somalis had the highest. In the first month after the travel ban took effect, more than 95 percent of U.S. visa applications from the countries were denied. 
Attorneys representing applicants abroad who were turned down for visas say consular officials have not clearly explained why their clients did not qualify for waivers.
    ""There is a feeling of extreme frustration. People are operating basically in the blind,"" said Diala Shamas, an attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, a New York-based nonprofit group that assists Yemeni applicants waiting for visas at the U.S. embassy in Djibouti. ""An outsider might think that the impact of the proclamation would be mitigated by the waivers, but in reality that is not at all the case.""
Trump's proclamation of a travel ban outlined three broad requirements for a visa waiver. Applicants must face undue hardship if denied a visa, the travel must be in the U.S. interest and the applicant must not pose a security risk.
For an applicant to be cleared of being a security threat, consular officers are told to consider ""the information-sharing and identity-management protocols of the applicant's country of nationality as they relate to the applicant,"" according to the letter. 
That last consideration could prove complicated for most applicants, given that the reason a country winds up on the banned list is that it does not meet U.S. standards for information sharing and identity management.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is investigating whether manufacturers in Canada, China, Greece, India, Korea and Turkey are dumping large-diameter welded pipe into U.S. markets or are being unfairly subsidized by their governments, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.
If the government makes a preliminary finding that dumping or unfair subsidies are taking place it will begin collecting cash deposits from U.S. companies importing the pipe, the department said.
The probe covers welded carbon and alloy steel pipe larger than 16 inches (406.4 mm) in diameter. The pipe is generally used to transport oil, natural gas, slurry and steam and for piling, the department said.
The U.S. investigations, part of the 94 cases President Donald Trump's administration has opened since taking office, are aimed at protecting U.S. manufacturers in global markets, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.
The Commerce Department estimated that in 2016 imports of large-diameter welded pipe from Canada had a value of $66 million, China $139 million, India $26 million, Greece $70 million, Korea $150.3 million, and Turkey $116.1 million.

(Reuters) - Oil major  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) said on Tuesday it should be able to raise production by between 4 percent and 7 percent in 2018 and buy back shares for the first time in three years even without a substantial rise in oil prices.
Chevron said it expects to sell off assets, produce more oil at higher margins and lower overall expenses, as industry-wide output climbs and prices stabilize.
The company's shares rose 2 percent to $115.45 in early trading, lifting the broader energy sector (SPNY) higher. 
San Ramon, California-based Chevron said it is budgeting capex of $18 billion to $20 billion each year for three years, slightly lower at the midpoint than a previous estimate.
""We intend to maintain capital discipline ... Even with no commodity price appreciation, we expect to deliver stronger upstream cash margins and production growth. This is a powerful combination,"" Chief Executive Michael Wirth said at an analyst day presentation.
Brent crude (LCOc1) has more than doubled since crashing to a 13-year low in 2016 in the wake of a production glut.
Chevron said high margin barrels of oil are expected to increase by more than 200 mboe/d in 2018, while Permian production is expected to reach about 500,000 barrels per day by the end of 2020 and 650,000 by the end of 2022.
The company's overall 2018 production estimate is based on oil prices at $60 a barrel and excludes asset sales, the second biggest U.S. oil producer said.
Chevron also said it expects to grow its free cash flow 2018 onwards, putting the company in a position to resume its share repurchase program.

The company halted buybacks in 2015 to save cash during the slump in oil prices.

Speaking at the CERAWeek conference in Houston, Nasser said the industry has already lost $1 trillion of investments since the oil price downturn from 2014 to 2016.
Future investments needed ""will only come if investors are convinced that oil will be allowed to compete on a level playing field, that oil is worth so much more, and that oil is here for the foreseeable future,"" Nasser said.
""That is why we must push back on the idea that the world can do without proven and reliable sources. We must challenge mistaken assumptions about the speed with which alternatives will penetrate markets.""
He noted that about 99 percent of passenger vehicles on the road use internal combustion engines, even hybrid vehicles, and said electricity produced for battery-powered vehicles comes through power generation, which is still dominated by coal, particularly in markets like India and China.
Nasser said that even with the growth of electric vehicles, increased demand from petrochemical markets over the next two decades will necessitate additional investment and need for crude oil. He noted ""even conservative estimates"" suggest the need for about 20 million barrels per day of new capacity in the next five years. 
He said he was confident that oil market fundamentals and future demand growth would be healthy, despite significant oil price volatility and forecasts of rising shale oil production. 
Nasser only briefly referenced the plans for Saudi Aramco to go public, saying it is ""proceeding very well,"" but the company's shareholder, the Saudi government, will ultimately decide when and where it will be listed. 
The company is expected to list the IPO domestically, but there is significant jockeying between New York, London and Hong Kong for a potential second listing. Hong Kong is emerging as an increasingly likely compromise, according to two sources familiar with the matter. 

The decision on the venue must be taken by March or April at latest if the IPO is to list in October or November, or it could be delayed until 2019, sources familiar with the IPO discussions have said. Nasser, speaking in Houston, did not comment specifically on the timeline.

Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London gained 25 cents or about 0.40% to $65.80 a barrel, also the highest since February 28.
Market participants were eyeing the weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute on U.S. oil supplies due later Tuesday. Official data by the U.S. Energy Information Administration was expected on Wednesday.
Oil prices found support after the International Energy Agency said on Monday that global oil demand was expected to grow in the next five years, while output from producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would rise at a much slower pace.
OPEC, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
Priced initially retreated after the IEA upwardly revised U.S. oil output growth, saying the country would be producing a total of nearly 17 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2023.

105,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",Aramco IPO venue in the balance as Saudi prince embarks on trip,"By Rania El Gamal, Alex Lawler and Yara Bayoumy
DUBAI/LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's upcoming trip to Britain and the United States could shape the decision on where to list oil giant Aramco, at a time when sources say the chances of London and New York hosting the IPO appear to be receding.
The two leading financial centers have long been the clear frontrunners to host the international leg of the flotation, alongside a Riyadh listing. 
Yet this may no longer be the case as Hong Kong is emerging as an increasingly likely compromise because Riyadh wants to help Asian nations that are expected to become ""cornerstone"" investors, including China and Japan, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
To be sure, both London and New York are still in the running, but their requirement for greater disclosure of sensitive information on Aramco than the Hong Kong exchange is viewed as a drawback by some Saudi officials and advisers, the sources said.
A final decision has yet to be made by Prince Mohammed, who oversees the kingdom's economic and oil policies, the sources said. The complexity of the listing, legal worries and conflicting recommendations of the different advisers have delayed decision-making, they added. 
Saudi Aramco said it was still reviewing its international listing options, and that no decision had been made, but declined to comment further.
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, the city's exchange operator, said: ""Hong Kong is well positioned for the listing of Aramco. We have not received any indication of how the company is likely to proceed with its international listing plan."" 
The London Stock Exchange declined to comment, while the New York Stock Exchange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Prince Mohammed will arrive in London on Wednesday for talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May and other senior ministers in his first trip to Britain since being named heir to the throne last summer. 
He is expected to travel to the United States from March 19 to the first week of April, where he will meet U.S. President Donald Trump, and make stops in New York, Boston, Houston and San Francisco among other cities.
Both May and Trump want to attract the IPO, which could be the largest in history. Senior Saudi officials, including Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, are likely to accompany the crown prince on his foreign tour. 
Britain has proposed loosening rules on listing state companies by creating a new category for such firms to accommodate Aramco. 
""The British want a strategic partner post-Brexit,"" said a third source familiar with the crown prince's trip.
In November, Trump publicly appealed for Saudi Arabia to list Aramco's shares in the United States, describing the listing as a priority for Washington.
The U.S. visit will give the Saudis a chance to discuss the IPO on a senior level, according to two separate sources familiar with the trip. 
$2 TRILLION VALUATION
Prince Mohammed has said Aramco is worth $2 trillion, meaning the listing of about 5 percent of the company could raise $100 billion.
He himself favors New York for Aramco's main foreign listing for political reasons, given the longstanding ties between Riyadh and Washington and also because it gives the company access to a larger pool of capital, the first two sources said. 
However, as well as the high disclosure requirements, the company's advisers have warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, the sources added. The law allowed lawsuits to proceed against the Saudi government claiming it had helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Riyadh denies the allegations.
In Britain, meanwhile, the moves by regulators to loosen rules on listing state companies have been met with resistance from some politicians. The head of an influential parliamentary committee said on Monday that such efforts could cost London its reputation for good corporate governance.
Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges. The IPO is the centerpiece of a Saudi economic reform plan, known as Vision 2030 and championed by Prince Mohammed, to diversify the economy beyond oil.
But the IPO plan has caused misgivings among some Saudi officials and Aramco employees who believe Riyadh is relinquishing its crown jewels to foreigners and would like the whole idea to be shelved, sources have previously said.
Bankers and analysts say Riyadh needs to list Aramco on either New York or London to show it is serious about its economic reforms and a willingness to attract foreign investment after an anti-corruption crackdown last November that led to the detention of several businessmen unnerved some investors. 
""If the Aramco deal is going to have any credibility a listing on either New York or London has to happen,"" said a senior Gulf-based banker familiar with the IPO process. 
""Anything else will not cut it for international investors, in terms of transparency and corporate governance.""

The decision on the listing venue must be taken by March or April at latest if the IPO is to be carried out in October or November, otherwise it could be delayed until 2019, sources familiar with the IPO discussions have said.

Comex gold futures were up 0.81% at $1,333.6 a troy ounce by 08:30 a.m. ET (12:30 GMT).
Investors remained cautious as U.S. President Donald Trump faced growing pressure to pull back from proposed steel and aluminium tariffs.
Trump reacted by stepping up pressure on Mexico and Canada, saying he would lift planned tariffs on steel imports if they signed a new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.
The tariffs, announced last week, had sparked concerns over a potential trade war, which would have a negative impact on the U.S. economy.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.41% at 89.58, the lowest since February 26.
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Markets were also jittery amid concerns over Sunday’s inconclusive Italian election results.
With no party winning an outright majority, Italy is likely to be plunged into a period of political instability, which could stall progress on economic reforms in the euro zone’s third-largest economy.

Front-month U.S. natural gas futures tacked on 2.4 cents, or around 0.9%, to $2.728 per million British thermal units (btu) by 8:20AM ET (1320GMT). It rose to its best level since Feb. 7 at $2.735 earlier in the session.
The commodity notched a small gain of around 0.3% on Monday, as updated weather forecasting models showed colder weather lingering over the eastern U.S. through mid-March.
Despite recent gains, market experts warned that futures are likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term as the coldest part of the winter has effectively passed.
Natural gas prices are down nearly 25% since late January amid speculation the end of the winter heating season will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for the fuel.
Spring usually sees the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 54 and 68 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended March 2.
That compares with a decline of 78 bcf in the preceding week, a drop of 68 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average fall of 129 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 1.682 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
That figure is 680 bcf, or around 28.8%, lower than levels at this time a year ago, and 372 bcf, or roughly 18.1%, below the five-year average for this time of year.

Crude Oil WTI Futures for April delivery were trading at $62.63 a barrel in Asia at 10:45pm ET, up 0.10%. Brent crude futures for May delivery, traded in London, were up 0.06% at $65.60 per barrel.
Prices were supported by bullish comments from ministers from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other industry players at the CERAWeek conference in Houston on Monday, the largest energy industry conference.
Prospects for strong compliance with the OPEC agreement to cut oil production have propped up oil prices.
In an effort to clear the global oversupply of oil, OPEC has been reducing output by around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) since January 2017, with output falling to a 10-month low in February 2018. The pact will run through the end of this year.
OPEC President Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouel, who is also the oil minister of the United Arab Emirates, said on Sunday that OPEC has not discussed extending production cuts into 2019.
Meanwhile, surging shale oil production in the U.S. has taken market share from OPEC producers. The U.S. has already risen past top exporter Saudi Arabia, and is set to overtake Russia as the world’s largest oil producer by 2019 at the latest. Once the world’s top oil importer, the U.S. has increased its oil output to over 10 million bpd and is moving closer to self-sufficiency.
This month, the number of oil rigs drilling for new production in the U.S. rose to 800 for the first time since April 2015, pointing to more increases in output to come.
The International Energy Agency said on Monday that it expected annual global oil demand growth to average a fairly strong 1.1 percent to 2023."

SEOUL (Reuters) - Oil futures rose on Tuesday for a third session, underpinned by robust demand forecasts and as ministers from OPEC touted the strength of its agreement to cut output to bolster prices.
International benchmark Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at$65.67 per barrel at 0743 GMT, up 8 cents, or 0.12 percent.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $62.68 a barrel, up 11 cents, or 0.18 percent. 
The International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Monday that global oil demand was expected to grow over the next five years, while output from producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would rise at a much slower pace.
The IEA's comments on increased demand, made during the CERAWeek conference in Houston on Monday, preceded statements from OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo that called the supply cut agreement with global producers ""as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar"".
""Oil was higher ... as the prospects for increased demand and a little bit of jawboning at the CERAWeek conference helped,"" Greg Mckenna, chief market strategist at AxiTrader, said in a note.
To fill the gap between OPEC and global demand, the IEA said the United States would supply much of the oil demand as its shale oil production was set to surge. 
U.S. crude production has risen to more than 10 million barrels per day (bpd), overtaking top exporter Saudi Arabia. Output hit a record 10.057 million bpd in November, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
BMI Research said in a note to clients on Tuesday that it had revised its 2018 Brent crude price forecast upward to $67 a barrel due to ""accelerated market rebalancing and strong sentiment-driven support"". 
""We maintain that firming global demand and weaker supply growth will support crude prices over 2018,"" the note added.
Meanwhile, Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, said traders were waiting for U.S. crude inventories data.
""Expectations are for a further build - with an estimate of a build of around 2-1/2 million barrels ... so if anything, that would expect to add pressure on oil prices,"" McCarthy said.
U.S. crude inventories were expected to rise by 3 million barrels in the week to March 2, marking a second straight week increase, according to a Reuters poll.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for March delivery rose 2.16% to settle at $62.57 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 1.9% to trade at $62.43 a barrel.
Crude futures clawed back some of their losses suffered last week after a report from energy provider Genscape showed crude stockpiles declined at the cushing storage hub in Oklahoma.
Inventories at the key U.S. hub – already at the lowest since 2014 – are expected to continue to drop as producers opt to sell rather than store crude as current prices continue to trade at a premium to forward prices – a market structure known as backwardation.
That helped offset, comments from the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggesting that US shale output is set to surge over the next five years.
“The United States is set to put its stamp on global oil markets for the next five years,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, in a statement. He added that the IEA could revive its estimate for US output upward should oil prices remain above $60.

114,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 03:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chevron in talks to sell stake in Canada LNG project - sources,"By John Tilak, Ernest Scheyder and David French
TORONTO/HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) is exploring options including the sale of a minority stake in its Canadian liquefied natural gas (LNG) project as it pushes ahead, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Among the parties in talks with Chevron for a possible stake in Kitimat LNG are Petroliam Nasional Bhd (PETR.UL), or Petronas, which scrapped its own $36 billion LNG project in British Columbia last year due to challenging market conditions, two of the people said. 
Reuters spoke over the past week to the sources, who said there is no certainty that Chevron would proceed with the stake sale. The persons spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is private.
Chevron declined to comment, and Petronas did not respond to a request for comment.
Chevron is also considering selling a stake in the project to a financial investor such as a Canadian pension fund or a private equity firm, the people added.
Canadian companies  Seven Generations Energy Ltd  (TO:VII) and  Tourmaline Oil Corp  (TO:TOU) are in discussions to supply natural gas to Chevron's project, the people said. Seven Generations may also consider buying a stake in the project by partnering with other gas producers, the people said.
While any possible deal with a financial investor would be strictly a cash infusion to help support the cost of building the project, a deal with a producer could be structured as a commitment to supply natural gas to the plant for a period of 20 to 25 years, the people said.
Canadian pension funds have a huge appetite for infrastructure-style assets that offer stable cash flows over a long period, and pipeline investments tend to have those attributes.
The project in British Columbia, a 50/50 joint venture with Australia's Woodside Petroleum Ltd (AX:WPL), has a 20-year, 10 million-metric-tonne-per-year export license for LNG and is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars to build.
Kitimat could become one of the largest capital investments in a Canadian energy project, Chevron says on its website.
Taking such a substantial investment decision has been difficult for the duo, given concerns over a global LNG supply glut for the last three years. Fierce political opposition in Western Canada to building pipelines and other energy infrastructure has also escalated in the last several years.
However, surging gas demand from China and Southeast Asia is reassuring export project developers that the market cycle is finally beginning to turn.
Seven Generations declined to comment, and Tourmaline did not respond to a request for comment.
Located about 1,400 kilometers north of Vancouver, the Kitimat project was earmarked to utilize shale gas extracted in the northern part of British Columbia and export LNG to energy-hungry markets in Asia.

San Ramon, California-based Chevron acquired its 50 percent stake in Kitimat in early 2013 from EOG Resources Inc (N:EOG) and  Encana  Corp (TO:ECA).

116,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",How unstable is Libya's oil production?,"By Aidan Lewis
TUNIS (Reuters) - Two of Libya's largest oilfields with combined production of nearly 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) have suffered shutdowns in quick succession, casting fresh doubt on a partial recovery in the OPEC member's oil output.
Libya's national output has been sustained at about one million bpd for months, and most recent closures have been quickly resolved. A shutdown that began on Sunday at El Sharara, Libya's biggest field, lasted less than 24 hours.
(For a graphic on Libya's oil facilities click http://tmsnrt.rs/2b9ZdLO) 
But the latest disruptions - caused by guards at El Feel field complaining about pay and benefits, and by a property owner who said he wanted rubbish cleared from his land - highlight continuing risks to output in a country without centralized security forces or political control. 
WHAT IS LIBYA'S POTENTIAL?
Libya has the largest proven reserves of oil in Africa, and has been a key supplier of light, sweet crude to Europe. 
Around 1970 it produced more than 3 million bpd, and before the NATO-backed uprising in which Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed seven years ago, it was pumping more than 1.6 million bpd.
Last year the state-owned National Oil Corporation (NOC) outlined plans that would raise production to 2.2 million bpd by 2023, but said this would need around $18 billion of investment.
Foreign oil companies including Italy's Eni (MI:ENI),  Total  (PA:TOTF) of France and U.S. firms ConocoPhillips (N:COP) and Hess (N:HES) have production stakes through joint ventures with the NOC.
WHY DID OUTPUT DROP AFTER 2011?
Since Libya's 2011 uprising, power in the sparsely populated nation has fragmented and local groups have used oil facilities as bargaining chips to press financial and political demands.
Armed factions across the country have cut off production at key fields and ports, including a long blockade of terminals in Libya's eastern oil crescent from 2014-2016. Prolonged and haphazard shutdowns have reduced pressure at oil wells.
As Libya's revenue fell due to production disruptions and lower oil prices, demands for salaries, local development and jobs that feed into blockades became more widespread.
Islamic State militants attacked oilfields and ports in 2015-2016 before being driven back by local forces. Their destruction of storage tanks at two of Libya's biggest terminals, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, has yet to be repaired. Fields including Mabruk and Ghani remain closed. 
After disputed elections in 2014 led to rival governments being set up in Tripoli and the east, eastern-based factions tried to sell oil independently. They failed, but the split added to uncertainty in Libya's oil sector.
WHAT ARE THE CURRENT RISKS?
The causes of recent shutdowns include economic protests by guards, armed groups pushing for the release of jailed members, and apparent political maneuvering in the east.
Sometimes shutdowns are triggered in remote fields or at terminals, sometimes by people with access to gearboxes that control pipeline valves. Production at the key Sharara field has repeatedly been cut on the long pipeline leading to the coast by groups near Zintan, a western town that became militarily powerful in the 2011 uprising.
The internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, which lacks authority over armed groups even in the capital, often has little means of ending blockades. 
Oil installations are meant to be protected by the Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG). But as with other parts of Libya's security forces, their official status is effectively self-declared and their actions are governed by local interests rather than any central authority.
Even as longer blockades ended from mid-2016, financial constraints have been an underlying drag on Libya's production rebound. The NOC has had rocky relations with the GNA, and has complained repeatedly that budget allocations have been held up. The GNA says its own resources are limited. 
A bigger political risk also looms. Factions in the east, where most of Libya's oil wealth is located, are opposed to the GNA and say it has not disbursed sufficient oil income to eastern regions. Some eastern hardliners have threatened to cut oil production although for now the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), which has good relations with the NOC in Tripoli, has kept fields and ports open. 
Security is still volatile. In December an explosion at a pipeline in eastern Libya caused an outage of up to 100,000 bpd, though it was quickly repaired. International companies are working offshore but still have a limited presence onshore, keeping exploration and development programs mostly on hold. 
WHAT ABOUT OPEC?
Along with Nigeria, Libya has been exempted from OPEC-led production cuts that seek to bolster crude prices and have been extended until the end of 2018.

Despite speculation that the two troubled nations would be pressured into joining the output-curbing deal, both have signaled their intention to raise production.

The opposition has been calculating inflation and GDP in the absence of up-to-date official data for the socialist-run economy that has been contracting since early 2014. 
""The economy is being destroyed,"" said opposition lawmaker and economist Jose Guerra at a presentation of the figures at the opposition-controlled National Assembly.
The data uses oil industry activity, vehicle assembly, bank loans and tax collection to gauge overall economic performance.

President Nicolas Maduro alleges an ""economic war"" by political foes and the United States. 
The slump in global oil prices since 2014 has also hit hard.
The central bank did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Monday's figures from the opposition. 
The bank has not released Venezuela's gross domestic product data since 2015, when the economic activity fell 6.2 percent.
But in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Venezuela's government last year acknowledged its economy had shrunk 16.5 percent in 2016.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude April contract was up 42 cents or about 0.69% at $61.66 a barrel by 10:20 a.m. ET (14:20 GMT), off Friday's two-and-a-half week lows of $60.13.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rose 27 cents or about 0.42% to $64.64 a barrel, after hitting a two-week trough of $63.20 on Thursday.
Oil prices pulled back from session highs after the International Energy Agency on Monday upwardly revised U.S. oil output growth, saying the country would be producing a total of nearly 17 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2023.
U.S. crude oil production has already surpassed that of top exporter Saudi Arabia to 10.28 million bpd.
Rising U.S. output has weighed on oil prices in recent months amid fears it could dampen global efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
But prices were still supported as market participants were eyeing an upcoming meeting between OPEC oil ministers and U.S. shale firms scheduled later Monday in Houston for the largest energy industry conference, CERAWeek.

Comex gold futures were little changed at $1,324.1 a troy ounce by 08:25 a.m. ET (12:25 GMT), the highest since February 27.
Risk sentiment weakened after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans on Thursday to impose tariffs of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum, in a move to “protect U.S. industry”.
The move sparked concerns over a potential trade war, which would have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, sending the greenback broadly lower.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was also steady at 90.00, after falling to 89.83 on Friday.
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that he would impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent levy on imported aluminum to protect U.S. producers, risking retaliation from major trade partners like China, Europe and neighboring Canada.
""We want Trump to abandon the plan,"" Yoshihisa Tabata, executive director of the Japan Aluminium Association told Reuters on Monday by phone.
""The U.S. is the second-biggest exporting market after China for Japanese aluminum producers and the high duties will directly impact on their business,"" he said.
Japan, which produced 2.07 million tonnes of rolled and extruded aluminum in 2017, exported about 27,000 tonnes to the U.S. out of total exports of about 243,000 tonnes.
""If the new tariffs were slapped, low-end commodities among Japanese aluminum products will be quickly replaced by U.S.-made products although high-end aluminum may take a while to be switched,"" he said.
The tariffs are expected to cause higher volatility in metal prices and in the premiums that are paid by buyers on top of exchange prices to cover insurance and the cost of delivery, he said.
""Producers and buyers will have to face unexpected changes in aluminum prices and premiums going forward,"" he said.
The Aluminium Association had previously expressed concerns about potential U.S. tariffs, with Mitsuru Okada, the head of the association, saying last July that any U.S. trade action to curb imports may result in surplus supply elsewhere and prompt a chain-reaction of retaliation by other nations.
Tabata echoed those concerns again on Monday.
""If the U.S. tariffs prompt retaliation from other countries and triggers a trade war, aluminum output will eventually shrink as producers will be making products only to meet local demand,"" Tabata said.
""That would be a nightmare.""

HOUSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. shale oil output is set to surge over the next five years, stealing market share from OPEC producers and moving the United States, once the world's top oil importer, closer to self sufficiency, the International Energy Agency said on Monday.
A landmark deal in 2017 between OPEC and rivals including Russia to curb output to reduce global oversupply improved the outlook for other producers as prices rose sharply throughout the year, the IEA said in Oil 2018, an annual report looking at the next five years.
With U.S. supply surging, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will see demand for its crude fall below current production in 2019 and 2020, the report forecast, suggesting a return to oversupply if OPEC output keeps steady.
U.S. oil output hit a record late last year, and is expected to rise by 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd) to 12.1 million bpd by 2023, as growth from shale fields more than offsets declines in conventional supply. 
Last year, the IEA forecast U.S. shale production to grow by 1.4 million bpd by 2022 with oil prices of up to $60 a barrel and by up to 3 million barrels with oil at $80 a barrel.
Natural gas liquids will add another 1 million bpd to U.S. supply to reach 4.7 million bpd by 2023. 
""The United States is set to put its stamp on global oil markets for the next five years,"" said Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director, in a statement. 
Birol, speaking at a media briefing at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, said U.S. output forecasts could be revised upward if oil remains above $60 a barrel.
He said he expects shale output to keep rising, regardless of OPEC policies, and said OPEC and other established oil producers need to reconsider their future growth plans in light of ""huge growth"" from U.S. shale.
He also said he expects U.S. export capacity to double over the next five years. 
With total U.S. liquids production set to reach nearly 17 million bpd in 2023, up from 13.2 million in 2017, the United States will be by far the world's top oil liquids producer.
Oil production growth from the United States, Brazil, Canada and Norway will more than meet global oil demand growth through 2020, the IEA said, adding that more investment would be needed to boost output after that.
Non-OPEC production is set to rise by 5.2 million bpd by 2023 to 63.3 million bpd with the United States alone accounting for nearly 60 percent of global supply growth. 
Production in 2017 rose by 670,000 bpd as drillers added 200 rigs, ""beating all expectations"", the IEA said.
OPEC STRUGGLES
Output from OPEC producers will grow at a much slower pace, the IEA said, adding it expected Venezuelan production declines to accelerate, offsetting gains in Iraq. Birol said Venezuela's production outlook may need to be cut in coming years as well.
As a result, OPEC's crude oil capacity will grow by just 750,000 bpd by 2023, the IEA said.
With shale and other non-OPEC supply rising, demand for OPEC crude plus withdrawals from inventories will average 31.8 million bpd in 2019, the IEA said, 1.8 million bpd less than its last medium-term forecast. 
This is lower than demand of 32.3 million bpd expected in 2018 and below the IEA's latest estimate of OPEC's production of 32.16 million bpd.
With forecast capacity of 36.3 million bpd, OPEC will be supplying less than 35 percent of global demand by 2023 compared to its historic share around 40 percent.
Boosted by economic growth in Asia and a resurgent U.S. petrochemicals industry, global oil demand will increase by 6.9 million bpd by 2023 to 104.7 million, according to the IEA. 
Despite steep non-OPEC oil production gains, the IEA warned that a decline in mature fields meant more investment was needed across the globe after 2020.

""Upstream investment shows little sign of recovering from its plunge in 2015-2016, which raises concerns about whether adequate supply will be available to offset natural field declines and meet robust demand growth after 2020,"" it said.

127,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2018 06:50PM ET</span>","As winter curbs end, China's aluminum smelters face new reckoning","By Tom Daly and Melanie Burton
BEIJING (Reuters) - Some Chinese aluminum producers that shut smelters during a winter crackdown on pollution may not reopen this spring once output curbs are lifted, as planned new capacity by state-run companies threatens to overwhelm demand and cut into profits. 
China, the world's biggest producer of aluminum - used in aeroplanes, cars and beverage cans - ordered smelters in 28 of its smoggiest northern cities to cut output by 30 percent from mid-November to mid-March. That affected an estimated one million tonnes of annual output. 
Record stockpiles and weak aluminum prices, which are down almost 10 percent since mid-November and hovering near breakeven levels, have given smelters from Shandong to Shanxi pause as the end of winter approaches. But they also face extra competition from new, mostly state-owned smelters in regions not subject to output curbs. 
Some 3 million-4 million tonnes of new capacity is set to come on line this year, or about 10 percent of the country's current output, according to a survey of analysts. 
That's roughly equivalent to adding the production capacity of Russia's Rusal (HK:0486), the world's second-biggest aluminum producer, to a bloated Chinese market whose overcapacity has riled the United States. 
That means squeezing out small, private companies. 
China's state-owned producers ""are going to become bigger and bigger and probably more powerful in the industry,"" said Jackie Wang, an analyst at CRU, a commodities consultancy. 
A limited restart may boost Chinese efforts to eliminate excess capacity via supply-side reform, which will be one of the main themes of the annual meeting of the National People's Congress, China's parliament, which starts Monday. 
But the new capacity, which far exceeds the amount cut over the winter, is also likely to send shivers across the global market and add pressure to international prices. 
(China's aluminum market: http://reut.rs/2Fju6eq) 
(China's aluminum output: http://reut.rs/2Fglwgv) 
BREAKEVEN 
Overseas alumina traders report a dearth of buying from Chinese smelters this year, suggesting no major restocking drive is underway. 
A source at a medium-sized smelter in Henan province said his company will ""not necessarily"" switch its units back on. Doing so depends on whether the local government will sanction such a move, the source said, adding that the restarting process is lengthy. It is also expensive, analysts say. 
Most Chinese smelters lose money when prices are as low as 14,000 yuan ($2,206) per tonne and will have to assess whether restarting is worthwhile, Wen Xianjun, vice president of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, told Reuters. 
""Unless you see a drastic decrease in the coal price and the anode price, their margins are not coming back, so there's not a lot of reason to restart,"" said Victor You, an analyst at CLSA, referring to carbon anode, used to conduct electricity in the smelting process. 
Not everyone is so cautious. 
A source at Xinfa Group, China's second-biggest private smelter, said it would restore full production in Shandong from March 15 after cutting around 380,000 tonnes for winter. 
At 14,000 yuan a tonne, ""we can still have enough to eat,” the source said, but added: ""maybe others will go hungry"". Xinfa did not respond to a request for comment. 
STATE-RUN SMELTERS REAP REWARDS 
Paul Adkins, managing director of the consultancy AZ China, estimated that 4.4 million tonnes of new capacity would be completed this year, most from state-run companies. Aluminum prices and power costs may limit the increase to 3 million tonnes, he told a Reuters global metals forum last month. 
State-run companies expanding production include Aluminum Corp of China Ltd (SS:601600), known as Chalco. The company said last year that it would boost output in 2018 as it brought on new capacity but did not disclose the size of the increase. 
Yunnan Aluminum (SZ:000807) is also due to build plants in its home province and Baise Mining Group is adding new capacity in Guangxi. The companies did not respond to requests for comment.
There were already signs of a ramp-up in December, when China's aluminum output defied the winter cuts to reach its highest since June. 
CRU's Wang, who expects 2.8 million tonnes of new capacity this year, says much of that will come from regions such as Guangxi, Guizhou and Inner Mongolia. 
Inner Mongolia is close to coal resources, so will enjoy favorable electricity costs, and is not far from key consumption markets in the east of the country, she said. Guangxi, meanwhile, has abundant alumina. All three regions were exempt from winter cuts. 

The new smelters' production costs ""should be lower than the very old ones, especially for the SOEs,"" which are trying to reduce costs and make profit, Wang said.

128,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 04, 2018 06:53AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices - Weekly Outlook: March 5 - 9,"Investing.com - Oil prices finished higher on Friday, but still suffered their first losing week in three as investors weighed indications of rising U.S. production against OPEC's ongoing efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for April delivery tacked on 26 cents, or around 0.4%, to close at $61.25 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark spent most of the session lower, falling to an intraday low of $60.13, a level not seen since Feb. 15.
Meanwhile, May Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., advanced 54 cents, or roughly 0.8%, to settle at $64.37 a barrel. It hit a two-week low of $63.19 on Thursday.
Oil saw weakness in early action, attributed in part to President Donald Trump’s announcement Thursday that he would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, stoking fears of a global trade war. But a weak dollar and a mild recovery in U.S. equities on Wall Street saw the commodity move into positive territory later in the session.
Despite Friday's bounce, WTI crude declined 3.6% for the week, while Brent lost 4%, as investors continued to fret over soaring U.S. output levels.
The number of oil drilling rigs rose by one to 800 last week, their highest in nearly three years,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. That marked a sixth straight week of increases, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
That came after data on Wednesday showed U.S. oil production, driven by shale extraction, rose to an all-time high of 10.28 million barrels per day (bpd), staying above Saudi Arabia's output levels and within reach of Russia, the world's biggest crude producer.
Analysts and traders have recently warned that booming U.S. shale oil production could potentially derail OPEC's effort to end a supply glut.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, have been restraining production by 1.8 million bpd to curb the market of excess supply. The arrangement, which was adopted last winter, expires at the end of 2018.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer and how fast output levels will continue to rise.
The annual CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, Texas commencing on Monday will also grab some attention. The week-long event, organized by IHS Markit, will see energy ministers from around the world meet with Big Oil executives.
A dinner between OPEC officials and U.S. shale executives on Monday night in Houston will be in focus.

Gold prices had hit a low of $1,303.60 on Thursday, the weakest level since December 29 amid expectations for faster hikes in U.S. interest rates this year.
Expectations for higher interest rates are typically bearish for gold as the precious metal struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets such as Treasury’s when borrowing costs rise.
Elsewhere in precious metals trading, silver settled up 1.53% at $16.52 a troy ounce, trimming the week’s losses to 0.51%.

""There will be new anti-pollution plans. Those can be challenged in court... By the time everything is decided it will be 2020,"" Rheinische Post newspaper quoted Wuest as saying in an interview published on Saturday.
By that time, a package of measures will have further reduced the levels of toxic nitrogen oxide in the air, he said.
""Bans are avoidable"" in North Rhine-Westphalia, he added.

A federal court ruled on Tuesday that German cities can ban the most heavily polluting diesel cars from their streets, a move that could accelerate a shift away from the combustion engine and force manufacturers to pay to improve exhaust systems.

MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - Russia's Energy Ministry said on Saturday that gas giant Gazprom's intention to terminate contracts with Ukraine poses no immediate threat to natural gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine.
The issue of gas transit has intensified after the Russian group said on Friday it would end the contracts after a Stockholm arbitration court ordered it to pay more than $2.5 billion to Ukrainian energy firm Naftogaz.
Gazprom (MM:GAZP) said on Saturday it had started moves to terminate gas supply contracts with Naftogaz, though Kiev said there had so far been no impact on supplies through its pipelines to Europe.
Gazprom's announcement marked an escalation in a long-running dispute between Moscow and Kiev, which has left Ukraine struggling to stay warm and which the EU has said could threaten gas flows across the continent.
Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak told European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcofic in a phone conversation that gas transit would not be at risk until Gazprom and Naftogaz fully terminated their agreement.
""Minister Novak assured that the gas transit from Russia to Europe is under no threat. The transit remains as reliable as in the past,"" the ministry said. 
Gazprom deputy CEO Alexander Medvedev said on Saturday the group had begun proceedings at the same court to carry out the terminations. 
""We have started the procedure of terminating contracts with Ukraine's Naftogaz,"" Medvedev said.
Ukraine's state-owned gas pipeline operator Ukrtransgaz said on Saturday it had had to take additional measures to ensure gas transit to European customers.
Ukrtransgaz spokesman Ihor Kravchyshyn said it had faced ""a critical situation"" as Russia had kept pressure at the point connecting to the Ukrainian pipeline system at a low level - at least 20 percent below that required by transit contracts.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said on Saturday Ukraine saw an increase in gas supplies from Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary, which has fully offset the impact of Gazprom's decision.

Gazprom had intended to resume gas supplies to Ukraine for the first time since late 2015 when Kiev started buying gas from Europe to try to cut its energy dependence on Moscow. But the Russian group canceled that plan on Friday.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - China delayed a U.S. request for a United Nations Security Council committee to blacklist 33 ships, 27 shipping companies, and a Taiwan man for violating international sanctions on North Korea, diplomats said on Friday.
The United States submitted the request a week ago, a move it says is ""aimed at shutting down North Korea's illicit maritime smuggling activities to obtain oil and sell coal."" 
The U.N. request coincided with the United States imposing its largest package of unilateral sanctions against North Korea on Friday, intensifying pressure on Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and missile programs.
China did not give a reason for placing a hold on the U.S. request. A hold can be lifted and is often used when a Security Council member wants more information, but sometimes it can lead to a permanent blocking of a proposed blacklisting.
The Security Council North Korea sanctions committee works on the basis of unanimity.
If agreed, the 33 ships proposed by the United States, 19 of which are North Korean vessels, would be subjected to a global port entry ban. Countries would also be required to deregister the 14 ships that are not North Korean.
The 27 proposed companies and the one individual would be subjected to an asset freeze. 
The U.N. Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, banning exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products.
In October the United States proposed eight ships for U.N. designation for smuggling banned cargo from North Korea. The committee agreed to ban four ships from ports globally, while Washington postponed a bid to blacklist the remaining four. 

In December the United States proposed 10 ships for blacklisting, the committee agreed to designate four, while diplomats said China objected listing the remaining six.

133,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>","Alaska, other oil states fight budget deficits for fiscal year 2019","By Stephanie Kelly
NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than three years after the collapse in oil prices, energy-producing states such as Alaska, Oklahoma and Louisiana continue to struggle with budget shortfalls, and fiscal 2019 is no different as lawmakers seek permanent revenue solutions. 
States that benefited from the energy boom were left reeling when prices collapsed in mid-2014, leading to a continuous scramble to make up for lost oil-related revenue.
Alaska, which depended heavily on revenues from oil activity, dealt with the sudden fiscal pressures by tapping into reserve funds and cutting spending. Some say the fiscal uncertainty surrounding the state has impacted private sector investment.
The state's proposed capital budget for fiscal 2019 is $150 million, down from nearly $2 billion in fiscal 2013, a drop of more than 90 percent. It still faces a budget deficit of $2.5 billion for next year.
""Less state funding doesn't instill a lot of confidence in private investors,"" said John MacKinnon, the executive director of the Associated General Contractors of Alaska.
As a result, employees in the state's construction industry are working fewer hours, MacKinnon said, noting that carpenters' hours were down by 20 percent in 2017 versus 2016.
The amount of money invested by public and private sources in construction projects in Alaska has decreased from $8.82 billion in 2014 to a projected $6.57 billion in 2018, according to data from the Institute of Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
And the number of Alaskans employed in the construction business statewide, excluding public and self-employed workers, has also decreased from an average of 17,075 workers in 2014 to a projected average of 14,962 in 2017, the data said.
BONDING IN THE LAST FRONTIER
Alaska has also not authorized any new General Obligation bond issuance since 2012 when voters approved of $449.9 million of debt, according to the state's Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
As of June 30, $110.35 million of that debt was unissued, the office said.
""The fiscal situation is such that taking on additional liabilities is not a smart thing to do at the moment,"" said Scott Goldsmith, professor emeritus of economics at ISER.
Barring any legislative actions, the state's constitutional budget reserve — its primary reserve account — could be empty by April 2019, said Pat Pitney, the OMB's director.
Pitney said she also feels that private investment has been pulling back from the state. 
""We have businessmen saying, 'I'm not investing in Alaska because there's uncertainty, and I'm putting my money somewhere else or I'm going to wait,'"" she said. 
BEYOND ALASKA
In Louisiana and Oklahoma, legislators also face budget deficits for the next fiscal year, having attempted to fill past shortfalls with temporary tax increases and one-time fixes, respectively.
Louisiana faces a fiscal cliff totaling roughly $1 billion because of a sunset on temporary tax increases adopted in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 and set to expire in mid-2018. The decline in the oil industry in part drove the tax increases, said Manfred Dix, an economist with the state's Office of Planning and Budget.
""We cannot depend on crude oil dramatically increasing again,"" Dix said.
Oklahoma's challenges stem from a combination of low oil prices and extensive one-time actions from the legislature, said Marcy Block, an analyst at Fitch Ratings. The state faces a deficit of about $167 million.
Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin has criticized the legislature in the past for failing to find long-term solutions to recurring deficits. 
LOWER FOR LONGER?
While oil prices have ticked up in the last half year, analysts and government employees reached by Reuters do not expect a return to their 2014 levels anytime soon — if at all. 
U.S. crude (CLc1) last clocked $61.18 per barrel, far below the more than $100 per barrel price it hit in 2014.
Credit agency S&P Global Ratings said on Tuesday that oil-producing states in 2018 should experience positive economic growth.
However, Fitch said on Jan. 25 that while oil prices and production have edged higher, states seem to be tempering their revenue and price forecasts.
""We are going to be low for a while, and they (states) need to align their budgets to that fact,"" Fitch's Block said.

134,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 02:41PM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices Snap 2-Week Winning Streak as Oil Rigs Near 3-Year Highs,"Investing.com – Crude oil prices snapped a two-week winning streak despite settling higher on Friday, as fears over rising U.S. oil output persisted after data showed the number of oil rigs rose to their highest in nearly three years.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for April delivery rose 26 cents to settle at $63.25 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 45 cents to trade at $64.28 a barrel.
The number of oil rigs operating in the US rose by one to 800, the highest level since April 2, 2015, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes.
That added to concerns that U.S. crude production may curtail major oil producers’ efforts to drain excess supply in the industry, as oil rig data often serves as an indicator of future production and demand.
Much of rebound in oil prices seen Friday was said to be on dollar weakness, while the underlying sentiment on oil prices remained bearish as Energy Information Administration (EIA) data Wednesday showed U.S. stockpiles of crude continued to build for the second-straight week.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by 3.019 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 23, exceeding expectations for a rise of 2.4 million barrels. Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – rose by 2.483 million barrels, confounding expectations for a decline of 190,000 barrels.
Also adding to negative sentiment was an ongoing uptick in U.S. crude production to 10.3 million barrels per day. That strengthened the U.S.’s position as the world’s second largest oil producer, as it closes in on leader Russia, fuelling investor fears that rebalancing in oil markets could face headwinds.
Money managers have turned bearish on oil prices, reducing their WTI net-long position – the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a drop – for a second week in the period ended Feb. 23, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. "
135,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>","After months without contact, Merkel eyes 'reset' with Trump","By Noah Barkin 
BERLIN (Reuters) - Before a phone conversation this week to discuss the war in Syria and Russian nuclear arms, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President Donald Trump had not spoken to each other in over five months.
That gap, described by diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic as shockingly long, underscores the challenge Merkel faces if she succeeds in forming a coalition government later this month and, as German officials suggest, tries to reset the relationship with Trump.
A strong believer in close transatlantic ties, Merkel was the go-to leader in Europe for both Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush when Washington and Berlin were navigating the global financial crisis, Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and Iran's nuclear programme.
But her relationship with Trump got off to a frosty start and has never recovered.
At a time of rising transatlantic tensions over trade, the Iran nuclear deal and NATO defence spending, some German officials and analysts worry the personal divide between the brash, impulsive president and cautious, analytical chancellor could lead to a further deterioration in bilateral ties.
Jan Techau, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think tank in Berlin, described the five month gap in contact between the leaders before Thursday's phone conversation as a ""very very bad sign"". He saw no connection with the conservative chancellor's struggle to form a new government more than five months after federal elections.
""I don't think it has anything to do with the political limbo in Germany. It is a sign of a relationship where there is no trust,"" Techau said. ""If you don't have a personal relationship between the leaders to fall back on, it can be very difficult to stop the downward spiral.""
Juergen Hardt, a senior lawmaker in Merkel's Christian Democrat party, said: ""Especially in times of stress, when immediate communication is required, they need to be able to pick up the phone and find solutions. There needs to be a good personal relationship and a good working relationship.""
MACRON
German government officials play down the prolonged ""radio silence"" between Merkel and Trump, noting that the chancellor has ratcheted back her contacts with many foreign leaders during the months of arduous coalition talks at home.
They say the dialogue between Germany and the United States at lower levels of the government remains strong. 
Some question whether any foreign leader can influence Trump, who shocked his European allies again on Thursday by announcing plans to introduce hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, sending financial markets reeling on fears of a trade war. [nL2N1QK0GY]
""Germany needs to make up for the vacuum at the top level by engaging on other levels, with Congress, with the states and with civil society,"" said Thomas Matussek, a former German ambassador to the United Nations and Britain.
Still, the contrast between Merkel's icy start with Trump and the rapport that French President Emmanuel Macron has developed with the American president is stark.
Macron has gone out of his way to woo Trump with a mix of machismo and flattery. The two engaged in a macho handshake contest when they first met last May. Two months later, Macron hosted Trump at Bastille Day celebrations in Paris, dining with him in the Eiffel Tower.
Next month Macron will travel to Washington for the first official state visit by a foreign leader since Trump became president early last year.
Over the past five months, Macron and Trump have spoken by phone seven times, according to the Elysee. Over the same span, British Prime Minister Theresa May has spoken with Trump four times, according to Downing Street.
U.S. and German officials confirmed to Reuters that before Thursday, Merkel had not spoken with Trump since Sept. 28. She often spoke with Obama and Bush on a weekly basis, according to German officials, who could not recall a gap of more than a month with Trump's two predecessors.
PUBLIC OPINION
A French official close to Macron rejected the notion that the French president and Merkel were engaged in a coordinated ""good cop, bad cop"" act with Trump, and noted that the chancellor had to take her more sceptical public into account.
""German public opinion towards Trump is a catastrophe. It is much more violent (than in France),"" the official said.
A poll by the Pew Research Center last year showed that just 11 percent of Germans have confidence in Trump. Another Pew poll published earlier this week showed that 56 percent of Germans view the relationship with the United States as ""bad"".
German officials still expect Merkel -- who has continued to talk with Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan during times of acute bilateral tensions -- to do her best to re-engage with Trump over the coming months.
The two will see each other at a G7 summit in Canada in June and at a NATO summit in Brussels a month later.
U.S.-German contacts may pick up if Merkel finally forms a new government. Social Democrat party members are voting on whether to endorse another four years of the 'grand coalition' with the Christian Democrats, with the result of the postal ballot due on Sunday.
""Once there is a new government in place all cabinet members will engage. Expect a new wave of visits from Berlin to Washington,"" one senior official said.

But German officials say there are no current plans for Merkel to return to the White House, where Trump ignored entreaties to shake her hand during a meeting in the Oval Office a year ago. And there are no plans for Trump to return to Germany following his visit to Hamburg for a G20 summit last July.

Gold futures for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $18.70, or 1.43%, to $1,323.80 a troy ounce.
Trump said Thursday the US will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminium. The U.S.’s main trading hit back as the EU was said to be considering setting duties on about $3.5 billion of U.S. imports on iconic U.S. brands including Harley Davidson, Bourbon, Blue Jeans.
That helped extend the flight-to-safety trade seen Thursday, as well-known safe havens like the yen and gold remained well supported.
Dollar-denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar – A fall in the dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency and thus, increases demand for the precious metal.
Despite the sharp upswing, gold prices were set to post their second-straight weekly loss as the yellow metal struggled to claw back losses sustained earlier this week which followed Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish comments.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures rose 1.50% to $16.52 a troy ounce, while platinum futures rose 0.97% to $967.10 an ounce.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 12:06PM ET</span>",Exclusive: EU may target $3.5 billion of U.S. imports for trade retaliation - sources,"By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering applying 25 percent tariffs on around $3.5 billion of imports from the United States if President Donald Trump carries out his plan to apply global duties to steel and aluminum, EU sources say.
The European Commission has said it would respond ""firmly"" to proposed U.S. import duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.
It has spelt out it would join others in a challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and consider safeguard measures, last deployed in 2002, to guard against steel and aluminum being diverted to Europe from elsewhere if U.S. tariffs come in.
A further counter-measure under consideration would specifically target the United States to ""rebalance"" trade between the two, EU sources say.
The U.S. tariffs would be officially brought in on grounds of national security, but the European Union says U.S. military requirements represent no more than 3 percent of U.S. production and that the measures are really a form of protectionism for U.S. manufacturers.
EU exports of steel to the United States in 2017 were worth 5.3 billion euros ($6.53 billion) and of aluminum 1.1 billion euros.
For certain grades of steel, the United States cannot show there was any increase of imports last year, the EU sources say, meaning it would not be allowed to apply safeguard measures to them. For the EU, exports of those grades amounted to 2.8 billion euros ($3.5 billion).
Assuming U.S. tariffs fully covered EU steel, the European Union would put forward 25 percent tariffs on 2.8 billion euros worth of goods from the United States.
About a third would be steel grades, another third other industrial products and a final third agricultural products.
The list of products is set to be presented next week to EU countries, whose approval would be needed.
The ""rebalancing"" would have to take place within three months.

MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - Russia's Gazprom (MM:GAZP) said on Friday it would terminate its gas contracts with Ukraine after it lost a court case, escalating a dispute which has left Ukraine struggling to stay warm and which the EU said could threaten gas flows to Europe.
A Stockholm arbitration court ordered Gazprom this week to pay more than $2.5 billion to Ukrainian energy firm Naftogaz - a ruling meant to conclude a long legal battle that has run alongside Ukraine's broader political stand-off with Russia.
But after the court decision, Gazprom did not restart gas supplies to Ukraine as expected on Thursday, forcing Kiev to take emergency measures to make up for the shortfall and warn that transit flows to Europe were at risk.
To make up for the lack of supplies from Russia, Kiev has suspended lessons at schools, universities and kindergartens until next week, switched power stations from gas to fuel oil and bought extra gas from Poland.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Gazprom had no right to suspend its contracts, and he expected them to remain in force. The moves showed that the Russian gas giant was not a reliable supplier, he said.
The threat of a supply cut to Europe comes as the continent has been hit by a record-setting cold spell, driving up demand.
In a statement, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said the court's ruling meant the company's gas deals with Ukraine would no longer be commercially viable, so it had no choice but to ask the court to terminate them.
""Gazprom had to immediately start the procedure of the termination of the contracts with Naftogaz on gas supplies and transit at the Stockholm arbitration court,"" Miller said.
Naftogaz declined immediate comment on the decision.
POKER PLAYERS
On Twitter, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin said: ""Yesterday I called Gazprom con artists, but today they are behaving like poker players and trying to raise the stakes. Only it's not clear what they're playing or with whom."" 
The row represents a new chapter in a long-running disagreement that prompted Russia to suspend gas exports to Europe, notably in the winters of 2005-2006 and 2008-2009.
European Union Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said Brussels was concerned not only about the supply of gas to Ukraine, but also about the transit of gas to the bloc.
""The Commission stands ready to steer a trilateral process which in the past has already proven to be effective in situations of disagreement,"" Sefcovic said in a statement.
Ukraine is the main route for the Russian gas to Europe where Gazprom accounts for around 35 percent of the market.
Ukraine and Russia have had a complex dispute over gas prices for years, which blew up when the two countries became enemies after a pro-Russian leader of Ukraine was toppled in 2014. Moscow responded that year by seizing Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and backing pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, where fighting has killed 10,000 people.
In one of its rulings, the Stockholm court ordered Naftogaz to buy 5 billion cubic meters of gas from Gazprom a year from 2018. The March deliveries would have been the first time Ukraine bought gas directly from Russia since November 2015, when it started buying gas from Europe via so-called ""reverse flows"", to try to cut its energy dependency on Moscow. 
Last year, Gazprom supplied a record high 194 billion cubic meters of gas to Europe, excluding former Soviet states and Turkey. Transit of Russian gas jumped by almost 14 percent to 93.5 bcm via Ukraine. 

A Gazprom spokesman did not respond to a request to comment on possible risks to the Russian gas exports to Europe.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude April contract was down 52 cents or about 0.89% at $60.44 a barrel by 10:00 a.m. ET (14:00 GMT), re-approaching Thursday's two-and-a-half week lows of $60.20.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London slid 49 cents or about 0.77% to $63.38 a barrel, close to a two-week trough of $63.20 in the previous session.
Oil prices weakened after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Wednesday that crude oil inventories rose by 3.019 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 23, exceeding expectations for a rise of 2.4 million barrels.
Fears that rising U.S. output could dampen global efforts to rid the market of excess supplies have systematically limited oil prices' gains recently.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
Market participants were also digesting news on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to impose tariffs of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum, in a move to “protect U.S. industry”.

The move sparked concerns over potential trade wars, which would have a negative impact on the U.S. economy.
The news overshadowed positive remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Powell, who told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that there was no evidence the U.S. economy is overheating.
Two days earlier, the Fed president had reiterated that the U.S. central bank would likely move forward with gradual increases in interest rates.
Separately, New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said on Thursday that four interest-rate hikes this year would constitute a ""gradual"" tightening.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.28% at 89.98, off Thursday's six-week peak of 90.89.
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

LUANDA (Reuters) - Angola has offered investors diamond exploration licenses that previously belonged to Isabel dos Santos, daughter of the former president, according to a video clip of a closed-door meeting with mining companies seen by Reuters. 
During the meeting at a mining conference in Cape Town last month, president of state diamond company Endiama, José Manuel Ganga Júnior, said the licenses had expired and were now available for new exploration partners.
Isabel dos Santos is Africa's richest woman with assets across multiple sectors in Angola and Portugal from jewelry to supermarkets. Her family has been a powerful force in Angola for four decades but her star has faded since her father, President José Eduardo dos Santos, stepped down last year. 
His successor President João Lourenço promised to tackle family monopolies and make Angola more attractive to investors. He dismissed her as chair of state oil company Sonangol, Angola's most important firm, in November. 
The licenses for primary deposits mentioned in slides accompanying the presentation, a copy of which Reuters has also seen, were for Camafuca-Camazambo, Mulepe, Sangamina, Chiri, and Tchiegi. All are located in the north-eastern diamond producing provinces of Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul.
A source in the Angolan diamond industry told Reuters the Camafuca-Camazambo and Chiri licenses had previously been in the hands of Isabel dos Santos.
Representatives for Isabel dos Santos did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""It is true that these kimberlites (a geological formation of igneous rock in which diamonds are sometimes found) we presented to promote and offer for exploration were already granted as licenses in the past, many years ago,"" Ganga Junior said in the video.
A spokesman at Endiama confirmed the video was authentic and that the licenses were offered to investors. The Ministry of Natural Resources directed questions to the state company. 
""These licenses have expired ... At this time, we don't have any commitment with any former owners of these projects,"" Ganga Junior said. 
Angola is one of the world's top 5 diamond producers, but much of the territory remains under-explored due to 27 years of civil war and a closed, difficult business environment since fighting ended in 2002. 
Lourenço took power in September and says he wants to shed Angola's image as an opaque oil economy with rampant corruption. He wants to attract international investors and has made changes to wrest power from dos Santos, pushing out some of his key allies. 
Russia's Alrosa is the only major diamond company currently producing in Angola via its stake in the Catoca mine - one of the world's largest. 
""We are ready to start from zero to negotiate in the best conditions, the best possibilities for the good of Endiama, our country and potential shareholders,"" Ganga Junior said.

""Apart from Endiama which has to be a partner by law, the rest is open.""

LONDON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - The gasps in the audience were clearly audible at the auction of Mexico's oil blocks a month ago as Royal Dutch Shell's hefty bids were announced one by one.
The size of Shell's cash payments - $343 million out of the total of $525 million that Mexico earned in the sale - far outstripped its competitors' offers, guaranteeing that the company swept up nine of the 19 offshore blocks.
The Anglo-Dutch major knew something no one else did.
Six months earlier, its drilling rig had struck a giant oil reservoir, the Whale well, in the U.S. side of the Gulf of Mexico - just across the border from many of the Mexican blocks, which share a similar Paleogene-age geology.
Calculating that this significantly increased the chances of the Mexican blocks also containing treasure, Shell delayed the announcement of the discovery until the day of the auction, after bids had been submitted.
""Post the Whale discovery we had some geological insights. It is not by accident we didn't announce it until the day of the bid,"" Andy Brown, Shell's head of oil and gas production, told Reuters. ""The nine blocks give us significant potential."" 
The geological intelligence gleaned from the Whale discovery explains why Shell (L:RDSa) bid so aggressively for the Mexican blocks, something that had confounded industry experts. 
It could also offer insight into the rationale underpinning its bet that Latin America - particularly Mexico and Brazil - will be a major source of new reserves as its current resources dwindle.
Shell, or any other explorer, is not legally obliged to publicly disclose a discovery. The fact that its first major exploration success in over 10 years came adjacent to blocks coming up for auction was a matter of good fortune, while the timing of the announcement was canny.
Shell has not yet released any estimates for the Whale's recoverable resources, but two industry sources close to the exploration project put the figure at up to 700 million barrels of oil. That equates to about half of Shell's 2017 oil production and would make the reservoir one of the biggest discoveries of the past decade in the industry.
Shell declined to comment on the potential size of the reserves.
Fossil fuels like oil are formed over millions of years in specific rock formations, which geologists and explorers try to identify via seismic studies and drilling to predict where resources might be found.
But, even though a similar geology might increase the chances of similar exploration success, there are no guarantees, and luck is always a big factor. So there is no certainty that the Mexican blocks will yield commercial volumes of oil.

NOT 'OBSESSED'
Shell acquired large amounts of specialized seismic data before the auction, about Whale and the Mexican blocks, to try to gain a better sense of the geological formations and potential oil reserves under the seabed, according to a source at an oil services company that provides such information. 
""Even for us it was surprising the way Shell bid during Mexico's deepwater auction. They really wanted the blocks close to the border, which indicates there must be a link between the formation in the U.S. and in Mexico,"" the source added. 
Shell needs to replenish its oil and gas reserves to maintain its production into the 2030s. Aside from the $54 billion acquisition of BG Group in 2016, which boosted its reserves, the company has had limited success in recent years. 
Last year, it was able to replace only 27 percent of its production, while on a three-year average, the figure was 78 percent, the company disclosed in its full-year results. The decline in reserves means that at the end of 2017 Shell had enough reserves to sustain its production for 8.9 years, compared with around 10.5 years in 2015. 
CEO Ben Van Beurden, while insisting he was not ""obsessed"" with the scale of his company's reserves, said Shell was starting to work on restocking its resources.
""We have a deepwater program that looks pretty good all the way into the next decade, but if you look at the second half of the next decade ... you will need new elements in the development funnel to sustain the cash-flow generation,"" he told reporters after the annual results announcement last month.
Shell has now given itself seven years to replenish its exploration program in order to sustain its deepwater production growth well into the 2030s, he added.
The company, like many of its peers, was forced to dramatically slash spending in recent years because of weak oil prices, with its exploration budgets hit particularly hard. Now that prices have recovered to a near three-year high of around $65 a barrel, firms feel more confident to once again invest in expensive offshore developments.
Shell owns a 60 percent stake in the Whale discovery with the remaining 40 percent held by  Chevron  (N:CVX), which is mainly shale-focused.
The reservoir is located in the Perdido area, which has become a heartland of Shell's deepwater activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 

Companies such as Shell that are eyeing Mexico's offshore are hoping to use the vast infrastructure of pipelines and rigs on the U.S. side to reduce development costs, said Andrew Latham of Edinburgh-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

MANILA/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to slap hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will likely make Southeast Asia the new hunting ground for global exporters seeking buyers, creating a glut that could depress prices and prompt some producers to close.
More of China's steel may find its way into developing countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam, but it could face competition from Russia, Ukraine and Turkey, industry officials and traders said.
Chinese aluminum exporters, which may take a similar tack, could clash with producers in South Korea and Thailand.
Trump said the duties, 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum, would be formally announced next week, and believes they will protect American jobs.
Fears of a global trade war dragged down Asian equities with shares of Asian steel producers supplying the U.S. market hit hard.
South Korea is the third-biggest steel supplier to the United States after Canada and Brazil and would be the hardest hit by the tariffs. Other Asian suppliers are Japan, Taiwan and India. 
China, the world's biggest steel producer, accounted for only about 2.9 percent of U.S. steel imports, data compiled by Wood Mackenzie showed. The world's top steel-buying nation, the United States imported a total 35.6 million tonnes last year.
Some of those Chinese products meant for the U.S. would go to Southeast Asia, said Roberto Cola, vice president of the ASEAN Iron and Steel Council.
""There will be excess supply in the region and prices will drop, which will be good for consumers,"" Cola said.
With some of the world's fastest-growing economies including the Philippines and Vietnam, Southeast Asian countries are among the world's major steel buyers with many of them having limited and costly domestic steelmaking capacity. 
Southeast Asia accounted for about a quarter of China's steel exports in 2017, Cola said.
As prices drop, China will face competition from other suppliers such as Russia, Ukraine, the Middle East and Turkey, said CRU analyst Richard Lu.
But strong domestic demand may help China absorb the excess steel, Lu said. Chinese steel shipments have dropped since hitting a record 112.4 million tonnes in 2015.
'THEY HAVE TO SHUT'
Japan and China are two of the biggest Asian exporters of aluminum to the U.S., accounting for 11 percent and 14 percent of those countries' total shipments. 
As Chinese aluminum producers look for new export markets, they could offer competition to manufacturers in South Korea Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand, while tighter margins could accelerate their plans to set up units offshore. 
""We believe the fabricators are able to divert their exports to other Asian countries if the U.S. situation plays out as they expect,"" said a source at a global trading house in Shanghai. 
China Hongqiao Group, the world's biggest aluminum producer, is already looking into the possibility of moving recently shuttered illegal smelting capacity overseas, mainly to Indonesia. 
But import duties on semi-manufactured aluminum products in some Asian countries could make it tougher for China to enter them, said a Singapore-based physical aluminum trader. 
""China has no choice, they have to shut. But ultimately U.S. consumers will have to bear the brunt of the price increase because the industry needs it. It's more about politics than aluminum,"" the trader said.
""I expect retaliatory moves from other countries,"" said Cola from the ASEAN Iron and Steel Council.
""What Trump is doing is an unprecedented move, it's going back to the old days of protectionism.""

146,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 03:51AM ET</span>","Crude Oil Prices Still Under Pressure, Near Multi-Week Lows","Investing.com - Crude oil prices were still under pressure on Friday, amid ongoing concerns over U.S. production levels and fresh worries over U.S. protectionist policies.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude April contract was down 19 cents or about 0.34% at $60.80 a barrel by 03:45 a.m. ET (07:45 GMT), just off Thursday's two-and-a-half week lows of $60.20.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London eased 6 cents or about 0.09% to $63.78 a barrel, after hitting a two-week trough of $63.20 in the previous session.
Oil prices remained under pressure after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Wednesday that crude oil inventories rose by 3.019 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 23, exceeding expectations for a rise of 2.4 million barrels.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories rose by 2.483 million barrels, confounding expectations for a decline of 190,000 barrels.
The massive build in gasoline stockpiles garnered most of the attention as some market participants had expected that a slowdown in refinery activity - as refiners enter period of maintenance - would lead to fall in gasoline supplies.
Fears that rising U.S. output could dampen global efforts to rid the market of excess supplies have systematically limited oil prices' gains recently.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
Market participants were also digesting news on Thursday that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to impose tariffs of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum, in a move to “protect U.S. industry”.
The move sparked concerns over potential trade wars, which would have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, weighing heavily on risk sentiment.

The move sparked concerns over potential trade wars, which would have a negative impact on the U.S. economy, weighing heavily on risk sentiment.
The news overshadowed positive remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Powell, who told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that there was no evidence the U.S. economy is overheating.
Two days earlier, the Fed president had reiterated that the U.S. central bank would likely move forward with gradual increases in interest rates.
Separately, New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said on Thursday that four interest-rate hikes this year would constitute a ""gradual"" tightening.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 90.24, off Thursday's six-week peak of 90.89.
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

148,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 02:04AM ET</span>","Canada's First Nations seek bigger stakes, profits from oil sector","By Rod Nickel and Nia Williams
CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada's First Nations are boosting investments and leveraging their clout with regulators to gain stakes in oil and gas projects as they seek greater returns on energy produced or transported across their territory.
Aboriginal groups in Canada have traditionally played a more passive role in the energy industry, collecting royalties from oil and gas output. That model is changing as some indigenous groups buy oil wells and negotiate ownership stakes in proposed pipelines and storage projects. 
""It's assets that create cash flow,"" said Joe Dion, Chief Executive of First Nations-owned Frog Lake Energy Resources Corp, which produces 2,000 barrels of oil per day. ""We get a piece of the action.""
First Nations, also called bands, play a pivotal role in Canada's oil industry because governments and companies have a legal duty to consult and accommodate them before proceeding with resource projects affecting their territories. The law gives bands ""pretty close to an effective veto,"" said University of Saskatchewan professor Ken Coates.
Some aboriginal groups have used that leverage to stop or delay oil projects, as when  Enbridge  Inc's (TO:ENB) proposed Northern Gateway pipeline was rejected by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in 2016 after bands raised environmental concerns. Other indigenous groups, however, are increasingly using the same power to negotiate ownership stakes in projects.
A bigger financial role for First Nations in the sector could help unlock oil and gas reserves in Canada, the world's fifth largest producer, that might otherwise stay in the ground because of objections from environmental or aboriginal rights groups.
Their experience parallels that of Native American tribes, who are also deeply split on whether and how to develop the vast resources on tribal lands. Indigenous Canadians make up about 5 percent of the nation's population and face higher levels of poverty and violence, giving bands a powerful incentive to maximize energy revenues to raise living standards.
""It's so polarized,"" said Stephen Buffalo, chief executive of the advocacy group Indian Resource Council. ""Some want to see the benefit, others think it's going to kill the earth.""
Frog Lake, a firm owned by Alberta's Frog Lake First Nation, is looking to buy more oil-producing properties outside of its territory along with stakes in tank farms and pipelines, said Dion, who is a member of the neighboring Kehewin Cree Nation.
Dion said aboriginal groups have traditionally settled for ""the smaller stuff"" - royalties from outside energy firms.
""The revenue-sharing piece is here now,"" Dion said. ""That is where we have to go.""
Aboriginal groups have a legal say in projects on their lands, which are held in trust by the Canadian government for band members, and also those that might impact them indirectly. First Nations' support gives energy firms better odds of overcoming any concerns from other aboriginal groups.
Ottawa on Feb. 8 unveiled draft legislation for resource projects that places greater emphasis on considering their impact on aboriginal communities. Under the rules for assessing major projects, to take effect next year, such concerns will be heard by the new Canadian Energy Regulator and Impact Assessment Agency of Canada.
BUYING AND FINANCING
Examples of First Nations taking bigger roles in energy projects are mounting.
 RBC  Capital Markets' (TO:RY) North American head of project finance Mark Saar said the bank is seeing more pipeline and storage companies seeking financial partnerships with aboriginals.
RBC in December completed a C$545 million bond issue for the Fort McKay and Mikisew Cree bands - the largest ever private investment by a First Nation - allowing them to buy a 49 percent stake in a  Suncor Energy  (TO:SU) storage facility. 
""The deal was oversubscribed,"" Saar said. ""We think there would be appetite for further similar deals.""
Some investors find aboriginals' involvement in energy projects appealing given that their support is often critical for regulatory approvals, Saar said. Others, however, worry about being tied to First Nations' finances because of historic mismanagement by some bands.
Investors and lenders are displaying ""greater acceptance of First Nations as players,"" said David Sharpe, a Mohawk aboriginal and Chief Executive of Toronto-based debt firm Bridging Finance, referring to RBC's bond issue.
Bridging Finance last year financed an unnamed First Nation's C$11 million purchase of stakes in producing oil wells and is working on four more similar deals, Sharpe said.
Investment bank AltaCorp Capital is raising funds for a C$16 billion ($12.85 billion) oil pipeline, proposed to run from Alberta to the northern British Columbia coast. 
The project has modest financial backing from one of Canada's richest families, the Aquilini Group, and support from 35 First Nations to use their land. In exchange for allowing that access, the bands will own at least 35 percent of the pipeline and a corresponding share of the profits.
If built, Eagle Spirit would be a crucial second outlet to the Pacific Ocean for crude from the oil sands, which currently sells at a steep discount because of transportation constraints.
Eagle Spirit Energy Holdings' proposed oil pipeline has strong interest from energy companies and investors, said Eagle Spirit president and chairman Calvin Helin, who is aboriginal.
The firm's main roadblock is a proposed government moratorium against oil tankers along the ecologically sensitive northern B.C. coast.
Two other private investor groups, A2A and G7G - with the political support of some First Nations - are proposing to build railways running from Alberta's oil sands to Alaska, avoiding the coastline of British Columbia because of the pipeline opposition there. Matt Vickers, head of G7G, declined to detail the investors' financial arrangements with the bands.
New railways could provide an alternative to  Kinder Morgan  Canada's (TO:KML) (N:KMI) Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Alberta to British Columbia, which has been delayed by one year due to the environmental concerns of the B.C. government, some aboriginals and municipalities.
'A REAL AWAKENING'
When Chief Isaac Laboucan-Avirom became leader of Alberta's Woodland Cree Nation in 2013, he was struck by the contrast between his band's precarious finances and the hydrocarbon wealth surrounding its territory.
Three years later, Laboucan-Avirom signed an agreement allowing  Baytex Energy  Corp (TO:BTE) to drill in exchange for modest royalties and jobs. Now, the Woodland Cree are granting permission for Eagle Spirit pipeline to use its land - in exchange for an undisclosed ownership stake.
Such opportunities have won over some groups trying to balance economic prosperity with environmental protection.
""There's been a real awakening,"" said Laboucan-Avirom, who is looking for further investment in oil and gas assets. ""Everything in our world is touched by oil and gas, whether we like it or not.""

Crude Oil WTI Futures for April delivery were trading at $60.95 a barrel in Asia at 10:30pm ET, down 0.07%. Brent crude futures for May delivery, traded in London, were up 0.08% at $63.88 per barrel at 11:00am Hong Kong time.
Oil prices have moved quite far from the highs of the beginning of February. WTI started February at $65.80 and Brent started at $69.65.
The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has been reducing output by around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) since January 2017 in an attempt to ease the global oversupply and stabilize oil markets. Oil output from OPEC fell to a 10-month low in February, but continued increase in oil production in the U.S. has countered OPEC efforts.
U.S. crude inventories increased by 3 million barrels last week, surpassing analyst expectations for a build of 2.1 million barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Gasoline stocks also rose by 2.5 million barrels compared with expectations for a 190,000-barrel drop.
Since mid-2016, U.S production has increased more than 20%, exceeding 10 million bpd. At this rate of increase, the U.S. is set to overtake Russia as the world’s largest oil producer by 2019.
Soaring oil production in the U.S. has simply filled the gap in supply created by OPEC, putting a lid on prices.
Although stocks at the key oil storage facility in Cushing, Oklahoma, has dropped below 30 million barrels for the first time since late 2014, the overall increase in U.S. oil stocks has overshadowed the effects of the destocking at Cushing.
Despite the lid on oil prices, oil markets remain well supported by soaring demand from Asia, particularly China.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices were set on Friday to post their first weekly decline in three weeks following a sell-off in global stock markets after news of planned U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum raised fears of a trade war.
President Donald Trump announced he would impose hefty tariffs on the two metals to protect U.S. producers, risking retaliation from major trade partners such as China, Europe and neighboring Canada.
Brent crude (LCOc1) rose marginally to $63.85 a barrel by 1125 GMT, while U.S. crude (CLc1) was down 4 cents at $60.95. Both contracts are set for weekly declines. 
""The rise in total U.S. commercial stocks coupled with a new high in domestic crude production made for a soft backdrop,"" Stephen Brennock, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates, said in a note. 
U.S. crude stocks  rose last week even as refineries hiked output, increasing by 3 million barrels, compared with expectations for a gain of 2.1 million barrels.
Still, stocks fell again at Cushing in Oklahoma, with inventories  down by 1.2 million barrels in a 10th consecutive week of decline, the Energy Information Administration said this week. 
""Although destocking in Cushing has continued, with stocks there falling below 30 million barrels for the first time since late 2014, the overall increase in U.S. oil stocks has overshadowed the good news,"" Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said in a note.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will hold a dinner on Monday in Houston with U.S. shale firms, the latest sign of the producer group widening talks about how best to tame a global oil glut.
U.S. crude output slipped in the last month of 2017, but in November hit an all-time high of 10.057 million barrels per day. Weekly data showed another record and further gains are expected.
""The market is not showing any obvious signs of turning around the mood. We are being driven by the pick-up in U.S. inventories and in general terms the market went a bit too far too soon,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.

Gold futures for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $0.90, or 0.06%, to $1,318.60 a troy ounce.
Trump said the US will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminium. The highly controversial move raised fears that the U.S.’s main trading partners including China could take countermeasures, triggering a global trade war.
The EU was said to be drawing up a list of US products to target, including orange juice and bourbon.
""The EU stands ready to react swiftly and appropriately in case our exports are affected by any restrictive trade measures from the U.S.,"" a European Commission source told CNBC.
While China’s commerce ministry in February said: “If the final decision from the US hurts China’s interests, we will certainly take necessary measures to protect our legitimate rights.”
Retaliation from China is seen as the biggest threat as sectors of the US economy including farming are highly dependent on demand from China.
While the move was expected, a sharp reaction was seen in markets: Riskier assets like stocks were dumped for well-known safe havens like the yen and gold.
Prior to the announcement gold prices had been under pressure – trading about $10 offside – after Fed member Bill Dudley said four-rate hikes would fit within the Fed’s plan to raise rates gradually.
Safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc pared losses, leaving the greenback nursing heavy losses, adding further support to the precious metal.
Dollar-denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar – A fall in the dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency and thus, increases demand for the precious metal.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures rose 0.22% to $16.36 a troy ounce, while platinum futures fell 2.04% to $967.50 an ounce.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for April delivery fell 1.1% to settle at $60.99 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent fell 1.21% to trade at $63.93 a barrel.
Crude oil prices bounced off their lows of $60.20 a barrel heading into settlement but ultimately settled lower as traders continued to fret Wednesday’s data showing U.S. crude supplies rose more than expected while domestic output remained near historic highs.
Domestic crude production rose to 10.3 million barrels per day, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. That leaves the U.S. as the world’s second largest oil producer as it closes in on leading producer, Russia, adding to fears that OPEC’s efforts to rebalance oil markets will come under pressure.
Investor fears were allayed somewhat, after Bloomberg News survey showed OPEC members continued to slash output which fell 80,000 barrels a day to 32.28 million a day in February. That was the lowest since 31.89 million seen in April.
The fall in the group’s output was mainly drive by production declines in Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
UAE production fell by 50,000 barrels per day to below its OPEC target, while Venezuelan output fell to 1.68 million barrels in February, down 30,000 barrels a day, from the previous month.

154,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>","Trump Is Said to Delay Decision on Steel, Aluminum Tariffs","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump has delayed a decision on imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum as his administration weighs a move that could antagonize trading partners from China to Mexico and hurt some domestic industries.
The White House has postponed the decision beyond Thursday, when the president was initially expected to make the announcement, said three people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deliberations aren’t public.
Trump had told aides he wants tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum from all countries -- both of which would exceed the most severe option presented to him by the Commerce Department. The president has until April 11 to announce a decision on steel and April 19 for aluminum.
A White House official said early Thursday that there would be an announcement on trade later in the day. Trump is holding a “listening session” on Thursday with chief executives including ArcelorMittal USA’s John Brett,  Nucor  Corp (NYSE:NUE).’s John Ferriola and Century Aluminum Co.’s Mike Bless, over the investigations.
Steel and aluminum stocks pared earlier advances. Century Aluminum was up 2.2 percent at 11:38 a.m. in in New York after rising as much as 8.5 percent. AK Steel Holding Corp. was up 3 percent after jumping as much as 12 percent. U.S. Steel Corp. advanced 1.8 percent and was up as much as 8.4 percent. Nucor, the largest U.S. producer, climbed 1.6 percent, following a 3.7 percent gain.
Severe Options
Trump has been considering a range of options to curb imports of steel and aluminum, after the Commerce Department concluded that shipments of the two commodities hurt U.S. national security. He’s told aides he wants tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum from all countries -- both of which exceed the most severe options presented to Trump by the Commerce Department.
“Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world,” Trump said in a Twitter posting Thursday morning. “We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!""
A U.S. move on tariffs may provoke retaliation from China, the world’s biggest steel and aluminum producer. China has already launched a probe into U.S. imports of sorghum, and is studying whether to restrict shipments of U.S. soybeans -- targets that could hurt Trump’s support in some farming states. While China accounts for just a fraction of U.S. imports of the metals, it’s accused of flooding the global market and dragging down prices.
China Talks
It could add to tensions between the world’s two-biggest economies on the same day Chinese President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser, Liu He, is scheduled to meet Trump’s senior economic team in Washington -- including White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
Foreign government officials have traveled to Washington in recent days to voice their concern about tariffs. Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo was said to warn the administration about his country’s plans for retaliatory measures. Trump is also under pressure from members of his own Republican party to tread lightly to avoid triggering global retaliation and amid concerns of higher prices for consumer goods.
However, American steel producers and workers have called on Trump to defend their industry as it grapples with the effects of overcapacity in China.
Last April, the president ordered Commerce to study the impact of steel and aluminum imports on national security under seldom-used section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act. Commerce submitted its final reports to the president in January.

155,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>","Crude Oil Prices Push Lower on Supply Data, Dollar Strength","Investing.com - Crude oil prices continued to trade at multi-week lows on Thursday, as investors remained cautious following news of an increase in U.S. stockpiles last week and as the U.S. dollar continued to move higher.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude April contract was down $1.23 or about 1.95% at $60.42 a barrel by 10:25 a.m. ET (14:25 GMT), the lowest since February 15.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London lost $1.27 or about 1.95% to $63.471 a barrel, also the lowest since February 15.
Oil prices remained under pressure after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Wednesday that crude oil inventories rose by 3.019 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 23, exceeding expectations for a rise of 2.4 million barrels.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories rose by 2.483 million barrels, confounding expectations for a decline of 190,000 barrels.
The massive build in gasoline stockpiles garnered most of the attention as some market participants had expected that a slowdown in refinery activity - as refiners enter period of maintenance - would lead to fall in gasoline supplies.
The data came a day after the American Petroleum Institute reported a 933,000 barrels increase in last week's crude oil stockpiles, albeit less than the expected increase of 2.7 million barrels.
Fears that rising U.S. output could dampen global efforts to rid the market of excess supplies have systematically limited oil prices' gains recently.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
Oil prices were also hit by growing expectations for more aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year, which pushed the U.S. dollar higher.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.22% at 90.81, the highest since January 12.
A stronger greenback often weighs on prices for dollar-denominated commodities.

Comex gold futures were down 0.82% at $1,307.00 a troy ounce by 08:45 a.m. ET (12:45 GMT), the lowest level since January 2.
The greenback was boosted after data on Thursday showed that U.S. jobless claims dropped to the lowest level since 1969 last week.
The U.S. dollar was already broadly supported after Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank would likely move forward with gradual increases in interest rates.
“The economic outlook remains strong,” he said. “Further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of both of our objectives.”
Powell was speaking at his first semi-annual monetary policy testimony to the House Financial Services Committee since taking over the helm of Fed earlier this month.

157,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 05:31PM ET</span>","Trump to impose steep tariffs on steel, aluminum, stoking trade war talk","By Steve Holland and Ginger Gibson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump announced on Thursday he would impose hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to protect U.S. producers, risking retaliation from major trade partners like China, Europe and neighboring Canada as well as helping to trigger a large selloff on Wall Street.    
Trump said the duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum would be formally announced next week although White House officials later said some details still needed to be ironed out.
Trump believes the tariffs will safeguard American jobs but many economists say the impact of price increases for consumers of steel and aluminum, such as the auto and oil industries, will be to destroy more jobs than they create.   
""We’re going to build our steel industry back and our aluminum industry back,"" he said.
News of the tariffs drove the stocks of U.S. domestic steel and aluminum makers sharply higher, but also hit sentiment on Wall Street due to the potential impact of higher costs on consumers.
The move came after what one person with direct knowledge of the discussions described as a night of ""chaos"" in the White House due to frequent switching of positions in the administration.
The threat of tariffs was sharply criticized by some senior Republican legislators as well as industries from autos to oil whose input costs will rise. A major concern is that U.S. farm exports could be hit hard in retaliation by steel-exporting countries.
RETALIATION 
""Every time you do this, you get a retaliation. Agriculture is the number one target. I think this is terribly counterproductive for the agriculture economy,"" said Senator Pat Roberts, who chairs the chamber's agriculture committee. 
China has already threatened to curb imports of U.S. soybeans, while the European Union has said it will consider action as well. China's top trade official Lui He is in Washington for trade talks.
The move will not directly hit China that hard, with data showing that Canada supplies 16 percent of U.S. demand versus China's 2 percent and is by far the largest steel exporter followed by Brazil and South Korea. 
""Should restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a sharply worded statement.
Brazil's industry ministry said it would consider taking action on its own over the tariffs or in concert with other countries. Two of its largest steelmakers, Cia Siderurgica Nacional and Usiminas sold off on the tariff news, closing down 4.4 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively. 
Washington is already engaged in a dispute with Canada and Mexico over its proposed revision to the North American Free Trade Agreement and months of tense talks have failed to produce any meaningful progress.
Asked whether there would be exemptions for any countries, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she would not get into any details ahead of next week’s announcement. She said the tariffs were still being finalized.
After Trump's statement, AK Steel Holding was up almost 10 percent, U.S. Steel Corp was up over 5 percent and  Nucor  (NYSE:NUE) rose 3.2 percent. By contrast shares of steel consumers fell with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co down over 3 percent and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) down almost 4 percent. 
The administration says duties would protect U.S. industry, but critics say they would raise costs for industry and fail to deliver on a campaign pledge to boost domestic jobs.
Trump’s decision reflected a victory for the trade hawks in his administration, including White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who has been rising in importance, and a setback for those who fear the repercussions of the move, such as top economic adviser Gary Cohn.
It had appeared unlikely that Trump would announce the tariffs on Thursday after a night of back and forth inside the administration.
""There was a lot of movement within the past 12, 16 hours,"" said the source who had knowledge of the discussions, but who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.
""It was going to happen. It wasn’t going to happen and then it did happen.""
The administration has also cited national security interests for its action, saying the United States needs domestic supply for its tanks and warships. Contrary to the action announced by Trump on Thursday, the Department of Defense had recommended targeted steel tariffs and a delay in aluminum duties.
Although China only accounts for two percent of U.S. steel imports, its massive industry expansion has helped produce a global glut of steel that has driven down prices.
Trade tensions between the United States and China have risen since Trump took office in 2017 and the administration is also pushing on what it regards as forced technology transfers to China. 
FEW MORE JOBS FROM TARIFFS
While American steelmakers have lost three quarters of their jobs between 1962 and 2005, a major study by the American Economic Association showed that much of this had been due to improved production technology as output per worker rose fivefold.
""Thus, even if trade protection leads to increased domestic production, increases in employment may be far less than many hope,"" a report from the independent Econofact economist network said last week.
Econofact said in its report that two million jobs were in industries that use steel ""intensively"", including auto parts, household appliances, farm machinery and oil equipment.
""Across many states, the number of jobs adversely affected in these steel-using industries could far exceed any steel jobs saved,"" Econofact warned.
The overall impact on the U.S. economy is likely to be muted, barring a major trade war, with steel and aluminum imports accounting for just two percent of the overall total.

Investment bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) estimated the tariffs would add 0.1 percentage point to core inflation over a period of time and cut economic growth by 0.1-0.2 percentage points, which would be more than offset by Trump's fiscal stimulus.

HOUSTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) will exit some joint ventures with Russia's Rosneft (MM:ROSN), citing Western sanctions first imposed in 2014, while the Russian company said the pullout will result in serious losses for its U.S. partner.
The move is an about-face for Exxon, which had opposed the sanctions over Russia's invasion of Crimea and argued they unfairly penalized U.S. companies while allowing foreign energy rivals to operate in the country, the world's largest oil producer.
Yet the sanctions were effective in slowing work on a project by Exxon and Rosneft on what was hailed as a major discovery in the Kara Sea above the Arctic Circle. 
Rosneft, Russia's largest oil company, said last year that it planned to return to operations at the project in 2019. 
Exxon's exit from projects will not affect the Sakhalin project off the eastern coast of Russia, Exxon and Rosneft spokesmen said.
Sakhalin-1 operates under a Production Sharing Agreement struck in the mid-1990s and currently produces around 200,000 barrels of oil per day. 
Representatives for the U.S. Department of State and Treasury Department did not have immediate comment. The joint ventures were reached when U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was Exxon's chief executive. 
A Rosneft's spokesman said ExxonMobil would incur serious losses because of the decision. 
Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontyev said Exxon had been forced to take what he called a predictable decision, but confirmed the move would not affect the Sakhalin-1 joint venture.
""It (Exxon) will suffer serious losses as a result of this (decision),"" said Leontyev.
Exxon said it will formally start the process of withdrawing from the joint ventures this year. 
In 2012, Exxon and Rosneft detailed an exploration partnership with plans to invest as much as $500 billion in developing Russia's Arctic and Black Sea oil reserves. Further deals were signed in 2014.
Exxon said in a financial filing on Wednesday that it recorded a fourth quarter after-tax loss of $200 million due to the withdrawal plan.
The United States and the European Union imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its role in eastern Ukraine conflicts. 
The U.S. government also imposed sanctions on Rosneft Chief Executive Igor Sechin that year.
The sanctions prohibit U.S. citizens or people in the United States from dealing with those on the blacklist, such as Sechin. Rosneft itself is subject to narrower U.S. sanctions that still allow Americans to deal with the company on some transactions.
The U.S. government fined Exxon $2 million for signing the joint ventures just after sanctions were imposed in 2014, saying the company showed a ""reckless disregard"" for the sanctions. Exxon called the fine ""capricious"" and appealed it. 

Still, Exxon wound down drilling in Russia's Arctic in 2014 after the sanctions were imposed. Exxon was allowed to finish some drilling projects as the sanctions took effect.

U.S. crude inventories increased by 3 million barrels last week, surpassing analyst expectations for a build of 2.1 million barrels, according to weekly data by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Gasoline stocks also rose by 2.5 million barrels compared with expectations for a 190,000-barrel drop.
Oil output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) fell to a 10-month low in February, but soaring oil production in the U.S. has simply filled the gap in supply created by OPEC, putting a lid on prices.
OPEC has been reducing output by around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) since January 2017, and the pact will run until the end of 2018. Continued increase in oil production in the U.S. has, however, hampered OPEC attempts to ease the global oversupply.
Earlier this week, International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol said that the U.S. will overtake Russia as the world’s largest oil producer by 2019. U.S production has surpassed 10 million bpd, an increase of more than 20% since mid-2016.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency is gaining strength, further putting downward pressure on oil prices, as dollar-denominated oil is now more expensive for other countries to import.
Oil markets remain well supported by strong global fundamentals. Demand continues to surge in Asia, particularly China, which emerged as a top buyer of U.S. crude last year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Thursday after sharp falls in the previous two sessions, though gains were limited as some investors shied away from riskier assets amid volatile equity markets and a stronger dollar.
Both global benchmark oil futures fell sharply on Wednesday after government data showed a larger-than-expected rise in U.S. crude inventories.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery (CLc1) was up 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $61.77 a barrel by 0741 GMT. It settled the previous session down 2.2 percent.
Brent crude (LCOc1) for May delivery, the new front-month contract, was up 17 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $64.90. The April contract expired on Wednesday, down 1.3 percent.
Both benchmark contracts fell nearly 5 percent in February, the first monthly declines in six months.
""An extended large decline in equities has been prompting investors to avoid risk assets such as oil,"" said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting in Tokyo.
Some industry sources said Wednesday's drop was also due to profit-taking by market participants at the end of the month after oil hit a three-week high earlier this week.
Meanwhile, oil has been under pressure as the dollar index (DXY) rose to a five-week high.
U.S. crude inventories rose by 3 million barrels last week, compared with analyst expectations for a build of 2.1 million barrels, weekly data by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed. 
Gasoline stocks also rose by 2.5 million barrels against expectations for a 190,000-barrel drop.
Soaring U.S. crude output has also kept a lid on oil prices this year, even though producers, led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, have reduced output.
U.S. crude oil production rose to a record 10.057 million barrels per day (bpd) in November and retreated slightly in December to 9.949 million bpd, the EIA said on Wednesday.
""Despite the expanding output curbs by OPEC and non-OPEC members such as Russia, the market has been focusing more on rising U.S. output since around late January,"" Akuta added.
OPEC, meanwhile, is doing its part to counter U.S. output. The group's oil production fell in February to a 10-month low, a Reuters survey found on Wednesday.

Oil prices may find some support as the U.S. is considering oil-related sanctions on OPEC member Venezuela to pressure its socialist President Nicolas Maduro, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Department of the Interior committee voted on Wednesday to recommend to Secretary Ryan Zinke that the agency lower royalty rates for federal offshore oil and gas drilling, to spur production.
The agency's royalty policy committee voted unanimously to lower the rates to 12.5 percent through 2024. The existing rate of 18.75 percent was set during the administration of former President George W. Bush.
The panel, which is made up of department and state officials, tribal representatives, and energy companies, also voted to increase the amount of acreage available for offshore oil and natural gas leasing in the outer continental shelf.
The Houston meeting was aimed at updating around a dozen federal royalty rules, which guide energy and mineral production in the United States.
The committee was formed last year to advise Zinke on whether the government was getting a fair price from resources companies for their use of public land. He will take its recommendations into account.
The panel also voted to approve a proposal letting coal companies that mine on federal land set their own rates for coal used to calculate royalties.
Zinke last year halted an Obama-era rule that had required coal companies to pay royalties on sales to their first unaffiliated customer. The rule, which had been intended to close a loophole that had let companies sell coal to its own subsidiaries at deflated prices, was criticized by Zinke as confusing.
Randall Luthi, president of offshore energy lobby group the National Ocean Industries Association, said at the meeting that existing production offshore was ""declining and at a very quick rate"" and that lowering royalty rates should spur new activity.
Pam Eaton, an advisor to conservation group Wilderness Society, attended the meeting as an observer.
She said in comments after formal presentations that she wanted to remind the committee that its mission was ""to ensure the public receives the full value of the natural resources produced from federal lands.""

168,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 06:07PM ET</span>",Venezuela presidential hopeful wants Wall Street economist on team,"By Andrew Cawthorne and Vivian Sequera
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan presidential candidate Henri Falcon said on Wednesday he would like a Wall Street economist, who sees dollarization as the solution for hyper-inflation in Venezuela, to play a big role on his team if he wins the upcoming election.
Falcon said Francisco Rodriguez, a Venezuelan who is chief economist at Torino Capital and advising him informally, would be the ideal leader of his economic team should he defeat socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
""What is the cancer of Venezuela, apart from the government? The economy. So the economy is for specialists,"" he told Reuters during an interview at his new offices in Caracas. 
""Francisco is a man with many qualifications, but he is also a politician recognized internally and abroad ... We need to build a really good team led by a great economist, that's Francisco Rodriguez.""
Rodriguez, one of the most influential analysts of Venezuela's dysfunctional economy, has recently been suggesting the bolivar currency should be scrapped for the U.S. dollar as an extreme measure to fix runaway inflation by stopping the government from printing excess money. 
Rodriguez also believes Venezuela - in the fifth year of crippling recession that has left millions hungry and created widespread shortages - would receive major help from international loan bodies like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund under a new government.
Speaking to Reuters earlier on Wednesday on the sidelines of a Caracas forum, Rodriguez confirmed he was giving informal advice to Falcon. ""I'm a friend, I respect him,"" he said.
He told the forum Falcon would make an excellent president. ""This country cannot survive six more years of Nicolas Maduro, this country doesn't deserve that,"" he added.
Falcon, a former state governor who has broken with an opposition boycott to run against Maduro, said he would prioritize repairing relations with Washington should he win the vote slated for April 22.
While most analysts give him little chance, some recent polls actually put him ahead of Maduro in voter preferences.
""The United States would have a potential ally in a new Venezuelan government,"" said Falcon, who defines himself as a center-leftist in favor of both market-friendly policies and strong welfare protection programs. 
NEW ELECTION DATE SOUGHT
Falcon implied he disagreed with possible U.S. oil sanctions against OPEC member Venezuela, saying he opposed any measures that ""end up hurting the poor.""
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has already slapped some individual sanctions on officials it deems guilty of rights abuses or eroding democracy in Venezuela, and has also imposed measures to block new financing for the government. 
It is pondering measures against the oil sector if Maduro does not improve conditions for the election, which critics say has been rigged to legitimize ""dictatorship.""
Falcon, a 56-year-old former military man who supported the ruling socialists until a 2010 split, has drawn the wrath of Venezuela's opposition coalition by throwing his hat into the ring and undercutting their boycott policy. 
""Abstention is no use,"" he said, pointing to past boycotts that had given the socialists big uncontested wins and arguing that 80 percent of Venezuelans wanted change.
""In world history, at least for the last two centuries, no government has won an election at a time of hyper-inflation,"" he added, citing the price of a box of eggs equivalent to nearly two-thirds of the minimum monthly wage. 
Prices in Venezuela rose more than 4,000 percent in the 12 months to the end of January, according to estimates by the country's opposition-led National Assembly, broadly in line with independent economists' figures.
Falcon is demanding improved election conditions, including a later vote date, U.N. observers, an end to ""harassment"" of Maduro opponents, and the removal of government handout booths known as ""red spots"" to curry favor with voters often set up near polling centers. 
Without guarantees, he may withdraw his candidacy. 
Falcon said he would like veteran Venezuelan politician Eduardo Fernandez, a former presidential candidate for opposition party COPEI, to be his foreign minister.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top aides to President Donald Trump look to push a tough line on trade in talks on Thursday with an envoy of Chinese President Xi Jinping, with a White House official saying a frank exchange of views was expected.
Aides say Trump has been increasingly frustrated by the soaring U.S. trade deficit with China, which was $375 billion in 2017, and is considering slapping tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.
That would raise the prospect of retaliation from Beijing and what some analysts see as a possible trade war.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn will meet jointly with Chinese economic adviser Liu He and his delegation at the White House, the official said on Wednesday, requesting anonymity to discuss the meeting.
""We expect a frank exchange of views on the trade and economic relationship, and that talks will focus on the substantive issues,"" the official said.
There was no plan for Trump himself to meet Liu but officials did not rule it out if progress was being made.
White House officials say China has shown little inclination to take steps to reduce the trade deficit in a way that would satisfy Trump and that he is now demanding action.
The U.S. Commerce Department on Feb. 16 recommended that Trump impose stiff curbs on steel imports from China and other countries and offered the president several options ranging from global and country-specific tariffs to broad import quotas.
A blanket tariff on steel would cover every steel and aluminum product entering the American market from China. 
A source close to the White House said Trump had expressed interest in imposing a tariff on steel imports of at least 24 percent. The White House said no final decision had been made.

”I don’t think we’ve ever had a better relationship with China than we do right now,“ Trump told reporters last Friday. ”The only thing that can get in its way is trade, because it so one-sided, it’s so lopsided.”

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for April delivery fell 2.17% to settle at $61.64 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent fell 2.60% to trade at $66.69 a barrel.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by 3.019 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 23, exceeding expectations for a rise of 2.4 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – rose by 2.483 million barrels, confounding expectations for a decline of 190,000 barrels, while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – fell by 960,000 barrels, a steeper fall than the 709,000 million barrels forecast.
The massive build in gasoline stockpiles garnered most of the attention as some market participants had expected that a slowdown in refinery activity - as refiners enter period of maintenance - would lead to fall in gasoline supplies. 
Also adding to negative sentiment was an uptick in domestic crude production to 10.3 million barrels per day as the US closes in on Russia as the world’s largest oil producer. That added to investor fears that a faster pace of US output would slow OPEC’s efforts to rebalance oil markets.
“All the indicators that suggest continued fast growth in the U.S. are in perfect alignment; rising prices leading, after a few months, to more drilling, more completions, more production and more hedging,” the International Energy Agency said in the report."

Gold futures for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $1.70, or 0.13%, to $1,320.30 a troy ounce.
Despite U.S. bond yields dropping on subdued economic data, gold prices struggled to mount a meaningful advance as positive sentiment on the yellow metal remained somewhat challenged by growing investor expectations for a faster pace of U.S. rate hikes.
The upbeat investor outlook on rate hikes come as recent data pointed to an improving inflationary environment. This was echoed by Fed chair Jerome Powell Tuesday, raising the prospect of four rate hikes in 2018. With current interest rates at 1.25% to 1.50%, four quarter-point rate hikes would take the Fed’s benchmark rate to 2.25% to 2.50% by December-end. 
Stifel chief economist, Lindsey Piegza said Powell's stance wasn't definitive but ""seemingly convinced at least some market participants to read a more hawkish tilt in his remarks"" igniting ""fears of an overly aggressive Fed reignited selling."" 
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 48 cents, or 0.8%, to $62.55 a barrel by 10:35AM ET (1535GMT). Prices were at around $63.10 prior to the release of the inventory data.
Meanwhile, London-traded Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., shed 55 cents, or roughly 0.8%, to $65.95 a barrel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories increased by 3.0 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 23.
That compared with analysts' expectations for a gain of around 2.4 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply-increase of 933,000 barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 1.2 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 423.5 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be in the lower half of the average range for this time of year.
U.S. crude oil production rose to an all-time high of 10.28 million barrels per day, keeping it above Saudi Arabia's output levels and within reach of Russia, the world's biggest crude producer.
Analysts and traders have recently warned that booming U.S. shale oil production could potentially derail OPEC's effort to end a supply glut.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 2.5 million barrels, compared to expectations for a decline of 0.1 million barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a drop of 1.0 million barrels.

Front-month U.S. natural gas futures tacked on 1.1 cents, or around 0.4%, to $2.694 per million British thermal units (btu) by 9:40AM ET (1440GMT).
The commodity notched a minor loss of 0.1% on Tuesday, amid speculation the end of the winter heating season will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for the fuel.
Market experts have warned that futures are likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term as the coldest part of the winter has effectively passed.
Natural gas prices are down nearly 20% since late January amid speculation the end of the winter heating season will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for the fuel.
Spring usually sees the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 68 and 78 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Feb. 23.
That compares with a decline of 124 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 7 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 118 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 1.760 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
That figure is 609 bcf, or around 25.7%, lower than levels at this time a year ago, and 412 bcf, or roughly 19.0%, below the five-year average for this time of year.

Comex gold futures were little changed at $1,319.1 a troy ounce by 08:35 a.m. ET (12:35 GMT), just off Tuesday's two-and-a-half week lows of $1,314.40.
Markets shrugged off official data released on Wednesday showing that the U.S. economy grew at a slower rate than initially expected in the fourth quarter.
The greenback was boosted after Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank would likely move forward with gradual increases in interest rates.
“The economic outlook remains strong,” he said. “Further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will best promote attainment of both of our objectives.”
Powell was speaking at his first semi-annual monetary policy testimony to the House Financial Services Committee since taking over the helm of Fed earlier this month.

(Reuters) - Oil analysts expect the price of crude to rise steadily this year but remain in a tight band dictated by U.S. shale output growth on one side and OPEC supply restraint on the other, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
The survey of 37 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude (LCOc1) would average $63 a barrel in 2018, slightly higher than $62.37 projected in the previous month's poll. 
""OPEC's level of compliance (with agreed production curbs) and the pace of U.S. shale's output growth are likely to be the key fundamental price drivers in 2018,"" Ashley Petersen of Stratas Advisors said. 
""Prices will likely be more volatile in 2018 than 2017, driven by whipsawing sentiment around the pace of U.S. growth.""
U.S. oil production  could surpass 11 million barrels per day this year, with production already near a record above 10 million bpd.
""The U.S. has stolen the show somewhat,"" said Cailin Birch, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. 
""That its oil market is dominated by a large number of uncoordinated, private-sector firms, many of whom benefit from lower production costs than producers elsewhere, means the U.S. will remain a major player for the foreseeable future."" 
Meanwhile, OPEC is closing in on its goal of reducing oil inventories held by industrial nations to their five-year average, figures from the group's head of research showed this month. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia have agreed to cap output by about 1.8 million bpd in a deal running from January last year until the end of 2018. 
Saudi Arabia last week said it hoped OPEC and its allies would be able to relax production curbs next year and create a permanent framework to stabilize oil markets after the deal expires.
""The supply deal remains a key uncertainty for the oil market. A transition of the deal is needed but not yet visible, with both an over-tightening and an orderly unwinding being potential scenarios,"" said Norbert Rucker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer. 
Analysts said that without a smooth exit from the pact, global inventories may drop sharply and trigger a potentially damaging price rise. 
Oil output in Venezuela, one of OPEC's larger producers, has dropped to its lowest in more than 20 years as the country grapples with an economic crisis, in turn helping curtail OPEC's supply beyond the group's agreed 1.2-million bpd commitment.
Growing demand from Asian economies, led by China, was expected to absorb part of the increase in U.S. supply.
""Rising global oil demand will be driven mainly by emerging markets, with non-OECD consumption rising by an average of 2.8 percent per year in 2018-19, which would be the fastest rate since 2013,"" the Economist Intelligence Unit's Birch said. 

U.S. light crude (CLc1) is forecast to average $58.88 a barrel in 2018, up from $58.11 in the January poll.

176,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>",Gold in Bind as Rising Interest Rates Counter Inflation Fear,"(Bloomberg) -- Gold tumbled after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell opened the door to four interest rate hikes this year on the back of a strengthening U.S. economy, another instance of the competing forces that have corralled prices into a $65 range since the start of January. 
While bullion is under pressure in an environment where the global economy is recovering and interest rates are climbing, the reappearance of inflation, the prospect of wider U.S. deficits and a long-term decline in the dollar have lent support to the bulls. Gold held steady at $1,317.52 an ounce Wednesday after a 1.2 percent drop a day earlier. Here are five charts that show the quandary.
Higher inflation expectations due to rising oil prices have been supportive for gold, according to a report in February from  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., which sees prices reaching $1,450 by the end of the year. Other drivers have been strong emerging market growth and some potential hedging demand in a choppy market environment, it said. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). also says rising inflation will benefit commodities, including precious metals.
While bond yields are rising and the Federal Reserve is set for further increases in interest rates, that may not necessarily spell gloomier times for gold. Bullion climbed during the previous tightening cycle in 2004-2006. Plus, the S&P 500 Index has doubled in the past seven years, and any prolonged reversal of the stock market boom could increase demand for gold.
A sustained return to dollar strength would also be bad news for gold bulls as bullion has a strong inverse relationship with the currency. While the dollar has been languishing near the lowest level since 2014, a rebound since mid-month has created a double bottom, a key reversal pattern in technical analysis. 
“Most of the time these patterns fail to work, especially if found at random areas of the chart,” Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at brokerage Forex.com, said last week. “But with the case of the Dollar Index, this potential double bottom has been formed around a long-term support at 88.50, a level which was resistance in the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2014 before it broke higher. So, if we get some confirmation here that the dollar has indeed bottomed, then this should be rather bad news for gold.”
A look at the performance of gold in other currencies may be sobering for bulls. Take a look at prices in the euro, the pound, the yen and the yuan this year -- they’re all down. Simona Gambarini, commodities economist at Capital Economics Ltd., said Monday that according to their calculations, 50 percent of the change in the price since the start of 2018 is due to dollar movements. “If we stripped that effect off, the price of gold would be much lower,” she said. Capital Economics predicts $1,270 by the end of the year.
By the way, ballooning shortfalls in the federal budget and current account balance could mean further weakness for the dollar even as the Fed tightens. “If the world ever does get sick of lending ever more money to the U.S. Treasury, the price of Treasury bonds will sink by definition,” Adrian Ash, research director at London-based BullionVault Ltd., said on its website Feb. 15. “In that outcome, it’s hard to imagine the price of gold failing to rise sharply.”

Fears that rising U.S. output could dampen global efforts to rid the market of excess supplies have systematically limited oil prices' gains recently.

In an effort to stabilize oil markets, OPEC has been curbing output by around 1.2 million bpd since January 2017, and the deal will run until the end of 2018.
While the effort has helped somewhat to support oil prices, the U.S. has continued to increase its oil production, filling the gap in supply created by OPEC and thus pushing prices down. In effect, the surging production in the U.S. is hampering OPEC attempts to ease the global oversupply.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency is gaining strength in the wake of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s first day of congressional testimony. The stronger dollar is further putting downward pressure on oil prices, as dollar-denominated oil is now more expensive for other countries to import.
However, oil markets remain well supported by strong global fundamentals. Demand continues to surge in Asia, particularly China, which emerged as a top buyer of U.S. crude last year."

It said in a statement that antidumping and countervailing duties would be levied on a number of Chinese firms, with dumping margins ranging from 48.64 percent to 106.09 percent and anti-subsidy rates of 17.14 percent to 80.97 percent.
""This Administration is committed to trade that is fair and reciprocal, and we will not allow American workers and businesses to be harmed by unfair imports,"" the statement quoted Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as saying.

China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday the aide would discuss ""China-U.S. relations and the two countries' economic and trade cooperation.""

""The Aluminum Association and its foil-producing members are extremely pleased with the Commerce Department’s final determinations,"" the group's president, Heidi Brock, said in the statement.
""U.S. aluminum foil producers are among the most competitive producers in the world, but they cannot compete against products that are sold at unfairly low prices and subsidized by the Government of China,"" Brock said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday as weak Chinese and Japanese industrial data triggered concerns of an economic slowdown that could lower oil demand, and as an industry data report showed an increase in U.S. crude stockpiles amid soaring output. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) was down 31 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $62.70 a barrel by 0446 GMT, after falling 90 cents in the previous session. 
Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 40 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $66.23 a barrel. On Tuesday, Brent fell 87 cents to $66.63. 
Traders said oil prices declined on concerns of a slowdown in the global economy after China reported on Wednesday that factory growth in February was at its lowest since July 2016. 
China is the world's second-biggest economy and the biggest importer of oil after overtaking the Unites States last year. Crude oil demand is highly correlated to economic growth. 
While China's week-long Lunar New Year holiday this month disrupted business activity, traders also pointed to tougher pollution rules that curtailed factory output. 
In Japan, the world's third-largest economy, industrial output in January took its biggest tumble since a devastating earthquake in March 2011, highlighting a weakening in demand and a build up of inventory. 
In the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, rising crude stockpiles weighed on prices. 
Data on Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute showed that crude inventories rose by 933,000 barrels in the week to Feb. 23, to 421.2 million barrels. 
Refinery crude runs dropped by 209,000 barrels per day (bpd), the API data also showed, implying a drop in demand for feedstock crude. Gasoline stocks rose by 1.9 million barrels. 
Official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due out later on Wednesday. 
Soaring U.S. production has pressured oil prices at a time when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia have reduced output to support prices. 
""Climbing U.S. production continues to weigh on the market as traders fear that the OPEC output cuts will be nullified by the rising U.S. output,"" said William O'Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia's Rivkin Securities. 
U.S. crude oil production has risen by a fifth since mid-2016 to more than 10 million bpd .

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for March delivery lost 1.4% $63.01 to settle at $63.91 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent fell 77 cents to trade at $66.52 a barrel.
""U.S. shale growth is very strong, the pace is very strong ... The United States will become the No.1 oil producer sometime very soon,"" IEA Director Fatih Birol told Reuters.
The comments renewed investor fears that rising US output may weigh on major oil producers’ efforts to rid the market of excess supply, and comes a day after Saudi Arabian oil minister Khalid al-Falih reaffirmed the country’s commitment to rebalance the market.
The oil cartel together with Russia agreed in November to extend the 1.8 million bpd output cuts through 2018, to rid the market of excess supplies.
Also furthering negative sentiment on oil prices were expectations that the Energy Information Administration’s weekly report will show a build in domestic supplies amid reduced refinery activity. This time of the year traditionally sees refinery activity slow, this in turn, lowers demand for crude while raising the prospect of a build in supplies.
Crude's struggle to pare losses was exacerbated by a sharp upswing in the dollar which followed Fed chair Jerome Powell's upbeat comments on inflation and economic growth raising the prospect of four rate hikes in 2018.
Dollar-denominated assets such as oil are sensitive to moves in the dollar – a rise in the dollar tends to make oil more expensive for holders of foreign currency and thus, reduces demand.
The American Petroleum Institute weekly inventory report is slated for Tuesday after US markets close, while the EIA issues its supply totals Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. ET expected to show crude supplies rose by 2.422 million barrels."

Gold futures for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $16.20, or 1.22%, to $1,316.40 a troy ounce.
“We’ve seen some data that will in my case add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target,” Powell said. “We’ve also seen continued strength around the globe, and we’ve seen fiscal policy become more stimulative.”
That raised the chances of a Fed rate hike in the fourth quarter of this year to about 50%. With a March rate hike all but guaranteed, the chances of rate hikes in the second and third quarters rose to about 80% and 70%, respectively. This would imply U.S. interest rates could surge to a range of 2.25% to 2.5% by year-end from the current range of 1.25 to 1.50% . 
The dollar hit 3-weeks highs, while the 10-year yields moved off lows to trade within touching distance of 3%, leaving gold prices on track to post a monthly loss. 
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures fell 1.39% to $16.32 a troy ounce, while platinum futures lost 1.65% to $1.63 an ounce.
Copper fell 1.16% to $3.187, while natural gas rose 0.37% to $2.70."
185,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>","EU to act if U.S. introduces steel tariffs, Germany warns","By Gernot Heller
BERLIN (Reuters) - European Union trade ministers agreed at a meeting on Tuesday that they would respond with counter-measures if the United States brings in import tariffs on steel and aluminum, German deputy economy minister Matthias Machnig said.
He said the introduction of tariffs, which has been floated by U.S. President Donald Trump, was incompatible with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and unjustifiable on national security grounds.
""I said we are preparing all options,"" Machnig told reporters on a conference call, adding that there was unanimous agreement that the European Commission and member countries ""need to take appropriate precautions"".
But he said they did not know yet whether Trump would really follow the suggestion of U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and impose customs or quotas on imports.
The U.S. Commerce Department has recommended that Trump impose steep curbs on steel and aluminum imports from China and other countries, ranging from global and country-specific tariffs to broad import quotas. Trump has until April to make a decision.
Trump said on Monday he wants to bring the steel industry back to America even if it means applying tariffs to imports from other countries, but the White House said he has not made a final decision on the issue.
Machnig said the Europeans thought the idea that such import restrictions could be justified by to risks to national security was ""absurd"".
But he said there was no detailed discussion about how the Europeans would respond if Trump decides to restrict imports of steel and aluminum.
The European countries were not as unified on what to do to protect companies against foreign takeovers made via so-called third-country investors from the outside the EU.
Machnig said big European countries like Germany, France, Italy, Spain and several more backed the European Commission's suggestions on that but there was a second group of countries that still needed to discuss this.
In September European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker proposed limiting China's ability to buy up European companies in infrastructure, hi-tech manufacturing and energy.
Machnig said it was important that the EU countries did not compete with each other for foreign investors on this issue. He said the plan remained to decide on appropriate protective measures by 2018. 
On Monday, after Chinese automaker Geely's purchase of a stake in Daimler, German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries was quoted as saying Germany must be careful that its economic openness is not exploited as a gateway for other countries' interests.

Other issues discussed at the EU trade ministers' meeting in Sofia were agreeing on a free trade agreement with the South American Mercosur countries as quickly as possible, as well as with Mexico, and strengthening the WTO.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude April contract was down 18 cents or about 0.28% at $63.73 a barrel by 10:00 a.m. ET (14:00 GMT), just off Monday's more three-week highs of $64.22.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London slipped 10 cents or about 0.15% to $67.19 a barrel, after hitting a more than two-week peak of $67.65 in the previous session.
Oil prices strengthened after Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih said over the weekend that the country's oil production in January-March would be well below output caps, with exports averaging below 7 million barrels per day (bpd).
Falih added that he hopes global oil producers will be able to create a permanent framework to stabilize oil markets after the current supply cut deal ends this year.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
The commodity also remained supported after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported last week that crude oil inventories fell by 1.6 million barrels and that oil production slipped to 10.27 million bpd from 10.271 million bpd.
Market participants were now looking ahead to fresh information on U.S. stockpiles. The American Petroleum Institute was set to publish its weekly report later Tuesday, while official data by the U.S. Energy Information Administration was expected on Wednesday.

Front-month U.S. natural gas futures shed 1.5 cents, or around 0.6%, to $2.671 per million British thermal units (btu) by 9:35AM ET (1435GMT). It rose to $2.723 in the last session, its best level since Feb. 9.
The commodity notched a gain of 1.1% on Monday, as updated weather forecasting models showed a return to colder weather over the eastern U.S. during the first week of March.
Despite recent gains, market experts warned that futures are likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term as the coldest part of the winter has effectively passed.
Natural gas prices are down nearly 22% since late January amid speculation the end of the winter heating season will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for the fuel.
Spring usually sees the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 68 and 78 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Feb. 23.
That compares with a decline of 124 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 7 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 118 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 1.760 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
That figure is 609 bcf, or around 25.7%, lower than levels at this time a year ago, and 412 bcf, or roughly 19.0%, below the five-year average for this time of year.

190,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 04:31AM ET</span>",Electric Vehicle Fervor Inspires Another Bleak Gasoline Forecast,"(Bloomberg) -- The Boston Consulting Group added its voice to the chorus of forecasts predicting a slump in U.S. gasoline consumption as electric vehicles become popular and internal combustion engines turn more efficient.
Demand for the fuel in the world’s biggest oil consumer may drop by a third by 2035, the firm said in a report titled “Are Oil Companies Ready for the Next Energy Transition in the U.S.?” that was published on Monday.
“Over the next two decades, changes to the U.S. energy landscape could cause a steep decline in domestic gasoline consumption,” wrote the report’s authors, including Marie-Helene Ben Samoun and Clint Follette.
A growing body of research is painting a bearish picture for oil beyond the next 20 years as more environmentally friendly vehicles hit roads across the globe. Rapid adoption of EVs could mean oil demand peaks by the 2030s, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  BP  (LON:BP) Plc, a prospect that’s likely to worry institutional investors in the energy industry.
But not everyone is pessimistic, and consumption growth has remained strong in recent years, aided by a global economic recovery. The threat to oil demand from electric vehicles and the anti-fossil fuel movement are overblown, according to Maynard Holt, the chief executive officer of Houston-based investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.
Investors are overestimating how quickly demand will shift to EVs, according to Pierre Lassonde, the chairman of Franco-Nevada Corp., the world’s most valuable streaming and royalty company. In India, a major oil consumer, gasoline and diesel consumption is seen doubling over the period through 2030, even though the nation aspires to sell only electric vehicles by the end of the next decade.
New Cars
The Boston Consulting Group said in its report that electric vehicles could account for about 20 percent of new U.S. car registrations by 2030, leading to a 30-35 percent drop in American gasoline consumption by 2035, compared with 2015 levels. It predicted last year that battery-powered cars will make up about half of the global automotive market by 2030, as environmental regulations, falling prices and the deployment of driverless taxis fuel demand.
“Judging from the experience of other industries, the transitions -- when they come -- will happen faster than established players expect,” it said. “Electric vehicle ownership could raise dramatically over the next decade, eroding demand for conventional vehicles.”
The consultant said that demand for jet fuel, marine fuel and feedstock for the petrochemical industry will grow strongly until 2035, in part offsetting the decline in gasoline consumption. Yet, their growth won’t be enough to compensate refiners for the loss of revenue.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The United States will overtake Russia as the world's biggest oil producer by 2019 at the latest, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday, as the country's shale oil boom continues to upend global markets.
IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said at an event in Tokyo the United States would overtake Russia as the biggest crude oil producer ""definitely next year"", if not this year.
""U.S. shale growth is very strong, the pace is very strong ... The United States will become the No.1 oil producer sometime very soon,"" he told Reuters separately. 
U.S. crude oil output  rose above 10 million barrels per day (bpd) late last year for the first time since the 1970s, overtaking top oil exporter Saudi Arabia . 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said early this month that U.S. output would exceed 11 million bpd by late 2018. That would take it past top producer Russia, which pumps just below that mark . 
Birol said he did not see U.S. oil production peaking before 2020, and that he did not expect a decline in the next four to five years. 
The soaring U.S. production is upending global oil markets, coming at a time when other major producers - including Russia and members of the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) - have been withholding output to prop up prices (LCOc1). 
U.S. oil is also increasingly being exported, including to the world's biggest and fastest growing markets in Asia, eating away at OPEC and Russian market share. 
Meanwhile, U.S. net imports of crude oil  fell last week by 1.6 million bpd to 4.98 million bpd, the lowest level since the EIA started recording the data in 2001, reflecting further erosion in a market OPEC has been relying on for decades. 
Birol said production growth was not just strong in the United States. 
""Canada, especially the oil sands, and Brazilian offshore projects. These are the two major (non-U.S.) drivers,"" he said.
On the demand side, Birol said the IEA expected growth of around 1.4 million bpd in 2018.

195,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 10:42PM ET</span>",Oil Prices Flat Amid Mixed Signals ,"Investing.com - Oil prices were flat Tuesday morning in Asia due to mixed cues from the Middle East, Asia and the U.S.
Crude Oil WTI Futures for April delivery were trading at $63.91 a barrel in Asia at 10:45pm ET, neither up nor down. Brent crude futures for May delivery, traded in London, were down just 0.09% at $67.28 per barrel at 10:50am Hong Kong time.
Oil prices have zigzagged between mild gains and losses over the past weeks due to mixed cues. Saudi Arabia’s oil minister said on Saturday that the Kingdom hoped the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would ease production restraints next year after the current supply cut deal ends this year.
In an effort to stabilize oil markets, OPEC has been curbing output by around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) since January 2017, and the pact would run until the end of 2018.
While the effort has helped somewhat to support oil prices, the U.S. has continued to increase its oil production, filling the gap in supply created by OPEC and thus pushing prices down.
The U.S has increased its production by more than 20% since mid-2016 to more than 10 million bpd. At this rate of production increase, the U.S. is set to overtake Russia in crude oil output by late 2018, making it the largest global supplier.
Meanwhile, demand continues to surge in Asia, particularly China, which emerged as a top buyer of U.S. crude last year. A recent report from Rystad Energy also forecasted that oil production in East and Southeast Asia would drop by 20 percent between 2017 and 2025, further boosting demand.
Next month, Saudi Arabia will reduce its oil production by 100,000 bpd and cut its exports to below 7 million bpd, a move that would further curb the global oversupply and support oil markets."

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil dipped on Tuesday before weekly data that is forecast to show rising U.S. crude inventories, although investor confidence in OPEC's ability to curb output helped stem the price slide.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) eased 6 cents to $67.44 a barrel by 1519 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) fell 12 cents to $63.79.
The American Petroleum Institute releases its weekly figures on U.S. crude inventories later on Tuesday. Stocks are forecast to have risen by 2.7 million barrels last week, according to a Reuters poll.
Inventories have fallen by more than 100 million barrels, or a quarter, in the last 12 months, to their lowest in three years. Seasonally, stocks tend to build in the first three months of the year.
But soaring U.S. production is upending global oil markets at a time when other major producers - including the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia - have been withholding output to prop up prices.
The United States will overtake Russia as the world's biggest oil producer by 2019, International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Tuesday.
""U.S. shale growth is very strong, the pace is very strong ... The United States will become the No.1 oil producer sometime very soon,"" he told Reuters.
U.S. output was 10.27 million barrels per day (bpd), according to government data released on Thursday, higher than the latest figures for the world's largest exporter Saudi Arabia and just below Russia. 
In addition to its weekly statistics, the U.S. Energy Information Administration will publish a monthly report on crude supply, which analysts expect to include substantial upward revisions to U.S. oil output.
""It is likely that the ... monthly data will show U.S. crude oil production in December about 200,000-300,000 bpd above what was estimated in the weekly reports,"" Petromatrix analyst Olivier Jakob said in a note.
A steadier dollar also undermined the crude oil market. A stronger U.S. currency can encourage investors to book profits on their holdings of dollar-priced commodities, stocks or bonds.
""Our technical analysts are saying (oil) is bearish unless we break above $67.70,"" SEB head of commodity strategy Bjarne Schieldrop said. 
""It's been rejected exactly at that level ... and that is where the price action is today. It's at a level where it's a tie between 'back to bullish or back to bearish'.""

197,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 03:01PM ET</span>",Farm groups urge Trump not to weaken U.S. biofuel policy,"By Jarrett Renshaw
(Reuters) - U.S. farm groups urged President Donald Trump in a letter on Monday not to weaken the nation's biofuels policy requiring corn-based ethanol to be blended into gasoline, calling it a critical engine of rural American jobs.
Trump is due to meet with senators and cabinet members on Tuesday to discuss potential tweaks to the law, called the Renewable Fuel Standard, that would help oil refiners who have increasingly complained the program costs them a fortune.
""As you meet this week to discuss these issues, we ask that you not entertain proposals that would undermine the purpose and intent of the RFS,"" according to the letter, signed by the heads of six farm groups, including the National Corn Growers Association and the American Farm Bureau Federation.
""Any action that seeks to weaken the RFS for the benefit of a handful of refiners will, by extension, be borne on the backs of our farmers,"" according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
The RFS requires oil refiners to cover the cost of blending increasing amounts of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation's fuels each year. The policy was adopted during President George W. Bush's administration to help farmers, cut petroleum imports and lower pollutant emissions.
Under the program, refiners must earn or purchase biofuel blending credits called RINs to prove that they are complying. As biofuels volume quotas have increased over the years, so have prices for the credits – meaning refiners that must buy them are facing rising costs.
Oil refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), which employs more than a thousand people in Philadelphia, declared bankruptcy last month and blamed the regulation for its demise. Reuters reported other factors may also have played a role in the company's bankruptcy, including the withdrawal of more than $590 million in dividend-style payments from the refinery by its investor owners.
Trump is due to discuss potential changes to the RFS on Tuesday with Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of corn state Iowa, along with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, and potentially Energy Secretary Rick Perry, according to sources familiar with the matter.

While a handful of proposals will be considered, the sources said, past efforts to change the RFS have been stymied by strong opposition by corn lobbyists.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for March delivery rose 36 cents to settle at $63.91 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 23 cents to trade at $67.27 a barrel.
""A study is taking place and once we know exactly what balancing the market will entail we will announce what is the next step. The next step may be easing of the production constraints,"" said Saudi Arabian oil minister Khalid al-Falih.
The oil cartel together with Russia agreed in November to extend the 1.8 million bpd output cuts through 2018, to rid the market of excess supplies.
The comments came a day after Baker Hughes on Friday showed the number of oil rigs operating in the US jumped by one to 799, the highest level since April 2, 2015.
Sentiment on oil was also supported by expectations for an increase in crude demand as the cold snap engulfing Europe is expected to encourage some refiners to shelve plans momentarily to enter a period of maintenance.
This time of the year traditionally sees refinery activity slow, this in turn, lowers demand for crude while raising the prospect of a build in supplies. Crude supplies unexpected fell last week, however, as producers were encouraged to sell rather than store crude as current prices traded at a premium to forward prices – a market structure known as backwardation.
Despite the uptick in crude prices money managers appeared to be less bullish on the oil prices, reducing their WTI net-long position – the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a drop – for a fourth week in the period ended Feb. 20, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data."

Bank of Montreal (BMO) said Friday it doesn’t expect any material change in the official tone from the Federal Reserve as the best near-term outcome for Powell is policy continuity until there is “clear evidence” that inflation is overheating or the real economy is stumbling.
Gold benefits from a fall in bond yields which limits the opportunity cost of holding non-interest yielding assets such as bullion.

Front-month U.S. natural gas futures tacked on 5.4 cents, or around 2%, to $2.711 per million British thermal units (btu) by 8:05AM ET (1305GMT). It rose to its best level since Feb. 8 earlier in the session.
The commodity notched a gain of around 2.6% last week, as updated weather forecasting models showed a return to colder weather over the eastern U.S. during the first week of March.
Despite recent gains, market experts warned that futures are likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term as the coldest part of the winter has effectively passed.
Natural gas prices are down nearly 22% since late January amid speculation the end of the winter heating season will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for the fuel.
Spring usually sees the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 68 and 78 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Feb. 23.
That compares with a decline of 124 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 7 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 118 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 1.760 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

207,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 25, 2018 10:24PM ET</span>",Oil Prices Climb On Monday As Asia’s Oil Production Drops,"Investing.com - Oil prices are up Monday morning in Asia, boosted by a new report from Rystad Energy forecasting oil production in East and Southeast Asia will drop by 20 percent between 2017 and 2025.
Crude Oil WTI Futures for April delivery were trading at $63.88 a barrel in Asia at 19:45am ET, up 0.52%. Brent crude futures for April delivery, traded in London, were up 0.39% at $67.30 per barrel.
Oil production in Asia is eroding sharply due to natural depletion in mature oil fields. Total oil production in East and Southeast Asia is set to decline from 13.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) to 10.4 million boe/d by 2025, according to Rystad Energy.
Underpinning the decline in output is the diminishing volume of new oil discoveries in East and Southeast Asia. The past decade and a half has seen fewer and fewer new sources of oil, while the limited volume of new oil discovered may not translate into production.
China’s oil production will decline the least, with the giant Changqing field continuing to support stable output and likely to contribute over 1 million boe/d over the next five years.
With that said, China’s output has still declined quite a bit in recent years. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts China will produce an average of 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, down by 0.5 million bpd since 2015.
Oil demand from East and Southeast Asia, on the other hand, is soaring. China emerged as a top buyer of U.S. crude last year. The shipment of crude oil that just left the newly upgraded Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) also appears to be heading for China, and this will likely become an increasing trend.
BP predicts that China and India alone would make up half of total growth in global energy demand over the next 30 years, according to its annual Energy Outlook, released last week.
Oil markets are therefore well supported with Asia’s oil production dropping fast as its demand soars."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices extended gains to hit their highest level in nearly three weeks on Monday, supported by comments from Saudi Arabia that it would continue to curb exports in line with the OPEC-led effort to cut global supplies.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery was up 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $63.75 a barrel by 0342 GMT after rising 3 percent last week.
London Brent crude gained 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $67.43, after climbing nearly 4 percent last week.
Both benchmarks earlier hit their highest since Feb. 7.
""The rise in equities made it easier to buy risk assets such as oil,"" said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting in Tokyo. 
""But amid worries over U.S. crude production at near record highs, oil is struggling to make a move.""
Prices were supported after Saudi Arabian oil minister Khalid al-Falih on Saturday said the country's crude production in January-March would be well below output caps, with exports averaging below 7 million barrels per day (bpd).
Saudi Arabia hopes OPEC and its allies will be able to relax production curbs next year and create a permanent framework to stabilize oil markets after the current supply cut deal ends this year, Falih added.
""A study is taking place and once we know exactly what balancing the market will entail we will announce what is the next step. The next step may be easing of the production constraints,"" he told reporters in New Delhi.
""My estimation is that it will happen sometime in 2019. But we don't know when and we don't know how"".

Wednesday’s minutes of the Fed's Jan. 30-31 policy meeting showed that policymakers plan to continue gradually lifting rates with economic growth picking up.

For the week, WTI crude rose nearly 3%, while Brent added about 3.8%, as both continue to claw back ground lost in a selloff earlier this month.
Sentiment was boosted after Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih said it was clear oil markets are rebalancing, and added that he expects inventories to continue to decline in 2018.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, have been restraining production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to curb the market of excess supply. The arrangement, which was adopted last winter, expires at the end of 2018.

U.S. oil production, driven by shale extraction, held steady at an all-time high of 10.27 million bpd last week, keeping it above Saudi Arabia's output levels and within reach of Russia, the world's biggest crude producer.
Analysts and traders have recently warned that booming U.S. shale oil production could potentially derail OPEC's effort to end a supply glut.

""We are waiting for a decision of the European Commission on the subject,"" Fallico said, referring to possible restrictions on the financing of Nord Stream-2, an undersea pipeline between Russia and Germany designed by Russia's Gazprom (MM:GAZP).
Fallico had said last year that Intesa was studying options to finance the pipeline but lacked understanding about Western sanctions against Moscow.
The United States and the European Union imposed financial and economic sanctions on Russia in 2014 for its role in the Ukrainian crisis. The restrictions targeted Russian individuals as well as the banking and energy sectors, limiting their access to global financing.
Austrian energy company OMB , a financial partner of Nord Stream-2, said last year that financing large Russian projects had become almost impossible after the United States imposed sanctions.
In the RIA interview, Fallico said if the European Commission decided not to slap sanctions on the pipeline, Intesa would be ready to take part in the project. Otherwise, Intesa and other potential partners would be unable to provide financing, he said.
""Anyway, it should become clear after Russia's presidential election,"" Fallico was quoted as saying.
Russia will hold a presidential vote on March 18, with the incumbent Vladimir Putin widely expected to secure another term.

Fallico also said the EU economy would take a hit if sanctions blocked the development of Nord Stream-2.

""I think that in the first half of this year, we will have recovered 70 percent of production,"" he said.
Venezuela's oil production dropped by nearly 13 percent last year according to figures released by OPEC in January, hitting a 28-year low that suggested a deepening economic crisis and increased chances of a debt default.

Official data from the General Administration of Customs showed a fourth straight month of no diesel, gasoline or fuel oil shipments. China has traditionally been the main source of North Korea's fuel.
The only oil product sent to North Korea was 201 tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
The export breakdown by product comes after data on Friday showed trade with North Korea fell to the lowest level in dollar terms on records going back to June 2014.
China remains North Korea's largest trading partner and sole major ally, though overall trade has fallen in recent months as the United Nations stepped up sanctions, banning imports of some major commodities and seafood in September and capping annual oil product shipments in December.
China imported no iron ore, coal or lead from North Korea last month, according to the customs data, in line with those latest curbs, aimed at persuading Pyongyang to abandon its weapons program.
Cereal trade also slowed, with exports of rice totaling 180 tonnes to North Korea, down 4.3 percent from a year ago. It did not export any corn.
The pace of that slowdown in business has accelerated in recent months with exports of petroleum and some grains almost grinding to a halt in November and December.
The data release came after the Trump administration on Friday imposed its largest package of sanctions against North Korea in a bid to increase pressure on Pyongyang for its nuclear and ballistic missile tests.
In a speech on Thursday, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said that the penalties are having an impact because North Korea now has less money to spend on its ballistic missile tests.
Last year, North Korea conducted dozens of missile launches and its sixth and largest nuclear test in defiance of U.N. resolutions as it pursues its goal of developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States.
China has repeatedly said it is fully enforcing all resolutions against North Korea, despite suspicion in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo that loopholes still exist.

The number of oil rigs operating in the US jumped by one to 799, the highest level since April 2, 2015, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes, pointing to further expansion in US output.
Offsetting that, however, was an earlier report of a dip in Libyan production as the country’s El Feel oilfield shutdown, which produces 70,000 barrels per day of crude.
Also helping WTI crude to a second-straight weekly gain were upbeat comments from Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih who said it was clear oil markets are rebalancing, and added that he expects inventories to continue to decline in 2018.
Al-Falih’s comments come in the wake of steady US production, threatening to derail major oil producers efforts to reduce global oil supplies to OPEC’s five year average. The oil cartel together with Russia agreed in December to extend the 1.8 million bpd output cuts through 2018, to rid the market of excess supplies.
The Energy Information Administration’s weekly inventory totals showed US crude production remained close to its highest level in nearly half a decade at 10.27 million barrels. This keeps the US on track to meet the EIA’s recent estimate for domestic production to top 11 million barrels per day by year-end."

Gold futures for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $2.10, or 0.16%, to $1,330.70 a troy ounce.
The Federal Reserve in its monetary policy report said the pace of wage gains was moderate, weighed by low productivity. The monetary policy report was released ahead of Fed chair Jerome Powell’s testimony to Congress on Feb. 27 to allow members of Congress and the public time to review the report.
“The economic expansion continues to be supported by steady job gains, rising household wealth, favorable consumer sentiment, strong economic growth abroad, and accommodative financial conditions,” the report said.
Losses in the yellow metal were limited somewhat by an ongoing fall in US bond yields – which move in the opposite direction to Treasury prices – from four-year highs, which some said could be the start of a long overdue correction to the recent fall in Treasury prices.
Gold is sensitive to moves lower in bond yields which limits the opportunity cost of holding non-interest yielding assets such as bullion.
The CFTC Commitment of Traders (COT) report due later is expected to provide traders with an insight into whether sentiment on the yellow metal has improved after the report last week showed bullish bets on gold fell for the fourth-straight week.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures fell 0.58% to $16.49 a troy ounce, while platinum futures fell 0.14% to $998 an ounce.
Copper rose 1.03% to $3.21, while natural gas fell 1.40% to $2.60."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has called a meeting early next week with key senators and Cabinet officials to discuss potential changes to biofuels policy, which is coming under increasing pressure after a Pennsylvania refiner blamed the regulation for its bankruptcy, according to four sources familiar with the matter.
The meeting comes as the oil industry and corn lobby – powerful forces in Washington – clash over the future of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a decade-old regulation that requires refiners to cover the cost of mixing biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into their fuel.
Trump's engagement reflects the high political stakes of protecting jobs in a key electoral state. Oil refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), which employs more than a thousand people in Philadelphia, declared bankruptcy last month and blamed the regulation for its demise.
The meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, will include Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, along with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, and potentially Energy Secretary Rick Perry, according to the four sources, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
One source said the meeting would focus on short-term solutions to help PES continue operating. PES is asking a bankruptcy judge to shed roughly $350 million of its current RFS compliance costs, owed to the EPA which administers the program, as part of its restructuring package.
The other sources said the meeting will consider whether to cap prices for biofuel credits called RINs, let higher-ethanol blends be sold all year, and efforts to get speculators out of the market.
Prices for ethanol RIN credits were trading at 62 cents each on Friday morning, down from 66 cents each on Thursday, according to traders.
Officials at the EPA, Agriculture Department, and Energy Department declined to comment. A White House official, Kelly Love, said she had no announcement on the matter at this time.
The offices of Cruz, Ernst and Grassley did not immediately return requests for comment. 
The sources said the options moving forward would be constrained by political and legal realities that have derailed previous efforts at reform.
The Trump administration has already considered changes to the RFS sought by refiners this year - including reducing the amount of biofuels required to be blended annually under the regulation, or shifting the responsibility for blending to supply terminals - only to retreat in the face of opposition from corn-state lawmakers.
NARROW OPTIONS, BROAD RESISTANCE
The EPA is expected to weigh in officially in the coming weeks on PES's request to the bankruptcy judge to be released from its compliance obligations. But any such move would likely draw a backlash from other U.S. refiners, who have no hope of receiving a waiver.
Under the RFS, refiners must earn or purchase blending credits to prove they are complying with the regulation. As biofuels volumes quotas have increased, so have prices for the credits - meaning refiners that invested in blending facilities have benefited while those that have not, such as PES, have had to pay up.
PES said its RFS compliance costs exceeded its payroll last year, and ranked only behind the cost of purchasing crude oil.
Other issues may have contributed to PES's financial difficulties. Reuters reported that PES's investor backers withdrew from the company more than $594 million in a series of dividend-style distributions since 2012, even as regional refining economics slumped.
Regulators and lawmakers have been considering how to cut the cost of the RFS to the oil industry.
In recent months, for example, the EPA has contemplated expanding its use of an exemption available to small refineries - a move that would likely push down RIN prices, but which both the oil and corn industries have said would be unfair. 
Cruz last year proposed limiting the price of RINs to 10 cents, a fraction of their current value – an idea that was roundly rejected by the ethanol industry as a disincentive for new ethanol blending infrastructure investment. 

Senator John Cornyn, also a Texas Republican, is preparing draft legislation to overhaul the RFS in Congress that would include the creation of a new specialized RIN credit intended to push down prices - but it too faces resistance from both the corn and oil lobbies.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude April contract was up 15 cents or about 0.27% at $62.92 a barrel by 10:05 a.m. ET (14:05 GMT), just off a more than two-week high of $63.09 hit on Thursday.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rose 14 cents or about 0.24% to $66.56 a barrel, after hitting a more than two-week peak of $66.56 on Thursday.
Oil prices were boosted on news the El Feel oilfield in Libya producing 70,000 bpd was shut down, due to unrest.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Thursday that crude oil inventories fell by 1.6 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 16, compared to expectations for a gain of around 1.8 million barrels.
The report came a day after the American Petroleum Institute reported a supply-drop of around 0.9 million barrels.
Both reports come out one day later than usual due to Monday's President's Day holiday.
However fears that rising U.S. output could dampen global efforts to rid the market of excess supplies have systematically limited oil prices' gains recently.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
Elsewhere, gasoline futures gained 0.45% to $1.775 a gallon, while natural gas futures lost 1.56% to $2.593 per million British thermal units."
219,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>",Bond Buyers Now Love the Commodity Producers They Once Hated,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are piling back into riskier commodity companies amid signs that the sector rout is firmly in the rear-view mirror.
First Quantum Minerals Ltd. increased the size and lowered the cost on a portion of its high-yield bond deal this week as oil hovers back above $60 a barrel and metals trade near multi-year highs.  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc reported record profit -- and a surprise dividend payout, which debt investors won’t like -- the latest in a turnaround that saw the firm embark on an aggressive debt-cutting plan in 2015 to avoid a downgrade to junk.
High-yield oil-and-gas and mining companies are buoyed by expectations that the commodity sector default rate will fall to 1.8 percent this year from 4.9 percent in 2017, when it accounted for the highest number of defaults by industry, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Overall corporate defaults are expected to drop to the lowest level since 2011.
Steadier commodity prices and earnings that show plentiful cash balances and strong profits are luring investors at a time when it’s getting trickier to find value in credit.
“Clearly there’s a complete reversal of sentiment on that sector compared to two or three years ago,” Olivier Monnoyeur, a portfolio manager at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) Asset Management U.K. Ltd., said by phone from London. “That is supporting good demand for a commodity bond deal.”
Junk-rated commodity companies are supported by a stronger economic picture globally as inflation expectations mount in the U.S., and Chinese government infrastructure stimulus continues to drive demand. Federal Reserve officials increased their optimism at January’s policy meeting about hitting their 2 percent inflation target and suggested more tightening would be needed.
“It should be pretty constructive for commodity prices,” Will Smith, a portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein Holding LP, which manages about $35 billion in high-yield. “If you layer in the fact that these companies have largely cleaned up their balance sheets and really shouldn’t have any liquidity issues in the near-term, they’re actually in a pretty good space.”
AllianceBernstein has participated in some new issues and they see value energy names with yields above 8 percent in the current environment, he said. The commodity complex is trading at a discount of about 100 basis points to 150 basis points to the rest of the market, Smith said.
High-yield credit spreads have compressed this year on strong investor demand, hitting their lowest level in more than 10 years in late January, to currently yield about 6.14 percent, according to the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) High Yield Index. Energy issuers have sold more than $13 billion of high-yield bonds this year, the fastest start on record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
First Quantum increased the size of its high-yield bond sale to $1.85 billion from a $1.5 billion target, pricing the $1 billion tranche of eight-year bonds at a lower coupon rate than initially discussed.
The recovery has also seen companies that were downgraded to high-yield make the trip back to investment-grade, which bodes well for investor sentiment, Monnoyeur said.
To be sure, junk-rated debt saw signs of weakness earlier this month, as market volatility spread from stocks to riskier credit amid concern about rising interest rates, which erode bond value. About $10.9 billion was taken from high-yield bond funds during the week ended Feb. 14, the second highest outflow on record. West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell below $60 a barrel for the first time since December.
“We don’t think the downside is anywhere close to where it was in 2016,” Smith said. AllianceBernstein’s worst-case scenario for oil is in the mid-$40s. “In that range, a lot of these commodity producers will do pretty well.”"

Comex gold futures were steady at $1,331.9 a troy ounce by 08:20 a.m. ET (12:20 GMT), just off Thursday's one-and-a-half week lows of $1,322.90.
The greenback remained broadly supported after the minutes of the Federal Reserve's January policy meeting showed that central bank officials see increased economic growth and rising inflation as justification to continue to raise interest rates gradually.
The dollar had been pressured lower recently by expectations for a faster pace of monetary tightening outside the U.S., which would lessen the divergence between the Fed and other central banks.
The U.S. currency was also boosted after the Labor Department reported on Thursday that initial jobless claims fell by 7,000 to 222,000 last week, compared to expectations for jobless claims to total 230,000.
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.21% at 89.84, just off a one-and-a-half week high of 90.17 hit on Thursday.

The U.S. Commerce Department this week imposed more import duties on biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia, adding anti-dumping duties to already steep anti-subsidy duties on the fuels.
The latest duties make it virtually certain that biodiesel from the two countries will not be sold in the U.S. market, with combined rates of up to 159 percent on Argentine fuel and up to 341 percent on Indonesian product.
""The anti-dumping duty and countervailing duty decisions against Indonesian biodiesel together represent a clear abuse of the trade remedy laws,"" Indonesia's Trade Ministry said in a statement. 
The ministry said the U.S. Commerce Department in its argument against Indonesian biodiesel used the same methodology applied by the European Union, which Indonesia said ""blatantly violates WTO law."" 
The WTO last month ruled in favor of several challenges by Indonesia to anti-dumping duties imposed on its biodiesel exports to the EU and asked that measures be changed.
Indonesia has not exported biodiesel to the United States since last year due to the import duties, according to the Indonesian Association of Biofuel Producers.
The Argentine Chamber of Biofuels (CARBIO) said on Thursday the increased U.S. duties were ""arbitrary and illegal"" and it expected the government to take the matter to the WTO.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 04:39AM ET</span>",U.S. shale investors still waiting on payoff from oil boom,"By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil production has topped 10 million barrels per day, approaching a record set in 1970, but many investors in the companies driving the shale oil revolution are still waiting for their payday.
Shale producers have raised and spent billions of dollars to produce more oil and gas, ending decades of declining output and redrawing the global energy trade map. But most U.S. shale producers have failed for years to turn a profit with the increased output, frustrating their financial backers.
Wall Street's patience ran out late last year as investors called for producers to shift more cash to dividends and share buybacks.
""'Give me some cash, please.' That's what investors have said,"" said Anoop Poddar, a partner at private equity firm Energy Ventures.
And yet such calls for payouts remain a debate in the industry as oil prices have recently creeped up to four-year highs. Investors demanding immediate returns could risk forcing firms to curb expansion that could have a higher long-term payoff if oil prices continue to rise.
(For an interactive graphic charting the global impacts of the U.S. shale oil boom, see: tmsnrt.rs/2EtJgen )
For now, share prices of shale producers have yet to fully recover from the 2014 oil price (CLc1) collapse, when many investors took losses as hundreds of firms went bankrupt and those that survived struggled.
The energy sector has lagged the rally that took the broader stock market to record highs. The S&P 500 Energy Index (SPNY) remains nearly a third off its peak in mid-2014, when oil prices (CLc1) (LCOc1) topped $100 a barrel. The broader S&P 500 index (INX) is up 39 percent during the same period.
A Reuters analysis of corporate dividend disclosures shows a split in how shale firms are reacting to increased pressure from investors - and the impact on their market value.
This year, five of the 15 largest U.S. independent shale firms have started paying or raised quarterly dividends, the documents show. But six of the firms have never offered a dividend or have not restored cuts implemented since the 2014 oil price collapse.
Anadarko Petroleum Corp (N:APC) earlier this month added $500 million to an existing buyback program and raised its dividend by 20 percent, sending its shares up 4.5 percent the next trading day. Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding, boosting the value of stock that remains. 
Shares in  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co (N:PXD) also rose 4 percent immediately after raising its dividend four-fold and posting better-than-forecast fourth quarter results earlier this month. Tim Dove, Pioneer's chief executive, called the increase ""a step toward our goal of returning cash to shareholders.""
Companies that have resisted boosting dividends, by contrast, have seen their valuations fall.
Of the six, shares in four -  Cimarex Energy  Co (N:XEC),  Devon Energy  Corp (N:DVN),  Parsley Energy  Inc (N:PE) and  Noble Energy  Inc (N:NBL) - have lost at least 19 percent in the last 12 months. Only one,  Continental Resources Inc  (N:CLR), is higher than a year ago. 
Four producers, including  Hess Corp  (N:HES), kept dividends steady through the downturn.
A PASS FOR SMALL, HIGH-GROWTH FIRMS
Recent oil price gains have eased the pressure from shareholders.
In January, U.S. oil futures (CLc1) jumped to $66.14 a barrel, up 56 percent from last year's low and at a level not seen in four years.
Since then, prices have cooled to about $63 a barrel, but remain 17 percent above a year ago, boosting cash flow for firms that have expanded output.
""A lot of these smaller companies have gotten a pass for outspending cash flow due to their very high growth rates,"" said Todd Heltman of asset manager Neuberger Berman, which invests in shale producers.
Shale output growth continues to outpace forecasts. The U.S. Energy Information Administration this month said United States production could top 11 million barrels per day by the end of 2018, a year earlier than it had expected just a month ago. 
Heltman has pressed shale firms to show restraint even amid rising prices. And despite higher revenues, spending increases have so far been restrained.
Producers have pushed up spending plans for all of 2018 by 10 percent over last year, according to a tally of 41 of the 65 producers tracked by financial services firm Cowen & Co.
Some companies have maintained conservative assumptions for the average oil price for 2018, budgeting for prices between $50 and $55 a barrel.
A higher price will mean they can cover new drilling investments and still pay dividends. 
Investors are searching for firms that can find the optimal balance between the conflicting goals of controlling costs, paying dividends and increasing production.
""We're looking to invest in those companies who have been able to improve their production and win the battle as far as cost of extraction,"" said Derek Rollingson, portfolio manager of the ICON Energy Fund (O:ICENX), which holds shares of more than a dozen U.S. shale producers.
A further rise in oil prices, however, could lead investors to take on more risk and penalize more conservative companies, said Mike Breard, an energy analyst at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.

""If oil is $65 by Easter,"" he said, ""investors are going to go to the companies and say, 'Why don't you borrow more money and drill more wells?'""

The US dollar index that measures the greenback against a basket of currencies stood at 89.78, up 0.13%, but dropped from an eight-day peak above the 90 mark yesterday.
Meanwhile, U.S. treasury 10-year note yields rose to 2.957% on Wednesday, its four-year high, before dropping to 2.904% on Thursday and rebounding to 2.928% on Friday.
St Louis Fed President James Bullard warned on Thursday that too many rate hikes this year would restrict economy growth, and that he did not expect the years of below-target inflation to change rapidly.

Crude Oil WTI Futures for April delivery were trading at $62.88 a barrel in Asia by 11:50am ET, up 0.18%. Brent crude Futures for April delivery, traded in London, were up 0.30% at $66.45 per barrel.
U.S. crude inventories had been forecast to rise 1.8 million barrels. But as net imports fell to a record low while exports surged, crude stockpiles saw an unexpected decline by 1.6 million barrels last week. Inventories dropped further at the key storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
The drop at Cushing was because prompt crude prices were higher than forward prices, discouraging storage as it makes more sense to liquidate on-hand inventories.
Meanwhile, U.S. crude exports jumped to more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd), close to the record 2.1 million bpd in October. Production increase is steady, and the U.S. is set to overtake Russia in crude oil output by late 2018, making it the largest global supplier.
The largest privately owned crude terminal in the U.S., the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), recently completed the first very large crude carrier (VLCC) crude oil loading operation. The super carriers can ship around 2 million barrels of oil.
This timely development comes as demand for oil continues to surge in Asia, especially China.
A drop in the U.S. currency from an eight-day peak also supported oil prices, as dollar-denominated oil is now cheaper for other countries to import.
Strengthened by healthy demand growth in Asia, oil prices are slowly inching closer to the highs of the beginning of February. WTI started February at $65.80 and Brent started at $69.65"
226,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Oil slips toward $66 a barrel as U.S. output offsets OPEC curbs,"By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil slipped toward $66 a barrel on Friday as rising U.S. oil output and exports countered OPEC-led attempts to erode stockpiles with output curbs and a dip in Libyan production.
U.S. oil production last week was steady at 10.27 million barrels per day, a record level if confirmed by monthly figures. Crude exports jumped to more than 2 million bpd, close to a record 2.1 million hit in October.
""The U.S. is pumping out a record amount of oil,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK Ltd.
""The bull rally which we have seen for the black gold could fade away as the U.S. oil production undermines the OPEC production cut commitments,"" he said.
Brent crude, the global benchmark, was down 11 cents at $66.28 at 1243 GMT. Prices had rallied in early 2018 and reached $71.28 on Jan. 25, the highest since December 2014. U.S. crude fell 10 cents to $62.67.
Prices recouped some losses following the shutdown of the El Feel oilfield in Libya producing 70,000 bpd. Production in the OPEC member has been running at about 1 million bpd although it remains volatile due to unrest.
A stronger dollar weighed on prices. A firmer dollar can make oil and other commodities denominated in the U.S. currency more expensive for other currency holders. 
The latest decline for crude came despite the U.S. Energy Information Administration reporting crude stocks fell unexpectedly by 1.6 million barrels. Analysts said low import figures contributed to the decline.
U.S. production is expected to rise even more this year and top 11 million bpd in late 2018, a headwind for OPEC efforts to drain stockpiles. 
But the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is not outwardly worried by rising U.S. output and says it is comfortable at the speed the market is moving toward balance.
""I think the pace is excellent, the deal is working and we're very happy with it,"" United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazroui, the current OPEC president, told Reuters on Wednesday. ""But the job is not yet complete.""
In January 2017, OPEC and allies including Russia began to cut production by about 1.8 million bpd, almost 2 percent of global supply, to get rid of a glut that had built up since 2014 and that led to a price collapse.

OPEC wants to reduce inventories held by industrialized nations to their five-year average and is getting closer to that goal.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 10:19PM ET</span>","U.S. defense department says prefers targeted steel, aluminum tariffs","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department has voiced support for the Trump administration's bid to impose national security restrictions on imports of steel and aluminum, although it would prefer a system of targeted tariffs and a delay for import curbs on aluminum. 
The Commerce Department on Feb. 16 recommended that President Donald Trump impose stiff curbs on steel imports from China and other countries and offered the three options to the president, who has yet to make a decision.
U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said he was concerned about the potential impact of the proposed measures on U.S. allies, adding that was the reason he preferred targeted tariffs.
""DoD believes that the systematic use of unfair trade practices to intentionally erode our innovation and manufacturing industrial bases poses a risk to our national security,"" Mattis wrote in an undated memorandum posted on Thursday on the Commerce Department website.
In the memo, which referenced a December interagency review of the commerce recommendations, he said that since direct defense needs account for only about 3 percent of U.S. production, the proposed curbs would not damage the Pentagon's ability to get steel and aluminum to meet national defense requirements. 
But while Mattis recommended that the tariffs on steel should proceed, the administration should wait before pressing ahead with the measures on aluminum.
""The prospect of trade action on aluminum may be sufficient to coerce improved behavior of bad actors,"" the department said.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week that Trump would have the final say on what measures to adopt.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has called a meeting early next week with key senators and Cabinet officials to discuss potential changes to biofuels policy, which is coming under increasing pressure after a Pennsylvania refiner blamed the regulation for its bankruptcy, according to four sources familiar with the matter.
The meeting comes as the oil industry and corn lobby – powerful forces in Washington – clash over the future of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a decade-old regulation that requires refiners to cover the cost of mixing biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into their fuel.
Trump's engagement reflects the high political stakes of protecting jobs in a key electoral state. Oil refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), which employs more than a thousand people in Philadelphia, declared bankruptcy last month and blamed the regulation for its demise.
The meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, will include Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, along with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, and potentially Energy Secretary Rick Perry, according to the four sources, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
One source said the meeting would focus on short-term solutions to help PES continue operating. PES is asking a bankruptcy judge to shed roughly $350 million of its current RFS compliance costs, owed to the EPA which administers the program, as part of its restructuring package.
The other sources said the meeting will consider whether to cap prices for biofuel credits, let higher-ethanol blends be sold all year, and efforts to get speculators out of the market.
Officials at the EPA, Agriculture Department, and Energy Department declined to comment. A White House official, Kelly Love, said she had no announcement on the matter at this time.
The offices of Cruz, Ernst and Grassley did not immediately return requests for comment. 
The sources said the options moving forward would be constrained by political and legal realities that have derailed previous efforts at reform.
The Trump administration has already considered changes to the RFS sought by refiners this year - including reducing the amount of biofuels required to be blended annually under the regulation, or shifting the responsibility for blending to supply terminals - only to retreat in the face of opposition from corn-state lawmakers.
NARROW OPTIONS, BROAD RESISTANCE
The EPA is expected to weigh in officially in the coming weeks on PES's request to the bankruptcy judge to be released from its compliance obligations. But any such move would likely draw a backlash from other U.S. refiners, who have no hope of receiving a waiver.
Under the RFS, refiners must earn or purchase blending credits called RINs to prove they are complying with the regulation. As biofuels volumes quotas have increased, so have prices for the credits - meaning refiners that invested in blending facilities have benefited while those that have not, such as PES, have had to pay up.
PES said its RFS compliance costs exceeded its payroll last year, and ranked only behind the cost of purchasing crude oil.
Other issues may have contributed to PES's financial difficulties. Reuters reported that PES's investor backers withdrew from the company more than $594 million in a series of dividend-style distributions since 2012, even as regional refining economics slumped.
Regulators and lawmakers have been considering how to cut the cost of the RFS to the oil industry.
In recent months, for example, the EPA has contemplated expanding its use of an exemption available to small refineries - a move that would likely push down RIN prices, but which both the oil and corn industries have said would be unfair. 
Cruz last year proposed limiting the price of RINs to 10 cents, a fraction of their current value – an idea that was roundly rejected by the ethanol industry as a disincentive for new ethanol blending infrastructure investment. 

Senator John Cornyn, also a Texas Republican, is preparing draft legislation to overhaul the RFS in Congress that would include the creation of a new specialized RIN credit intended to push down prices - but it too faces resistance from both the corn and oil lobbies.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for March delivery rose 1.77% settle at $62.77 a barrel, while on London\'s Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 1.35% to trade at $66.30 a barrel.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by 1.616 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 9, confounding expectations for a rise of 2.355 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – rose by just 261,000 barrels, above expectations for a build of 283,000 barrels, while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – fell by 2.422 million barrels, a steeper fall than the 1.460 million barrels forecast. 
The upbeat gasoline and distillate supplies data come despite refinery utilization under pressure as refiners remained in a period of maintenance. 
Lower refinery activity usually lowers demand for crude leading to a build in supplies. Some said, however, that the surprise draw in crude supplies was supported by added incentive to sell rather than store crude as current prices traded at premium to forward prices – a market structure known as backwardation. 
Also supporting the larger draw in crude supplies was a rise in crude exports to above 2 million barrels a day, near an all-time high set in 2017, as the widening Brent-WTI price differential boosted foreign demand of American supplies.
U.S. weekly oil production remained close to record levels at 10.27 million barrels a day, which keeps the US on track to meet the EIA’s recent estimate for domestic production to top 11 million barrels per day by year-end."

Gold is sensitive to moves lower in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A weaker dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency raising demand while a fall in U.S. bond yields, limits the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

(Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp (N:CHK) said it expects production to keep rising this year, despite a 12 percent cut in spending, sending the U.S. natural gas producer's shares up nearly 23 percent on Thursday.
Like its peers in the energy industry, Chesapeake faces pressure from investors to increase production on minimal spending, and has cut costs and jobs to manage a balance sheet saddled with nearly $10 billion in debt.
The company, which is selling assets worth $2 billion to $3 billion, said it expects production to rise by about 3 percent in 2018 after adjusting for asset sales.
While that growth rate is the same as last year, it will come off a planned capital budget of $1.96 billion to $2.38 billion for 2018, which at the mid-point is 12 percent lower than last year.
The Street should ""perceive this as a positive given 2018 spending is decreasing, while production still increasing,"" SunTrust Robinson analyst Neal Dingmann said.
Since crude oil prices crashed in 2014, U.S. energy producers have been curbing costs, while aiming to boost output through new technology such as processing seismic data better, improving reservoir models and drilling more efficient wells.
Chesapeake said it expects new wells to be ""a lot more economic"" as it tests new well designs.
""We will continue to drive costs out of our operations, improve margins and utilize advancing technologies to create value across our portfolio,"" Chief Executive Officer Robert Lawler said on a conference call.
Chesapeake is focusing on the Powder River Basin across Montana and Wyoming to tap gas reserves. It also operates in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas, Utica Shale in Ohio and Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma.
Higher production and averaged realized prices, and a near 9 percent drop in costs, helped Chesapeake's fourth-quarter profit top analysts' expectations.
Chesapeake's net income was $309 million, compared with a year-ago loss of $740 million.
Its adjusted profit of 30 cents per share beat analysts estimate of 24 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Chesapeake's average production rose 3.3 percent to 593,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Average sales price rose 20.2 percent to $24.41 per barrel of oil equivalent.
The company's shares were up 22.2 percent at $3.22 in late morning trading, set for their biggest one-day percentage gain in nearly two years.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has fired a diplomatic warning shot at Washington by raising the prospect of building nuclear reactors for ships while staying within the limits set by its atomic deal with major powers, a U.N. nuclear watchdog report showed on Thursday.
U.S. President Donald Trump has long railed against the 2015 nuclear deal for reasons including its limited duration and the fact it does not cover Iran's ballistic missile program. He has threatened to pull out unless European allies help ""fix"" the agreement with a follow-up accord.
Since Trump took office more than a year ago, Iran has stayed within limits on items including its stock of low-enriched uranium imposed by the deal, which also lifted painful international economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic.
A quarterly report on Iran by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, which is policing the deal's restrictions, showed that Iran remained compliant, but also that it had informed the agency of a ""decision that has been taken to construct naval nuclear propulsion in future"". 
Iran has raised that prospect in public statements before. In 2016, President Hassan Rouhani ordered the start of planning on the development of nuclear marine propulsion in reaction to what he called U.S. violations of the nuclear deal.
Rouhani was alluding to the lack of economic benefit to Iran from the deal because many companies including big Western banks continue to shun the country for fear of breaching separate U.S. financial sanctions that stayed in place after other sanctions were rescinded. 
Analysts have said Iran is many years or decades away from having naval nuclear capacity. But mentioning it evokes both projecting military might and potentially enriching uranium beyond the limit of 3.67 percent purity imposed by the deal.
A senior diplomat said it was not clear from Iran's statement to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) whether it was referring to those previous statements, but they appeared to be a reaction to Trump's comments. 
""Formally there is no clarity on this. But informally yes, why now? So obviously there is a link ... to the possibility that the JCPOA's future is questioned,"" the senior diplomat said, referring to the 2015 deal by its full name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
Iran's notification on marine propulsion could cover a range of intentions over any period of time, meaning there was no cause for concern, the senior diplomat said. 
Iran has yet to respond to the IAEA's request for ""further clarifications and amplifications"", the report said, adding that if Iran had reached a concrete decision to build new facilities for marine propulsion it must provide design information.

The confidential quarterly IAEA report follows a statement by Iran's deputy foreign minister earlier on Thursday that Tehran will withdraw from the deal if there is no economic gains and major banks continue to stay away.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 37 cents, or 0.7%, to $62.08 a barrel by 11:03AM ET (1603GMT). Prices were at around $61.60 prior to the release of the inventory data.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., added 30 cents, or roughly 0.5%, to $61.98 a barrel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 1.6 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 16.
That compared with analysts' expectations for a gain of around 1.8 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply-drop of around 0.9 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 2.6 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 420.5 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be in the lower half of the average range for this time of year.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 0.3 million barrels, compared to expectations for a decline of 0.3 million barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a drop of 2.4 million barrels.

Front-month U.S. natural gas futures shed 2.1 cents, or around 0.8%, to $2.638 per million British thermal units (btu) by 10:45AM ET (1545GMT). Futures were at $2.649 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. fell by 124 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Feb. 16, above forecasts for a withdrawal of 121 bcf.
That compared with a decline of 194 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 89 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 145 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 1.760 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
That figure is 609 bcf, or around 25.7%, lower than levels at this time a year ago, and 412 bcf, or roughly 19.0%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas futures settled higher for the second day in a row on Wednesday, boosted by forecasts for a bump in late-winter heating demand.
Despite this week's gains, market experts warned that futures are likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term as the coldest part of the winter has effectively passed.
Natural gas prices are down almost 30% since late January amid speculation the end of the winter heating season will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for the fuel.
Spring usually sees the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.

236,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 09:25AM ET</span>","U.S. copper stocks sprint to record high, reflecting transport costs, weak demand","By Pratima Desai
LONDON (Reuters) - Record high stocks of copper in land-locked Arizona and Utah are a reflection of soaring transport costs in the United States and weak demand for the industrial metal produced in the Americas, copper industry sources say.
Trading sources added that stocks in these two locations are likely to keep rising until prices are high enough to offset costs of transporting the copper.
Copper stocks held in warehouses registered with COMEX (O:CME) in the United States stand at 228,428 tonnes, up from below 90,000 tonnes at the start of 2017.
Specifically, stocks in COMEX warehouses in Salt Lake City, Utah have climbed to 131,774 tonnes from around 30,000 tonnes in January last year, while those in Tucson, Arizona are up at 74,427 tonnes from below 50,000.
""Trucking costs are generally higher,"" said Robert Edwards, a consultant at CRU Group. ""Premiums in the physical market are just not attractive enough for anyone to try and move metal out of warehouses in Tucson or Salt Lake City.""
Physical market transactions are typically based on a premium - currently about $130 a ton in the United States - over a price set on futures exchanges such as COMEX and the London Metal Exchange. 
U.S. premiums are up more than 10 percent since November, but they are still not high enough to cover the costs of transporting the copper to the country's industrial heartland in the Midwest or to consumers in Asia. 
Sources said the cost of taking copper from a warehouse in Arizona, loading it into a container, then onto a truck, driving it to a seaport, unloading the container there and loading onto a vessel could cost between $120 and $150 a ton. 
That is about double the level at the end of 2016, sources said, adding that the freight from a U.S. port to top consumer China is a further $40 a ton.
Reasons for rising transport costs include the jump in oil prices and strong U.S. economic growth, which has meant increasing demand for industrial transport.
""Tighter restrictions on the numbers of hours truck drivers in the U.S. can be on the road have also driven up costs,"" a commodity trading source said.
He added that incentive payments - sometimes more than $40 a ton - by warehouses to firms that store copper in Salt Lake City and Tucson had helped offset the costs of getting the metal to those locations.
""The longer you agree to leave your metal in a warehouse, the better the incentive ... A fair amount of the copper in those locations comes from local producers and a large amount is Latin America production, which would previously have gone to China.""
Latin America is a major producer of Sx-Ew copper, which uses solvent extraction and electrowinning, and for which demand is soft as consumers in China prefer ER - electro-refined - copper. China accounts for nearly half of global demand for refined copper, estimated at around 23 million tonnes this year.
""Players in the Chinese market have always preferred ER to Sx-Ew cathode,"" said Eleni Joannides, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie. ""Certainly during 2017, the ER cathode market in China was more liquid compared with Sx-Ew cathode.  That could be one factor behind the higher demand for ER over Sx-Ew now.""
Some sources say COMEX warehouse rents for copper at around $10 a ton a month, or assuming a 30-day month about 33 U.S. cents a day, are an incentive as the average for warehouses approved by the LME is around 51 cents a day per ton.
""That is a superficial comparison, there are so many other costs to take into account - labor costs, charges for loading, unloading and cancellation charges,"" a copper trader said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday, dragged lower by a firmer dollar that offset support from a surprise decline in U.S. crude inventories.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were down 11 cents at $65.31 per barrel by 1218 GMT, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures (CLc1) eased 24 cents to $61.44 a barrel. 
The dollar rose to a one-week high against a basket of major currencies (DXY) on Thursday, after minutes of the Federal Reserve's January meeting showed policymakers were more confident of the need to keep raising interest rates.
With the strengthening dollar, the oil price has lost nearly 10 percent since hitting a multi-year high above $70 in January.
""Given the market’s whipsaw reaction we could add another key takeaway, that recent heightened market volatility could be here to stay,"" LCG markets strategist Jasper Lawler said.
The correlation between moves in the oil price and the dollar has strengthened in the last couple of weeks, as investors increasingly sell other assets to buy the U.S. currency on expectations of a faster pace of rate rises.
""The firming dollar continues to thwart investor sentiment despite the bullish inventory data,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA.
A stronger dollar pushes up the bill for countries paying for imports in other currencies, potentially curbing demand.
The American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday reported an unexpected drop in U.S. crude oil inventories by 907,000 barrels to 420.3 million barrels for the week to Feb. 16.
Inventories usually rise at this time of year, as many refineries cut crude intake to conduct maintenance, but a bottleneck in Canada's pipeline system has reduced U.S. imports and pushed U.S. stocks lower.
""Improved pipeline infrastructure to the Gulf coast and the decreased supply via TransCanada's Keystone pipeline, sent ... inventories tumbling,"" Innes said.
But analysts said oil markets were still generally well supported due to rising demand for crude and production restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia.
""OPEC production curbs have stabilized the market. Adherence to (the) agreement has been relatively good,"" Daniel Hynes, senior commodity strategist at ANZ bank, said in a report on Thursday.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was little changed at a one-and-a-half week high of 90.09.
A stronger greenback often weighs on prices for dollar-denominated commodities.

Crude Oil WTI Futures for April delivery were trading at $61.01 a barrel in Asia at 11pm ET, down 1.09%. Brent crude futures for April delivery, traded in London, were down 0.40% at $64.88 per barrel.
The dollar rose beyond a one-week peak against other currencies on Wednesday, extending its recovery from three-year lows set last week as traders cut back on some of the bearish bets against the U.S. dollar.
The strengthening dollar makes greenback-denominated oil imports more expensive for other countries, thus curbing demand and dragging prices down.
This is despite an unexpected drop in U.S. crude oil inventories by 907,000 barrels to 420.3 million barrels for the week to Feb 16, according to The American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday.
The U.S. is still expected to continue increasing its production, as it has done by more than 20% since mid-2016 to more than 10 million barrels per day (bpd). At this rate of production increase, the U.S. is set to overtake Russia in crude oil output by late 2018, making it the largest global supplier.
This also means that the gap in production that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is trying to create is simply being filled by U.S. shale, making OPEC’s attempt to reduce the global oversupply and control oil price volatility less effective.
Current prices have moved quite far from the highs of the beginning of February. WTI started February at $65.80 and Brent started at $69.65. However, a healthy demand-growth in Asia, particularly China, continues to support oil markets."

Oil is struggling to regain the highs of January after a sell-off in global equities spread to commodities earlier this month. Rising U.S. crude output continues to be a major challenge for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to balance the market through production cuts.
“Even if we see U.S. stockpiles drawing again, we should pay more attention to surging American crude output,” Will Yun, a commodities analyst at Hyundai Futures Corp., said by phone in Seoul. “There is more room for oil to trend downward for now with the increase in U.S. production having a deeper impact on prices.”
West Texas Intermediate for April delivery fell as much as 93 cents to $60.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange and traded at $60.98 at 10:30 a.m. in Singapore. The contract lost 11 cents to close at $61.68 on Wednesday. Total volume traded was about the same as the 100-day average.
Brent for April settlement was down 57 cents at $64.85 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Prices gained 17 cents to close at $65.42 on Wednesday. The global benchmark crude traded at a $3.87 premium to WTI.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for March delivery fell 11 cents to settle at $61.68 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent fell 23 cents to trade at $65.02 a barrel.
Oil prices pared intraday gains as traders fretted over fresh weekly totals from the EIA expected to show both crude supplies and production continued to increase in the week ended Feb. 16.
Rising US shale output is widely believed to be one of the main risks threatening to derail OPEC’s efforts to restore balance in oil markets. The group agreed in December to extend the 1.8 million bpd output cuts through 2018, to rid the market of excess supplies.
US production, which surged to a record 10.27 million barrels per day last week, could add to output gains as a widening Brent-WTI differential is said to boost foreign demand of American supplies.
The American Petroleum Institute weekly inventory report is slated for Tuesday after US markets close, while the EIA issues its supply totals Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. ET."
244,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Soybeans Could Dethrone Corn as U.S. Crop King After 35 Years,"(Bloomberg) -- For the first time in 35 years, soybeans are poised to steal the crown of U.S. crop king from corn.
American farmers are set to increase their soy plantings to a record 90.69 million acres, according to the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 21 trading firms and analysts. Corn sowings are forecast to drop to 90.12 million. The last time soy surpassed corn was 1983, when government payments were based on idling acres.
For the full survey results, click here.
If it feels like we’ve been here before, you’d be right. This time last year analysts were expecting the great soybean steal to happen because the crop was already offering better premiums. And while growers did sow more of the oilseed than ever before, the plantings came in just shy of matching corn as temperate weather favored the grain.
So what’s different this year? Drought.
About 16 percent of the corn belt is already experiencing drought conditions, with more dry weather forecast into the start of the growing season. Soybeans, wheat and cotton are all more drought-tolerant than corn.
Price Premiums
Prices are also still favoring soybeans, with futures for this year’s crop trading about 2.5 times higher than corn contracts. This is the fifth straight year that the oilseed is offering better returns.
After years of depressed crop prices, those premiums are more important than ever -- just ask Julie Burgod. The 52-year-old farms 4,500 acres and raises calves near ‬Ipswich, South Dakota, with her husband and son. They already plan to slash corn acres in half to make way for soybeans, because the grain “doesn’t pay the bills.” Burgod also owns a crop insurance agency and said many of her clients are echoing the sentiment.
“Soybeans are king, and corn is queen,” Burgod said. “We also are skittish about the dry soils coming into 2018.” 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its first planting estimates for the season at its annual outlook conference that begins Thursday in Arlington, Virginia.
Plains Drought
Dry weather is most acute in the northern Great Plains. In North Dakota, drought conditions cover 65 percent of the state, compared with zero last year, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
The arid soils are limiting planting options, according to Jim Diepolder, a farmer and seed and farm-chemical dealer near Willow City, North Dakota. The conditions reduce the chances of corn crops generating the yields needed for farmers to break even. Barley is also less attractive after a string of bumper crops boosted inventories, prompting beer companies to cut supply contracts.
Diepolder is planting no corn this year, 50 percent less barley and replacing those acres with another grain that’s forecast to see planting gains: wheat. He’ll also seed more canola. Both crops are considered drought resistant.
“I watch the weather and I watch market prices, but weather is the key,” Diepolder said “The drier it gets, the more spring wheat will get planted because it’s a good drought crop. You have to have something to sell at harvest.”

Gold futures for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $0.40, or 0.03%, to $1,331.60 a troy ounce.
Gold prices steadied a day after suffering its biggest one-day slide in two-and-a-half months which followed a surge in yields and dollar.
The yellow metal was supported by somewhat dovish comments from Federal Reserve officials who suggested the Fed’s gradual approach to monetary policy tightening should continue.
Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari suggested the central bank should continue on its current path, and avoid overreacting to one-month upbeat wage and inflation data.
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas president Robert Kaplan reiterated that the Fed should gradually raise rates in 2018. Kaplan said he expects that inflation will make progress toward 2% over 2018 and the impact of tax-cuts will be seen in 2018.
Market participants, however, await the release of the Federal Reserve’s January minutes to establish whether the duo of speeches calling for an unchanged Fed approach to monetary policy reflected the overall mood among other Fed officials.
Some participants suggested that the minutes were unlikely to show a stark change in the bank’s narrative on inflation and rate hikes given that the January meeting was Janet Yellen’s final meeting.
Stifel chief economist, Lindsey M. Piegza said the Fed in its January policy statement noted a ""specific forecast for a ""move up"" in inflation"" in 2018, ""warranting a ""further"" removal of accommodation."" Piegza said that the minutes may ""provide additional context"" on the Fed's expectations on inflation.
In a rising interest rate environment, investor appetite for gold weakens as the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal increases relative to interest-bearing assets such as bonds.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices softened on Wednesday ahead of data expected to show rising crude inventories in the United States and as the dollar strengthened from last week's three-year lows.
Brent crude futures for April delivery were little changed, falling 1 cent to $65.24 a barrel by 12:37 p.m. EST.
West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) futures for April delivery, the new front month, fell 18 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $61.61 a barrel.

U.S. crude stocks likely rose 1.3 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 16, the fourth consecutive weekly build, according to a preliminary Reuters poll.
U.S. crude oil production surpassed 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in November for the first time since 1970, hindering efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, led by Russia, to reduce bloated global inventories and prop up oil prices by cutting output.
Also bearish for oil, the dollar strengthened against other major currencies, buoyed by a rise in short-term U.S. government bond yields to a nine-year high.
Oil gained some support by a gain on Wall Street. (N)
""Oil prices and the S&P have been highly correlated, of late, with economic strength translating into improved company performance and higher energy demand,"" said John Kilduff, partner at investment manager Again Capital in New York.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude April contract was down 35 cents or about 0.55% at $61.45 a barrel by 10:00 a.m. ET (14:00 GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London fell 14 cents or about 0.21% to $65.11 a barrel.
U.S. crude oil futures were boosted on Tuesday as a result of reduced flows from Canada's Keystone pipeline, which has been operating below capacity since late last year due to a leak.
Oil prices were also supported this week by potential supply disruptions in the Middle East after Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel could act against Iran itself, not just its allies in the Middle East, following border incidents in Syria.
However, traders became more cautious ahead of this week's U.S. inventories reports. The American Petroleum Institute was set to publish its weekly report on U.S. oil supplies later Wednesday, while official data by the U.S. Energy Information Administration was expected on Thursday.
The reports come out one day later than usual due to Monday's President's Day holiday.
Fears that rising U.S. output could dampen global efforts to rid the market of excess supplies have systematically limited oil prices' gains recently.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.

Front-month U.S. natural gas futures tacked on 3.0 cents, or around 1.2%, to $2.647 per million British thermal units (btu) by 9:15AM ET (1415GMT). It rose to $2.662 in the last session, a level not seen since Feb. 9.
U.S. gas futures rallied 2.3% on Tuesday as updated weather forecasting models showed a return to colder weather over the eastern U.S. during the first week of March.
Despite this week's gains, market experts warned that futures are likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term as the coldest part of the winter has effectively passed.
Natural gas prices are down almost 30% since late January. They reached their weakest level since May 2016 last week amid speculation the end of the winter heating season will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for the fuel.
Spring usually sees the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 112 and 128 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Feb. 16.
That compares with a decline of 194 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 89 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 145 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 1.884 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
That figure is 577 bcf, or around 23.4%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 433 bcf, or roughly 18.6%, below the five-year average for this time of year.

Crude Oil WTI Futures futures for April delivery were trading at $61.33 a barrel mid-morning in Asia, down 0.74%. Brent crude futures for April delivery, traded in London, were down 0.31% at $64.84 per barrel in mid-morning.
Traders said the declines were due to U.S. dollar-denominated oil imports being more expensive for other countries. The dollar rebounded from three-year lows set last week as traders cut back on some of the bearish bets against the U.S. dollar.
A continued dollar recovery will work against oil prices, but oil markets remain well supported due to a healthy demand-growth in Asia, particularly China, combined with a supply restraint by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
Saudi Arabia’s effort to clean up the global oversupply of oil is also helping to stabilize oil price volatility. The Kingdom has vowed to reduce its exports to below 7 million barrels per day (bpd) next month and to cut oil production by 100,000 bpd in March compared to the February level.
Further supporting prices are rising tensions in the Middle East, especially along the border of Syria and Israel. While neither Syria nor Israel is a major player in the oil business, threat to oil anywhere in the Middle East tends to put upward pressure on oil prices.
These mixed signals have caused oil prices to zigzag up and down over the past weeks, mostly between small rises and dips. That said, current prices have moved quite far from the highs of the beginning of February. WTI started February at $65.80 and Brent started at $69.65.

LONDON (Reuters) - Brent oil prices fell on Tuesday, under pressure from a stronger dollar and a bout of profit-taking, while U.S. futures held steady, bringing the discount between the two key futures contracts to a six-month low. 
Brent crude futures were down 65 cents from Monday's close at $65.02 a barrel by 1509 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 2 cents from their last close on Friday to $61.70 a barrel.
Brent was trading at a premium to WTI of over $7 a barrel at the start of the year.
Reduced supply from Canada to the United States caused by pipeline reductions was supporting WTI, traders said.
A narrower premium of Brent to WTI means it is also less attractive for consumers in northwest Europe to import U.S. crude, especially with refiners conducting maintenance. Premiums for local North Sea grades are at multi-month lows. 
Logistical constraints in the United States have even caused prices for regional grades to diverge. [CRU/C]
""Less crude oil is being transported from Canada to Cushing due to the restricted capacity of the Keystone pipeline. And for another, new pipeline capacities mean more crude oil is leaving Cushing,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said in a note.
""Light Louisiana Sweet, the reference type for comparable oil on the U.S. Gulf Coast, even costs only $2 more than WTI. It therefore makes hardly any sense for refineries on the Gulf Coast to buy WTI from Cushing – indeed this would not be cost effective at all if the price gap narrowed any further.""
Louisiana light sweet crude is trading at a premium of around $2 a barrel to WTI, down from nearly $5 a month ago.
Overall, oil markets remain supported by supply restraint on the part of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which started last year to draw down excess global inventories.
Ayed Al Qahtani, OPEC's head of research, said at an industry conference on Tuesday that the excess of oil held in storage has fallen in the past year to stand 74 million barrels above the five-year average.
This compares with a surplus of around 340 million barrels in January 2017, he said.

The U.S. contract was boosted a result of reduced flows from Canada's Keystone pipeline, which has been operating below capacity since late last year due to a leak.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London lost 67 cents or about 1.02% to $65.00 a barrel, after hitting a more than one-week peak of $65.90 on Monday.

Natural gas prices are down almost 30% since late January, amid speculation the end of the winter heating season will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for the fuel.
Market experts warned that futures are likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term as the coldest part of the winter has effectively passed and below-normal temperatures in April mean less than they do in January and February.
Spring usually sees the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 112 and 128 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Feb. 16.
That compares with a decline of 194 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 89 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 145 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 1.884 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
That figure is 577 bcf, or around 23.4%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 433 bcf, or roughly 18.6%, below the five-year average for this time of year.

260,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 08:01AM ET</span>","OPEC, Russia Said to See Oil Glut Dissipating at a Faster Rate","(Bloomberg) -- The latest discussions between OPEC and its oil-producer allies concluded that the supply glut is dissipating at a faster pace than previously anticipated, say people familiar with the matter.
After about four years of surplus, the global market will finally rebalance in the second or third quarter, earlier than previously estimated, said people familiar with the group’s deliberations. This conclusion follows multiple signals of tighter supply, including Brent crude briefly surging above $70 a barrel and oil stockpiles in developed nations falling by the most in six years.
“We have seen a remarkable year in 2017 -- the market of crude has been restored and went to healthy numbers,” United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei said at the International Petroleum Week conference in London on Tuesday. “Ahead of us this year is the balance of supply and demand.”
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia are going even further than their pledged 1.8 million barrels a day of production cuts, giving “massive momentum” to the market, according to the cartel’s Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo. By some estimates, bloated oil stockpiles have already shrunk back to average levels, but the group shows no signing of easing off as Saudi Arabia seeks higher prices to buttress the historic initial public offering of its state energy producer.
The Deepest Cut
The Joint Technical Committee, which includes officials from both OPEC nations and allies from outside the group, based its rebalancing scenario on the assumption that Libya and Nigeria keep output at January levels and other participants in the deal maintain compliance with cuts, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions were private.
The group of 24 nations implemented 133 percent of their pledged cuts in January, according to Barkindo.
Oil inventories in developed economies are about 74 million barrels above the five-year average, the JTC concluded. Stockpiles are already back in line with that average using a method that considers how quickly they’re likely to be consumed, known as forward demand cover, the people said.
While OPEC has maintained its five-year-average inventory target since the cuts began in January 2016, it’s now considering other measures that could change its view on whether the market is balanced. The group is also drafting a charter that would allow continued cooperation with other producers beyond the expiry of the cuts at the end of 2018, Mazrouei said.

264,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Refiner goes belly-up after big payouts to Carlyle Group,"By Jarrett Renshaw
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Throughout 2016 and 2017, a rail terminal built to accept crude oil for the largest East Coast refinery often sat idle, with few trains showing up to unload.
Although little oil flowed, plenty of money did.
Under a deal Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) signed in 2015, the refiner paid minimum quarterly payments of $30 million to terminal owner North Yard Logistics LP - even if little crude arrived. Much of that cash, in turn, flowed to the investors that own both PES and North Yard, led by the  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG), a global private equity firm with $178 billion in assets.
The deal in effect guaranteed lucrative payouts to Carlyle regardless of whether the refinery benefited from the arrangement. When oil market conditions made the rail shipments unprofitable later that year, the refinery took heavy losses while its investors continued to collect large distributions for two more years.
The rail contract exemplifies the financial demands Carlyle imposed on PES in the years leading up to the refiner’s bankruptcy in January. The Carlyle-led consortium collected at least $594 million in cash distributions from PES before it collapsed, according to a Reuters review of bankruptcy filings. Carlyle paid $175 million in 2012 for its two-thirds stake in the refiner.
More than half the distributions to the Carlyle-led investors were financed by loans against PES assets that the refiner now can't pay back, the filings show. The rest came from the refiner's operating budget and payments PES made under the terminal deal to North Yard, a firm with no offices or employees that PES spun off in 2015.
PES has blamed its bankruptcy on environmental regulations that require all U.S. refiners to cover the costs of blending corn-based ethanol into the nation’s gasoline. But the ill-fated train terminal deal and other large payouts to investors played key roles in the refiner's collapse, according to filings and five current or former PES employees who were involved in the refinery's decision-making. The employees spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The investor payouts, along with a slump in refining economics, left PES unable to cover its obligations under the decade-old U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard or the loans it took to finance the distributions to Carlyle, the filings show.
PES had $600 million in debt and $43 million in cash on hand when it filed bankruptcy last month. It now hopes to restructure and continue operations, which employ about 1,100 people.
Carlyle Group spokesman Christopher Ullman declined to comment on whether the distributions or the rail-terminal deal contributed to the refiner's bankruptcy. PES spokeswoman Cherice Corley defended the payments to Carlyle and said the biofuels regulations played a ""significant"" role its collapse.
""We feel our capital structure was appropriate, and any suggestion that it was the cause of our restructuring is completely ignoring the significant effect of the flawed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS),"" Corley said.
Other refiners and Pennsylvania officials have also blamed biofuels regulation for the South Philadelphia refinery’s failure, triggering renewed debate about the program on Capitol Hill.
Refiners without the necessary blending facilities, such as PES, are required to purchase regulatory credits, known as RINs, from firms that do such blending. The cost of compliance for PES rose from $13 million in 2012 to $218 million in 2017 as prices increased for the credits, which are traded in an open market.
The refiner, however, failed to pay a large portion of that obligation. In addition to its conventional debt, PES still owes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory credits worth about $350 million, an amount tied to the fuel it produced over the past two years, according to filings. The firm stopped buying RINs last year - and instead sold them to other refiners for what likely amounted to tens of millions of dollars, Reuters reported in November.
The corn and ethanol lobby has pushed back on the argument that biofuels regulation sunk PES, pointing out that other refiners governed by the same law are raking in their highest profits in years. The refinery’s failure had more to do with the hefty profits it paid to Carlyle as its cash reserves dwindled and its debt soared, said Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Council.
""The Carlyle Group looks more like a corporate raider than a savior in this deal,"" Coleman said.
Carlyle would not lose any of its gains on the PES investment under the refiner’s proposed restructuring plan, which has the support of almost all creditors, according to filings. PES also asks the bankruptcy court to entirely absolve its $350 million obligation to the EPA.
EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman declined to comment on the delinquent PES credit obligations, citing the bankruptcy proceedings.
CARLYLE RECOUPED INVESTMENT WITH DEBT
Carlyle bought its stake in PES as many other East Coast refineries were closing down because of weak margins. The previous owner, Sunoco - now Energy Transfer Partners (N:ETP) - contributed the refinery’s assets and became a non-controlling partner.
The $175 million Carlyle paid was its only investment in PES, filings show, and the firm soon recouped its acquisition costs through a loan against the refinery.
At the direction of its investor-controlled board, PES borrowed $550 million in March 2013 and paid $200 million of that to investors, according to bankruptcy filings.
PES then spent $100 million building the rail terminal that year and $30 million in 2014 to double its capacity. At the time, U.S. oil production was skyrocketing as improved drilling technology unlocked new reserves in places such as North Dakota. Carlyle saw an opportunity to tap this cheaper supply and wean PES off costly imports.
The plan worked well at first, in 2013 and 2014, and PES posted earnings of about $500 million for the two years combined.
In January 2015, PES spun off the terminal, creating North Yard as a separate firm. PES then signed a ten-year agreement with North Yard to pay $1.95 for each barrel unloaded and agreed to a minimum quarterly volume of 170,000 bpd, guaranteeing the $30 million quarterly payments to North Yard. For any barrel PES unloaded above the threshold, the refinery paid North Yard 51 cents.
The system was designed to reward PES for success, but had no contingency plan to protect the refiner against the failure that would quickly follow the deal. The rail terminal has averaged just 58,000 bpd since the contract was signed, according to figures provided to Reuters by energy intelligence service Genscape, because Carlyle and PES could no longer access crude at prices low enough to make the rail shipments profitable.
That left PES paying millions of dollars to Carlyle, through North Yard, for oil shipments it never received.
BAD BET ON CHEAP CRUDE
Carlyle’s purchase of PES and the rail terminal investment were bets that U.S. oil would remain cheap relative to imports. A glut of domestic production had caused U.S. crude to sell at a deep discount to imported barrels, with the gap averaging about $8.60 between 2012 and 2015.
But by late 2015, an oil price rebound slashed the domestic discount to less than $3 a barrel – not enough to cover the cost of a long rail journey.
PES nonetheless continued to pay North Yard a total of $298 million between 2015 until August 2017, filings show. The Carlyle-led investor group received $151 million, in eight distributions, of the total paid to North Yard.
In November of that year, PES took on more debt to finance more payouts to investors, borrowing a total of $160 million in two loans against the rail terminal and delivering the proceeds its Carlyle-led backers, filings show.
Corley, the PES spokeswoman said terminal investment more than paid for itself during its more profitable period. But for last two years, PES said in filings, the refinery remained largely cut off from the cheap crude it needed to survive.

""Perversely, it became cheaper to transport crude oil from North Dakota to points in Western Europe than it was to transport the same crude oil to Philadelphia,"" the firm said.

Crude Oil WTI Futures for April delivery were trading at $62.20 a barrel mid-morning in Asia, up 1.06%. Brent crude futures for April delivery, traded in London, were down 0.40% at $65.41 per barrel.
Partly due to Saudi Arabia’s vow to cut oil production by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) next month compared to the February level and to cut exports to below 7 million bpd in March, oil prices are stabilizing and inching back up from sharp drops at the beginning of the month. Brent started February at $69.65 and WTI started at $65.80.
Saudi Arabia increased its January production by 23,300 bpd to 9.977 million bpd, according to the latest numbers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), released last week. This figure, however, is still below its quota of 10.058 million bpd.
Further supporting prices are rising tensions in the Middle East, especially along the border of Syria and Israel where Iranian and Syrian forces are reportedly amassing with Israeli forces responding. Although neither Syria nor Israel plays much of a role in the oil market, prices tend to increase whenever there is a threat to oil anywhere in the Middle East.
Preventing oil prices from rocketing is the continued increase in production in the U.S.
Now the second-largest producer of oil, ahead of Saudi Arabia, the U.S. has increased its production by more than 20% since mid-2016 to more than 10 million bpd. This puts downward pressure on oil prices while strong global economic fundamentals and Saudi Arabia’s efforts to reduce the global oversupply of oil are preventing big drops in prices.
Meanwhile, demand from China continues to increase, and the International Energy Agency (IEA) has raised its forecast for oil demand this year by 7.7%, expecting global demand to increase by 1.4 million bpd through 2018."

270,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",U.S. Oil Exports Go Up a Gear as Supertanker Sets Sail for China,"(Bloomberg) -- The flood of U.S. oil exports stepped up a gear on Monday after the first fully laden supertanker sailed from an American port, alleviating a bottleneck that’s limited overseas shipments.
The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, or LOOP, the only deep water port in the U.S. able to handle the industry’s biggest tankers, said in a statement it had successfully completed the first loading of a very large crude carrier. Shipping data compiled by Bloomberg show the tanker is the Saudi Arabian-owned Shaden, now heading to the Chinese port of Rizhao.
""There could not be a better time to offer this service as domestic production surpasses 10 million barrels per day in the ever-dynamic global crude oil market,"" said LOOP LLC President Tom Shaw.
LOOP has been a vital piece of U.S. energy infrastructure for more than 30 years, handling oil imports from across the world as well as gathering crude pumped from deepwater deposits in the Gulf of Mexico. Since it started receiving oil in 1981, it has offloaded 10,200 tankers.
The Shaden, which is owned by the National Shipping Co. of Saudi Arabia and carries the flag of the kingdom, was the first VLCC to load oil at the port rather than discharge it.
Pipelines and ports have become the biggest bottleneck in U.S. oil exports, with traders at times engineering logistically complex chains combining railways, trucks, pipelines, barges, and ship-to-ship transfers to get crude out of the country. As U.S. output surpasses the record high of 10 million barrels a day set in 1970, trading houses, pipeline owners and ports are investing in new infrastructure to ship more American crude overseas.
While U.S. crude has already been exported using supertankers, other ports are too shallow to allow full loadings, meaning smaller ships must shuttle multiple cargoes to the giant vessels as they wait to load offshore. LOOP, because it stands in deeper water about 18 miles off of the Louisiana coast, allows the industry’s largest tankers to load in one go.
Using very large crude carriers will significantly cut shipping costs. The new export capacity at LOOP will allow the supertankers to deliver foreign crude into the U.S. and depart laden, known as back-hauling in the industry’s jargon, rather than returning empty.
LOOP said the ""shipper of record"" was the trading arm of Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc. However, data compiled by Bloomberg showed the Shaden was booked last month by Unipec, China’s biggest oil trader. a unit of the country’s refining giant China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec.
LOOP didn’t disclose what kind of oil the Shaden loaded, but traders said it was unlikely U.S. shale oil. It’s more likely to be a mix of crude pumped out of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Washington lifted a 40-year ban on most oil exports in late 2015, reshaping the world’s energy map as U.S. crude was shipped to countries including Switzerland, China, Israel and even the United Arab Emirates. The de facto export ban, which only allowed a few exceptions, was imposed in the aftermath of a 1973 to 1974 oil embargo led by Saudi Arabia.
Even though the country remains a net oil importer, U.S. crude exports have surged to a record high of 2.1 million barrels since the ban was lifted. China and other Asian nations have become big buyers.

Trading volumes were expected to remain limited as U.S. markets were closed on Monday in observance of Presidents' Day.
Comex gold futures were down 0.37% at $1,351.1 a troy ounce by 02:10 a.m. ET (06:10 GMT), off Friday's three-and-a-half week peak of $1,364.4.
The greenback strengthened after data on Friday showed that U.S. homebuilding increased to more than a one-year high in January and that building permits soared to their highest level since 2007.
The upbeat report overshadowed fresh concerns over the deficit in the U.S., which is projected to climb near $1 trillion in 2019 following the recent announcement of infrastructure spending and large corporate tax cuts.
The dollar was also supported after the U.S. Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that consumer prices rose more than expected in January by 0.5%, sending U.S. bond yields higher.
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

273,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2018 12:00AM ET</span>","For timing of Aramco IPO, watch forward oil price curve","By Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - It's the burning question in the oil industry: when will Saudi Arabia pull the trigger on the Aramco stock market listing?
Many industry experts are focusing on the current level of oil prices. However another key consideration for Saudi officials in floating up to 5 percent of the state oil producer is where they see prices in one to two years' time, two sources close to the IPO said. 
The Riyadh government is carefully analyzing the future price curve structure in oil markets because it regards prices further out as an important element in achieving a high valuation in what could be the biggest initial public offering in history, the sources told Reuters.
Ideally, so-called long-dated prices for one and two years ahead need to move at least $10 higher - to around $70 per barrel - for the government to be happy to launch the listing, said the sources, who declined to be named as the information is confidential.
""When will the ideal moment come?"" said one of the sources. ""Maybe you should also look at the forward curve for oil ... as the forward curve will be key for investors valuing Aramco.""
The Saudi energy ministry and Saudi Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Many considerations are likely to influence the IPO timing, and the final decision may rest with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. But if long-dated prices at around $70 are an important factor, this could indicate a listing may be some way away. 
Brent oil futures for March 2019 are valued now at $60.60, about a $4 discount to the $64.50 current - spot - price, and for two years away at $57.70. 
Saudi officials have given few clues about the IPO, with energy minister Khalid al-Falih and finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan saying only that the government will proceed when ""the time is right"".
Spot and long-dated prices often do not move together. Immediate prices are more influenced by developments such as politically driven supply outages or natural disasters, while prices further down the curve are more affected by broader expectations of supply and demand, factoring in issues such as OPEC output policy and the rise of electric vehicles. 
Spot prices rose to a three-year high above $70 in January but have since slid nearly 15 percent together with a broader decline in the stock markets due to fears about global inflation as well as renewed concerns about rising U.S. oil production.
The concern about long-dated prices could also cast OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia's oil-supply policies in a new light.
The kingdom has orchestrated a global oil output cut deal to support prices, a move which Reuters has previously reported was partly driven by a desire to maximize Aramco's valuation for the IPO.
Falih has repeatedly said he sees OPEC cuts lasting until the end of 2018 and even then that the exit would be very gradual - comments that helped support not only near-term but also longer-dated prices.
'SWEET SPOT'
The Saudi government says Aramco is worth $2 trillion and aims to list on one or more foreign stock exchanges in addition to Riyadh.
Saudi sources have said the listing on a local bourse could happen before the international listing. It is not clear if the forward oil price indicator will be a key consideration for the timing of a local listing. 
The IPO is a central part of the crown prince's reform drive aimed at restructuring the kingdom's economy and reducing its dependence on oil revenue. The prince is also one of the architects of the output production pact between OPEC and Russia. 
While Saudi officials think $60 per barrel is a reasonable price for oil in the long term, the rally at the start of 2018 has provided an incentive to bump up the Aramco valuation, according to a third source close to the IPO.
""$60 is a sweet spot. But now they are making hay while the sun shines,"" the source said.
He added however that, inside Aramco, concerns were also rising that a prolonged rally could again spur U.S. shale production too much and lead to a loss of Saudi market share. 

""A rally to the $70s carries the seeds of its own destruction,"" the source said.

Markets in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, China, the US and Canada are shut on Monday. In the week ahead, investors will focus on minutes of the Fed’s latest policy meeting with hopes the central bank will give more hints on the pace of future rate hikes this year.
Last week, gold prices pulled back from three-week highs on Friday as the dollar rebounded against a currency basket, but losses were held in check as the dollar remained near multi-year lows. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for overseas buyers.
Expectations for a faster rate of monetary tightening outside the U.S., which would lessen the divergence between the Federal Reserve and other central banks has eroded the dollar’s relative yield attraction for investors.
The greenback has also been hit by concerns that recent tax cuts will negatively impact the US fiscal deficit, which is projected to balloon to near $1 trillion in 2019.
Although gold struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets such as Treasury’s when borrowing costs rise, some analysts said the factors that drove the uptick in inflation were cyclical, meaning growth in inflation is likely to be gradual.

276,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2018 11:18AM ET</span>","Exclusive: For now, U.S. wants Europeans just to commit to improve Iran deal","By Arshad Mohammed, John Irish and Robin Emmott
WASHINGTON/PARIS/MUNICH (Reuters) - The United States has sketched out a path under which three key European allies would simply commit to try to improve the Iran nuclear deal over time in return for U.S. President Donald Trump keeping the pact alive by renewing U.S. sanctions relief in May.
The approach, outlined in a State Department cable obtained by Reuters and an interview with a senior department official this week, still faces obstacles. The European allies are uncertain what will satisfy Trump and are reluctant to make such a commitment only to find that he asks them for more, two European officials and two former U.S. officials said. 
The cable's characterization of what the United States wants from the Europeans, which has not been previously reported, sets a lower standard than laid out by Trump in January and so might facilitate a meeting of the minds, five current European and four former U.S. officials said.
""We are asking for your commitment that we should work together to seek a supplemental or follow-on agreement that addresses Iran’s development or testing long-range missiles, ensures strong IAEA inspections, and fixes the flaws of the 'sunset clause,'"" said the cable (http://reut.rs/2ocuNM2).
The crux of the July 2015 agreement between Iran and six major powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - was that Iran would restrict its nuclear program in return for relief from sanctions that have crippled its economy.
Trump sees three defects in the deal: its failure to address Iran's ballistic missile program; the terms under which international inspectors can visit suspect Iranian nuclear sites; and ""sunset"" clauses under which limits on the Iranian nuclear program start to expire after 10 years. He wants all three strengthened if the United States is to stay in the deal. 
Trump delivered an ultimatum to the European powers on Jan. 12, saying they must agree to ""fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal"" or he would refuse to extend the U.S. sanctions relief on Iran that it calls for. U.S. sanctions will resume unless Trump issues fresh “waivers” to suspend them on May 12.
""This is a last chance,"" he said.
The State Department declined comment on the cable, saying it would not discuss internal communications. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on what Trump sought in his Jan. 12 statement or how it viewed the approach outlined in the cable.
AN AGREEMENT TO GET AN AGREEMENT
Reaching a full-blown international accord by the May 12 deadline is seen as an impossibility by some U.S. and European officials even if there was agreement on the underlying issues, which there is not.
In an interview last week, a senior U.S. State Department described the effort with the Europeans as a two-phase process.
During the first, from Jan. 12 to May 12, the United States will seek to get the Europeans to agree on the weaknesses that need to be fixed, he said.
""We want a commitment from them that these are the deficiencies that need to be addressed ... and an agreement that we will seek an agreement. That’s it,"" he said.
The second phase, to begin immediately after May 12, would take that understanding to the other parties to the deal - Iran, Russia and China - to see if there was some way to address these issues.
The official said there were three possible avenues to do this: amend the existing pact, negotiate a supplemental agreement, or seek a new U.N. Security Council resolution to make the changes.
If the United States were to pursue a supplemental accord, which is common in arms control, it would want the support of Iran, Russia and China but could live with just the agreement of Germany, France and Britain, the senior U.S. official said.
In such a scenario, the four Western nations could create their own supplemental agreement to reimpose sanctions if the Iranians violated any of the new conditions that they would set. 
In a meeting not been previously reported, U.S. negotiators will next see officials from Britain, France and Germany, known as the ""E3,"" in Paris on Tuesday, U.S. and European officials said, to discuss how to meet Trump's demands.
""A LITTLE SOFTER""
European officials said in interviews they did not know if the view laid out in the State Department diplomatic cable - sent to U.S. diplomats in London, Paris, Berlin and Brussels to deliver to their counterparts - will prevail in Washington. 
Ultimately, they said, all that counts is Trump's judgment on whether to renew U.S. sanctions waivers that expire on May 12.
""Has the Trump administration shifted its stance? We don't know,"" said a senior European diplomat on Friday.
""The reality is that what we are doing now is to try to get the best package possible to convince Trump,"" said a second European diplomat on Friday, referring to Trump's concerns on missiles, inspections and the sunset clauses.
""Nobody knows what Trump will do or wants,"" he added.
That confusion is caused, in part, by disagreements among different parts of the U.S. administration and the fundamental unpredictability of what Trump — who has at times rejected the advice of his senior national security officials — may ultimately decide.
The State Department cable was ""a little softer"" than Trump's statement, said Richard Boucher, a former State Department spokesman for five U.S. secretaries of state.
Boucher and three other former U.S. officials flagged the difference between Trump’s demand the E3 reach an ""agreement to fix the terrible flaws"" of the deal and the cable's less demanding language seeking a ""commitment"" to ""work together"" to ""seek"" a supplemental accord that ""addresses"" its deficiencies.

""The president, to me, was holding out a higher standard. They have to agree and negotiate and we have to get an agreement. Whereas the other one was (saying) we have to get their commitment to go down this road,"" Boucher said.

MUNICH (Reuters) - U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said on Saturday that, despite denials, public reports showed that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was using chemical weapons, and added that it was time for the international community to hold the Syrian government to account.
""Public accounts and photos clearly show that Assad's chemical weapons use is continuing,"" McMaster said at a major international security conference taking place in Munich. 
""It is time for all nations to hold the Syrian regime and its sponsors accountable for their actions and support the efforts of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,"" he said.
McMaster did not specify which public accounts or pictures he was referring to.
Earlier this month, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the Syrian government had repeatedly used chlorine gas, but stressed that the U.S. did not have evidence of sarin gas use.
French President Emmanuel Macron has said that ""France will strike"" if chemical weapons are used against civilians in the Syrian conflict in violation of international treaties, but that he had not yet seen proof this is the case.
The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and said it targets only armed rebels and militants.
In recent weeks, rescue workers, aid groups and the United States have accused Syria of repeatedly using chlorine gas as a weapon against civilians in Ghouta and Idlib.
Earlier this month, Syrian government forces, who are backed by Russia and Iran, bombarded the areas, two of the last major rebel-held parts of Syria.
Diplomatic efforts have made scant progress towards ending a war now approaching its eighth year, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced half the pre-war Syrian population of 23 million from their homes.
NORTH KOREA
McMaster called on the international community to do more on North Korea.
""We must pressure the Kim regime, using all available tools, to ensure that this cruel dictatorship cannot threaten the world with the most destructive weapons on earth,"" he said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
The United States has appeared to endorse closer post-Olympics engagement between North and South Korea with an eye to eventual U.S.-North Korean talks, but has agreed with Seoul that sanctions must be intensified to push Pyongyang to negotiate an end to its nuclear weapons program.
The prospect of negotiations comes after months of tension over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, in which U.S. President Donald Trump and the North Korean leader traded insults and threats, while the U.N. tightened sanctions.

""Nations that evade full enforcement and fail to take these steps are acting irresponsibly, now is the time to do more,"" McMaster said, calling on countries to cut off military and commercial ties with Pyongyang.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for March delivery rose 34 cents to settle at $61.68 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 37 cents to trade at $64.70 a barrel.
The number of oil rigs operating in the US jumped by seven to 798, the highest level since April 2, 2015, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes.
That added to investor fears that rising US oil output would offset major oil producers’ efforts – as part of the production-cut agreement – to rid the market of excess oil stockpiles.
The rise in US oil rigs comes just two days after data showed US producers continued to ramp up output.
The Energy Information Agency disclosed its weekly supply totals report showing U.S. crude output hit a record 10.27 million barrels per day. This keeps the US on track to meet the EIA’s recent estimate for domestic production to top 11 million barrels per day by year-end.
Also weighing on sentiment somewhat was a duo of reports earlier this week from OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) claiming that non-OPEC output, led by the US, was set to surge in the months ahead.
Non-OPEC production, led by the US, is likely to grow by more than demand in 2018, the International Energy Agency cited in a monthly report. The energy body also said that the underlying oil market fundaments appeared “less supportive for prices” so far this year.
The IEA report echoed some of the findings observed in the OPEC monthly report released Monday, showing the oil cartel revised upward its estimate for non-OPEC output to a total of 59.26 million bpd this year, 320,000 bpd higher than its previous forecast."

Gold futures for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $5.70, or 0.42%, to $1,349.70 a troy ounce.
In the wake of a rebound in the dollar, gold prices fell but remained well supported as traders continued to mull over the impact of rising inflation on the precious metal.
Dollar-denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar – A fall in the dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency and thus, increases demand for the precious metal.
Some say that rising inflation, supporting expectations for further Federal Reserve rate hikes will weighed on the precious metal as it gets dumped for interest-bearing assets like bonds. Others, however, suggested that gold provides a hedge against inflation, so tends to garner attention in an inflationary environment.
Also supporting gold prices was an uptick in Far East demand as the Chinese New Year got underway which usually ushers in gift buying in the form of gold jewellery, which accounts for roughly 50% of total gold demand.
“Based on the local premiums to international gold prices, it appears that demand ahead of the Chinese New Year has been relatively strong,” Capital Economics analyst Simona Gambarini said earlier this week in an email to clients.

Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London added 11 cents or about 0.14% to $64.42 a barrel, still on the upside but off session highs of $64.94.
The rally in oil prices was capped as the greenback regained some strength after data on Friday showed that U.S. homebuilding increased to more than a one-year high in January and that building permits soared to their highest level since 2007.
The greenback came under broad selling pressure earlier amid fresh concerns over the U.S. deficit, which is projected to climb near $1 trillion in 2019 following the announcement of infrastructure spending and large corporate tax cuts.

The socialist leader, who is up for re-election in April, also said that a process of bond renegotiation and restructuring was ""impeccable."" 
Venezuela is undergoing an economic crisis, with quadruple-digit inflation and widespread shortages of food and medicine. Crude production is at its lowest levels in many years. The OPEC nation is also behind on more than $1.6 billion inpayments across sovereign debt and that of state oil company PDVSA, Japanese bank Nomura said in a recent note to investors. 
""The negotiation and restructuring processes of our international debt is impeccable, going better than I could have hoped which demonstrates it was the correct decision,"" Maduro told reporters. 
Oil accounts for some 95 percent of Venezuela's export revenue. 
Venezuela said oil output rose in January to 1.8 million bpd, according to OPEC. However, the oil cartel's secondary sources reported the true figure was just 1.6 million bpd, its lowest monthly figure in more than a decade and a half. 
Crude production fell 13 percent in 2018 from the previous year, according to OPEC. 
It was the biggest decline among OPEC members, who have pledged to restrain output through 2018. 
But unlike voluntary cuts by other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries intended to stoke higher crude prices, Venezuela has been unable to stop a six-year-long production decline. 
While the government has vowed to stay current on its debt, it has also deferred payments into grace periods and beyond. It blames U.S. sanctions for delays. 

Critics blame the crisis on strict currency and price controls and deep corruption at high levels in government.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. fell by 194 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Feb. 9, above forecasts for a withdrawal of 183 bcf.
That compared with a decline of 119 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 114 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 154 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 1.884 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
That figure is 577 bcf, or around 23.4%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 433 bcf, or roughly 18.6%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
It fell to its lowest since May 2016 at $2.530 earlier in the session amid speculation the end of the winter heating season will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for the fuel.
Market experts warned that futures are likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term as the coldest part of the winter has effectively passed and below-normal temperatures in April mean less than they do in January and February.
Spring usually sees the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil slipped towards $64 barrel on Thursday as record U.S. production and rising inventories outweighed a weak dollar and Saudi Arabia's comments that OPEC and other producers were committed to their pact on cutting supplies.
U.S. crude output hit a record 10.27 million barrels per day, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, making it a bigger producer than Saudi Arabia. U.S. crude and gasoline inventories rose last week, U.S. data showed.
Brent crude (LCOc1), the global benchmark, fell 32 cents to$64.04 at 1208 GMT, giving up an earlier gains that had extended Wednesday's rally. U.S. crude (CLc1) was up 1 cent at $60.61.
""What we have now is a bit of a re-adjustment from the price rise we had yesterday, which was a bit overdone,"" said Olivier Jakob, analyst at Petromatrix. ""I don't think the data was that supportive,"" he added, referring to the EIA's inventory report.
Crude inventories rose by 1.8 million barrels in the week to Feb. 9, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said, an increase that was less than analysts' forecasts.
Gasoline stocks rose by 3.6 million barrels, more than double the forecast.
Oil had climbed on Wednesday and early on Thursday after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC would do better to leave the market tight than end the deal on cutting output too soon.
""Khalid al-Falih gave his strongest hint yet that exiting the current supply agreement is unlikely to be on the agenda this year,"" said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM.
Under the deal, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day, almost 2 percent of global supply. The cuts started a year ago and will run until the end of 2018.
But the rebound in U.S. production, encouraged by the higher prices delivered by the OPEC-led cuts, is undermining efforts to curb supplies. The EIA expects U.S. production to top 11 million bpd in late 2018, a year earlier than projected last month.

Rising U.S. output also countered support from a weaker dollar, which fell to a 15-month low against the yen. A weaker dollar makes oil and other dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.

296,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",Saudis Says OPEC May Need New Way to Count Oil Stockpiles,"(Bloomberg) -- OPEC will soon discuss with Russia a new way to measure oil stockpiles, with the Saudi Energy Minister saying that finding reliable inventory data has been a challenge to more than a year of oil-output cuts meant to curb the global glut.
Oil producers involved in the supply reductions, which have helped lift crude prices to three-year highs, will discuss which inventory levels to consider when they meet in April, Saudi Arabia Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih told reporters in Riyadh on Wednesday. More coordination is needed to assess inventories, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at the same meeting.
Russia, OPEC and their allies committed to output cuts in November 2016 to reduce global inventories to their five-year average. Since then, the producers haven’t disclosed how this benchmark is defined, and Al-Falih admitted after talks in Oman last month that a technical discussion was required on what the oil market needs in terms of inventory.
One possible new measurement would be to assess how long existing inventories would meet demand, or forward-day cover, Al-Falih said. Finding reliable data for inventories remains a challenge, he said.
For more on using inventory levels as a metric to base oil policy click here
Citigroup Inc. -- along with a growing number of analysts -- says the group can probably exit the strategy earlier than planned, at some point in the summer, as oil inventories are already back to normal levels. That contrasts with the view of the 24-nation coalition of oil producers, which says the surplus in industrialized countries is still substantial and has pledged to press on with the curbs until the end of this year.
Oil has been struggling to recover to levels seen before last week’s plunge as investors are wary that OPEC’s strategy of curbing output could backfire and lead to a resurgence in U.S. shale production. While oil stockpiles in developed nations have shrunk to the lowest since 2014, supplies still remain about 52 million barrels above the five-year average, according to the International Energy Agency.
Data on oil demand and stockpiles outside developed economies can be patchy, which is one reason why OPEC and Russia based their target on more reliable data from the group of industrialized nations known as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But accounting for inventories in other nations including Saudi Arabia, Brazil, China and crude held on tankers,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) concluded the oversupply has been eliminated.
Al-Falih said on Wednesday that he prefers to see producers maintaining the production cuts this year even if that would result in a small supply shortage.
“If we have to overbalance the market a little bit, then so be it,” he told reporters. “Rather than quitting too early and finding out we were dealing with less reliable information"" of inventories, he said. It’s better to ""stay the course and make sure that inventories are where the industry needs them,” Al-Falih said.

299,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>","A year into OPEC's production cuts, Asia's oil markets have tightened","By Henning Gloystein
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Just over a year into production cuts lead by OPEC and Russia, oil markets in Asia have tightened noticeably as significant amounts of excess crude have been taken off tankers used for storage and delivered to customers across the region.
Shipping data shows about 15 super-tankers are currently filled with oil floating off the coasts of Singapore and surrounding Malaysia, Asia's main trading and storage hub for crude coming from the Middle East to Asia.
That's slightly less than last November, and half the number of tankers used for storage in mid-2017.
Traders say onshore tanks in the region, including at Vopak's site in Johor, Malaysia, are also not booked out any more, marking a turnaround from 2016/17 when a situation known as tank-top was feared in which oil markets are so bloated that they run out of storage.
The fall in storage is a sign production restraint started by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia in January 2017 is having the intended effect of reducing a global glut. 
The main impact of OPEC withholding supplies has been to change the structure of the oil price curve.
During oversupply, crude prices for immediate delivery tend to be lower than those for later dispatch, a market structure known as contango that gives traders an incentive to store oil for later sale.
With markets now tighter, spot prices are more expensive than those for later delivery, removing the incentive.
""Most of the contango stocks afloat are sold,"" said Oystein Berentsen, director for crude trading at Strong Petroleum in Singapore.
The oil price curve shows spot prices to be almost $4 per barrel above those for delivery this time next year.
""Floating storage is no longer economical,"" Berentsen said.
What's more, shipping data shows the majority of tankers storing oil around Singapore are only part full. In 2016/17, by contrast, the armada of tankers was filled to the rims.
WHERE FROM HERE?
The main factors that could flip oil markets back into oversupply are an end to OPEC's and Russia's production restraint and soaring U.S. output.
But Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de-facto leader, says it is committed to withholding production.
""If we have to err on over-balancing the market a little bit, so be it,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday.
U.S. output, however, is rising fast and its exports are increasingly appearing in Asia.
U.S. crude production hit a fresh record of 10.27 million barrels per day this month, more than top exporter Saudi Arabia pumps, and within reach of top producer Russia.

The International Energy Agency warned this week that supplies may start overtaking demand growth again later this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Penguins, Royal Dutch Shell's (L:RDSa) latest oil and gas development in a remote corner of the British North Sea, epitomizes the new doctrine for deepwater projects -- keep it cheap and simple. 
Shunned during the oil price crash of 2014-2016, deepwater projects are being embraced again, a challenge to the surge in onshore U.S. shale output.
Penguins, the first new major deepwater project this year, will rejuvenate the 44-year-old field by drilling 8 new wells 165 meters (541 feet) underwater and connecting them to a new production vessel. 
Due for completion in 2021 at a cost of around $1 billion, Penguins will cost a fraction of the average of giant developments earlier this decade, producing a modest 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day.
""It is another example of how we are unlocking development opportunities, with lower costs,"" Andy Brown, head of Shell's oil and gas production division, said.
GRAPHIC: http://reut.rs/2BpKCYe
Like Shell, companies such as  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM),  Total  (PA:TOTF) and  BP  (L:BP) have in recent years radically changed the way they design offshore fields - deploying steel platforms out at sea - to make them simpler and faster to build, and able to challenge the economics of shale fields such as the Permian basin in Texas.
As executives gain confidence that their companies can make a profit with oil at around $50 a barrel - less than half the level of the early 2010s - boards are set to approve more projects. Oil currently trades at around $60 a barrel.
Analysts at Bernstein expect around 40 new offshore projects to be approved in 2018, compared with 29 last year and 14 in 2016, when project numbers fell to the lowest since at least 1990. 
Companies including Exxon, Shell and BP have set a rigid cost ceiling for new projects, requiring them to be profitable with oil at $40 a barrel in order to withstand an uncertain outlook clouded by the rise of electric vehicles. 
As a result, most new projects are set to be significantly smaller than the traditional field size, averaging 42,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared with 69,000 last year, according to Bernstein.
""You will see more deepwater over time, for sure,"" Bernard Looney, head of BP's oil and gas production division, told Reuters in January. BP is expected to approve a number of projects this year, he added, including in Senegal, Mauritania, Oman and Azerbaijan.
Leaner projects can be achieved by drilling simpler wells and connecting them to existing platforms and pipelines, in what is known as infill drilling, or by swapping bespoke gear for off-the-shelf equipment and by processing vast amounts of data to streamline oil field construction. 
A sharp drop in rig and services costs, by as much as 80 percent in some cases over the past three years, has further helped reduce the cost of projects.
""Much is made of the Permian, its flexibility and the returns there. But actually infill drilling for a decade creates enormous sources of money,"" Looney said.
DEEPWATER PROJECTS
There are exceptions to the rule. Some fields are so vast that they require massive investment, while remaining profitable at low oil prices.
Among the largest projects expected to be approved this year are Petrobras's (SA:PETR4) Libra II in Brazil, at an expected cost of $10 billion, Shell's Bonga Southwest in Nigeria at $12.2 billion and Exxon's Mamba liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique at $30 billion, according to analysts at Jefferies. 
For all the buzz around shale production, it accounts for around 7 percent of the world's crude supply of around 98 million barrels per day while offshore production accounts for over one quarter.
The scale of the highly complex projects - one platform can produce 150,000 bpd in some cases - helped tap new resources in recent decades to meet surging global demand for energy. 
But some deepwater projects were plagued by huge cost over-runs and delays - one of the most famous examples being the giant Kazakh field Kashagan, later dubbed ""cash-all-gone"" as costs ballooned from $10 billion to $60 billion.
But after years of spending cuts, companies urgently need to develop new resources to offset the natural decline of fields, which can reach 10 percent per year.
""When you look at the mix you need offshore, you need deepwater. The onshore by itself won't be enough to make up for the decline rates that you are seeing globally,"" Lorenzo Simonelli, Chief Executive Officer of energy services company  Baker Hughes  (N:BHGE), told Reuters. 
Exxon, the world's top publicly traded oil company, last year gave the go-ahead for the development of the Liza field in Guyana. The project is expected to generate double-digit returns with oil at $40, the company said.
Oil majors have made a number of major discoveries in recent months - Exxon in Guyana, BP in the North Sea, Shell in the Gulf of Mexico, Eni and Total offshore Cyprus - and their development will hinge on keeping costs low.

""Discipline has to stay, we're very determined in this space. We're not going to say that now that the oil prices are back up, let's do more, let's spend more,"" BP's Looney said.

Front-month U.S. natural gas futures slumped 3.2 cents, or around 1.2%, to $2.562 per million British thermal units (btu) by 9:05AM ET (1405GMT). It fell to its lowest since May 2016 at $2.538 at the start of the week.
The commodity enjoyed a brief reprieve on Tuesday, rising about 1.6%.
Market experts warned that futures are likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term as the coldest part of the winter has effectively passed and below-normal temperatures in April mean less than they do in January and February.
Spring usually sees the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 173 and 187 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Feb. 9.
That compares with a decline of 119 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 114 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 154 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.078 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Oil prices finished lower on Tuesday after the International Energy Agency raised concerns about a ramp-up in output by non-OPEC producers.
The commodity has been on the backfoot recently as investors worried over soaring U.S. output levels.
U.S. crude oil production, driven by shale extraction, has rebounded by almost 20% since the most recent low in mid-2016 to 10.2 million barrels per day, above that of top exporter Saudi Arabia and within reach of Russia's output levels.
That added to fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.

That was largely due to soaring U.S. crude production, which has jumped by over 20 percent since mid-2016 to more than 10 million bpd, surpassing that of top exporter Saudi Arabia and coming within reach of Russia, the world's biggest producer. 
U.S. crude is also increasingly appearing on global markets, and more is set to come as the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port starts testing supertankers for exports. 
The surge in U.S. supplies means oil may be in oversupply again soon, flipping the 2017 deficit induced by supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia. 
The International Energy Agency said expects oil demand to grow by 1.4 million bpd in 2018, but adding that output growth could outpace demand. 
Citi said it expected 2018 oil markets to be balanced or in slight oversupply, forecasting a ""market surplus of 0 to 0.2 million bpd."" 
OPEC and the IEA ""are vastly underestimating the magnitude and sustainability of non-OPEC oil supply growth,"" Citi said. 
Markets are already reacting, with physical prices for crudes from the North Sea, Russia, the United States, and Middle East becoming cheaper. 
Despite the warning lights from within oil markets, economic fundamentals remain healthy.

Japan on Wednesday reported an 8th straight quarter of growth, its longest continuous expansion since the 1980s bubble economy, Cabinet Office data showed.

NUSA DUA, Indonesia/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Soaring gas demand from China, India and Southeast Asia is sucking up an LNG supply glut previously expected to last for years, opening opportunity for new production from East Africa to North America that had been deemed part of the overhang. 
Trade flows in Eikon show global liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports have risen 40 percent since 2015, to almost 40 billion cubic meters (bcm) a month. Growth accelerated in 2017, with imports up by a fifth, largely due to China, but also South Korea and Japan. 
Asia's LNG market has been glutted since 2015, following massive development that began in the early 2000s. But a gasification program in China last year and strong economic growth across Asia pushed up demand, contributing - along with a cold winter - to a doubling of LNG spot prices from mid-2017. 
The market is expected to remain relatively tight for the remainder of 2018, with China's gas program continuing and delays at several export projects. 
""The tight market is going to continue simply because demand is growing and expected projects have been delayed,"" said Jun Nishizawa, senior vice president at the energy division of Japan's Mitsubishi Corp's. 
Nishizawa cited delays in projects at Cameron LNG export terminal in Louisiana, in which Mitsubishi has a stake, and Freeport LNG in Texas.
Freeport's first LNG train is scheduled to be completed in November 2018 and no delays have been announced. 
""I don't think substantial LNG will be produced by these two projects by end of the year,"" Nishizawa said, speaking at an LNG industry conference last week in Bali, Indonesia.
In Australia, the Ichthys project developed by Japan's Inpex and France's Total has seen several delays and cost blowouts. Total's CEO said first exports now may not come until the second quarter. 
The LNG tanker market is also tight, with few ships ordered in recent years. 
""The global LNG tanker market looks increasingly bullish for 2018 and 2019, as strong demand growth and a thinning order-book pressure the available supply,"" BMI Research said this week.
CHANCE FOR NEW PROJECTS
This unexpected tightening potentially opens the way for new projects for the first time in several years. 
Many projects were delayed or axed when oil and gas prices started tumbling in mid-2014. Now energy companies are returning to health as prices have improved. 
""The entire Asian LNG market will increase. It will stimulate more producers to take the risk to develop projects to get into Asia,"" said Jarand Rystad, chief executive of consultancy Rystad Energy. 
In East Africa, U.S. energy firm Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) is getting closer to a final investment decision (FiD) as it lines up potential buyers for its Mozambique gas field. 
Tokyo Gas is the latest to near an offtake agreement, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named as they could not talk about ongoing contractual negotiations. 
Anadarko and Tokyo Gas declined to comment. 
Anadarko's Mozambique concession holds an estimated 75 trillion cubic feet (2.1 trillion cubic meters) of gas, its website says, four times 2017's globally imported LNG volumes. 
Several export projects in North America also hope for FiD this year. 
They include LNG Canada, or Kitimat, a $40 billion, 6.5 million-tonnes-a-year venture involving Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), PetroChina, Korea Gas Corporation and Japan's Mitsubishi. 
In the United States, Cheniere Energy plans to expand, and Pembina Pipeline hopes for FiD on its 7.8 million-tonne-a-year Jordan Cove plant in Oregon.
Also, top LNG exporter Qatar plans to expand output to over 100 million tonnes a year by 2024, from 77 million tonnes now. 
Other projects and expansions are planned from West Africa to Papua New Guinea.
Just a few of these projects would lift specialist LNG firms like Norway's Hoegh LNG. 
""Now that they (China) are setting up (import) terminals, more demand could emerge,"" said Parth Jindal, managing director of Hoegh LNG Asia. 
One risk to new projects, though, are emerging price disputes between buyers and sellers, with importers demanding cheaper and more flexible terms. 
Poten and Partners, an energy brokerage and consultancy, said this week a ""dearth of commitments"" from buyers to long-term contracts would make it hard for developers to finance new capacity. 
NEW DEMAND 
North Asia has been anchoring demand for the past decade - Japan, China and South Korea being the top three LNG importers - with China accounting for most of the growth. 
South and Southeast Asia are now providing new demand. 
India is starting a gas development program that could match China's, planning to add 11 LNG import terminals to an existing four.. 
Pakistan started importing LNG in 2015 and has ambitious expansion plans. Bangladesh and Myanmar also plan to develop import terminals.
Thailand expects its LNG imports to climb nearly sevenfold, to 35 million tonnes a year by 2036, and Indonesia, the world's fifth-biggest LNG exporter, is expected to become a net importer as domestic production stalls. 

By 2030, Thailand and Indonesia together could import nearly 70 million tonnes of LNG a year, said Azam Mohammad of consultancy McKinsey, comparable to all the gas China imported in 2017.

314,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 11:27PM ET</span>",Oil Prices Flat In Asia Morning As Traders Eye Mixed Cues ,"Investing.com - Oil prices were mostly flat Wednesday morning in Asia, with traders in the region reacting to mixed cues from data that suggests demand will increase this year but so will supply.
Crude Oil WTI Futures for March delivery were trading at $59.17 a barrel mid-morning in Asia, down 0.03% but zig-zagging between mild gains and losses. Brent crude futures for April delivery, traded in London, were up 0.13% at $62.80 per barrel in mid-morning.
A stronger U.S. dollar, faster-than-anticipated U.S. production and a surge in demand from China have supported oil prices over the last week but oil remains well off recent highs, likely due to lingering concerns of oversupply.
Brent started February at $69.65 and WTI started at $65.80.
On Tuesday, International Energy Agency (IEA) raised both its forecast for oil demand this year by 7.7% but also warned that production is rising, particularly in the U.S. and that could put downward pressure on oil. The IEA expects global demand to increase by 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) through 2018.
The IEA's comments followed numbers last week that pointed to the U.S. emerging as the second-largest producer of oil, ahead of Saudi Arabia. U.S. production has increased by more than 20% since the middle of 2016 to more than 10 million bpd, inching on top producer Russia.
Pushing prices up were expectations of more demand this year not only from the IEA but also from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which said earlier this week that demand would increase faster than expected. OPEC forecast an increase of 1.59 bpd in global demand, an increase of 600,000 bpd from earlier forecasts.
Also supporting oil prices was ongoing weakness in the dollar, which may have helped demand.
Strong global economic fundamentals may also be supporting oil prices, or at least preventing further drops. Japan reported Wednesday an eighth consecutive quarter of growth, even though the expansion there slowed in the quarter to December.
Demand from China is also increasing with oil exports from the second largest economy topping imports from the US.
Next month, China has plans to launch yuan-denominated oil futures on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange. The oil futures would be launched March 26.
Keeping oil's rebound in check, however, were numbers from The American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday.
The API said inventories of crude in the US rose by 3.9 million barrels in the week to Feb. 9 to 422.4 million, far exceeding analysts' expectations of a 2.8-million-barrel increase. The API said gasoline inventories increased by 4.6 million barrels compared to expectations of a 1.2-million-barrel increase.
The API numbers have underscored fears of an oversupply."

Gold futures for February delivery were up 0.53% to $1,337.40 a troy ounce by 10:20pm ET, supported by a weaker dollar. A retreat in the dollar has helped gold prices to rebound from its one-month low of $1,306.81 an ounce last week.
The U.S. Dollar Index that tracks the dollar against a basket of currencies was down 0.11% to 89.60, but gold prices are likely to be range bound before the release of U.S. inflation data.
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

Overnight, crude oil prices settled lower for a second straight day after the International Energy Agency’s gloomy monthly report stoked investor fears that rising US oil output would derail OPEC’s efforts to rebalance the market.
Non-OPEC production, led by the US, is likely to grow by more than demand in 2018, according to a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA). The energy body warned, however, that the underlying oil market fundamentals appeared “less supportive for prices” so far this year.
While the IEA raised its demand growth outlook to 1.4 million barrels of oil per day, investors were concerned with the energy watchdog’s bearish view on supply, warning that higher US oil production – expected soon to overtake that of Saudi Arabia – could reverse the trend of falling oil stockpiles.
The IEA report echoed some of the findings observed in the OPEC monthly report released Monday, showing the oil cartel revised upward its estimate for non-OPEC output to a total of 59.26 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, 320,000 bpd higher than its previous forecast.

318,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 03:56PM ET</span>",Physical oil market sends warning to OPEC: Rout might not be over,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov, Olga Yagova and Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - As OPEC watches a near 15 percent drop in the oil price in three weeks, important indicators in the physical crude market are flashing worrying signals that the decline might be far from over.
The concerns come not from the heavily traded futures market, but from less transparent trading activity in crude oil and other products markets, where key U.S., European and Russian crude prices have fallen of late, suggesting less robust demand.
Benchmark oil futures have plunged in recent days together with global stock markets due to concerns over inflation as well as renewed fears that rapid output increases out of United States will flood the market with more crude this year.
OPEC, including its Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo, argue the decline is just a blip because demand is exceeding supply and will guarantee prices won't plunge again to $30 per barrel as they did in 2015 and 2016.
Traditionally, when oil futures decline, prices in the physical markets tend to rise because crude is becoming cheaper and hence more attractive to refiners.
But in the past weeks, differentials in key European and U.S. markets such as North Sea Forties, Russia's Urals, West Texas Intermediate in Midland, Texas, or the Atlantic diesel market have all fallen to multi-month lows.
The reasons tend to be different for most physical grades but overall the trend paints a bearish picture. 
""Physical markets do not lie. If regional areas of oversupply cannot find pockets of demand, prices will decline,"" said Michael Tran from RBC Capital Markets.
(Graphic: Benchmark European diesel refining margins - http://reut.rs/2BoIGzb)
""Atlantic Basin crudes are the barometer for the health of the global oil market since the region is the first to reflect looser fundamentals. Struggling North Sea physical crudes like Brent, Forties, and Ekofisk suggest that barrels are having difficulty finding buyers,"" he added.
This follows the run-up in U.S. production to daily output of 10.04 million bpd as of November, highest since 1970, pushing it into second place among crude producers, ahead of Saudi Arabia and trailing only Russia, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. 
On Tuesday, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said increased U.S. supply could cause output to exceed demand globally in 2018.
Forties crude differentials to dated Brent have fallen to minus 70 cents, down from a premium of 75 cents at the start of the year as the Forties pipeline returned to normal operation.
The Forties differentials are now not far off their lowest since the middle of 2017, when the benchmark Brent crude price was trading at around $45 per barrel compared to $62 per barrel now and $71 per barrel just a few weeks ago.
In the United States, key grades traded in Texas and Louisiana have fallen to their lowest in several months. 
URALS, DIESEL STRUGGLE
A similar pattern is observed in the Russian Urals market, one of the biggest by volumes in Europe.
At a discount of $2.15 to dated Brent, Urals' differentials in the Mediterranean are now at their lowest since September 2016, when Brent futures were hovering near $40-$45 per barrel.
""Sour grades are not in a good shape worldwide, so is Urals,"" said a European crude oil trader, who asked not to be named because he is not allowed to speak publicly. That sharply contrasts with a situation from the start of 2017 when OPEC cuts of predominantly sour grades made them attractive to buyers.
""Supply is more than ample in Europe, Urals faces strong competition from the Middle Eastern grades,"" said another trader on the Russian crude oil market adding that supplies of Urals to Asia were uneconomic due to a wide Brent-Dubai spread.
Adding pressure on Urals, traders expect loadings of the grade to rise in the coming months due to seasonal maintenance at Russian refineries.
A decline in physical crude values generally means better margins for refiners. But it is also not happening this time.
The profit margin refiners make on processing crude into diesel collapsed in Europe and the United States by over 18 percent over the past week, according to Reuters data. 
Europe, where nearly half of the vehicles are fueled by diesel, is the home to the global benchmark for diesel prices and the biggest storage hub for the road fuel as regional refineries are unable to meet local demand.
""Oil demand isn't that bad in general, but heating oil demand has been horrible, particularly in the United States and Germany,"" Robert Campbell, head of global oil product markets at consultancy Energy Aspects, said. 
    ""European refineries are running at very high rates since December so there is plenty of supply in the region while the weather has been warmer than usual, which led to weaker demand.""
    The refined product markets were expected to significantly tighten in March and April due to a high seasonal refinery maintenance schedule. [REF/E]

    But in a further indication of wavering confidence, the spread between the April Low Sulphur Gasoil futures to the May contract also crashed in recent weeks from an all-time high premium of $5 on Jan. 26 to a discount of 50 cents on Tuesday.

321,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 12:33PM ET</span>",China's Strongest Weapon in a Trade War With Trump May Backfire,"(Bloomberg) -- As tensions escalate between the U.S. and China, one crop is emerging as the most powerful weapon in a potential trade war: the soybean.
China is the biggest buyer of American soybeans, picking up about a third of the entire U.S. crop, which it uses largely to feed 400 million or so pigs. President Xi Jinping’s administration is studying the impact of restricting soybean imports in retaliation for U.S. tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, people familiar with the situation told Bloomberg last week.
Any China soybean curbs would directly hit farmers in Midwestern U.S. states that President Donald Trump needs to win re-election in 2020. Yet they would also pose a big risk for Xi: His nation is the world’s largest pork producer and consumer, and higher costs for pig farmers could increase prices of meat for his nation’s 1.3 billion citizens.
Food prices have long been a politically sensitive issue for China’s ruling Communist Party, which rose to power in 1949 in the wake of economic mismanagement that led to hyperinflation. A surge in the cost of everything from pork to electronics in the late 1980s also stoked dissatisfaction in the run-up to the Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) protests.
‘Worst-Case Scenario’
“Using soybeans to retaliate against the U.S. would be a worst-case scenario” for China, said Li Qiang, chief analyst with Shanghai JC Intelligence Co., a private grains consulting firm. “Pork is a staple meat for Chinese people.”
China’s Commerce Ministry and Agriculture Ministry didn’t immediately respond to faxed questions about the potential impact of restrictions on soybeans.
On pig farms in rural Tianjin, some 200 kilometers (124 miles) from Beijing, concern is growing. Standing next to a sow delivering piglets, Shi Ruixin said his costs would increase sharply if China squeezed U.S. soybean imports.
“Hog feed prices will rise as well as pork prices,” the 68-year-old farmer said.
The seasonality of the soybean trade is one reason that China can’t easily replace U.S. supply, even though authorities in Beijing have sought to diversify. Last year, China’s imports from Brazil rose 33 percent to about 51 million metric tons, while those from the U.S. fell 3.8 percent to 33 million tons.
Sun Chao, the president of Tianjin Tianjiao Group -- the hog feed producer that supplies Shi -- said that U.S. soybeans meet Chinese demand from October to February, when the South American crop is still growing.
“U.S. supplies can’t be replaced,” said Sun, who manages a cooperative with 150 farmers and 30,000 pigs. “We rely on each other.”
‘Extremely Concerned’
Chinese officials began looking into measures against soybeans in January as trade tensions with the Trump administration began to heat up. The Commerce Ministry held a meeting with some Chinese companies to get feedback, and no conclusions were reached, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. Any final decision would be made by senior Chinese leaders.
“We are extremely concerned by suggestions that U.S. exports, including soybeans, may face unjustified trade restrictions,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement. “American farmers are facing serious economic challenges without having to face bogus barriers erected strictly for political purposes. We are examining all tools available to us to assist our stakeholders.”
‘Painful for Everybody’
Trump has sought to close a trade gap in goods with China that surged 8.1 percent last year to a record $375 billion, according to Commerce Department data. Besides the duties on imported solar panels and washing machines, the administration last year began a probe into China’s aluminum and steel sales and its intellectual property practices.
China has responded by launching an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation against U.S. shipments of the grain sorghum, a substitute for corn. Restricting soybeans would have an even bigger impact on American farmers.
“It would definitely put downward pressure on prices,” said Dave Salmonsen, senior director of congressional relations with the American Farm Bureau Federation, the biggest U.S. farmer group, based in Washington. “We’re already in a surplus situation, and losing China would just make everything worse.”
Still, one U.S. farmer who hosted Xi during his 2012 visit to the U.S. doubts China will take action against soybeans. Grant Kimberley, who raises 4,000 acres of corn and soybeans northeast of Des Moines, Iowa, said Chinese soybean restrictions would lead to “dramatic swings” in prices that would disrupt trade throughout the world.
“It would be painful for everybody,” Kimberley said. “Painful for the Chinese, painful for the U.S. I don’t see why anyone would want to do it.”

322,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 10:24AM ET</span>",'Red flags' for the oil market are popping up all over the world," Crude oil prices slumped into correction — a 10% drop from their January highs — amid the turmoil that hit stocks over the past two weeks. 
But according to commodity strategists at RBC Capital Markets, investors would be wise not to ignore several risks that may drive prices even lower. Short of sounding ""alarm bells"" in their note on Tuesday, the strategists led by Michael Tran said pockets of the market are getting oversupplied again. That's problematic because production cuts led by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia helped drive a nearly 45% rally since last September, and pushed oil above $60 per barrel.
""Oil prices needed a breather and investors should not discount the caution signs that have been emerging,"" Tran said in the note. 
He added: ""In our view, the market has been overly focused on the race toward rebalance without realizing that transient pockets of oversupply have been emerging in the physical market.""
West Texas Intermediate crude oil, the US benchmark, traded down 1% at $58.75 per barrel at 9:18 a.m. ET on Tuesday. 
In the North Sea, Tran identified the weakening premium that crudes produced there, such as Brent, held over their benchmark contracts. ""The Forties differential to front month Brent futures moved from a premium of 75¢/bbl last month to lows last week of -50¢/bbl,"" Tran noted. ""Such drastic weakness is indicative of an oversupply or a soggy regional spot market."" He added that the sudden  shutdown of the Forties, Britain's largest oil pipeline, failed to move oil meaningfully higher. 
Across the Atlantic and in the US, Tran noted that shale producers continue to gush oil, funded by a market that got ""too bullish"" on price.
""The bearish output rhetoric seemingly took a temporary back seat while the market rallied over recent months, but the spotlight has returned following the surge in production to levels well eclipsing 10 mb/d for the first time in almost 50 years,"" he noted. 
Additionally, the next few weeks will be key to watch as refineries fire up after their maintenance season. That's when the market's ability to absorb US barrels will be tested, he said.
In Asia, China's import growth, which nearly doubled over the last two years, has been a key source of demand. But its exports are also rising, Tran said, showing that domestic refineries are overproducing. 
And although they've been dialed back, Saudi Arabia's exports are nearing record levels. 
One final, location-agnostic red flag is overextended investor positioning. Passive investors have piled into long West Texas Intermediate crude positions since the start of the year. 
""Stretched investor length means that a further jolt to the market, irrespective of origin, whether it be from broad market jitters or softer physical fundamentals, can make for violent swings to the downside,"" Tran said. "

The request was made as part of public consultations on Norges Bank's proposal to drop the oil and gas sector from the fund's investments in order to reduce the risk of oil-price fluctuations.
The Saudi government plans to sell about 5 percent of Aramco, hoping to raise some $100 billion or more in what would likely be the world's biggest initial public offering.
""The company will own much larger petroleum reserves than oil firms that are currently listed, which will raise the risk from the return on (those) resources,"" the finance ministry said in a letter to the central bank.
""We're asking Norges Bank to explain the impact a listing of Saudi Aramco will have on the fund's benchmark index,"" it added.

Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London declined 51 cents or about 0.81% to $62.06 a barrel, near Fridays two-month trough of $61.77 after rising to $63.09 earlier in the day.
In a report on Tuesday, the IEA predicted that world crude supply could surpass demand this year, potentially undermining global supply cut efforts.
The IEA raised its forecast for oil demand growth in 2018 to 1.4 million barrels per day, from a previous projection of 1.3 million bpd.
The report came a day after OPEC said it expected world oil demand to climb by 1.59 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, an increase of 60,000 bpd from the previous forecast, reaching 98.6 million bpd.
OPEC also said the U.S. and other outside producers would boost supply by 1.4 million bpd this year, up 250,000 bpd from last month and the third consecutive rise from 870,000 bpd in November.
Because of non-OPEC production growth, oil markets will only return to a supply and demand balance ""towards the end of this year,"" according to the Organization.
Fears that rising U.S. output could dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies have been weighing in oil prices recently.
The producer group, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
Elsewhere, gasoline futures dropped 0.65% to $1.669 a gallon, while natural gas futures rallied 3.25% to $2.634 per million British thermal units."

Comex gold futures were up 0.31% at $1,330.5 a troy ounce by 08:00 a.m. ET (12:00 GMT), the highest since February 7.
Market participants were eyeing this week's U.S. consumer price inflation data due on Wednesday and producer price inflation data on Thursday for further clues on how fast the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.
The greenback also suffered from a rebound in U.S. equity markets on Monday. Markets were especially boosted by news of a $2 billion infrastructure plan by the Trump administration.
The plan is part of the two-year budget agreement passed by the U.S. Congress last Friday, ending a brief government shutdown.
The agreement is set to boost federal spending by almost $300 billion and suspend the debt ceiling for a year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.41% at 89.64.
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures were down 0.12% at $16.55 a troy ounce."
327,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 13, 2018 07:02AM ET</span>",IEA Says OPEC Almost Cleared Oil Glut But Shale Risk Looms,"(Bloomberg) -- OPEC and its allies have almost achieved their goal of clearing an oil glut, but their efforts could be derailed by rising supplies from the U.S. and other rivals, the International Energy Agency said.
Oil stockpiles in developed nations fell the most in more than six years in December as supply cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia took effect. The surplus is also being cleared by higher consumption, with the agency boosting its forecast for global demand growth in 2018 by about 100,000 barrels a day to 1.4 million a day.
Yet OPEC’s strategy could be backfiring, as the increase in prices to a three-year high stimulates more supply from America. U.S. output will soon surpass that of the cartel’s biggest producer, Saudi Arabia, and may overtake Russia as global leader by the end of the year, according to the IEA.
“With the surplus having shrunk so dramatically, the success of the output agreement might be close to hand,” said the Paris-based agency, which advises most of the world’s major economies. Nevertheless, the “main message” remains that “fast-rising production in non-OPEC countries, led by the U.S., is likely to grow more than demand.”
OPEC and Russia, once fierce market rivals, forged an alliance in late 2016 to offset the oil glut unleashed by the advent of the U.S. shale industry. 
After a year of output cuts, stockpiles in industrialized nations have shrunk to the lowest since November 2014. They were about 52 million barrels above the five-year average in December, a drop of 80 percent from a year earlier, the IEA said.
Last month, OPEC’s implementation of pledged cuts was its strongest since the deal came into force, with the group reducing output by 37 percent more than it promised, according to the IEA. Compliance was given a boost by Venezuela, whose oil industry has been crippled by years of under-investment and economic decline.
Shale Drilling
Global inventories may stop falling in the early part of this year with the onset of new supplies, the agency said. It raised estimates for growth in non-OPEC supply in 2018 by about 100,000 barrels a day to 1.8 million a day -- approximately equal to the amount of production OPEC and its partners promised to cut.
Having cut costs during a three-year market slump, U.S. shale companies are able to deliver even more oil as recovering prices fund new drilling, it said. The nation’s output could climb enough this year to satisfy the expected increase in global consumption, according to the IEA.
Oil futures traded near $59 a barrel in New York on Tuesday. Prices fell last week, continuing their retreat from the three-year high of $66.66 reached in late January.

LONDON (Reuters) - The rise in global oil production, led by the United States, is likely to outpace growth in demand this year, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday.
The Paris-based IEA raised its forecast for oil demand growth in 2018 to 1.4 million barrels per day, from a previous projection of 1.3 million bpd, after the International Monetary Fund upped its estimate of global economic growth for this year and next.
Oil demand grew at a rate of 1.6 million bpd in 2017, the IEA said in its monthly market report.
However, the rapid rise in output, particularly in the United States, could well outweigh any pick-up in demand and begin to push up global oil inventories, which are now within sight of their five-year average.
""Today, having cut costs dramatically, U.S. producers are enjoying a second wave of growth so extraordinary that in 2018 their increase in liquids production could equal global demand growth,"" the IEA said.
""In just three months to November, (U.S.) crude output increased by a colossal 846,000 bpd and will soon overtake that of Saudi Arabia. By the end of this year, it might also overtake Russia to become the global leader.""
U.S. crude output could reach 11 million bpd by the end of this year, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with other exporters such as Russia, have agreed to maintain a joint restriction on crude supply for a second year running in 2018, to force inventories to drain and support prices.
Oil inventories across the world's richest nations fell by 55.6 million barrels in December to 2.851 billion barrels, their steepest one-month drop since February 2011, the IEA said.
For 2017 as a whole, inventories fell by 154 million barrels, or at a rate of 420,000 bpd. By the year-end they were only 52 million barrels above the five-year average, with stocks of oil products below that benchmark, the IEA said. 
""With the surplus having shrunk so dramatically, the success of the output agreement might be close to hand. This, however, is not necessarily the case: oil price rises have come to a halt and gone into reverse, and, according to our supply/demand balance, so might the decline in oil stocks, at least in the early part of this year.""
Oil production outside OPEC nations fell by 175,000 bpd in January to 58.6 million bpd, but was still 1.3 million bpd higher than January last year, predominantly because of the 1.3-million-bpd year-on-year increase in U.S. output.
OPEC output was largely steady at 32.16 million bpd in January and compliance with the supply deal reached 137 percent, due in part to declines in Venezuela, where economic crisis has paralyzed much of the country's oil production capacity.
The IEA estimates demand for OPEC's crude in 2018 will average 32.3 million bpd, after dropping to 32.0 million in the first quarter of the year. 
The IEA said oil prices, which briefly touched a high of $71 a barrel in January, could be supported even if U.S. production rises, provided global growth remains strong, or if unplanned supply outages persist.

""If so, most producers will be happy, but if not, history might be repeating itself,"" the IEA said.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude March contract was up 13 cents or about 0.20% at $59.44 a barrel by 04:00 a.m. ET (08:00 GMT), off Friday's one-and-a-half month low of $59.20.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London gained 15 cents or about 0.24% to $62.74 a barrel, after falling to a two-month trough of $61.77 on Friday.
Oil markets rose as global equity markets began to recover on Monday from last week's steep losses. U.S. markets were especially boosted by news on Monday of a $2 billion infrastructure plan by the Trump administration.
Prices were also boosted after OPEC said on Monday that it expected world oil demand to climb by 1.59 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, an increase of 60,000 bpd from the previous forecast, reaching 98.6 million bpd.
OPEC also said the U.S. and other outside producers would boost supply by 1.4 million bpd this year, up 250,000 bpd from last month and the third consecutive rise from 870,000 bpd in November.
Because of non-OPEC production growth, oil markets will only return to a supply and demand balance ""towards the end of this year,"" according to the Organization.
Oil prices signed their worst weekly loss in two years on Friday after  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s Baker Hughes energy services firm reported that the number of oil drilling rigs jumped by 26 to 791 last week.
That marked a third straight week of increases and the largest weekly rise in more than a year, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
That added to fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.

MANILA (Reuters) - China will oppose any ""unfair and unreasonable"" trade measures by countries such as the United States against its steel companies, a Chinese government think-tank said on Tuesday, arguing protectionism will ""poison"" the industry. 
""Certainly we will protest against unfair and unreasonable measures launched by some countries such as the U.S.A. towards Chinese steel companies,"" the China Metallurgical Industry Planning and Research Institute said in an email to Reuters.
""We will also study and discuss the counter-measures to try to seek a fair position for Chinese companies without any violation of W.T.O. (World Trade Organisation) agreement.""
The Institute, which provides consultancy services to Chinese government policymakers and steel enterprises, was responding to recent efforts by U.S. steel firms urging President Donald Trump to curb surging imports they say are undermining the U.S. industry.
Trump will meet with a bipartisan group of lawmakers later on Tuesday to discuss trade matters. The meeting comes a month after the Commerce Department handed him the results of its investigation into steel and aluminum imports, giving him 90 days to respond.
The Commerce Department has offered no insight into its conclusions, although the probe could lead to broad tariffs or import quotas.
Trump is considering action on both steel and aluminum under the rarely used 'Section 232' of a 1962 U.S. trade law, which allows for restrictions to protect national security.
The Chinese think-tank said it its email that, ""Trade protection will poison the healthy development of steel industry. Only open and cooperation can expand the common benefit.""
The United States is the world's biggest steel importer, buying nearly 40 percent of shipments from Canada, Brazil and South Korea.
But China was not among the top 10 sources of U.S. steel imports in January-September 2017, based on U.S. Commerce Department data.
Exports from China, the world's top steel producer, to the U.S. reached 1.18 million tonnes last year. That's a fraction of the 800 million tonnes it makes each year, equal to about half of global output.
From a record high of 112.4 million tonnes in 2015, China's total steel exports have fallen amid threats of a trade dispute and better demand at home. The exports dropped to 75.4 million tonnes last year.

Crude Oil WTI Futures futures for March delivery were trading up 0.56% at $59.62 at mid-morning in Asia on Feb. 13.
Meanwhile, Brent Oil futures for April delivery were trading up 0.45% to $63.01 on London's Intercontinental Exchange.
The mild increases followed comments from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The group said on Monday that it expects oil demand to grow faster than originally anticipated this year due to a health global economy. OPEC now expects demand to rise by 1.59 million barrels per day (bpd), an increase of 60,000 bpd.
The positive forecast could lend renewed support for oil. WTI oil for March delivery hit a high of $66.14 in late January before plummeting to below $60 at the beginning of February.
Balancing out OPEC's optimistic outlook was an increase in the output now expected from non-OPEC countries. This non-OPEC production is now expected to rise by 320,000 bpd more than expected to 59.26 million bpd this year.
Analysts expect data from the American Petroleum Institute and the US Energy Information Administration on Wednesday will show that crude stockpiles in the US increased by 2.6 million barrels but distillates are expected to fall by 1.625 million barrels and gasoline stocks are forecast to increase by 1.367 million barrels.
After a bad beginning of February, oil prices got a boost last week from China export data. Chinese export growth beat expectations in January growing 11.1% year on year, according to the General Administration of Customs. The final data easily beat median forecasts. Imports jumped an even more impressive 36.9%, far above the expected 9.8% increase.
A big portion of the increase may have been due to increase imports of oil. China imported some 40 million tons of oil in January, up 7 million tons from December.

Futures in New York advanced as much as 2.8 percent, the biggest intraday jump in more than a month. Strong demand for crude coupled with restrained production from OPEC and allied suppliers will erase any remaining glut, United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei, who’s also president of the cartel, said Monday. Global demand is robust enough to absorb growing output from shale fields, according to Kuwait’s oil minister.
Oil prices are rising in response to “statements from OPEC telling us they believe compliance to the cuts is going to be at historic highs,” Bart Melek, head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said by telephone. “Ultimately, the market is well-supported around $60. We do see the market rebalance. Inventories will continue to drop.”
The U.S. benchmark crude contract lost almost 10 percent of its value last week amid concerns about the broader economy and whether demand will continue to rise. Kuwait Oil Minister Bakheet Al-Rashidi characterized the selloff as a “correction only.”
“It will come back,” Al-Rashidi said on Monday in remarks to reporters in Kuwait City. Meanwhile, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said compliance with self-imposed output caps probably increased last month over December’s level of 129 percent.
Shale drillers in places like West Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota may imperil the carefully-laid plans of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and fellow travelers like Russia and Mexico. The number of rigs searching for U.S. oil jumped 34 percent in the past year, spurred on as prices recovered from the deepest market rout in a generation.
As a result, U.S. oil production is expected to exceed 11 million barrels a day before the end of this year. OPEC’s own analysts on Monday upped their estimate for how much oil non-cartel suppliers will pump this year by 250,000 barrels a day to 1.4 million a day.
“Shale is coming and the expectation is that it will come stronger than in 2017, and this is something that we have to watch,” Al Mazrouei said Monday in an interview in Dubai. “But considering all factors, I don’t think it will be a huge distorter of the market.”
West Texas Intermediate crude for March delivery advanced $1.07 to $60.27 a barrel at 9:40 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 27 percent above the 100-day average.

Barkindo also said the cartel and its non-OPEC partners need to continue cooperating beyond 2018 and that their accord is still a “work in progress.”
“Essentially what we see today is a reversal of Friday’s sell-off,” said Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS Group AG in Zurich. “The overshooting of prices in January has triggered a stronger supply response from U.S. frackers.”

Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London advanced 67 cents or about 1.05% to $63.45 a barrel, after falling to a two-month trough of $61.77 on Friday.
Oil prices signed their worst weekly loss in two years on Friday after  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s Baker Hughes energy services firm reported that the number of oil drilling rigs jumped by 26 to 791 last week.
That marked a third straight week of increases and the largest weekly rise in more than a year, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The report came after data on Wednesday showed U.S. oil production, driven by shale extraction, rose to an all-time high of 10.25 million barrels per day (bpd). That figure is above that of top exporter Saudi Arabia and within reach of Russia's output levels.
That added to fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
The producer group, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
This week, market participants are awaiting weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Traders will also focus on monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency to assess global oil supply and demand levels.
Elsewhere, gasoline futures gained 0.37% to $1.708 a gallon, while natural gas futures dropped 0.85% to $2.562 per million British thermal units."
340,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 09:05AM ET</span>",Natural Gas Futures Slide To 21-Month Low As Winter Winds Down,"Investing.com - Natural gas futures started the week off in negative territory on Monday, falling to its lowest level in almost two years amid speculation the end of the winter heating season will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for the fuel.
Front-month U.S. natural gas futures slumped 3.0 cents, or around 1.2%, to $2.554 per million British thermal units (btu) by 9:05AM ET (1405GMT). It fell to its lowest since May 2016 at $2.538 earlier in the session.
The commodity plunged about 9.2% last week, after weather forecasts showed that temperatures won't be as cold as previously expected.
Market experts warned that futures are likely to remain vulnerable in the near-term as the coldest part of the winter has effectively passed and below-normal temperatures in April mean less than they do in January and February.
Spring usually sees the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 173 and 187 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Feb. 9.
That compares with a decline of 119 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 114 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 154 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.078 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
That figure is 503 bcf, or around 19.4%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 393 bcf, or roughly 15.9%, below the five-year average for this time of year.

Comex gold futures were up 0.42% at $1,321.1 a troy ounce by 08:15 a.m. ET (12:15 GMT), after climbing to $1,328.8 earlier in the day.
Market participants were eyeing this week's U.S. inflation data for further clues on how fast the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was little changed at 90.18
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
The greenback had strengthened broadly after the U.S. Congress passed a two-year budget agreement early Friday morning, ending a brief government shutdown.
The agreement is set to boost federal spending by almost $300 billion and suspend the debt ceiling for a year.
Government activities were temporarily shut down when a midnight deadline to pass the U.S. budget deal was missed on Thursday due to a prolonged speech by Senator Rand Paul, who said the bill would “loot the Treasury.”
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures rallied 1.28% to $16.35 a troy ounce."

LONDON (Reuters) - ""Chocfinger"" made his name and his money by taking bold bets on cocoa markets. But after nearly four decades of trading, sometimes winning, sometimes losing, Anthony Ward threw in the towel.
Ward blames the rise of computer-driven funds and high-frequency trading for forcing him and some other well-known commodities investors to close their hedge funds and look for opportunities where machines can't make a difference.
While computerized trading is not new, Ward and others argue its steady rise has reached a tipping point that is distorting prices and creating uncertainty not only for investors, but for chocolate firms, carmakers and others who rely on commodities.
It was in January 2016, after a slide in cocoa prices, that Ward decided the days of traditional commodity investors doing well from taking positions based on fundamentals such as supply and demand may be numbered.
""It was just too big, too quick, too dramatic. And completely against the fundamentals,"" Ward told Reuters.
Commodity markets fell across the board that month after weak factory data in China raised fears of lower demand from the world's top consumer of raw materials.
Ward blamed the slide in cocoa on what he regarded as misplaced selling by computer-driven funds reacting to the Chinese data, given China has scant impact on the cocoa market.
""The actual fundamentals in cocoa were extraordinarily bullish in January 2016. We were forecasting the largest harmattan in history, which is exactly what happened,"" he said.
His prediction that a hot, harmattan wind from the Sahara desert would hit harvests in Ivory Coast and Ghana and drive cocoa prices higher did come to pass - but not before the fund had been forced to cut its losses when the market slumped.
At the end of 2017, Ward closed the CC+ hedge fund that had invested in cocoa and coffee markets for years. 
And at the end of January, commodity hedge fund Jamison Capital Partners run by Stephen Jamison closed. He told investors that machine learning and artificial intelligence had eliminated short-term trading opportunities, while commodities did not offer obvious benefits in the long term. 
Also in 2017, renowned oil trader Andrew Hall, who earned $100 million in 2008, called time on his main Astenbeck Commodities Fund II.
He had said in an earlier letter to investors that extreme volatility caused by ""non-traditional investors and algorithmic trading"" made it difficult to hold onto long-term positions when the market moved against them.
In 2016, Michael Farmer, founding partner of the Red Kite fund that specializes in copper, also accused high-frequency traders using super-fast computers of distorting the market and getting an unfair advantage.

DISTORTION?
Other investors have taken refuge in related sectors or left commodities altogether, exasperated by the automated trading that drives about half of U.S. commodity futures trading.
A study by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission last year showed computerized trading on the world's largest futures exchange, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME), accounted for 49 percent of the volume in agriculture contracts and 58 percent for some energy contracts.
At the same time, data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research shows the average hedge fund returned 8.64 percent in 2017 but commodity hedge funds eked out returns of just 0.43 percent.
Ward estimates that while in the past automated trading would distort the market by 10 percent to 15 percent from prices justified by fundamentals - which he said was irritating but often manageable - it can now reach 25 percent to 30 percent.
Algorithmic, or systematic, funds use computers to make decisions after processing vast amounts of data, or trade on signals such as market momentum or when prices hit key levels.
Those who run automated funds argue that they inject much-needed liquidity while capturing the dynamics of the market more efficiently than traditional trading strategies.
Farmer and others say, however, that it is unfair for exchanges to allow high-frequency trading (HFT) groups to have co-location platforms, allowing them to put super-computers in the same data center as the exchange servers.
They say that gives HFTs the tiny advantage they need to jump ahead of incoming orders, effectively piggybacking. Traditional investors say this exacerbates market moves and in turn makes it more costly for them to take out hedges when price moves go against them.
MIND-BOGGLING DATA
Systematic fund managers see the rise of their sector as a part of a trend that is transforming not only financial markets but wider society with the advent of artificial intelligence, robots and machine learning.
""I don't feel too sorry (for traditional fund managers),"" said Anthony Lawler, co-head of GAM Systematic, the quantitative part of Swiss money manager GAM Holding, which had assets under management (AUM) of 148.4 billion Swiss francs ($158 billion) at the end of September.
""Information, which used to be expensive, difficult to get, not easily shared, is now ubiquitous. It's truly mind-boggling the depth of data available,"" Lawler said.
""That means it's much more difficult to have an information edge and advantage to the player who can digest and analyze the data the quickest."" 
GAM Systematic, which had $4.3 billion of assets at the end of September, regards commodities as one of many markets it monitors for opportunities by crunching data such as weather forecasts and shipping data that shows how full a vessel is.
He acknowledged that algorithms can lead to mistakes and over-generalization, but said that should just open up opportunities for traditional fund managers. 
""If you're a great discretionary trader, then sit on the sidelines and wait for those missteps ... I would be super happy if that trader is successfully picking off some of these missteps,"" said Lawler.
Systematic funds also make decisions based on the structure and technical levels of markets. Some analysts argue that markets absorb fundamental information before many analysts are aware of it and automated funds are simply more efficient.
""I used to do a lot of fundamental analysis when I was in equities and I realized it doesn't really matter, it was a waste of time,"" said Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at commodities broker Marex Spectron.
""The truth is fundamental analysis is effectively the work of a historian, seeking to provide explanation for what has already occurred,"" he said.
SCHIZOPHRENIC MARKETS
Some fund managers and analysts say computerized trading has been amplified in commodities because other participants such as banks and pension funds have cut exposure to the sector.
Total global commodity assets under management more than halved from 2012 to 2015 to under $200 billion, though the total has since recovered to just over $300 billion, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""There's less liquidity, and therefore prices are more choppy, more schizophrenic, because of the exit of so many market counterparties,"" said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at French bank  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
Not all those who have closed commodity hedge funds put the blame on computers.
""Either you read the information badly, or you have bad information,"" said Christophe Cordonnier, who co-founded the Belaco Capital fund in 2012 after heading investor sales in commodities at Societe Generale.
Cordonnier says Belaco Capital made a bad decision on timing, launching the fund in 2012 and counting on a global economic recovery to boost commodities. After a rebound failed to materialize, the fund closed in 2015. 
Other fund managers have survived by being creative, such as Christoph Eibl, chief executive of Tiberius Asset Management, whose commodity assets under management have dwindled from $2.5 billion at its peak to about $350 million.
""Seven years ago we started diversifying our business operations,"" said Eibl. He now operates a merchant business in metals with a turnover of more than $1 billion a year, runs tungsten and tin mines in Africa and Asia and is soon to launch a metals-backed crypto-currency. 
Ever the risk taker, Ward still plans to trade cocoa and coffee - but only with his own money - while looking for opportunities in the underlying physical commodities markets. And he's keeping a close eye on computerized trading.
""In the end the whole thing will blow up because when there's a big problem, a black swan event, they won't be able to get out. It will be very messy,"" said Ward.

343,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>",OPEC President Says Shale Surge Won't Thwart Plan to Clear Glut,"(Bloomberg) -- Surging output of U.S. shale oil won’t be a “huge distorter” of efforts by global crude producers to clear a glut, according to OPEC’s president.
The market should re-balance this year, given robust demand and producers’ compliance with their pledges to curtail supply, United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei, currently the president of OPEC, said Monday in an interview in Dubai. His Kuwaiti counterpart, Bakheet Al-Rashidi, said he sees world oil consumption growing by 1.6 million barrels a day in 2018 and absorbing additional output from U.S. shale deposits.
“Shale is coming and the expectation is that it will come stronger than in 2017, and this is something that we have to watch,” Al Mazrouei said. “But considering all factors, I don’t think it will be a huge distorter of the market.”
Oil is rebounding from its biggest weekly decline in two years, though gains are limited due to concerns over a resurgence in U.S. shale. The U.S. oil rig count rose last week by 26, the most in a year, to 791, Baker Hughes data showed on Friday. American weekly crude output topped 10 million barrels a day for the first time on record, and the U.S. government forecasts it will balloon to 11 million later this year.
Inventories In Focus
Such an increase would complicate efforts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers to prop up crude prices by curtailing supply. OPEC, Russia and other oil producers agreed in November to extend self-imposed limits on output until the end of this year, seeking to counter a glut fed partly by U.S. shale drillers.
“What concerns us today is the level of inventories that we need to achieve the five-year average, and I see the market going in that direction and achieving balance,” Al Mazrouei said. “How long it will take depends on how long the increase in shale production will take.”
OPEC and other participants in the oil-cuts deal aim for global crude inventories to fall to the average level of the past five years. The U.A.E. is the fourth-largest producer among OPEC’s 14 members, while Kuwait ranks fifth, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
“Demand for this year is expected to be good, if not better than 2017,” Al Mazrouei said. This, together with “good” economic indicators and compliance with output cuts, indicate that the crude market will balance within the year, he said.
Oil prices are currently at about half their 2014 peak, with benchmark Brent crude futures up 2.2 percent at $64.17 a barrel in London at 9:34 a.m. local time. Brent tumbled 8.4 percent last week, in the second consecutive weekly loss.
“It’s a correction only. It will come back,” Kuwait’s Al-Rashidi told reporters in Kuwait City. Kuwait expects cooperation on oil policy to continue beyond 2018, he said. “We will look for criteria to make sure the market is stable at all times.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose 2 percent on Monday, recovering some of last week's steep losses as global equities steadied after their largest one-week slide in two years.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) rose 95 cents to $63.74 a barrel by 1012 GMT, up nearly 2 percent, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures (CLc1) gained $1.03 to $60.23, up 1.8 percent.

European shares took their lead from Friday's rise on Wall Street, while other commodities including copper and gold also strengthened. [MKTS/GLOB]
Consumption remains robust, even though rising U.S. crude production has knocked oil off its 2018 highs above $70 and threatened the efforts of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to prop up prices by reining in supply.
""Demand growth is very strong and with declines in places like Venezuela, is helping the situation. If demand stays strong, it still looks like OPEC will be in control in 2019,"" SEB chief commodities strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said.
""If global growth does slow down and oil demand starts to slow, then production growth in the U.S. becomes a problem, because OPEC's cake starts to shrink and that will be the line in the sand,"" he said.
U.S. oil production  has risen above 10 million barrels per day (bpd), overtaking top exporter Saudi Arabia and coming within reach of top producer Russia.
OPEC and partners including Russia have agreed to cut their crude output by 1.8 million bpd for a second year, but U.S. production looks set to continue to grow. 
U.S. energy companies added 26 oil rigs looking for new production last week, boosting the count to 791, the highest since April 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday. 
""The increase over the last month has been driven primarily from private producers,"" U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note. ""Investor fear around greater U.S. oil production/lack of producer discipline has risen.""
PVM Oil Associates strategist Stephen Brennock said these are tough times for oil bulls.

""Positives may appear in short supply but, along with OPEC-led production curbs, buyers can take solace from a healthy global oil demand backdrop. Much of this is owing to China’s ravenous thirst for oil, which saw it surpass the U.S. to become the world’s largest crude importer in 2017,"" he said.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures  rallied $1.36, or 2.3%, to $60.59 a barrel by 4:10AM ET (0910GMT).
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., jumped $1.40, or roughly 2.2%, to $64.21 a barrel.
Oil prices finished lower for a sixth straight session on Friday to tally their worst weekly loss in two years.
WTI crude lost roughly 9.6% last week, which was the biggest such decline since January 2016, while Brent gave up about 8.5%, as investors continued to fret over soaring U.S. output levels.
The number of oil drilling rigs jumped by 26 to 791 last week,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.
That marked a third straight week of increases and the largest weekly rise in more than a year, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
That came after data on Wednesday showed U.S. oil production, driven by shale extraction, rose to an all-time high of 10.25 million barrels per day (bpd). That figure is above that of top exporter Saudi Arabia and within reach of Russia's output levels.

Comex gold futures were up around $8.00, or 0.6%, at $1,323.50 a troy ounce by 3:55AM ET (0855GMT).
Gold futures declined on Friday to suffer from their largest weekly loss in two months, as the dollar index and Treasury yields gained, dulling investment demand for the precious metal.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, as these increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Besides the inflation report, this week's calendar also features U.S. data on retail sales, producer prices, building permits, housing starts, industrial production, weekly jobless claims, consumer sentiment, as well as surveys on manufacturing conditions in the Philadelphia and New York regions.
The Fed held interest rates unchanged last month and raised its inflation outlook, signaling that borrowing costs will continue to climb under new central bank chief Jerome Powell. Traders are currently putting the chances of a 25-basis-point hike by the Fed at its March meeting at around 76%, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
In other metals action, silver futures were up 26.1 cents, or 1.6%, at $16.40 a troy ounce.

347,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2018 02:20AM ET</span>",Big Oil takes stage for post-austerity beauty contest,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - With years of austerity in their rear-view mirrors, the world's biggest oil companies are locked in a beauty contest to lure investors with promises of growth and greater rewards.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Total are emerging as frontrunners after a three-year slump thanks to strong growth projections but  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), the biggest publicly traded oil company, has largely disappointed with a weaker outlook.
Major oil companies slashed spending and cut costs after oil prices collapsed in 2014 and can now generate as much cash with crude at $50-$55 a barrel as they did when the price was around $100 earlier in the decade.
Cash flow at oil companies in 2017 rose to its highest since before the slump, helped by the drastic cost cutting plans and a recovery in oil prices, and executives are once again turning their attention to growth.
With crude expected to hold above $60 a barrel into the end of the decade, major oil companies are confident they can boost already attractive payouts to shareholders.
Total sent the strongest signal, announcing plans to increase dividends by 10 percent, buy back $5 billion of shares by 2020 and abolish its so-called scrip policy introduced in the lean years of offering shares instead of cash dividends.
Analysts at Bernstein hailed the French company, which reported a 28 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, as ""the new benchmark in shareholder returns"" and upgraded their share recommendation to ""outperform"".
""Clearly the U.S companies disappointed more whereas Total cheered everyone up together with Shell, even if it had a small miss,"" said Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at The Scottish Investment Trust.

BACK TO BUYBACKS
Norway's  Statoil  (OL:STL) and U.S. company  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) have also raised their dividends over the past week, while  BP  (LON:BP) was ahead of the pack by resuming share buybacks in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Shell, whose profits and cash flow beat Exxon's last year, is now set to buy $25 billion of shares by the end of the decade after abolishing its scrip policy in November.
Analysts say Exxon remains an outlier after a disappointing drop in cash flow and production in the fourth quarter raised concerns among investors about its strategy.
Shares of the Irving, Texas-based company have fallen by more than 10 percent over the past week, wiping $35 billion off its value. Its stock has trailed rivals significantly over the past two years, reflecting its weaker outlook.
""All the majors are cheap at the moment but maybe Exxon is not the best major out there. We prefer Shell,"" McKinnon said.
Shell's shares have outperformed rivals with total shareholder returns of 90 percent over the past two years, said Simon Gergel, chief investment officer for UK equities at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors.
""We were encouraged by the cost cutting plans of the company and the potential transformation of its future cash flows,"" he said. 
THE RACE IS ON
After three years of finding ways to save money through job cuts, lower exploration budgets and harnessing new technology to become more efficient, executives have moved growth to the fore and are scrambling to outshine each other.
""The priority of the board is to maintain our ambitious growth and continue to add value for shareholders,"" Total Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne told investors on Thursday.
During a meeting with analysts last week, Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden and Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said nine times that their goal was to make the Anglo-Dutch company a ""world-class investment"".
The ambitious Dutch CEO has publicly said he wants Shell to challenge Exxon's financial dominance in the sector, even though the U.S. giant is still significantly larger than Shell by market value.
To reach that goal, Shell made by far the boldest move in the downturn, buying rival BG Group for $54 billion in 2016 and transforming the company into the world's largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader and a major oil producer in Brazil.
But Shell was not the only one to take advantage of the slump to secure growth by snapping up rivals reeling from the slide in Brent crude from a 2014 high of $115 a barrel to just $27 in January 2016.
Total bought Maersk Oil for $7.5 billion and Engie's LNG business for $1.5 billion last year, BP made a number of investments in Africa and Norway while Exxon boosted its U.S. shale position with a $6 billion acquisition. 
Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said while Shell still had the strongest potential to return cash to investors, a measure known as shareholder yield, Total was now close behind following its results and dividend announcements.  
""Total is the clear winner to us so far, with a growing dividend and buyback combination that is closer to Shell in terms of total return, but with more upstream growth and less reporting volatility,"" Borkhataria wrote in a note. 
Shell's shareholder yield for 2019 is forecast at 8.2 percent compared with Total's 6.7 percent, BP's 5.9 percent and Statoil's 5.2 percent, while Exxon's yield is at 4.7 percent and Chevron's 4.2 percent, according to Borkhataria.

""Overall, it was a strong year for the majors. Cash has been up, production was up, they look quite confident, these are things I like to see,"" James Laing, equities fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, said.

Gold futures for April delivery rose 0.74% to $1,325.60 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Investors this week are watching inflation readings from the U.S., UK and Germany.
Last week, gold prices edged lower on Friday in what was a fifth day of declines in the last six sessions as the stronger dollar weighed on the precious metal, making it more expensive for holders of other currencies. The dollar was supported by increased safe haven demand from investors amid dramatic moves in the equities and bond markets. U.S. stocks ended higher on Friday, but still suffered their steepest weekly losses in more than two years.
Market turbulence has been triggered by speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates at a faster rate than had been expected amid signs of a pickup in inflation. Expectations for higher interest rates are typically negative for gold as the precious metal struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets like Treasury’s when borrowing costs rise.
The dollar also found received support after Congress and U.S. President Donald Trump approved a federal budget plan that ended an overnight federal shutdown.

Gold futures for April delivery settled at $1,315.70 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. For the week, prices were down 1.62%.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 90.22 in late trade.
The index was up 1.45% on the week, having recovered from a three-year low set two weeks ago.
The dollar was supported by increased safe haven demand from investors amid dramatic moves in the equities and bond markets. U.S. stocks ended higher on Friday, but still suffered their steepest weekly losses in more than two years.
Market turbulence has been triggered by speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates at a faster rate than had been expected amid signs of a pickup in inflation.
Expectations for higher interest rates are typically negative for gold as the precious metal struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets like Treasury’s when borrowing costs rise.
The dollar also found received support after Congress and U.S. President Donald Trump approved a federal budget plan that ended an overnight federal shutdown.
Elsewhere in precious metals trading, silver was down 0.19% to $16.31 a troy ounce late Friday and recorded a 1.48% weekly decline.
Platinum settled at $968.20, down 1.04% for the day, bringing the week’s losses to 2.78%
Among base metals, copper prices fell for the sixth straight session on Friday amid concerns over building supplies.
Copper for March delivery was down 1.04% at $3.050 in late trade and ended the week down 4.75%. It was the lowest close since mid-December and the largest weekly percentage decline since November 2014.

351,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 11, 2018 06:09AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices - Weekly Outlook: Feb. 12 - 16,"Investing.com - Oil prices finished lower for a sixth straight session on Friday to tally their worst weekly loss in two years, as investors continued to fret over soaring U.S. output levels.
Steep losses in the global stock market this week and a strengthening dollar also contributed to oil's losses.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for March delivery sank $1.95, or around 3.2%, to close at $59.20 a barrel. It fell to its worst level since Dec. 22 at $58.07 earlier in the session.
Meanwhile, April Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., tumbled $2.02, or roughly 3.1%, to settle at $62.79 a barrel, after it touched a more than nine-week low of $61.77 earlier in the day.
For the week, WTI crude lost roughly 9.6%, which was the biggest such decline since January 2016, while Brent gave up about 8.5%.
The number of oil drilling rigs jumped by 26 to 791 last week,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.
That marked a third straight week of increases and the largest weekly rise in more than a year, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
That came after data on Wednesday showed U.S. oil production, driven by shale extraction, rose to an all-time high of 10.25 million barrels per day (bpd). That figure is above that of top exporter Saudi Arabia and within reach of Russia's output levels.
That added to fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
The producer group, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
Among other energy contracts, March gasoline futures slumped 6.4 cents, or 3.6%, to end at $1.700 a gallon on Friday, with prices suffering a weekly loss of around 9.2%.
Heating oil for March edged down 6.6 cents, or 3.4%, to $1.855 a gallon, posting a weekly drop of around 9.7%.
Meanwhile, natural gas futures plunged 11.3 cents, or 4.2%, to $2.584 per million British thermal units, its lowest finish since late February 2017, for a weekly decline of 9.2%.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer and how fast output levels will continue to rise.
Oil traders will also focus on monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency to assess global oil supply and demand levels.

352,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Colombia aims to kick-start oil hedging program - finance minister,"By Rodrigo Campos
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Colombia is drawing up plans to hedge against declines in the price of crude, its main export, the country's finance minister said on Friday, following in the footsteps of Mexico, which successfully used one during the 2014-2016 price slump.
Mauricio Cardenas said ""it is the right time"" for Colombia to start thinking about implementing an oil hedge for the first time, adding that the country would need to reshape its legal framework to allow the government to lead a potentially risky financial transaction. 
""Colombia needs to do something like what Mexico has (done),"" Cardenas told Reuters in an interview in New York. ""As oil prices recover and seem to be higher now than what they probably will be in the long term, this would be the right time to hedge.""
Colombia once earned roughly a fifth of its national income from oil revenues, royalties and taxation, but that figure fell to nearly zero during the global decline in crude prices in 2014.
The country would need to change its laws to remove liability from public officials as they carry out those hedges, which could run into controversy in Congress, especially in an election year.
Colombians will elect a new Congress in March and a four-year president in May. President Juan Manuel Santos is serving his second term and is not allowed to run again.
Cardenas said he wants to start the creation of a legal framework ""so that in the future hedging becomes the norm, not the exception.""
""This is one of the things I'd like to do before the end of this administration, I think it would be a good thing to leave for the next administration to complete,"" he said.
A hedge would allow Colombia to stabilize oil revenues in the event of a slide in prices. The downside is that if prices improve the cost of the hedge is a loss.
Mexico, for example, likely profited little from its 2017 hedge as prices rebounded well above its bet that a barrel would average around $42. However, in 2016 Mexico saw a $2.65 billion payout from its oil hedge.
Oil has rebounded from 12-year lows of under $30 per barrel in 2016. Even after a 10 percent slump this week, it still closed at just over $59. 
The recovery in oil prices has filled the coffers of Colombia's state-controlled oil company Ecopetrol, which over the last year has reduced its external debt by $3 billion to $15 billion, according to Cardenas.
The minister said Ecopetrol has between $4 billion and $5 billion in cash in hand that could be used for additional repayment of external debt. The company's results, due out in coming weeks, will positively surprise markets in terms of dividends and revenues to the Colombian government, Cardenas said.
""We had a number of years where Ecopetrol did not provide any revenues to the Colombian government. Now we're going to start seeing those revenues again.""

353,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 04:17PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Costa Rica to lift 30-year ban on planting robusta coffee trees,"By Enrique Andres Pretel
SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Costa Rica will join other coffee-producing nations in the region and start planting robusta, lifting a 30 year-ban on a crop that is more resistant to diseases and rising temperatures than arabica trees, the Minister of Agriculture said on Friday.
The agriculture ministry's resolution, which would allow for the production of robusta varieties, still needs to be signed by President Luis Guillermo Solis before it takes effect.
""It's a decree for the cultivation of robusta in specific areas that the national coffee institute ICAFE will determine so there is no mixing of the varieties, including the post-harvest processes,"" Costa Rica's Agriculture Minister Felipe Arauz told Reuters in an interview.
Costa Rica is one of the region's smaller coffee producers, but famed for its high-quality arabica varieties.
Robusta trees thrive at lower elevations and the beans, with their stronger and more bitter taste than the more highly prized arabica, are typically used to make instant coffee or added to blends as a cheaper ingredient. Robusta is also used to create the froth in some espressos.
""If we're going to harvest robusta, the process should be ordered, planned and technically sound,"" said Arauz. 
The minister added that ICAFE will determine where the crops can be planted and what varieties will be allowed.
ICAFE was not available for comment.
The move in Costa Rica comes as changing climates are making robusta farming more attractive and as a growing number of farmers in Latin American are starting to plant the cheaper crop. 
Robusta survives better in warmer temperatures, and higher-levels of caffeine make the trees hardier against some diseases and pests.
Farmers growing arabica in Central America were hit hard by the spread of an airborne fungus known as roya in 2012. 
In low-lying areas, which are more susceptible to roya, some producers are now looking to robusta as an alternative crop because many varieties are resistant to the fungus and less costly to grow than arabica.
Still, some in the industry see robusta as a threat to Costa Rica's global reputation as an exporter of high-quality arabica beans.
""The complaints can be resolved with clearly designated areas (for planting robusta) and by talking to farmers. We believe that if it's done right there won't be a negative effect on arabica,"" said Arauz.
The minister said robusta is a good option for areas too hot and humid for arabica and where the crop of choice is pineapple, which along with bananas is Costa Rica's main agricultural exports.

""We need to create jobs and well-being in agricultural areas where the most profitable crop is the pineapple,"" he said.

354,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>","Crude Oil Prices Slide 9% This Week, Biggest Since November 2016","Investing.com – Crude oil prices settled lower as data showed the number of US oil rigs surged to a 34 month high, stoking investor fears for a ramp up in domestic production.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for March delivery fell 3.19% cents to settle at $59.20 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent lost 3.56% to trade at $62.50 a barrel.
The number of oil rigs operating in the US rose by 26 to 791, the highest level since April 2, 2015, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes.
That deepened investor fears that rising US oil output would offset major oil producers’ efforts – as part of the production-cut agreement – to rid the market of excess oil stockpiles.
The rise in US oil rigs comes just two days after the Energy Information Administration released Wednesday its weekly inventory totals showing both US crude and output rose.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose 1.895 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 2, below expectations for for a rise of 3.189 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday.
The build in crude this week comes amid a slowdown in refinery activity as refiners entered a period of maintenance, which typically lessens demand for crude oil.

Gold futures for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $2.30, or 0.17%, to $1,317.10 a troy ounce.
Gold prices were set for their second weekly drop in a row, pressured by a sharp recovery in the dollar and expectations that global central banks were poised to initiate a shift away from ultra-loose monetary policy measures. 
The Bank of England stood pat on interest rates Thursday but signalled that rate hikes could be needed earlier than expected as the rapid pace of inflation continued. Offsetting the prospect of tighter monetary policy, however, was the ongoing rout in global stock markets, triggering safe-haven demand, as more than $6 trillion in stock market capitalization was lost so far this week. 
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

Futures tumbled as much as 2.4 percent on Friday in New York, on track for its steepest weekly decline in almost a year. A global index of more than 1,600 stocks limped toward its most painful weekly result since 2011 as investors fled riskier asset classes. American crude output is soaring so fast that the U.S. is on the verge of elbowing Saudi Arabia and Russia aside as the dominant supplier.
“The supply backlash that we have been expecting in the U.S. because of higher prices became very real in the market psyche,” Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas in London, said by telephone. Oil is also being buffeted by “ripple effects from the risk-off move in equity markets.”
Traders who divine market momentum from charting and technical signals were closely watching New York crude’s 50-day moving average because a settlement below that level for several days in a row would be regarded as bearish.
Oil in New York has tumbled 7.4 percent so far this month. Even as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia curtailed output to prop up prices, production has continued escalating in the U.S.
West Texas Intermediate crude for March delivery slid $1.24 to $59.91 a barrel at 10:42 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

OPEC member Iran also announced plans on Thursday to increase production within the next four years by at least 700,000 barrels a day, which Brennock said marked ""a hat-trick of heartaches"" for oil bulls.

359,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",How soaring U.S. oil exports to China are transforming the global oil game,"By Henning Gloystein
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Bit by bit, the U.S. petroleum industry is turning world oil markets inside out. 
First, sharp drops in U.S. imports of crude oil eroded the biggest market that producers like OPEC had relied on for many years. Now, surging U.S. exports – largely banned by Washington until just two years ago - challenge the last region OPEC dominates: Asia. 
U.S. oil shipments to China have surged, creating trade between the world's two biggest powers that until 2016 just did not exist, and helping Washington in its effort to reduce the nation's huge trade deficit with China.
The transformation is reflected in figures released in recent days that shows the U.S. now produces more oil than top exporter Saudi Arabia and means the Americans are likely to take over the No.1 producer spot from Russia by the end of the year.
The growth has surprised even the official U.S. Energy Information Administration, which this week raised its 2018 crude output forecast to 10.59 million bpd, up by 300,000 bpd from their last forecast just a week before.
When U.S. oil exports appeared in 2016, the first cargoes went to free trade agreement partners South Korea and Japan. Few expected China to become a major buyer. 
Data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows U.S. crude shipments to China went from nothing before 2016 to a record 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January, worth almost $1 billion. Additionally, half a million tonnes of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) worth almost $300 million, headed to China from the U.S. in January.
TRADE SURPLUS NARROWS
The U.S. supplies will help reduce China's huge trade surplus with the U.S. and may help to counter allegations from U.S. President Donald Trump that Beijing is trading unfairly.
""With the Trump administration, the pressure on China to balance accounts with the U.S. is huge... Buying U.S. oil clearly helps toward that goal to reduce the disbalance,"" said Marco Dunand, chief executive and co-founder of commodity trading house Mercuria.
As the energy exports rose, China's January trade surplus with the United States narrowed to $21.895 billion, from $25.55 billion in December, according to official Chinese figures released on Thursday.
The energy sales to China are still modest compared with the $9.7 billion of oil shipped by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to China in January. But they are already cutting into a market dominated by the likes of Saudi Arabia and Russia - with the threat of much more competition to come.
""We see U.S. crude as a supplement to our large base of crude"" from the Middle East and Russia, said a refinery manager for China's oil-major Sinopec, declining to be named as he was not cleared to speak to media.
He said that Sinopec was looking to order more U.S. crude this year.

INSIDE OUT
China's crude imports climbed to a record 9.57 million bpd in January, official data showed on Thursday.
Meanwhile, U.S. imports have fallen below 4 million bpd, against a record 12.5 million bpd in 2005.
At average December/January volumes, American oil and gas sales to China would be worth around $10 billion a year. Including exports to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, the figure doubles. 
U.S. exports would be even greater but for infrastructure constraints: no U.S. port can handle the biggest oil tankers, known as Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC).
To address that, one of the biggest facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port Services (LOOP), is expanding in order to handle VLCCs soon.
THE PRICE OF OIL For Chinese buyers, the main attraction of U.S. oil has been price. Thanks to the shale boom, U.S. crude is cheaper than oil from elsewhere.
At around $60.50 per barrel, U.S. crude is currently some $4 per barrel cheaper than Brent, off which most other crudes are priced.
For many established oil exporters like the Middle East-dominated OPEC or Russia, who have been withholding production since 2017 in an attempt to push prices higher, these new oil flows mark a big loss in market share. 
""OPEC and Russia accepted that the U.S. will become a big producer because they simply wanted to get the price where it is today,"" Mercuria's Dunand said. 
Since the start of the OPEC-led supply cuts in January 2017, oil prices have risen by 20 percent, though prices in February have come under pressure again in large part due to soaring U.S. output. 
The flood of U.S. oil may even change the way crude is priced. 
Most OPEC producers sell crude under long-term contracts which are priced monthly, sometimes retro-actively. U.S. producers, by contrast, export on the basis of freight costs and price spreads between U.S. and other kinds of crude oil.
This has led to a surge in traded volumes of U.S. crude futures, known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), leaving volumes of other futures like Brent or Dubai far behind.
""Buyers, like sellers of U.S. oil, started hedging WTI,"" said John Driscoll, director of Singapore-based consultancy JTD Energy Services.
Despite all these challenges to the traditional oil order, established producers are putting on a brave face.
""We have no concern whatsoever about rising U.S. exports. Our reliability as a supplier is second to none, and we have the highest customer base with long-term sales agreements,"" said Amin Nasser, president and chief executive officer of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil behemoth.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China plans to launch its long-awaited crude oil futures contract on March 26, the country's securities regulator said on Friday, a move that could potentially shake up pricing of the world's largest commodity market.
Chang Depeng, a spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), gave the launch date at a regular briefing in Beijing, confirming what two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier on Friday. 
The launch will mark the culmination of a years-long push by China to create Asia's first oil futures benchmark, and is aimed at giving the world's biggest oil importer more clout in pricing crude sold to Asia. 
It will potentially give the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), which will operate the new contract, a share of the trillions of dollars each year in oil futures trading.
The Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) and INE, which is part of the ShFE, declined to comment. 
Asia has become the world's biggest oil consuming region, and China hopes its own derivative crude contract will better reflect market conditions in the region.
The two most active oil futures contracts in the world are the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (CLc1) contract offered by the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), owned by CME Group (O:CME), and the Brent (LCOc1) contract offered by the Intercontinental Exchange (N:ICE) from London.
WTI futures are an important component of physical oil prices in the Americas, while Brent plays a vital role for prices for Middle Eastern, European and Asian crude. 
Most physical oil trades globally are hedged using those two crude derivatives. 
The creation of the yuan-denominated contract, which will be open to Chinese and overseas investors, was originally expected about six years ago, but has run into delays as turmoil in China's stock markets and other commodity futures raised concerns about its capacity to handle financial turbulence.
The proposal was put on the backburner early last year. Potential international participants worried they would not be able to freely exchange the yuan because of a Chinese clampdown on capital outflows, and were concerned at Beijing's heavy handed intervention in its commodity markets.
John Browning, chief operating officer of Hong Kong-based futures broker Bands Financial Ltd, which has been approved by the CSRC as an overseas intermediary for the INE, said international participation in the contract was crucial to ensure INE pricing truly reflects global trade flows.
""The principal driver for the choice of this contract is to enable China to develop its own benchmark for oil pricing while increasing the trade of renminbi-denominated oil,"" Browning said in a statement, using another name for the Chinese currency. 

But while the contract will be quoted in yuan, ""the exchange will accept USD as collateral for initial margin,"" opening the way for participation by non-Chinese companies, he added.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq seeks around $100 billion in foreign investment in transport, energy and agriculture as part of a plan to rebuild parts of the country and revive the economy after a three-year war on Islamic State.
The government's National Investment Commission published a list of 157 projects it will seek investment for at an International Conference for Reconstruction of Iraq to be hosted by Kuwait Feb. 12 to 14.
Some of these projects are about rebuilding destroyed facilities like Mosul's airport, while others are new investments to strengthen and diversify the economy away from oil, said an economic advisor to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.
""All together, they cost about $100 billion,"" the advisor, Mudhar Saleh, told Reuters. Sixteen projects carry a price tag of $500 million or more, according to the list.
Rebuilding homes, hospitals, schools, roads, businesses and telecommunications is key to providing jobs to the young, to end the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people and put an end to several decades of political and sectarian violence.
Iraq declared victory over Islamic State in December, having taken back all the territory captured by the militants in 2014 and 2015. A U.S.-led coalition supported the Iraqi forces, especially in the battle to dislodge them from Mosul, their de facto capital in northern Iraq, in July.
The United States government will not contribute funds at the conference but will instead encourage investment from the private sector and Gulf Arab allies, U.S. and Western officials said.
A U.S. official in Baghdad said 100 U.S. companies were participating in the conference.
Three rail projects top the list: a 500-kilometer (311 mile) line from Baghdad to Basra in the south estimated to cost $13.7 billion, a line from Baghdad to Mosul in the north estimated at $8.65 billion and an $8 billion metro for the capital.
Iraq reopened to foreign investment in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, but the vast majority of the billions invested went to increasing its oil and gas production.
It has become the second-largest crude exporter of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, after Saudi Arabia, with a daily output of 4.4 million barrels.
At the conference, Iraq will seek investment in the downstream oil industry including in storage tanks, refineries and petrochemical plants to process its crude into plastics and fertilizers.
Saleh said investments in the oil industry and agriculture will probably be easier to attract than other sectors given the country's vast crude reserves, available land and water wealth.
Total land offered for investments to grow ""strategic crops"" is nearly 1,500 square kilometers (580 square miles). Iraq, one of the world's largest wheat importers, aims to achieve self-sufficiency and possibly become a net exporter of the grain.
""We feel there will be support for Iraq, from the Americans, the Europeans, the Arab countries, the United Nations, and humanitarian organizations,"" said Saleh.

Comex gold futures were steady at $1,318.5 a troy ounce by 02:00 a.m. ET (06:00 GMT), off Thursday's one-month low of $1,309.22.
The dollar weakened after a midnight deadline to pass the U.S. budget deal was missed on Thursday due to a prolonged speech by Senator Rand Paul, who objected to $300 billion in deficit spending in the bill saying that it would “loot the Treasury.”
U.S. congressional leaders had reached a two-year budget deal on Wednesday to raise government spending by almost $300 billion.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.14% at 90.06, off the previous session's two-and-a-half week high of 90.46.
Gold is sensitive to moves in the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency.
However, the greenback's losses were expected to remain limited as U.S. bond yields turned higher again. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was still hovering near a recent four-year peak on Friday.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Environmental activists in California on Thursday plan to protest a Trump Administration proposal to vastly increase offshore oil drilling in the United States.
The protest was planned at 1:30 p.m. PT (4:30 p.m. ET) to immediately precede a public meeting by the U.S. Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in Sacramento, where officials will be available to talk with members of the public about the proposed drilling expansion and help them submit public comments.
California officials said on Wednesday the state would block transport of such petroleum through its waters.
On Thursday, the California Coastal Commission also weighed in, requesting that the state be removed from consideration for offshore drilling. The state's Natural Resources secretary, John Laird, also voiced opposition.
""We urge the Interior Department to withdraw our state from further consideration for renewed offshore oil and gas development,” he said in a statement.
The protest is being organized by several environmental groups including the Center for Biological Diversity, the Sierra Club, and the Natural Resources Defense Council. It will feature public officials including State Controller Betty Yee, who sits on the commission that decides on pipeline permits, and state Senator Hannah-Beth Jackson, whose Santa Barbara district's coastline has been polluted by oil spills from past drilling.
""Offshore drilling is dirty and it’s dangerous,"" said Miyoko Sakashita, head of the oceans program for the Center for Biological Diversity. ""It results in oil spills that injure and kill wildlife.""
California’s threat to deny pipeline permits for transporting oil from new leases off the Pacific Coast is the latest step by states trying to halt the biggest proposed expansion in decades of federal oil and gas leasing. 
Officials in Florida, North and South Carolina, Delaware and Washington, have warned drilling could despoil beaches, harm wildlife and hurt lucrative tourism industries.
On Wednesday, California officials sent a formal letter to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management demanding that the Pacific coast be removed from the program. The State Lands Commission, which must approve any new pipelines, said in the letter it would not permit the movement of oil from new offshore leases to pass through state land or water.
“I am resolved that not a single drop from Trump’s new oil plan ever makes landfall in California,” Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, chair of the State Lands Commission and a Democratic candidate for governor, said in an emailed statement. 
The letter also criticized the agency for holding just one public meeting in California, the most populous U.S. state with about 40 million residents.
In response, a spokeswoman for Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said the process of developing the five-year-plan for offshore oil and gas leases is ""a very open and public process.""
“Secretary Zinke looks forward to meeting with more Governors and other coastal representatives who want to discuss the draft program,” spokeswoman Heather Swift said by email, adding the bureau “has planned 23 public meetings, in our coastal states, to secure feedback directly from citizens.”

William Brown, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s chief environmental officer, said state input is taken seriously, and has resulted in past drilling plans being scaled back.

368,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Venezuela resorts to swaps to get oil imports for Curacao refinery,"By Marianna Parraga
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA has resumed crude imports for its 335,000-barrel-per-day Isla refinery in the Caribbean island of Curacao after a seven-month pause, as it seeks to turn around falling fuel output, according to internal PDVSA documents.
PDVSA, which supplies the bulk of Venezuela's export revenue, is increasingly in need of foreign crude as chronic underinvestment slashes its own output, leaving it short of crude to refine and blend.
The increased activity at Curacao comes as more suppliers are accepting oil swaps as a solution to the company's lack of dollars, according to the documents. Cash-strapped PDVSA is increasingly giving its own crude and products away to obtain some of the barrels its refining network needs.
Refining problems due to outages and lack of oil have caused intermittent fuel shortages in the OPEC-member nation. The shrinking crude output and exports have not only cut its ability to pay cash for imported oil, but also to buy the food, medicine and supplies the country needs.
PDVSA's oil purchases - typically used for refining and blending its heavy crude for export markets - declined to almost none during the second half of last year as the company used most of its cash to pay bondholders and avoid a default. 
PDVSA has received in recent weeks 1.73 million barrels of U.S. West Texas Intermediate and DSW crudes, and 1.44 million barrels of Russia's Urals crude at Curacao's Bullenbay terminal, according to the PDVSA's internal data and Reuters vessel tracking data, almost the same volume imported in all of 2017.
Most imports came from tenders awarded in December to China Oil and trading firm Citizens Resources LLC. 
PDVSA expects to receive two more U.S. crude cargoes from China Oil, owned by state-run China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and Sinochem Corp, and two additional Urals cargoes from trading firm  Glencore  (L:GLEN) and Russia's Lukoil (MM:LKOH), the documents say.
PDVSA, Citizens Resources, China Oil and Lukoil did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Glencore declined to comment.
PDVSA agreed to prices over $66 per barrel for the crude purchases discharged this year, according to the same documents. The numbers were close to market prices, but still are a heavy load for a country struggling to afford basic goods.
Cash payments for the cargoes have been minimal since PDVSA also has agreed to deliver up to 1 million barrels of fuel oil and 3.9 million barrels of Merey heavy crude in exchange for the imports.
Such barter deals have become common in recent years as PDVSA strains to obtain hard currency for its crude. A series of oil-for-loan agreements coupled with falling crude output have left the company cash strapped. In 2017, its oil production fell to the lowest level in almost three decades.
Financial sanctions imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump in August have also worsened its cash problems while limiting access to long- and medium-term credit. 
PDVSA's Isla refinery in Curacao is one of its main facilities for fuel oil output for exports, but a lack of crude last year limited processing at the plant, causing delays in shipments to Asia, PDVSA's main destination for exports.

Venezuela's domestic refineries are also working well below capacity. The country's largest facility, Amuay, entirely halted processing in January. Some units restarted days after, but its catalytic cracker stopped working again this week due to lack of feedstock, according to union sources.

Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London declined 23 cents or about 0.37% to $65.27 a barrel, just off a six-week low of $64.68 reached earlier.
Oil prices remained under pressure since data last week showed that U.S. oil production topped the 10 million barrels per day (bpd) mark.
Domestic oil production, driven by shale extraction, rose 3.3% to an all-time high of 10.25 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. That figure is above that of top exporter Saudi Arabia and within reach of Russia's output levels.
Prices were also hit by news U.S. commercial crude stocks increased by 1.9 million barrels in the week to February 2, to 420.25 million barrels.
That added to fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
The producer group, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.

372,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 06:19AM ET</span>",California says will block crude oil from Trump offshore drilling plan,"By Sharon Bernstein
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California will block the transportation through its state of petroleum from new offshore oil rigs, officials told Reuters on Wednesday, a move meant to hobble the Trump administration’s effort to vastly expand drilling in U.S. federal waters.
California's plan to deny pipeline permits for transporting oil from new leases off the Pacific Coast is the most forceful step yet by coastal states trying to halt the biggest proposed expansion in decades of federal oil and gas leasing. 
Officials in Florida, North and South Carolina, Delaware and Washington, have also warned drilling could despoil beaches, harm wildlife and hurt lucrative tourism industries.
""I am resolved that not a single drop from Trump's new oil plan ever makes landfall in California,"" Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, chair of the State Lands Commission and a Democratic candidate for governor, said in an emailed statement.
The commission sent a letter on Wednesday to the U.S. Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) urging the bureau's program manager Kelly Hammerle to withdraw the draft proposal, saying the public did not have an adequate opportunity to provide input on the plan. 
""It is certain that the state would not approve new pipelines or allow use of existing pipelines to transport oil from new leases onshore,” the commission wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.
California has clashed repeatedly with President Donald Trump's administration over a range of other issues since last year, from climate change to automobile efficiency standards to immigration.
The Interior Department last month announced its proposal to open nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, sparking protests from coastal states, environmentalists and the tourism industry. 
Governors from nearly every U.S. coastal state except Alaska and Maine expressed opposition, and even Alaska's governor requested sensitive areas be removed.
The proposal also comes amid low U.S. oil industry demand for new offshore leases, as drillers focus on cheaper and highly-productive wells onshore that have pushed U.S. production over 10 millions barrels per day for the first time since 1970. 
Heather Swift, spokeswoman for Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, said developing the five-year plan for offshore oil and gas leases is ""a very open and public process.""
""Secretary Zinke looks forward to meeting with more Governors and other coastal representatives who want to discuss the draft program,"" she said, adding the bureau ""has planned 23 public meetings, in our coastal states, to secure feedback directly from citizens.""
In an interview on Tuesday, William Brown, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's chief environmental officer, said state input is taken seriously, and has resulted in past drilling plans being scaled back. He said the approval process would take two years and include an environmental review.
PROTESTS
Trump has said more offshore drilling would boost the U.S. economy and national security by reducing reliance on imported oil. 
Opponents of offshore drilling have complained that Congress has passed no new safety standards since  BP  (LON:BP) Plc’s Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. It took months to stop that leak, which became the largest oil spill in American history, despoiling the environment of Gulf Coast states and causing billions of dollars in economic damage.
Offshore drilling has been restricted in California since a 1969 oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara. In 2015, another spill in Santa Barbara County sent as much as 2,400 barrels of oil (101,000 gallons or 382,000 liters) onto the coast and into the Pacific, leaving slicks that stretched over nine miles (14 km).
Major oil companies, like  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX), have long since abandoned their efforts in California's offshore region, despite its estimated 250 million barrels of proven oil reserves, due in part to legislative and political hurdles and easier prospects elsewhere.
Chevron gave away the U.S. Geological Survey seismic data on offshore California and other parts of the U.S. West Coast for research use in 2005, deeming it no longer commercially useful.
Neal Kirby, a spokesman for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents small and mid-sized drilling companies, said his members support the administration’s drilling plan. 
But, he said that the industry was primarily interested in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, a region close to existing oil infrastructure and highly-productive fields. He said if California bars oil from passing through pipelines, companies would be even less likely to seek new offshore leases there.
A number of other states have asked the Interior Department to exempt them from the drilling plan. So far, Secretary Zinke has said he would exempt Florida, which borders the Eastern Gulf and the Southeastern Atlantic, to protect its tourism industry and he has promised to hold discussions with other states that have expressed concerns. 
On Jan. 24, U.S. lawmakers from Florida sent Zinke a letter pressing him to honor his pledge, noting that the acting chief of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management had said Florida's coast is ""still under consideration for offshore drilling."" 

Environmentalists and some elected officials plan to protest the drilling plan at a public meeting on Thursday in Sacramento.

373,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2018 05:55AM ET</span>",Texas flood: U.S. oil exports pour into markets worldwide,"By Catherine Ngai, Libby George and Florence Tan
NEW YORK/LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - In the two years since Washington lifted a 40-year ban on oil exports, tankers filled with U.S. crude have landed in more than 30 countries, ranging from massive economies like China and India to tiny Togo.
The repeal has unleashed a flood of U.S. shale oil, undercutting global crude prices, eroding the clout of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and seizing market share from many of its member countries.
In 2005, before the shale revolution, the United States had net imports of 12.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude and fuels - compared to just 4 million bpd today.
U.S. producers are making new customers out of some of the world's biggest oil-importing nations in Asia and Europe, posing a serious competitive threat to the only other countries that produce as much crude: Saudi Arabia and Russia. At home, the export boom has filled pipelines and sparked a surge of investment in new shipping infrastructure on the Gulf Coast.
(For an interactive graphic detailing the global impacts of the U.S. shale revolution, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2EtJgen)
U.S. producers now export between 1.5 million and 2 million barrels of crude a day, which could rise to about 4 million by 2022. The nation's output is expected to account for more than 80 percent of global supply growth in the next decade, according to Paris-based International Energy Agency.
Much of the increased flow will go to China, the world's top importer and, since November, the largest buyer of U.S. crude other than Canada.
Chen Bo, president of Unipec - China's largest buyer of U.S. crude - told Reuters that the firm expects to double U.S. imports this year to 300,000 bpd as it seeks to expand sales in Asia and find new customers for U.S. exports in other regions, including Europe.
Unipec - the trading arm of Asia's largest refiner, state-owned Sinopec - is also considering long-term crude supply deals with U.S. pipeline and terminal operators. The firm may also partner with such firms to expand and improve U.S. export infrastructure, Chen said in an interview.
""U.S. crude flowing to Asia is a major trend in global oil trading,"" Chen told Reuters.
Separately, China's state-owned chemical and oil conglomerate Sinochem Group plans to open a trading office in Houston later this year to source U.S. crude for China's independent refineries, five sources familiar with the plans told Reuters.
Between 2010 and 2017, U.S. oil production rose from 5.5 million barrels a day to 10 million bpd - approaching a record set in 1970 - as shale fields in west Texas and North Dakota lured massive new drilling investments. That brings national production in line with Saudi Arabia and close to top-producer Russia's 10.9 million barrels a day.
Saudi Arabia cut output last year as part of OPEC's 2016 deal to reduce supply - after losing a price war with U.S. shale producers that created a global glut. 
Most forecasts show U.S. crude output growing about 500,000 to 600,000 barrels per day through the end of 2018, said David Fyfe, chief economist at global commodity trading firm Gunvor Group in Geneva, Switzerland. The U.S. Energy Department is even more optimistic, now expecting growth to rise by 1.2 million bpd - hitting 11 million bpd by year-end. 
""The bulk of that growth will likely be exported,"" Fyfe said.
U.S. producers are also displacing foreign oil at home.
Total U.S. crude imports have dropped to 7.6 million barrels a day from a peak of 10.6 million bpd in 2006. OPEC's share has declined from more than half of U.S. imports to about 37 percent as the United States relies more on domestic production and neighboring Canada.
OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Angola have been among the hardest hit. In the second half of 2017, U.S. imports from Saudi Arabia averaged 709,000 bpd, lowest since 1987 and down from a peak of 1.73 million bpd in 2003. 
BIG BUYERS IN INDIA, EUROPE
U.S. producers have also broken into the market in India - the world's third-largest oil importer and home to the world's largest refining complex, operated by Reliance Industries.
Seeking to diversify its foreign supplies, India first imported U.S. crude in October and bought a total of 8 million barrels of U.S. oil last year, according to Thomson Reuters ship-tracking data and shipping data provided by sources.
In Europe, as of November, the United States had become the fifth-largest oil supplier to France, according to customs data, exceeding Nigeria, Libya, Iran or the North Sea. In November 2016, the U.S. didn't even make the top ten.
China stopped importing Nigerian crude in the fourth quarter, according to Chinese customs figures, and while China's overall imports rose by 12 percent in 2017, imports from Saudi Arabia rose just 2.3 percent.
""They're taking market share really from OPEC nations,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of PetroMatrix.
GULF COAST SHIPPING BOOM
Surging U.S. exports are rippling through the rest of the domestic energy economy. Shipping terminals Texas and around the Gulf Coast are building out infrastructure to handle larger tankers.
“If we didn’t have the option to send that crude to export markets, I think crude oil production would have been much more distressed,"" said Jarl Pedersen, chief commercial officer at Port Corpus Christi in south Texas, referring to 2016, when oil prices were still in the 40s. 
Pipeline and logistics firms are among the big beneficiaries, as booming crude demand means steadier profits for companies sending oil to the Gulf and storing it for export. 
Enterprise Products Partners (N:EPD) - which operates more than 5,000 miles of crude oil pipelines and 38 million barrels of crude storage - reported record profits in 2017, boosted by record volumes for its pipelines and marine terminals.
Magellan Midstream Partners (N:MMP), which operates key pipelines from Texas's Permian Basin to the Gulf, expects to spend more than $1.7 billion in the next two years on construction projects. Among those are new docks, storage and marine terminals in the Houston area to meet growing demand.
Terminal operators and shippers in the U.S. Gulf are ramping up investment to guard against supply bottlenecks as more barrels leave the U.S. It can take 18 to 24 months to build an export dock.
Gulf Coast terminals handle three-quarters of U.S. crude exports, but only one - the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) terminal - can handle supertankers that can carry up to 2 million barrels of oil. 
Most shipping channels are too shallow. Last year, Occidental Petroleum Corp's (N:OXY) Ingleside terminal at Corpus Christi test-loaded a supertanker - but that channel is currently not deep enough to fully load such a vessel. 
In late January, the CEO of the Corpus Christi port forwarded a letter from six energy executives pressing the Trump Administration for $60 million in federal funding for ship channel improvements as part of a $320 million project to widen and deepen the port's ship channel. 
Lifting the crude export ban allowed for $50 billion in industrial projects in south Texas alone, the executives wrote.

""If that project for some reason should stall,"" said Corpus Christi's Pedersen, ""that would really make U.S. crude less competitive in Asia.""

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 30 cents, or 0.5%, to $61.49 a barrel by 3:55AM ET (0855GMT). The U.S. benchmark sank $1.60, or 2.5%, in the last session, after touching its lowest level since Jan. 5 at $61.25.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., dipped 31 cents, or roughly 0.5%, to $65.20 a barrel, after hitting its lowest level since Dec. 26 earlier in the session.
Oil settled lower for the fourth session in a row on Wednesday, after data showed U.S. oil production topped the 10 million barrels per day (bpd) mark last week.
Domestic oil production, driven by shale extraction, rose 3.3% to an all-time high of 10.25 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. That figure is above that of top exporter Saudi Arabia and within reach of Russia's output levels.
Weighing further on prices was that U.S. commercial crude stocks rose by 1.9 million barrels in the week to Feb. 2, to 420.25 million barrels.
That added to fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
The producer group, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed in December to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
In other energy trading, gasoline futures held steady at $1.764 a gallon, while heating oil was little changed at $1.925 a gallon.
Natural gas futures ticked up 1.5 cents, or 0.6%, to $2.718 per million British thermal units, as traders looked ahead to weekly storage data due later in the global day amid expectations for a withdrawal of 116 billion cubic feet.

Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, as these increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Comex gold futures fell to a session low of $1,311.70 a troy ounce, its worst level since Jan. 10. It was last at $1,314.10 by 3:30AM ET (0830GMT), down around 0.1%.
Gold futures closed lower for a fourth-straight session on Wednesday, as the dollar index and Treasury yields gained, dulling investment demand for the precious metal.
The greenback's upward trend continued in early trade Thursday. Against a basket of six major rival currencies, the dollar was a shade higher at 90.25, its highest in two weeks, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note stood at around 2.82%.
The move higher in the yields also came amid news that U.S. Senate leaders reached a two-year budget deal to raise government spending by almost $300 billion.
Meanwhile, focus remained on U.S. stocks, which were the source of the latest turbulence in global markets.
Unless the market plunge intensifies and damages the economy, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to budge from its plan to raise borrowing costs three times this year, some analysts said.
In other metals action, silver futures inched up 6.2 cents, or 0.4%, to $16.30 a troy ounce. It touched $16.19 earlier in the session, its lowest since Dec. 22.
Palladium prices fell 0.8% to $976.60 an ounce, its lowest since Nov. 15.
Sister metal platinum meanwhile lost 0.3% at $978.80 after touching its lowest since Jan. 11 in the previous session.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for March delivery fell 0.21% to $61.66 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent eased 0.12% to $65.43 a barrel.
Ahead, China reports trade balance data with a $54.10 billion surplus seen for January and exports up 9.6%, a dip from 10.9% in December, and imports expected up 9.8%, a jump from 4.5% in December.
China's China's crude oil imports in January jumped 20% to a record 40.64 million metric tons, equivalent to 9.57 million barrels per day (bpd), up from around 7.94 million bpd in December and the previous high of 9.17 million bpd in March of 2017.
Overnight, crude oil prices settled sharply lower after data showed US domestic oil supplies rose for the second straight week while domestic production rose further above 10 million barrels per day.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by rose 1.895 million barrels for the week ended Feb. 2, below expectations for for a rise of 3.189 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – rose by 3.414 million barrels, well above the expectations for a build of 459,000 barrels, while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – unexpectedly rose by 3.926 million barrels, confounding expectations for a decline of 1.419 million barrels expected.
The sharp build in product inventories such as gasoline and distillate comes amid a slowdown in refinery activity as refiners enter a period of maintenance. Subdued refinery activity lessened demand for crude oil, contributing to the recent build in inventories.
Rising US output continued to weigh on sentiment after the EIA's preliminary figures on Wednesday showed weekly U.S. production hit 10.25 million bpd. That level brings the US closer to world's top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia.
The ongoing uptick in US production is widely viewed as one of the biggest headwinds for oil prices as it threatens to dampen major oil producers’ efforts to rid the market of excess supplies as part of the OPEC-led production cut agreement.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Thursday, taking Brent crude to a 2018 low, as soaring U.S. output uncermined OPEC's efforts to tighten markets and prop up prices.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $65.20 per barrel at 0226 GMT, down 31 cents, or 0.5 percent, from the previous close. Brent slipped to its lowest for the year at $65.12 a barrel early in the session.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $61.46 a barrel. That was down 33 cents, or 0.5 percent, from the last settlement, though still some way off its $60.10 2018 low on Jan. 2.
""Brent has now turned negative for 2018 while WTI isn't looking great either,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at futures brokerage Forex.com.
The dips follow bigger falls on Wednesday, when crude touched one-month lows and erased much of 2018's early gains.
Some support on Thursday came from the second outage in as many months on the 450,000 barrels per day Forties pipeline network, Britain's biggest, which supplies much of the crude underpinning Brent futures.
But the biggest market driver was U.S. production. What's long been expected is now official: U.S. crude oil output averaged above 10 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time since the early 1970s last week, reaching 10.25 million bpd.
RUNAWAY PRODUCTION
Until the early 2000s, the United States was oil starved, importing a peak of 12 million bpd.
But in one of the steepest rises of any oil producer in modern history, U.S. output has surged by more than 20 percent since mid-2016, undermining OPEC's and Russia's efforts to tighten the market and prop up prices by withholding production.
In fact, the OPEC-led restraint was arguably the biggest enabler for America's production boom, handing over market share at higher oil prices.
At 10.25 million bpd, U.S. output is now higher than the previous 10.044 million bpd record from back in 1970.
It's above that of top exporter Saudi Arabia's and within reach of Russia's.
Weighing further on prices, U.S. commercial crude stocks  rose by 1.9 million barrels in the week to Feb. 2, to 420.25 million barrels.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) this week upped its 2018 average output forecast to 10.59 million bpd, up by a whopping 320,000 bpd from its last forecast just a week earlier.
Daily average production also shot up in the latest week.
""What surprised the most was the large spike in oil production to 10.25 million barrels per day which was significantly higher than 9.92 million from the previous week,"" Razaqzada said.

""Clearly, the data points to an imbalanced market and oil prices have responded by turning sharply lower,"" he added.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday, lifted by a report that U.S. crude inventories fell last week, although analysts warned that soaring U.S. output and a seasonal demand drop could soon weigh on crude. 
Brent crude futures were at $67.44 per barrel at 0751 GMT, up 58 cents, or 0.9 percent, from the previous close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $63.88 a barrel. That was up 49 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last settlement.
The market was supported by a report by the American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday saying that U.S. crude inventories fell by 1.1 million barrels in the week to Feb. 2 to 418.4 million barrels, traders said.
A group of oil producers around OPEC and Russia have been withholding supplies since last year to tighten supplies and prop up prices. The cuts are set to last through 2018.
""Evidence points to a global inventory market that has arguably already balanced – with days of forward cover in the low single digits or possibly even lower - which should support the spot price going forward,"" said Richard Robinson, manager of the Ashburton Global Energy fund.
Other analysts, however, warned of the risk of lower oil prices, both from financial markets and because of weaker seasonal demand.
In the short-term, demand is expected to slow due to refinery maintenances at the end of the northern hemisphere winter season.
""The combination of rising risk-aversion and fading short-term fundamental support continues to put downward pressure on oil,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.
Looming over oil markets is rising U.S. crude production, which has already soared by 18 percent to almost 10 million barrels per day (bpd).
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. output to rise to an average of 10.59 million bpd in 2018, and then 11.18 million bpd by 2019.
That would be more than top producer Russia, which pumped on average 10.98 million bpd out of the ground in 2017. 
""With all the chatter about U.S. production ramping up, there could be a growing propensity to move lower near-term,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell for a third day on Tuesday, as a rout in global equities triggered losses across bonds, cryptocurrencies and commodities, although the crude price is in positive territory so far this year.
Even with Wall Street stocks posting their largest one-day fall since late 2011 on Monday and measures of volatility spiking to multi-year highs, reflecting heightened investor nervousness, oil has not suffered to the same extent. 
Brent crude futures were down 35 cents on the day at $67.27 a barrel by 0921 GMT, still up 1 percent so far in 2018. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures eased by 25 cents to $63.90.
Since the S&P 500 hit a record high on Jan. 26, the index has lost 8 percent. Oil, in contrast, has lost 4.5 percent, while cryptocurrency bitcoin has lost half its value.
A factor that could insulate oil to some extent against a bigger rout is the structure of the forward curve, where the prompt futures contract is trading well above those for delivery further in the future.
""We know that speculative positions both in terms of contracts and in allocated dollars are at an all-time high. Thus a real pain-trade has not yet hit the oil market,"" SEB head of commodity strategy Bjarne Schieldrop said.
""Longs have not yet started to flock to the exit door. If that happens, it will make the buying opportunity even better for the oil consumers who buy oil on the forward curve."" 
Financial markets went into a tailspin on Monday after a sharp rise in U.S. bond yields raised concern over a possible increase in inflation and potentially higher interest rates.
U.S. S&P 500 futures tumbled 3 percent in Asian trade on Tuesday, extending Monday's sell-off.
""Suddenly, inflation has become one of the most talked-about issues in markets,"" U.S. bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in a note.
Market-based inflation expectations, as measured by the U.S. five-year breakeven inflation rate, reached a 10-month high above 2.10 percent late last week but have since pulled back.
Oil has been caught between the opposing forces of a 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) cut in supply by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, and a surge in U.S. crude output above 10 million bpd, its highest since the 1970s. 
There is also a seasonal downturn in demand, as many refineries shut for maintenance at the end of the peak-consumption winter season in the northern hemisphere.

400,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 03:54PM ET</span>","With sorghum warning shot, Beijing targets Trump's core farm base","By Dominique Patton and Michael Martina
BEIJING (Reuters) - In launching a probe into U.S. sorghum imports, China has fired a warning shot across its top trading partner's bow that shows farmers in states that voted for U.S. President Donald Trump may be Beijing's top retaliatory target in the event of a trade war.
On Sunday, the Ministry of Commerce launched an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation, potentially leading to hefty tariffs on imports of the ingredient used in livestock feed and the fiery Chinese liquor baijiu.
It comes less than a fortnight after Trump slapped steep tariffs on imports of solar panels and washing machines and two months after Washington's decision to investigate Chinese aluminum alloy sheet, the first U.S.-initiated anti-subsidy and anti-dumping probe in decades.
Those moves had rekindled concerns among global policymakers and markets of a U.S.-China trade war. (Graphic: China is the main destination for U.S. agricultural exports - http://reut.rs/2E1vxuc)
The United States accounts for more than 90 percent of total sorghum arrivals in China. U.S. imports were worth just over $1 billion last year. 
The commerce ministry said it had initiated the investigation because the local industry included a large number of small growers who were unable to prepare the necessary documentation.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the issue was an ""individual, normal trade remedy investigation case"".
Deploying the rarely used tactic of self-initiating, rather than responding to complaints from farmers, suggests the probe had been in the works for some time, and was viewed by trade experts as retaliation for recent U.S. actions against China.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said China should conduct the investigation openly and transparently. ""Politics play no role in anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations in the United States, and should not affect the outcomes of the trade investigations conducted by foreign nations,"" Ross said in a statement.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office, which could seek a World Trade Organization challenge against any anti-dumping decision by China, declined to comment. The National Sorghum Producers and trade group U.S. Grains Council each said they would cooperate with an investigation. 
China has used other niche farm products such as distillers' dried grains to hurt the United States in recent years.
But taking aim at sorghum at a time when the global grain market is in surplus and growers around the world are scrambling to find homes for their products hits at Trump's core political base while avoiding damaging supplies of a product critical at home.
Texas and Kansas, major Republican strongholds or ""red states"", produce most of the U.S. sorghum crop.
""They believe that if they ratchet up the heat in key red states where there's a large agricultural community that's voted for Donald Trump that it will somehow change the situation,"" said Paul Burke, Asia director at U.S. Soybean Export Council.
While many sorghum traders in China were surprised by the news, they said they would likely switch to buying from the nation's ample supplies of locally grown corn instead. China's state reserve is big enough to feed the country for a year.
POLITICAL RESONANCE
Business executives had expected Beijing to target commodities, a major U.S. export to China, in any response to the escalating trade dispute.
Last week Lester Ross, chairman of the policy committee at the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told reporters that China would take aim at sectors with ""political resonance in the United States"", such as commodities and aircraft.
With Trump threatening further action on steel and aluminum imports from China as well as alleged Chinese intellectual property rights abuses, the conflict could escalate further.
Many Chinese experts think politicians in Washington are not prepared to pay the heavy economic and political price needed to upset trade dynamics between the world's two largest economies, including a large Chinese trade in goods surplus. 
But some business executives warn that invoking a Cold War-era trade law to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum could trigger a trade war, which could expand to other more critical commodities, such as soybeans, the United States' biggest agricultural export by value worth more than $12 billion last year.
China's commerce and agriculture ministries told a delegation of U.S. soy growers last September that soybeans were being considered as a target for retaliatory action, Burke said.
""We're watching the situation very closely,"" he told Reuters on Monday.

Comex gold futures were up 0.15% at $1,339.20 a troy ounce by 08:15 a.m. ET (12:15 GMT), just off Friday's nearly two-week lows of $1,330.10.
The greenback was boosted after the U.S. Department of Labor reported on Friday that the economy added 200,000 jobs in January, beating expectations for a 184,000 gain. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.1% this month, in line with expectations.
The strong wage growth data fueled inflation expectations, and underlined the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a faster pace this year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.10% at 89.13.
Separately, Treasury yields continued to climb, with the benchmark 10-year note hovering near more than four years.
Recent chatter that the world's leading central banks will start tightening monetary policy faster than previously thought has sparked a global bond market selloff this year, with yields in the U.S., Europe and Asia all spiking higher.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 60 cents, or 0.9%, to $64.86 a barrel by 3:30AM ET (0830GMT). The U.S. benchmark slumped 35 cents in the last session.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., fell 64 cents, or roughly 1%, to $67.94 a barrel, after hitting its lowest level in around a month at $67.70 earlier in the session.
WTI crude lost roughly 1% last week, while Brent declined about 2.8%, as rising U.S. oil production pushed down prices.
The number of oil drilling rigs climbed for a second week in a row,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. It rose by six to 765 last week, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 20% since the most recent low in mid-2016, and increasing drilling activity for new production means output is expected to grow further, as producers are attracted by climbing prices.
U.S. crude oil production, driven by shale extraction, hit 9.91 million barrels per day last week, according to government data, the highest level since the early 1970s and close to the output of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Oil prices have risen almost 55% from around $43 a barrel in June, benefiting from production cut efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The producers agreed in December to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.

The data contributed to the sentiment that inflation is picking up and higher interest rates are on the horizon.
Comex gold futures were a touch lower at $1,336.10 a troy ounce by 3:15AM ET (0815GMT), not far from a two-week low of $1,330.10 touched in the last session.
Gold fell almost 1% on Friday after a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report drove up the dollar and Treasury yields as the data laid some groundwork for a potentially more aggressive Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes this year.
The majority of economists believe that the U.S. central bank will hike rates three times this year. However, the market is now adjusting to the possibility that the Fed could raise rates four more times in 2018.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding nonyielding bullion.
The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six rivals, was a shade higher at 89.05, remaining above a more than four-year low of 88.25 hit late last month.
Treasury yields pushed higher, with the benchmark 10-year note running up to the highest level in more than four years at around 2.87%.

409,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",Next-wave LNG terminals get smaller to offer flexible supply deals,"By Julie Gordon
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The liquefied natural gas market is growing every year, but the terminals that ship and receive the fuel are shrinking.
The booming sector's next-generation infrastructure is being designed for a emerging-market buyers that want smaller volumes on shorter, more flexible contracts.
LNG export terminals, where the gas is liquefied and put on vessels for shipping, have traditionally been massive, custom-built facilities that cost tens of billions of dollars. And so to justify the investment, they have typically required equally massive, long-term supply deals, often lasting a decade or more.
Numerous terminal projects on the horizon, by contrast, are new modular-style designs built to snap together like Legos, allowing for small to mid-scale liquefaction or regasification plants that can be expanded if and when demand grows.
The first next-generation liquefaction plant is under construction in the U.S. state of Georgia and is expected to begin operating mid-year.
These facilities, with far smaller liquefaction units - known as trains - are ""more consistent with market conditions,"" said John Baguley, chief operating officer of Australia-based LNG Ltd, which has proposed mid-scale LNG plants in the United States and Canada.
The new designs reflect a maturing market with a more diverse base of customers that will drive future growth.
In 2008, the average contract was for 18 years and more than 2 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa). By 2016, it had dropped to less than eight years and less than 1 Mtpa, with new buyers in emerging markets like China, India and Pakistan seeking flexibility due to market uncertainty.
These new buyers are fueling small utilities and industrial users such as fertilizer plants and factories, said Alfred Moujaes, Houston President for Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Company. The firm is building small, modular plants for LNG buyers, who need to convert the liquefied fuel back to a gas form after shipping.
Typically, such markets will be small at first, but the hope is that demand will grow as additional customers convert to LNG, Moujaes said. The modular plants allow terminals to grow with the market. 
Demand for liquefied natural gas, or LNG, has taken off in recent years as it is a cleaner fuel than oil or coal, and abundant supply has driven its price sharply lower. 
Overall global consumption of LNG rose to 33.1 billion cubic feet per day in 2016, about 10 percent of total natural gas usage; it is expected to grow by 75 percent by 2027, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The United States, with its abundant supply of pipeline gas and well-developed energy hubs such as the U.S. Gulf Coast, is emerging as a dominant global producer.
U.S. export capacity has shot up from less than 2 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) in 2015 to 18 Mtpa in 2017, and is projected to top 77 Mtpa by 2022, transforming the United States into the world's No. 2 exporter behind Australia.
In 2005, just 15 countries imported LNG; now there are 39, with another eight expected to hit the market by 2022, according to the International Energy Agency. 
TINY TRAINS
The new style of North American liquefaction projects will be built in Asia before being shipped to the United States for assembly. At the heart of these new terminals are modular trains which produce just a fraction of the LNG of a traditional train. 
LNG Ltd has proposed four 2-Mtpa trains at its Magnolia project in Louisiana, while Tellurian Inc is planning up to 20 1.38-Mtpa trains at its Driftwood project, also in Louisiana. 
That compares to Cheniere Energy's four 4.5-Mtpa trains now operating at its 18-Mtpa terminal in Sabine Pass.
With modular trains, companies hope to avoid the delays and cost overruns that have dogged custom mega-projects like  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) Corp's Wheatstone and Gorgon projects in Australia. 
Another large terminal, Sempra Energy's Cameron LNG project in Louisiana with three 4.5-Mtpa trains, has been delayed to 2019 after originally targeting a launch this year. 
While modular designs allow more flexibility, some experts question whether they will ultimately cost less to build and be as easy to expand as promised, noting the technology is unproven.
""The issue that everybody is wrestling with is, does that really save you money?"" said Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at shipbroker Poten and Partners. 
The first such facility in the U.S. will provide a test case. The $2 billion Elba Island project, being built in Georgia's Chatham County by  Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI), will have 10 trains and export capacity of just 2.5 Mtpa. 
The technology is attractive enough that Cheniere has proposed a cluster of seven 1.36-Mtpa trains for a project being constructed in Corpus Christi, Texas, in addition to other, much larger liquefaction units.

Michael Wortley, Cheniere's CFO, said in an interview that the company still believes traditional large-train designs work well. But it wanted to explore smaller-train technology, he said, to make sure ""we weren't missing anything.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices on Monday extended declines from the end of last week amid a wider market sell off and a stronger dollar, with Brent crude falling to its lowest in nearly a month.
Other markets dropped as investors were spooked by Friday's payrolls report from the United States, which showed wages growing at their fastest pace in more than 8-1/2 years, fuelling inflation expectations.
Brent was down 68 cents, or 1 percent, at $67.91 a barrel at 0344 GMT, after falling 1.5 percent on Friday. Brent's weekly drop was 2.75 percent last week. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude declined 72 cents to $64.73 a barrel, after dropping 0.5 percent in the previous session. WTI fell by 1 percent during the last week.
""Oil is caught up in this general risk-off move, not helped at the margins by a little bit of strength in the U.S. dollar,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.
Asian shares were down the most in more than a year on Monday as fears of resurgent inflation battered bonds.
Wall Street dropped last week from record highs as inflation concerns sparked speculation that central banks globally might be forced to tighten policy more aggressively.
The three major U.S. indexes capped their worst weekly losses in two years, after closing at record highs the previous week.
""The size of the move in U.S. equities doesn't always mean this, but usually after a move like that and particularly when it follows such a long uptrend, there is follow through selling,"" Spooner said. 
Rising U.S. oil production has also helped push down oil prices, undermining attempts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to support prices.
Data from the U.S. government last week showed that output climbed above 10 million barrels per day in November for the first time since 1970, as shale drillers expanded operations after gains in oil prices last year. 
""Over the course of the next few weeks one of the key things is going to be U.S. production data and whether the increase in shale rigs recently is going to increase,"" Spooner said.
U.S. energy companies did add oil rigs for a second week in a row last week, energy services company Baker Hughes Inc reported on Friday. Drillers added six oil rigs in the week to Feb. 2, bringing the total to 765.
Hedge funds and money manager reduced last week their bullish positions on U.S. crude, cutting their net-long positions from a record after three weeks of increases.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The United States is considering restricting imports of Venezuelan crude oil and exports of U.S. refined products to Venezuela, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday, to put pressure on socialist President Nicolas Maduro to ""return to the constitution."" 
""One of the aspects of considering sanctioning oil is what effect would it have on the Venezuelan people? Is it a step that might bring this to an end more rapidly?"" Tillerson said at a news conference in Buenos Aires, referring to Venezuela's economic and political crisis. 
Tillerson, on a Latin America trip that also includes visits to Mexico, Peru, Colombia and Jamaica, raised eyebrows on Friday after he suggested that Maduro could be toppled by his own military.
Restrictions on Venezuela's all-important oil industry would represent an escalation of financial pressure on the OPEC member, which is gripped by severe shortages of food and medicine. Sanctions have so far focused on individual members of Maduro's government and a ban on buying new Venezuelan debt. 
""We are looking at options and we are looking at how to mitigate the impacts on U.S. business interests"" and on other countries in the region, Tillerson said.
Standing next to Tillerson at the news conference, Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie said his country would ""closely follow"" the possibility of oil and fuel sale restrictions, but said sanctions ""must never harm the Venezuelan people.""
Other Latin American governments have said they were unwilling to take steps that would worsen the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela,
""Not doing anything to bring this (crisis) to an end is also asking the Venezuelan people to suffer,"" Tillerson said. 
Venezuela's crude oil sales to the United States in 2017 were the lowest since 1991, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data, hurt by sanctions on the OPEC nation.

Citing sources, Reuters reported last June that the Trump administration was considering sanctions on Venezuela's energy sector, including state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], responsible for most of the country's exports.

The number of oil rigs operating in the US rose by six to 765, the highest level since Aug. 11, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes. That added to ongoing fears that rising output may weigh on oil prices as US output reached 10 million barrels per day last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.
Also adding to pressure on oil prices was dollar strength on nonfarm payrolls data showing wage growth improved, fueling expectation for a faster pace of rate hikes then is currently priced in with some analysts expecting the Federal Reserve’s “dot plots,” to show four rate increases for this year rather than the current three rate hikes.

The bank said it expects Brent-WTI differential for the second half of 2018 to 2019 to widen to $5.50 a barrel, citing risks of further widening this year. This, in turn, could reaffirm demand for crude oil exports, leading to tighter oil inventories.

Wage growth met expectations rising 0.3%, and was revised upward to 0.3% for December.
Signs of faster wage growth will be welcomed by the Federal Reserve as it has long held the belief that tighter labor markets would spur wage growth, leading to a faster pace of inflation. Analysts on Friday appeared to endorse Fed’s stance on tighter labor markets boosting inflation, as they revised upward their forecast for both inflation and the number of rate hikes for the year.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude March contract was down $1.05 or about 1.55% at $64.77 a barrel by 04:00 a.m. ET (08:00 GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London lost $1.30 cents or about 1.88% to $68.35 a barrel.
Oil prices were boosted after a report on Wednesday by the Energy Information Administration showed strong U.S. demand for gasoline and distillates along with weekly declines in domestic supplies of the petroleum products.
However, the EIA also said that U.S. crude supplies rose 6.8 million barrels last week, which marked the first increase in 11 weeks.
The report added that U.S. crude oil production edged up by 41,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.919 million bpd, the highest level since the early 1970s and close to the output of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Analysts and traders have recently warned that U.S. shale oil producers could ramp up production as they look to take advantage of higher prices, potentially derailing OPEC's effort to curb excess supply.
Oil prices were also supported after a Reuters survey on Thursday showed that adherence by producers included in the OPEC deal to curb supply rose to 138% from 137% in December.

419,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2018 09:55AM ET</span>",Texas shale challenges North Sea crude as world oil benchmark,"By Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Surging shale oil production in Texas and North Dakota is being felt on trading desks in Chicago, Houston and New York, where a brisk business in West Texas Intermediate crude futures is far outpacing contracts for London-based Brent crude.
As the United States approaches a record 10.04 million barrels of daily production, trading volumes of so-called ""WTI"" futures exceeded volumes of Brent crude in 2017 by the largest margin in at least seven years.
A decade ago, falling domestic production and a U.S. ban on exports meant that WTI served mostly as a proxy for U.S. inventory levels.
""There was a time when the U.S. was disconnected from the global market,"" said Greg Sharenow, portfolio manager at PIMCO, who co-manages more than $15 billion in commodity assets.
Two changes drove the resurgence of the U.S. benchmark. One was the boom in shale production, which spawned a multitude of small producers that sought to hedge profits by trading futures contracts. Then two years ago, the United States ended its 40-year ban on crude exports, making WTI more useful to global traders and shippers.
(For an interactive graphic detailing the global impacts of the U.S. shale revolution, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2EtJgen)
U.S. exports averaged 1.1 million barrels a day through November 2017, rising to an average 1.6 million bpd in the final three months. That compares to just 590,000 bpd in 2016.
As U.S. production and exports grow, global firms that increasingly buy U.S. oil are offsetting their exposure by trading in U.S. financial markets. That also gives U.S. shale producers more opportunity to lock in profits on their own production.
RIVAL EXCHANGES, SHIFTING PROFITS
The U.S. boom has reignited a competition over oil trading that began in the 1980s between two of the world's biggest exchange operators - Intercontinental Exchange, and the New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, which was acquired by Chicago-based CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) in 2008.
For ICE and CME, energy represents the second-biggest source of revenue, trailing only stocks and interest rate trading, respectively. ICE is based in Atlanta, but is known for its European contracts after it bought London’s International Petroleum Exchange and its Brent futures contract in 2001. 
About 310 million U.S. crude futures contracts - worth about $16 trillion in oil - changed hands on CME's New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) in 2017, far more than the about 242 million contracts in Intercontinental Exchange's Brent crude futures.
Energy products including WTI brought in $790 million in revenue for CME in 2016, the latest annual data available. Brent crude futures and options alone contributed nearly $300 million to ICE's revenues in 2016.
Since 2011, trading volumes in WTI futures have risen by about 135 million contracts, compared to an increase of about 109 million in Brent, according to exchange data. 
CME has said there is a ""clear trend"" that the U.S. benchmark is being used more globally, in part because of growing production there and relatively stagnant output of the North Sea crude grades that underpin Brent trading.
That makes investors more likely to trade in WTI than Brent, said Owain Johnson, managing director of energy research and product development at CME.
""You know more about what WTI will look like in the next five years,"" he said.
Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive at ICE, dismissed the notion that WTI's global influence is rising versus Brent, calling it ""a red herring.""
EXPORT SURGE LURES BUYERS
The increasing liquidity in U.S. oil futures stems partly from the surge in hedging by domestic shale producers but also from growing overseas interest, which pushed outstanding contracts to new records in 2017. 
Average daily volumes in WTI futures from outside the U.S. jumped nearly 40 percent in 2017 over 2016, according to CME Group data. Foreign participation in WTI now represents about 30 percent of CME's average daily volume.
""The U.S. is reclaiming the title of being arguably the world's most relevant crude oil benchmark"" because of rising U.S. exports and production, said Michael Tran, director of energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
Purchasers worldwide say the U.S. contract may have to change, however, to reflect the price at export hubs such as Houston. Currently, WTI contracts are tied to oil deliverable at the landlocked storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma.
More supply is coming to Gulf Coast ports from Texas, where production is now near 4 million barrels a day.
""We need a new benchmark for pricing American crude oil for export to Asia and other areas,"" said Chen Bo, president of Chinese state oil trader Unipec, at an industry event in Houston in November.
Unipec is the trading arm of refiner Sinopec and the largest buyer of U.S. oil in Asia; Chinese firms bought an average of 220,000 barrels a day of U.S. crude last year. 
Sources with two major trading firms said CME has approached them to gauge demand for a benchmark futures contract that would have Houston as its delivery point.
In December 2017, the NYMEX introduced a new contract aimed at the growing market of Asian buyers importing U.S. crude, such as China, the second biggest importer in 2017. The contract prices the spread between WTI and Middle-East benchmark Dubai.
The contract allows Asian refiners to better evaluate the economics of U.S. crude compared to oil elsewhere, Chen said.
The dominance of Europe's Brent and America's WTI crude futures comes despite Asia's growing share of global oil consumption, up from 27 percent in 2000 to almost 40 percent today. Europe's and North America's share of demand has declined.
A key reason for the Middle East's and Asia's failure to create an oil futures benchmark is that financial commodity trading is not well established in either region.
Middle Eastern producers are largely state-owned, and while the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) was set up in 2007 to establish a new benchmark, it has so far not managed to attract enough liquidity to dominate the region.
In China, a long-delayed futures contract is expected to be launched by Shanghai’s INE exchange this year, with the stated goal of becoming Asia’s benchmark. But wrangling over details has undermined INE's credibility, analysts say.

That's left the United States, with its established commodity markets, operating as ""the Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) of the oil market,"" Tran said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several key commodities traders are leaving  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), sources said on Wednesday, the latest wrinkle as the Wall Street firm seeks to turn around its struggling commodities unit.
Those leaving include Don Casturo, operating chief of global commodities; Saad Usmani, a London-based managing director who traded crude oil and natural gas; Rahul Dhir, who traded refined oil products; and Will Evans, a global franchise manager, according to people familiar with the matter, and a Jan. 30 memo announcing Casturo's departure seen by Reuters. 
The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. 
While Goldman posted its first quarterly loss since 2011 of $4.4 billion due to changes to the U.S. tax law passed by Congress in December, analysts and investors have been closely watching the decline of its trading book. 
Commodities trading was the main driver of a 30 percent decline in Goldman's broader bond trading business last year, Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez said on Jan. 17.
Goldman hired several new senior traders late last year to turn around the business and replace people like Greg Agran, who left as co-head of commodities trading in September after 26 years with the bank.
Departures at banks are common at this time of year after traders wait to receive their bonus payout. With lower trading revenues across the industry in the fourth quarter and full year, recruiters said that many would be getting lower payouts for 2017 payments.
Sources said previously that managers in Goldman's commodities trading unit had warned some staff to expect little to no bonus.
The bank has been working reduce risk and manage assets that were hurting results toward the end of 2017, CFO Chavez added in the earnings call earlier this month. Goldman is focused on catering to clients rather than placing bets on price moves, he added, noting that trends are hard to predict.
""I remember when I was in that business and people would ask me, 'What do you think about the outlook for oil prices?"" he said. ""I would say, accurately but perhaps not all that helpfully, 50 percent chance they go up and a 50 percent chance they would go down.""
Commodity trading firms and banks posted major losses in 2017 due to muted client activity and volatility in energy markets. A number of firms suffered heavy losses in the first half of the last year after the slide in natural gas prices, while others lost money in the second half due to swings in oil prices during Hurricane Harvey, analysts said.
Last week, Jamison Capital Partners LP, a $1.5 billion commodity hedge fund, told investors it was closing by the end of January. It follows other big names that have closed in recent months, including Andy Hall's Astenbeck Capital Management and Texas tycoon T. Boone Pickens 
Goldman is the only large U.S. bank that has continued trading and investing in commodities in a major way. Rivals including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) pulled back years ago after a public outcry over banks potentially influencing commodities prices, and as regulatory scrutiny increased. 
Its chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, spent the early days of his career at the bank selling gold. Casturo, the outgoing commodities operating chief, first joined Goldman in 1998. News of his departure was first reported by Bloomberg.
Among those who joined in recent months are Nitin Jindal, who became partner and head of North American natural gas and power trading, and David McKeon, formerly of Castleton Commodities International LLC, who is now a managing director and senior oil trader at Goldman.

The EIA, however, also reported that U.S. crude supplies rose 6.8 million barrels last week, which marked the first increase in 11 weeks.
The report also showed that U.S. crude oil production edged up by 41,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.919 million bpd, the highest level since the early 1970s and close to the output of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Analysts and traders have recently warned that U.S. shale oil producers could ramp up production as they look to take advantage of higher prices, potentially derailing OPEC's effort to curb excess supply.
Oil prices have risen almost 55% from around $43 a barrel in June, benefiting from production cut efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The producers agreed in December to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
In other energy trading, gasoline futures rose 0.3% to $1.900 a gallon, while heating oil added 0.4% to $2.073 a gallon.
Natural gas futures sank 5.8 cents, or 2%, to $2.937 per million British thermal units, as traders looked ahead to weekly storage data due later in the global day amid expectations for a withdrawal of 104 billion cubic feet.

Comex gold futures were a touch lower at $1,343.10 a troy ounce by 3:15AM ET (0815GMT).
At Fed Chair Janet Yellen's last policy meeting as head of the central bank, the Fed announced it was holding rates steady, a move that was widely expected, but said inflation is likely to rise this year.
Those comments signaled that borrowing costs will continue to climb under incoming central bank chief Jerome Powell.
The majority of economists believe that the U.S. central bank will hike rates in March, followed by another hike in June, with a third move higher arriving in December.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding nonyielding bullion.
The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against six rivals, was a shade higher at 89.05, remaining above last week’s low of 88.25, its weakest level since December 2014.
Treasury yields pushed higher, with the benchmark 10-year note running up to the highest level in almost four years at around 2.75%.
Besides the Fed, there is a batch of data on today's economic calendar, including weekly jobless claims figures and a report on fourth-quarter productivity and labor costs at 8:30AM ET (1330GMT). There is also manufacturing PMI at 9:45AM ET (1445GMT) and both ISM manufacturing data and construction data at 10AM ET (1500GMT).

TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices extended modest gains on Thursday as OPEC's strong compliance with a supply reduction pact offset news that U.S. production topped 10 million barrels per day for the first time in nearly half a century.
NYMEX crude for March delivery rose 14 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $64.87 a barrel by 0558 GMT, after ending the last session up 0.4 percent.
London Brent crude for April delivery was up 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $69.04, after settling up 3 cents in the previous session.
U.S. crude oil production in November surpassed 10 million barrels per day for the first time since 1970, and neared the all-time output record, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.
""As oil prices rise, higher shale output is definitely on the market's mind,"" said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting in Tokyo. 
Oil output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also rose in January from an eight-month low as higher output from Nigeria and Saudi Arabia offset a further decline in Venezuela and strong compliance with a supply reduction pact, a Reuters survey found. 
However, adherence by producers included in the deal to curb supply rose to 138 percent from 137 percent in December, the poll found, suggesting commitment is not wavering even as oil prices hit their highest level since 2014.
""OPEC nations realize that lower production would buoy oil prices and that it's better for them,"" Akuta added. 
Oil prices are unlikely to advance much above $70 a barrel in 2018, with the market caught between the opposing forces of OPEC-led production cuts and surging U.S. output, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
Oil prices initially slipped on Wednesday after U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed that U.S. crude inventories rose by 6.8 million barrels last week, after 10 straight weeks of declines. [EIA/S]
But prices rebounded on the back of a surprise 2 million-barrel drawdown in gasoline stocks, helping push up gasoline futures.
Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 1.9 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.5 million-barrel drop, the EIA data also showed.

Kuwait Petroleum Corp expects to spend over $500 billion as it boosts its crude oil production capacity to 4.75 million barrels per day in 2040, the national oil firm said on Wednesday.

The Caixin/Markit China manufacturing PMI for January came in at 51.5, meeting an expected steady reading of 51.5 seen on Thursday. On Wednesday, the official manufacturing PMI came in at 51.3, below the 51.5 seen and the 51.6 level in December.
The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, keeping them in a range between 1.25% - 1.50%.
The Federal Reserve signalled that it would push ahead on its monetary policy tightening path as economic activity has been rising at a solid rate, while inflation remained low but is expected to ""move up"" in the coming months.
""The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong,"" The Federal Reserve noted in its monetary policy statement. ""Inflation on a 12‑month basis is expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.""
The somewhat upbeat outlook on inflation comes as data on Monday showed that the Core PCE Price Index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, rose 1.5% in December.
Overnight, gold prices eased from session highs on Wednesday. Gold is sensitive to rising U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – fell by 1.980 million barrels, confounding expectations for a build of 1.877 million barrels, while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – unexpectedly fell by 1.940 million barrels, a steeper fall than the 1.454 million barrels expected.
The sharp build in US oil supplies come as the spread between WTI crude and Brent continues to tighten, lessening demand for domestic crude exports, leading to a build in crude stockpiles.
U.S. crude production rose to 10.04 million barrels a day set in November 1970, according to data released by EIA on Wednesday. That level brings the US closer to world's top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia.

438,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2018 06:27PM ET</span>",A modern land run? Trump move opens Utah to mining claims under 1872 law,"By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw federal protections from millions of acres of Utah wilderness will reopen much of the iconic terrain to gold, silver, copper, and uranium land claims under a Wild West-era mining law, according to federal officials.
Starting at 6 a.m. on Feb. 2 – the moment Trump’s proclamation reducing the size of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments takes effect – private citizens and companies will be allowed to stake claims for hard rock mining in a process governed by the General Mining Law of 1872, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.
The process for staking a claim remains much as it did during the Gold Rush: A prospector hammers four poles into the ground corresponding to the four points of a parcel that can be as big as 20 acres, and attaches a written description of the claim onto one of them. A prospector then has 30 days to record the claim at the local BLM office.
""We're working on getting information and new monument maps ready for people interested in claims,"" said Utah Bureau of Land Management spokesman Michael Richardson.
The costs of claiming are low: a $212 filing fee, and an annual maintenance fee of $150. The claims provide prospectors mineral rights, with no requirement to pay the government royalties, but not ownership of the land.
The law covers mining for uranium, gold, silver, copper and other precious metals, but excludes coal and petroleum. 
URANIUM RUSH? MAYBE NOT
Conservation groups including the Southeastern Utah Wilderness Alliance are concerned that new prospecting in the area could cause environmental harm, but it's unclear whether the rare opportunity to stake mining claims will draw much interest.
The Bears Ears area is known to have uranium deposits, but prices are currently in the dumps - at around $25 a pound compared with $130 a decade ago - due to weak domestic demand from nuclear reactors.
Kyle Kimmerle, whose family owns more than 100 uranium mining claims in Utah, said he won't be rushing out for new land. 
""The current price of uranium is not likely to warrant any new claiming,"" he said. ""It would take $60-$70 for me.""
U.S.-based uranium mining companies Energy Fuels (A:UUUU) and Ur-Energy (A:URG) - both of which are pressing the White House for limits on uranium imports - also said they were not currently planning to run out into the Utah wilderness with poles to stake claims.
Energy Fuels wrote a letter in May asking the administration to adjust the monument’s boundaries to accommodate its existing operations and said there were “many other known uranium and vanadium deposits located within the [original boundaries] that could provide valuable energy and mineral resources in the future.” 
A spokesman for Energy Fuels said Wednesday that the company has no intention of mining in any of the re-opened land and that its request to adjust boundaries would not have opened up new mining sites.
When Trump announced his decision to shrink the monuments in December, he billed it as a victory for local governments against what he called abusive federal overreach on western lands.
""Families and communities of Utah know and love this land the best, and you know the best how to take care of your land and how to conserve this land,"" he said at the time. 
The administration has denied that it intended to boost drilling or mining in the region, a policy it has pursued on other federally protected lands.
The decision reduced the size of the 1.3-million-acre (0.5 million hectare) Bears Ears monument, created by President Barack Obama in 2016, by more than 80 percent. It slashed the 1.9-million-acre (768,900-hectare) Grand Staircase-Escalante monument, designated by President Bill Clinton in 1996, in half.
Republican Congressman John Curtis of Utah has since proposed legislation to withdraw all of Bears Ears region from future mining claims. But any claim submitted under the General Mining law before the legislation passes would be honored, Curtis' spokeswoman Katie Thompson said.
Democratic Congressman Raul Grijalva of Arizona has urged quicker action, pressing Republican colleagues to ask the Interior Department to block mining claims sooner.
""If we’re serious about preventing mining and drilling in Bears Ears, the administration needs to take concrete action now,” Grijalva said this week.

Conservation groups and Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico, have long criticized the General Mining law as out-of-date.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) snapped up nine of 19 oil and gas blocks awarded in Mexico's prized Gulf of Mexico deep waters, emerging the clear winner in the country's biggest auction since the energy sector was opened up to foreign oil firms.
The stakes are high for Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and his ruling party, which is keen to showcase the results of the liberalization ahead of a presidential election in July.
Shell focused on blocks in the Perdido and Salina basins, which were expected to be the most competitive of the 29 areas on offer in the auction. Perdido is close to U.S. waters where oil firms already operate.
(Graphic on the blocks: http://tmsnrt.rs/2DGpgnB)
Shell won four blocks as a lone bidder, four more in a consortium with Qatar Petroleum and another in a consortium with Mexican state oil firm Pemex.
""This is excellent news for Mexico and is a strong commitment from Shell in Mexico. We are a big player in deep water worldwide,"" said Alberto de la Fuente, president of Shell Mexico. 
Shell would spend more than the minimum investment it pledged in the bids, he said, but declined to give further details. Shell was operating in Mexico before the auction. The firm won a block in an earlier sale in Mexico's shallow waters in 2017 and has a chain of 30 gas stations in Mexico, he said.
PC Carigali, a unit of Malaysia's state oil firm Petronas, won six blocks. The firm won in consortia for four blocks and alone for two more.
""We're in, we want to explore and we want to find oil and gas,"" said Faisal Bakar, Carigali's country manager in Mexico. 
Carigali also participated in winning bids for two deep water fields in an earlier auction. 
Qatar Petroleum participated in winning consortia in five blocks.
Ten blocks received no bids, so were not awarded.
For a full list of winners and bidders, see.
OIL PRICE HELPS
With oil prices (CLc1) (LCOc1) near a three-year high, energy firms are emerging from a recession. They have more cash now than at any time since 2014, so conditions are better than they were for any of the eight auctions Mexico has held since 2015.
The higher oil price helped Shell to put in solid bids, de la Fuente said.
Shell was also a big winner in an oil auction for blocks in Brazil's deepwater in October, snapping up three blocks in the presalt region in the country's Atlantic waters.
Mexico faces stiff competition from Brazil and other regional rivals keen to attract cash from global oil majors. Argentina, Uruguay and Ecuador are also auctioning oil and gas fields this year.
Pena Nieto's 2013 energy reform was his highest-profile economic initiative, aimed at attracting hundreds of billions of dollars of investment to turn around a state-run oil industry in decline. The results of previous auctions to attract foreign investment were mixed.
Firms that won in the previous auctions have pledged investments of $61 billion. But Mexico needs 10 times that amount to raise oil output back to 2004 levels, the country's Energy Secretary Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said on Tuesday.
Some of the firms that won in previous auctions have made big finds, adding over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent to reserves.

Mexico is expected to hold its first shale oil and gas auction by the end of 2018, the head of the country's oil regulator said on Wednesday, potentially opening up one of the world's top reserves of unconventional energy.

That was the first increase following ten straight weeks of declines and compared with analysts' expectations for a much more modest gain of around 0.1 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 2.22 million barrels last week, the EIA said.

Front-month U.S. natural gas futures tumbled 13.0 cents, or around 4.1%, to $3.065 per million British thermal units (btu) by 9:10AM ET (1410GMT), after hitting a three-week low of $3.022 earlier in the session.
The commodity rose almost 0.9% on Tuesday as traders reacted to a blast of cold weather which upped demand for the heating fuel.
But fresh models released overnight showed that temperatures won't be as cold as previously expected through both the upcoming six- to 10-day and eight- to 14-day periods.
Natural gas prices typically rise during the winter months as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 90 and 110 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Jan. 26.

The U.N. and United States have introduced a wave of sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea's development of nuclear weapons, including by seeking to reduce its access to crude oil and refined petroleum products. 
""We can't lower deliveries any further,"" Russia's envoy to Pyongyang, Alexander Matzegora, was quoted by RIA as saying in an interview.
Quotas set by the U.N. allow for around 540,000 tonnes of crude oil a year to be delivered to North Korea from China, and over 60,000 tonnes of oil products from Russia, China and other countries, he was quoted as saying.
""[This] is a drop in the ocean for a country of 25 million people,"" Matzegora said.
Shortages would lead to serious humanitarian problems, he said, adding: ""Official representatives of Pyongyang have made it clear that a blockade would be interpreted by North Korea as a declaration of war, with all the subsequent consequences.""
Last week, the United States imposed further sanctions on North Korea, including on its crude oil ministry.
In his first annual State of the Union speech to the U.S. Congress on Tuesday, President Donald Trump vowed to keep up the pressure on North Korea it from developing missiles which could threaten the United States.
North Korea on Saturday condemned the latest U.S. sanctions. and Russian deputy foreign minister Igor Morgulov said Russia had no obligation to carry out sanctions produced by the U.S.

(Reuters) - Oil prices are unlikely to advance much higher than $70 a barrel in 2018, with the market caught between the opposing forces of OPEC-led production cuts and surging U.S. output, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
The survey of 34 economists and analysts forecast that Brent crude will average $62.37 a barrel in 2018, up from the $59.88 forecast in the previous monthly poll. 
""Steady demand growth, a clear commitment to supply restraint by key OPEC producer Saudi Arabia and persistent geopolitical risks will all help to keep a floor under oil prices,"" said Cailin Birch, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
""However, we expect strong production growth from the U.S., as well as some opportunistic selling by both OPEC and non-OPEC members later in the year, to prevent prices from rising much higher than $70 per barrel on average.""
Brent crude is on track for a fifth straight monthly gain, having averaged about $69 so far in January, but analysts said the rally is unlikely last beyond the first quarter.
They said U.S. production, which has risen more than 17 percent since mid-2016, could top 10 million bpd -- a level surpassed only by Saudi Arabia and Russia. 
Rahul Prithiani, director at CRISIL Research, expects oil prices to range between $62 and $67 a barrel in 2018, citing rising U.S. oil output.
Meanwhile, the world's biggest oil consuming region, Asia, has recently started to import U.S. crude and could show increased appetite to draw more shipments east, analysts said.
The higher production has paved the way for a widening gap between U.S. crude prices (WTI) and both the Brent and Dubai benchmarks, making it is cheaper for Asian countries to import U.S. crude despite high freight costs.
""As long as WTI continues to trail other regional crude benchmarks, U.S. oil should continue to find its way towards Asia,"" said Giorgos Beleris, analyst at Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. 
U.S. light crude is forecast to average $58.11 a barrel in 2018, up from the $55.78 predicted in the December poll. The contract has averaged about $63.63 thus far in 2018.
Alongside the growth in U.S. oil output, the $65-plus price environment is encouraging other non-OPEC exporters, such as Brazil and Canada, to ramp up production through new projects. 
Analysts said it was too early to predict whether OPEC would make changes to the duration of the pact to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day, which is due to expire at the end of this year.
""The output-cut agreement is unlikely to be extended beyond 2018 in its present form as the market will rebalance this year,"" said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy's Global Gas Analytics in London.
""Nevertheless, calls to formulate an exit strategy from the deal will gather pace. This, in turn, could see a gradual withdrawal from the agreement in 2019.""

The poll forecast Brent crude to average $61.62 in the fourth quarter and $61.29 in 2019.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended Jan. 26 at 10:30AM ET (1530GMT).
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories rose by nearly 3.2 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a more modest increase of around 0.1 million barrels.
The API report also showed a gain of 2.6 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks, which include motor diesel and heating oil, fell by about 4.0 million barrels.
There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures slumped 44 cents, or 0.7%, to $64.06 a barrel by 3:45AM ET (0845GMT), its lowest level in around a week. On Tuesday, the U.S. benchmark fell $1.06, or 1.6%, to $64.50 a barrel.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., declined 42 cents, or roughly 0.6%, to $68.10 a barrel, after losing 68 cents, or 1%, a day earlier.
Oil prices ended lower on Tuesday, pulling further away from their strongest levels since late 2014, as traders weighed a steady increase in U.S. output against OPEC's ongoing efforts to drain the market of excess supplies.
Analysts and traders have recently warned that U.S. shale oil producers could ramp up production as they look to take advantage of higher prices, potentially derailing OPEC's effort to curb excess supply.
Oil prices have risen almost 55% from around $43 a barrel in June, benefiting from production cut efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The producers agreed in December to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
In other energy trading, gasoline futures dropped 0.2% to $1.851 a gallon, while heating oil shed 0.4% to $2.059 a gallon.
Natural gas futures sank 13.5 cents, or 4.3%, to $3.059 per million British thermal units, as updated weather forecasting models called for milder weather, which should dampen demand for the heating fuel.

The dollar saw renewed selling pressure, falling almost 0.4% against a basket of six major currencies to 88.68 in early trade and sliding back towards its weakest level since Dec. 2014.
Treasury yields eased down after running up to their highest level in almost four years, with the benchmark 10-year note dipping to 2.699%.
The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged. Investors, however, will be focusing on the central bank's policy statement for hints on the monetary policy outlook.
The majority of economists believe that the U.S. central bank will hike rates in March, followed by another hike in June, with a third move higher arriving in December.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding nonyielding bullion.
Besides the Fed, investors also looked ahead to key U.S. economic data due later in the session for fresh clues on the likely trajectory of monetary policy in the months ahead.
The highlight of Wednesday's economic calendar will be the ADP jobs report at 8:15AM ET (1315GMT), which is often seen as a warmup act for the big Friday government nonfarm payrolls report.
There is also the Chicago PMI survey at 9:45AM ET (1345GMT) and a report on pending home sales at 10AM ET (1400GMT).
Financial markets showed a limited reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, at which he called on Republicans and Democrats to work towards a compromise over immigration and infrastructure legislation.
In other metals action, palladium prices inched up 0.5% to $1,057.60 an ounce. It slumped to a five-week low at $1,047.00 in the previous session.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices fell for a third day on Wednesday after data from an industry body showed crude stocks rose more than expected last week, while a selloff in other commodities, stocks and bonds added to investors' bearish mood. 
Brent crude, the global benchmark, was down 0.69 cents, or about 1 percent, at $68.33 a barrel by 0244 GMT, a nearly two-week low.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were down, 67 cents, or 1 percent, at $63.83, after falling to its weakest level in more than a week.
On Tuesday, U.S. crude fell 1.6 percent to close at $64.50 a barrel, the contract's decline far outpacing a 0.6 percent drop in the price of Brent.
""Increasing concerns over the rising U.S. production continue to mount pressure on the commodity,"" said Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments. ""Over the past couple of years, U.S. producers have gained significant inroads in the global oil market industry,"" he said.
Prices on both WTI and Brent are still on track for a fifth month of gains.
But the report from the American Petroleum Institute late on Tuesday showing crude stocks rose by 3.2 million barrels last week cast a further bearish pall over the market. [API/S]

Overnight, WTI crude oil prices settled lower on Tuesday as traders appeared to unwind some their bullish bets.
Concerns over a potential rise in US oil supplies come as traders fear that narrowing spreads between WTI crude and Brent may have dampened demand for US crude exports, leading to a build in crude stockpiles.
Also adding to negative sentiment on oil prices were expectations that US crude production could soon hit an unprecedented 10 million barrels per day (bpd) as the number of oil rigs rose sharply last week, pointing to a potential ramp up in production.
US crude production reached 9.88 million barrels a day last week, the highest since 1983, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Offsetting the rise in US production has been ongoing production curbs from major oil producers - as part of the OPEC-led output cut agreement- and higher oil demand growth amid strong global economic momentum. Yet, some fear that the rise in US oil production may dampen OPEC and other major oil producers' resolve to remain in strong compliance with the accord to curb output.

Front-month U.S. natural gas futures jumped 8.0 cents, or around 2.5%, to $3.245 per million British thermal units (btu) by 8:30AM ET (1330GMT).
The commodity sank to as low as $3.038 on Monday as traders reacted to updated weather forecasting models which called for milder weather.
But fresh models released overnight show a wide swath of below-average temperatures encompassing the bulk of the central and eastern US through both the upcoming six- to 10-day and eight- to 14-day periods.
Natural gas prices typically rise during the winter months as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 90 and 110 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Jan. 26.
That compares with a decline of 288 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 87 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 160 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.296 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 519 bcf, or around 18.4%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 486 bcf, or roughly 17.5%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
A recent blast of cold weather across parts of the U.S. over the past few weeks has resulted in unusually strong storage withdrawals for natural gas, bringing storage levels to the low end of a five-year range.

462,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 02:22AM ET</span>","Coal firms plead to courts, Trump for West Coast export terminals","By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The ailing U.S. coal industry is ramping up its political and legal offensive to win approval for West Coast export terminals that could provide a lifeline to lucrative Asia markets.
Coal producers filed two recent lawsuits against governments in Washington state and California challenging local decisions to block port projects on environmental grounds. The industry is also lobbying the Trump administration to override the local bans.
The fight reflects the sector’s desperation to boost exports as U.S. utilities continue their shift away from coal-fired power - despite Trump policies aimed at helping miners. 
The proposed port projects are crucial to industry growth, said Hal Quinn, president of the National Mining Association. 
""It’s worth fighting these battles,"" he said.
The strategy could be a long-shot. Courts have tended in the past to side with local authorities in similar cases, and the administration’s policy options for forcing coal infrastructure on unwilling local governments remain unclear.
Officials at the White House and Department of Energy did not respond to requests for comment. 
The coal industry has eyed the West Coast as a gateway to the global market for years, with plans for as many as seven terminals on the books a decade ago. But five of those projects were canceled amid volatile Asian demand and bitter opposition in left-leaning California, Washington, and Oregon.
45 NEW COAL PLANTS
Coal producers are fighting for the remaining two proposed projects – in Oakland, California and Longview, Washington - and have filed two recent lawsuits, including one this month, amid rising coal demand in Japan, China and Korea.
""There are 45 new coal plants planned or under construction in Japan alone,"" said Rick Curtsinger, a spokesman for Colorado-based Cloud Peak, which mines in Montana and Wyoming.
(For a graphic showing U.S. coal exports to North Asia, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2E3LZuJ)
Earlier this month, the company announced a deal to export coal from a Montana mine to two new coal gasification power plants in Fukushima, Japan, site of the 2011 nuclear accident.
But growth from such deals is constrained because the only West Coast coal export facility in North America - in British Columbia, Canada - is near full capacity.
Coal buyers in Japan and South Korea confirmed they would welcome more U.S. shipments. Japan’s JERA utility sees the U.S. as a key to diversifying its fuel sources, said spokesman Tsuyoshi Shiraishi.
An official with a South Korean power utility, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: ""The popularity of U.S. coal is rising among utilities in South Korea"" because of relatively low prices.
Even with the bottlenecks, coal exports rose more than 60 percent in the first five months of 2017, driven by temporary supply disruptions from Australia and depressed prices for U.S. coal. 
Shipments to Europe rose about a third, to 16 million tons, compared to the same period in 2016, according to U.S. Department of Energy data. Exports to Asia doubled, to 12.3 million tons, over the same period. 
COURT BATTLE
This month in Oakland, attorneys for coal export terminal developer Phil Tagami and leading Utah coal producer Bowie Resources kicked off hearings in federal court over their proposed project. They argued the city council had used flawed scientific data to justify its unanimous 2016 decision to ban coal exports from the city.
That study concluded that dust emissions from coal transport would threaten local health. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says excessive exposure to coal dust can cause black lung and other respiratory problems. 
The coal industry’s lawyers countered that the study examined the wrong kind of coal and ignored state-of-the-art anti-dust technologies.
The city has so far spent more than a million dollars in legal fees to keep Utah coal out of Oakland ports, said Oakland Council Member Dan Kalb.
""I am saddened they are continuing to fight,"" he said.
A decision in the suit could come within weeks.
Meanwhile, Lighthouse Resources, the developer of the proposed Millennium coal export terminal in Washington state, filed another federal lawsuit earlier this month against the governor and state regulators.
Washington had denied a permit for the project last year citing worries about rail safety, air pollution and noise pollution. 
The company argues the state is obstructing the commerce of other states where the coal is mined and that only the federal government can regulate such interstate commerce.
Michael Greve, a law professor at George Mason University, said the plaintiffs would have to prove that Washington is favoring its own economic interests over those of other states - a tough standard to meet, particularly in a case involving an environmental ban.
In 2011, a Colorado court rejected a similar legal argument made by the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, which advocates for fossil fuels. The institute had challenged a state law requiring investor-owned utilities to obtain 30 percent of their generation from renewable sources.
The coal industry, meanwhile, is pushing the White House and Congress for policy solutions – potentially through an infrastructure spending package – to make it easier to open export terminals over local objections, said Quinn, of the National Mining Association.
Others want the administration to weigh in on the interstate commerce argument.
“The administration can have some influence if the opposition drifts into an area where it is treading on federal authority,” said Bud Clinch, director of the Montana Coal Council.
Last fall, Energy Department Deputy Secretary Dan Brouillette floated the idea of using the U.S. Federal Power Act to supersede state efforts to block gas pipelines. 
""We can’t stop a state legislature and a governor from doing what they think is in their self-interest,"" he said during an event at the National Petroleum Council. ""But these are interstate industries.""

463,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2018 01:50AM ET</span>","Pemex woes, presidential race stall Mexican oil joint ventures","By Ana Isabel Martinez and Adriana Barrera
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico will likely have trouble finding international oil firms willing to partner with state-owned Pemex due to hefty fees, low oil prices and uncertainty ahead of a presidential election in July, a blow to efforts to reform the energy sector and boost government revenue. 
The government of President Enrique Pena Nieto enacted a wide-ranging reform in 2013-2014 to encourage foreign investment and end the slide in oil output to multi-year lows. The reform ended Pemex's 75-year monopoly over the energy sector, which is one of the key generators of revenue for the government. 
Mexico has opened oil and gas exploration and production to foreign investors, as well as fuel retail in Latin America’s second-largest economy. 
On Wednesday, Mexico will auction 29 areas in the Gulf of Mexico, the biggest chunk of oil and gas wealth on offer since the reform. The rights were offered to companies including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and China National Offshore Oil Corp, without obliging them to tie up with Pemex.
However, Pemex is struggling to achieve another of the reform's goals - luring foreign oil firms to develop what were considered potentially lucrative oil fields at two offshore sites.
Foreign oil firms saw the cost for buying into the joint ventures as high, officials and oil executives said, because the fees include a share of what Pemex has already spent in exploring oil and gas at those fields.
Fully transferring exploration costs incurred by the inefficient state-run oil company put the profitability of such partnerships at risk and has been the main obstacle to finding partners, along with the opacity of Pemex's accounts, the sources said. 
""Pemex is well known for inefficiency,"" said an executive from a firm that participated in several auctions in Mexico, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
After the two failed joint ventures, Pemex has tempered its expectations for the year. Six months ago Pemex was considering 160 onshore and offshore areas for development. Now just seven more modest onshore projects are planned for such partnerships in the states of Veracruz, Chiapas and Tabasco, according to company statements. 
Most of those seven projects are expected to be offered in late spring and awarded at the end of 2018, said Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of Mexican oil regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH).Falling production and low oil prices mean Pemex is dealing with budget cuts that limit funds for exploration and production and it faces growing competition from private companies lured to Mexico by the energy overhaul. 
As a result, Pemex would consider it a success to find partners for several of its shallow water and onshore projects, which require less investment, said a senior executive at the company, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
At the same time, industry officials say, the government must be mindful that offering up potentially lucrative tie-ups to international oil majors might favor the nationalist platform of election front-runner, opposition contender Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. 
Though he has moderated his rhetoric about the oil reform somewhat the leftist Lopez Obrador has said he would review the contracts issued by the current government. Industry executives worry that a Lopez Obrador government could at least slow the pace of the energy reform.
REGULATION 
In an early success, in 2016, Australia's BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) partnered with Pemex on the $11 billion Trion deepwater project. The Mexican company also found partners for two onshore projects in the southern state Tabasco. 
But Pemex subsequently failed to find partners on its Ayin-Batsil shallow water development and the Nobilis-Maximino deepwater project, whose tender was canceled in December due to lack of interest.
Red tape was an obstacle to executing the joint ventures more quickly, a Pemex source said. Management changes, including the departure of Chief Executive Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya, have slowed decision making, said a consultant who works with private oil companies on Pemex tie ups.
TIME TO CHANGE? 
The cancellation of the Nobilis-Maximino farmout was a blow to Pemex. Close to oil infrastructure near the U.S. maritime border, and believed to contain hundreds of millions of barrels, the project would have been its second biggest farmout after Trion. 
Low oil prices, geological complexity and competition from Brazil for the same investors impacted the sale, officials from Pemex, the oil industry and Mexico's regulator said. 
Pemex said it would relaunch the project when market conditions improved. 
Prospective partners in joint ventures have no means to review Pemex's finances to evaluate whether the costs are reasonable, unlike Brazil's Petrobras, which has an ""open book"" policy.
Industry experts say it will be difficult for the company to attract more partners without changing this.
""Nobody is going to give Mexico money without open books,"" said the executive from a firm that participated in several auctions in Mexico, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Pemex calculated $815 million in exploration costs - known as the ""carry"" - incurred in Nobilis-Maximino. The sum was later cut to $632 million at the request of companies interested in bidding. Pemex also had to lower its requirements for Trion. 
""Pemex has learnt valuable lessons from the two rounds that did not turn out as expected,"" Mexico's deputy energy minister Aldo Flores told reporters earlier this month at a conference. 

""It's doing its job to adjust them and make its offer more competitive.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday for a second day as rising U.S. output and a strengthening dollar sapped demand for crude, pushing Brent below $70 a barrel.
Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, declined 33 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $69.13 a barrel at 0331 GMT. The contract for March delivery settled down $1.06, or 1.5 percent, at $69.46 a barrel on Monday.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures dropped 47 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $65.09 a barrel. On Monday, they fell 58 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $65.56.
Prices are still heading for a fifth straight monthly gain.
""Markets remain fragile to the downside,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore, citing a jump in the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States.
U.S. production is already on par with Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Only Russia produces more, averaging 10.98 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017.
U.S. output has jumped more than 17 percent since mid-2016 and is expected to exceed 10 million bpd soon.
Drillers in the U.S. added 12 oil rigs for new production in the week to Jan. 26, Baker Hughes reported on Friday.
The recent rally in oil prices had been fueled by the U.S. dollar's six straight weekly slides. The greenback is down 3 percent so far this month. 
Oil is priced in the U.S. currency, so a falling dollar can boost demand for crude from buyers using other currencies.
The dollar index had been below $90 since Jan. 24, falling below $89 on Friday. But the currency has rebounded since then to around $89.37, which has weighed on crude prices.
Investors are bracing ""for the upcoming refinery maintenance season amid a strong USD,"" ANZ Research said in a note, which also pointed to rising inventories as U.S. shale producers continue their battle with OPEC.
Crude prices may also be under pressure on expectations for U.S. inventories to rise for the first time in 11 weeks, according to a preliminary poll by Reuters on Monday.

Front-month U.S. natural gas futures slumped 9.2 cents, or around 2.9%, to $3.083 per million British thermal units (btu) by 8:00AM ET (1300GMT).
The commodity soared about 10% last week, as traders reacted to a blast of cold weather which upped demand for the heating fuel.
Natural gas prices typically rise during the winter months as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
But updated weather models released over the weekend showed that the western, central, and southern parts of the country will be milder than normal through Feb. 11, as high pressure dominates.
The northeast will remain cold, but with brief milder breaks between weather systems.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 90 and 110 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Jan. 26.
That compares with a decline of 288 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 87 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 160 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.296 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 519 bcf, or around 18.4%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 486 bcf, or roughly 17.5%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
A recent blast of cold weather across parts of the U.S. over the past few weeks has resulted in unusually strong storage withdrawals for natural gas, bringing storage levels to the low end of a five-year range.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil eased below $70 a barrel on Monday as rising U.S. output undermined efforts led by OPEC and Russia to tighten supplies, but prices were still on track for their strongest start to the year in five years.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were down 64 cents at $69.88 a barrel by 1130 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were down 36 cents at $65.78 a barrel.
So far this month, the Brent has risen by 6.3 percent, making this its biggest rise in January since 2013.
A key driver has been the dollar, which has lost 3.2 percent against a basket of major currencies (DXY) so far this year, partly pushed down by suggestions from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the U.S. administration favored a weaker currency.
A falling dollar tends to support oil, which is priced in the U.S. currency, by making it cheaper for holders of other currencies.
Support has also come from a large premium in the front-month Brent oil contract over those for future delivery, as investment in crude futures and options reached a new record high last week.
""The market is bullish. One side that could correct significantly could come from the strength in the U.S. dollar,"" PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said.
""Undoubtedly, whatever the strategy is of Donald Trump and his finance ministry, they managed to support oil prices in the last week by talking the dollar down,"" he said, adding that oil prices would slip if the dollar changed direction.
Despite generally bullish sentiment, analysts said the market had been dented by rising output in North America.
""We believe that today’s oil prices project a too rosy picture, stick to our cautious view, and view the market as being at risk from profit-taking,"" Julius Baer's head of macro and commodity research Norbert Ruecker said.
U.S. output  has grown by more than 17 percent since mid-2016, reaching 9.88 million barrels per day (bpd) in mid-January. It is expected to exceed 10 million bpd soon.
U.S. energy firms added 12 drilling rigs for new production in the week to Jan. 26, taking the total to 759, Baker Hughes reported.

U.S. production is now on par with top exporter and OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia. Only Russia produces more, averaging 10.98 million bpd in 2017.

474,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2018 04:24AM ET</span>",Why Canada is the next frontier for shale oil,"By Nia Williams
CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The revolution in U.S. shale oil has battered Canada's energy industry in recent years, ending two decades of rapid expansion and job creation in the nation's vast oil sands.
Now Canada is looking to its own shale fields to repair the economic damage.
Canadian producers and global oil majors are increasingly exploring the Duvernay and Montney formations, which they say could rival the most prolific U.S. shale fields.
Canada is the first country outside the United States to see large-scale development of shale resources, which already account for 8 percent of total Canadian oil output. China, Russia and Argentina also have ample shale reserves but have yet to overcome the obstacles to full commercial development.
Canada, by contrast, offers many of the same advantages that allowed oil firms to launch the shale revolution in the United States: numerous private energy firms with appetite for risk; deep capital markets; infrastructure to transport oil; low population in regions that contain shale reserves; and plentiful water to pump into shale wells.
Together, the Duvernay and Montney formations in Canada hold marketable resources estimated at 500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, 20 billion barrels of natural gas liquids and 4.5 billion barrels of oil, according to the National Energy Board, a Canadian regulator.
""The Montney is thought to have about half the recoverable resources of the whole oil sands region, so it's formidable,"" Marty Proctor, chief executive of Calgary-based Seven Generations Energy, told Reuters in an interview.
Canada's shale output stands at about 335,000 bpd, according to energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, which forecasts output should grow to 420,000 bpd in a decade. The pace of output growth could quicken and the estimated size of the resources could rise as activity picks up and knowledge of the fields improves, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.
Seven Generations and Encana Corp, also based in Calgary, are among leading producers developing the two regions. Global majors including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) - who pulled back from the oil sands last year - are also developing Canadian shale assets.
 Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) announced its first ever Canadian shale development in the Duvernay in November. Spokesman Leif Sollid called it one of the most promising shale opportunities in North America. ConocoPhillips sees potential for the Montney to deliver significant production and cash flow to the company, executive vice president of production drilling and projects Al Hirshberg said in November.
Shell will invest more money this year in the Duvernay than any other shale field except the Permian Basin in West Texas, the most productive U.S. shale play, spokesman Cameron Yost said.
""We may learn something in the Permian that becomes applicable in the Montney, and vice versa,"" Yost said.
The oil sands boom dates back two decades, when improved technology, rising crude prices and fears of global oil shortages sparked a rush to develop the world's third-largest reserves. But in the last five years, much of that investment has migrated south as U.S. shale firms pioneered new drilling techniques and flooded global oil markets with cheaper-to-produce crude.
The oil sands currently account for two-thirds of Canada's 4.2 million barrels per day of crude. They will continue to contribute heavily to Canada's energy output because oil sands projects, once built, produce for decades. 
But the era of oil sands mega-projects will likely end with Suncor Energy's 190,000 barrel-per-day Fort Hills mining project, which started producing this month.
Canadian energy officials are now counting on shale, also known as ""tight"" oil, to lure new investment.
""Increasingly we are going to see light tight oil and liquids-rich natural gas forming a key part of Alberta's energy future,"" said Margaret McCuaig-Boyd, energy minister for the province where the oil sands and much of the nation's shale reserves are located.
A FUTURE IN FRACKING
Oil sands development drove Alberta's economic growth at a rate of 5.5 percent annually between 2010 and 2014, about twice the national rate. But the oil price crash in 2014 sent the region into a recession and has since prompted producers to scrap at least $32 billion in planned projects.
Oil sands capital spending fell for a third straight year in 2017 while other oil and gas investment rose 40 percent from 2016 to about C$31 billion, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Spending outside the oil sands is expected to grow again this year to C$33 billion, nearly three times the amount predicted for oil sands investment.
(For a graphic detailing capital spending in Canada's oil sector, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2BnxD5x) 
Hydraulic fracturing of shale oil and gas can yield quicker returns on smaller investments than extracting tar-like bitumen from the oil sands. Shale production is also less carbon-intensive, addressing a major concern among international investors reluctant to finance what environmental groups deride as the ""tar sands"".
""The last decade has been dominated by conversations about the oil sands, and people have maybe missed the opportunities"" in shale fields, Encana Chief Executive Doug Suttles told a conference in British Columbia in November. ""All these things have a much lower carbon footprint than the average barrel refined today.""
'ABSOLUTELY HUGE' POTENTIAL
The Duvernay in central Alberta is a shale play, while the Montney, straddling northern Alberta and British Columbia, is technically a formation of siltstone, a more porous rock. Drilling and extraction techniques are the same, however, and many in the industry use the term shale for both.
Drillers face challenges in both fields because of their distance from key markets, but the high potential of their reserves is unquestioned.
The Duvernay is comparable to the Eagle Ford shale field in South Texas. The Montney is unique, with its enormous gas resources and extremely thick rock formation containing several different levels at which oil and gas can be drilled, said Mike Johnson, technical leader of hydrocarbon resources for the National Energy Board.
Weak prices in an oversupplied natural gas market have hampered development, along with added costs of shipping from the far-flung fields and limited capacity on pipelines. That makes it harder to compete with producers in shale gas plays such as the Marcellus in the northeastern United States.
Meanwhile, proposed Canadian liquefied natural gas export terminals on the west coast, which were expected to provide a huge source of demand, have been canceled or stalled due to weak prices.
Such obstacles, however, have not stopped producers from staking claims in the region. Last year, Alberta oil and gas land sale prices reached levels not seen since 2014 because of a rush to buy land in the Duvernay East Shale Basin. 
""The potential is absolutely huge,"" said Mark Salkeld, president of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada. ""The only thing holding us back is access to market and the cost.""

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures inched up 19 cents, or 0.3%, from their last close to $66.33 a barrel by 3:35AM ET (0835GMT). The U.S. benchmark reached its best level since Dec. 4, 2014 at $66.66 last Thursday.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., declined 11 cents, or roughly 0.2%, to $70.04 a barrel. The contract touched $70.78 on Thursday, a level not seen since Dec. 2014.
WTI crude gained 4.4% last week, while Brent rose about 2.8%, the fifth such rise in six weeks.
Oil prices have risen almost 60% from around $43 a barrel in June, benefiting from production cut efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The producers agreed in December to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
Analysts and traders have recently warned that U.S. shale oil producers could ramp up production as they look to take advantage of higher prices, potentially derailing OPEC's effort to curb excess supply.
The number of oil drilling rigs climbed by 12 to 759 last week,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. That marked the biggest weekly increase in the rig count since March.
Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 17% since the most recent low in mid-2016, and increasing drilling activity for new production means output is expected to grow further, as producers are attracted by climbing prices.
U.S. oil production rose to 9.87 million barrels per day last week, according to government data released during the week, the highest level since the early 1970s and close to the output of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
In other energy trading, gasoline futures held steady at $1.925 a gallon, while heating oil shed 0.4% to $2.119 a gallon.
Natural gas futures sank 7.9 cents, or 2.5%, to $3.095 per million British thermal units, as updated weather forecasting models called for milder weather next week.
The commodity soared about 10% last week, as traders reacted to a blast of cold weather which upped demand for the heating fuel.

Comex gold futures slumped around $7.00, or 0.5%, from the last session's closing price to $1,345.60 a troy ounce by 2:55AM ET (0755GMT). It climbed to its highest since Aug. 2016 at $1,365.40 last Thursday.
Meanwhile, silver futures shed 10.6 cents, or 0.6%, to $17.33 a troy ounce.
The dollar index, which gauges the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, rose almost 0.3% to 89.10, extending its rebound from a three-year nadir of 88.25 set on Thursday.
The greenback fell last week following comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about how a weaker currency benefits trade. The currency later edged up after President Donald Trump said Mnuchin had been misinterpreted, but subsequently resumed its slide.
U.S. Treasuries price fell, pushing up the benchmark 10-year yield to as high as 2.708%, its loftiest level in nearly four years.
Global financial markets will focus on this week's Federal Reserve policy meeting, which will be the last under the leadership of Janet Yellen before she hands the chairmanship over to Jerome Powell.
There are also some major data releases in the coming week, as the calendar rolls to February from January, with Friday's monthly employment data in the spotlight.
The majority of economists believe that the Fed will hike rates in March, followed by another hike in June, with a third move higher arriving in December.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding nonyielding bullion.
Another headliner this week will be President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday. The theme of Trump's address will be ""building a safe, strong and proud America,"" a senior administration official told reporters on Friday.
According to the White House, the speech will focus on five main policy areas: jobs and the economy, infrastructure, immigration, trade and national security.

Last week, gold prices ended lower on Friday but remained in sight of the previous day’s 17-month peak as the U.S. dollar was pressured by data pointing to slower U.S. economic growth and comments by a senior U.S. official backing a weaker currency.
The dollar remained lower after data on Friday showing that the U.S. economy grew by an annualized 2.6% in the fourth quarter, rather than the 3% expected, down from 3.2% in the previous three months.
The greenback had already weakened broadly, falling to three year lows against a currency basket after US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday at Davos that a “weaker dollar is good for trade.”
The dollar found some support after President Donald Trump said Thursday the US currency would get “stronger,” appearing to contradict Mnuchin’s comments.

CHICAGO/MONTREAL (Reuters) - A collapse of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to scrap, could create the most profound disruption for U.S. farmers who produce grains, meats and dairy products sold to Canada and Mexico.
Blake Erwin, a third-generation American who raises cattle, corn and soybeans in Dixon, Nebraska, said on Saturday that he is not closely monitoring the negotiations, but that he hopes the outcome will support U.S. farmers who are struggling to make a living due to low commodities prices, rising healthcare costs and high property taxes. 
""A trade agreement has to be fair for the United States, but we also want to keep those exports going for the farmer,"" said Erwin, 34. ""We don't want to mess up any good things we got going."" 
Erwin spoke to Reuters over the weekend as U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators met in Montreal for the sixth of seven planned rounds of talks to revamp the 1994 pact.
U.S. farmers and exporters are fighting to preserve their exports at a time when Canada is finding customers in new markets. They also face strained relations between the United States and Mexico, a major buyer of U.S. corn, wheat, beef, pork and dairy products.
""The U.S. is behaving so badly it's going to create opportunities for Canadian agriculture,"" Iowa State University economist Dermot Hayes said last week during a visit to Winnipeg. 
Trade flows have already begun to shift.
The United States remains the dominant grain supplier to Mexico. Yet Mexico imported 583,000 metric tonnes of corn from Brazil in 2017, a 980 percent jump from the previous year, according to Mexican government trade data.
Mexican imports of U.S. soybean meal, used to feed chickens and livestock, fell 29 percent in the first 11 months of 2017, compared with the same period the previous year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
'MORE IMPORTANT THAN PRICE' 
Trump's animosity toward Mexico and complaints over trade imbalances have pushed longtime buyers to work with new suppliers and expand existing relationships in South America, the European Union and other regions, trade experts said.
""You get partners who build a bond and get real comfortable working together. We're starting to see that bond becoming more important than price for where countries are buying grains,"" said Karl Setzer, risk management team leader for MaxYield Cooperative.
Case in point: A rare 30,000-tonne shipment of Brazilian corn steamed its way in November to grain terminals in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, operated by agribusiness heavyweights Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) and Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM). 
Despite a steep decline in U.S. corn prices, with stocks sitting at a historic high, the buyer paid a premium for the Brazilian grain - as much as $2 more per tonne, according to trade sources. 
A Cargill spokeswoman said the company had no immediate comment. ADM did not respond to requests for comment.
Canada last week agreed to join the new version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, part of a broad effort to court new trade partners.
""The tough NAFTA negotiations have convinced Canada that we have to have a number of trading partners, not just one,"" said Ron Bonnett, a beef farmer and president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture. 
The revised TPP, known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, will reduce tariffs on Canadian pork, beef and wheat to Japan and other markets, in some cases eliminating duties altogether.
Darci Vetter, former U.S. chief agriculture negotiator, said if the talks dragged on past March they might not end until next year, making it more challenging to sell American farm products.

""Other trade agreements will be implemented, buyers of U.S. products in Mexico and Canada won't be sure that we are a good long-term bet, and so we're likely to see our clients react accordingly,"" she told a panel on NAFTA in Montreal on Friday.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2018 10:32AM ET</span>",U.S. says planned Russian pipeline would threaten European energy security,"By Marcin Goettig and Lidia Kelly
WARSAW (Reuters) - The United States sees the planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany as a threat to Europe's energy security, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Saturday.
Poland, Ukraine and Baltic states fear the pipeline would increase Europe's dependence on Russian gas and provide the Kremlin with billions of dollars of additional revenue to finance a further military build-up on European Union's borders.
""Like Poland, the United States opposes the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. We see it as undermining Europe's overall energy security and stability,"" Tillerson said at a joint news conference with the Polish foreign minister in Warsaw. 
""Our opposition is driven by our mutual strategic interests,"" he said. 
The United States has already sanctioned Russian companies over Moscow's involvement in the Ukraine crisis, and foreign companies investing in or helping Russian energy exploration.
Poland, an EU member since 2004, sees Russia as its biggest potential threat, especially since Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula from neighboring Ukraine in 2014.
Russia is also engaged in the long civil war in Syria, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people, driven millions from their homes, and fueled a refugee crisis in the European Union.
""SUPPLY SECURITY""
Nordic nations have already voiced security concerns over the pipeline being laid near their shores under the Baltic. 
But Germany and Austria have focused more on the commercial benefits of having more cheap gas, arguing there could be little harm from an additional pipe.
""Any additional gas infrastructure can contribute to increased supply security in Europe,"" Germany's economy ministry spokesman said, adding Berlin's stance was that Nord Stream 2 was a commercial venture that must comply with relevant laws.
German energy groups Uniper and Wintershall, Austria's OMV, Anglo-Dutch group Shell (LON:RDSa) and France's Engie have invested in the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline, which is to pump more Russian gas via the Baltic Sea.
Poland, which spent four decades under Soviet domination after World War Two, still imports Russian gas to meet about two-thirds of its consumption. 
But it has invested in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal on the Baltic coast to diversify supplies and plans to build a gas link to Norway. 
Poland, whose main trade partner is Germany but main security ally Washington, signed in November a long-term deal to buy LNG from the United States. 

""We are proud to support Poland's energy diversification and security,"" Tillerson said.

483,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>",Copper Deals Off to Best Start in 12 Years as Prices Surge,"(Bloomberg) -- Copper mining deals are off to the best start in at least 12 years -- and more money could be pouring into the sector this year.
More than $500 million in transactions are pending or were completed so far this month, the most recorded for January in Bloomberg data going back 12 years. Merger interest is picking up after years of under-investment limited mining companies’ capacity to meet rising demand for the metal, Stephen Gill, a managing partner at Pala Investments, said by phone.
“We see the large mining companies indicating their need to buy growth,” said Gill, whose mining and metals-focused investment company is the biggest shareholder in Nevada Copper Corp. “Due to years of under-investment, their project pipelines are now empty and can only be replenished through acquisition as it takes years to develop, permit and build a new copper mine.”
The appetite for copper-mining assets is surging after prices climbed the most in seven years in 2017 amid disruptions that widened the shortfall in supply. While the rally has faltered since prices climbed to a three-year high in late December,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). analysts say the outlook remains positive. Signs of synchronized global growth also are boosting demand prospects, highlighting the need to bring new copper projects online soon. The metal headed for its first weekly gain this year despite a decline Friday.
Production trailed consumption by 175,000 metric tons in the first 10 months of last year, according to the International Copper Study Group. The deficit widened from 143,000 tons in the same period a year earlier, after a labor strike at BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd.’s Escondida mine in Chile and a temporary ban on concentrate shipments from Freeport-McMoRan Inc.’s Grasberg curtailed supply in the early part of 2017, the study group said.
There may be more supply troubles brewing. More than 30 labor contracts are up for negotiations this year in Chile and Peru, putting almost one-fifth of global copper supply at risk of disruption this year, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Andrew Cosgrove and Eily Ong estimated.
“People forgot about the depleting copper mines or the grades declining at a large amount of the copper mines, plus the elevated strike risk which is occurring in the industry,” Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive officer of  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc, said in an investor meeting in December.
Over the next decade, the market would need 5 million tons of copper from new mines to meet growing demand, Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson said Thursday, citing Wood Mackenzie estimates. New projects being developed have lower ore grade, he said.
‘Real Absence’
“There is a real absence of major new projects on the horizon,” Adkerson said on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. “Supply’s reflecting a very long period of under-investments. And even as we speak today with higher prices, we don’t see a wave of new investments being started immediately.”
The combined capital spending of copper producers tracked by Bloomberg Intelligence has plunged by more than half to $52.3 billion last year, from almost $129 billion four years earlier.
The dearth of investments and the difficulty in finding lucrative projects meant less spending on acquisitions last year. The value of transactions pending or completed in 2017 shrank to $1.15 billion, from $3.03 billion a year earlier. Still, in terms of number of deals, the 51 transactions last year targeting copper assets were the most in Bloomberg data in at least 12 years.
To be sure, January’s performance isn’t always a clear indicator of the annual flow of money into mining deals. And $510.6 million in transactions this month pales in comparison to some of the large deals of the recent past, such as the $7 billion sale by Glencore of the Las Bambas copper project to a group led by MMG Ltd. announced in April 2014. Deals that year reached $11 billion, the highest since 2012.
Still, mining companies will be under heavy pressure to start buying new assets soon, especially with copper prices trading above $7,000 a metric ton for most of the past month.
“Copper valuations are disconnected from where copper prices will ultimately trade in the long run,” Cosgrove said in a telephone interview. Assets are being valued based on copper prices below $7,000, when the cost of bringing in new capacity is much higher, he said.

Gold futures for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $13.30, or 0.98%, to $1,349.60 a troy ounce.
“Well, I think you know, people have misinterpreted some of my comments about the dollar this week,” Mnuchin told Yahoo Finance. “I was very clear I’m not making comments about where the dollar is in the short term. I’m not going to make comments about where the stock market would be. But I respect what the president said.” That comes a day after President Donald Trump had said that dollar ""will get stronger and stronger.""
The dollar remained on track to post weekly loess, however, amid data showing durable goods and US economic growth undershot economists’ forecasts.
Dollar-denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar – a rise in the dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency and thus, reduces demand.
Weaker economic data, meanwhile, did little to support safe-haven demand as the US economy cooled in the fourth quarter of the year, while durable goods fell short of economists' estimates.
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.6% annual rate in the October-December period, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That was below economists’ forecast for 3% growth.
The Commerce Department in a separate report said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 0.3% in December after an upwardly revised 0.2% increase in November.
Yet despite the fourth quarter GDP miss, RBC said the data showed exports and imports were rose significantly on the quarter, rising 6.9% and 13.9%, respectively, and noting that strong import growth is a sign of a strong domestic environment.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures fell 1.31% to $17.57 a troy ounce, while platinum futures fell 1.46% to $1,017.
Copper fell 0.58% to $3.198, while natural gas rose 2.52% to $3.53."
485,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Despite sanctions, North Korea exported coal to South, Japan via Russia - intelligence sources","By Guy Faulconbridge, Jonathan Saul and Polina Nikolskaya
PARIS/LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - North Korea shipped coal to Russia last year which was then delivered to South Korea and Japan in a likely violation of U.N. sanctions, three Western European intelligence sources said.
The U.N. Security Council banned North Korean exports of coal last Aug. 5 under sanctions intended to cut off an important source of the foreign currency Pyongyang needs to fund its nuclear weapon and missile programs. 
But the secretive Communist state has at least three times since then shipped coal to the Russian ports of Nakhodka and Kholmsk, where it was unloaded at docks and reloaded onto ships that took it to South Korea or Japan, the sources said.
A Western shipping source said separately that some of the cargoes reached Japan and South Korea in October last year. A U.S. security source also confirmed the coal trade via Russia and said it was continuing.
""Russia's port of Nakhodka is becoming a transhipping hub for North Korean coal,"" said one of the European security sources, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of international diplomacy around North Korea.
Asked to respond to the report, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that Russia abided by international law.
""Russia is a responsible member of the international community,"" he told reporters on a conference call. 
Interfax news agency quoted an unidentified official at Russia's embassy to North Korea on Friday as saying Russia did not buy coal from North Korea and was ""not a transit point for coal deliveries to third countries."" 
Russia's mission to the United Nations told the Security Council sanctions committee on Nov. 3 that Moscow was complying with the sanctions. 
Two lawyers who specialize in sanctions law told Reuters it appeared the transactions violated U.N. sanctions. 
Reuters could not independently verify whether the coal unloaded at the Russian docks was the same coal that was then shipped to South Korea and Japan. Reuters also was unable to ascertain whether the owners of the vessels that sailed from Russia to South Korea and Japan knew the origin of the coal.
The U.S. Treasury on Wednesday put the owner of one of the ships, the UAL Ji Bong 6, under sanctions for delivering North Korean coal to Kholmsk on Sept. 5. 
    It was unclear which companies profited from the coal shipments.
RUSSIA URGED ""DO MORE"" ON SANCTIONS 
North Korean coal exports were initially capped under a 2016 Security Council resolution that required countries to report monthly imports of coal from North Korea to the council's sanctions committee within 30 days of the end of each month.
Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Russia had not reported any imports of North Korea coal to the committee last year.
The sanctions committee told U.N. member states in November that a violation occurs when ""activities or transactions proscribed by Security Council resolutions are undertaken or attempts are made to engage in proscribed transactions, whether or not the transaction has been completed.""
Asked about the shipments identified by Reuters, Matthew Oresman, a partner with law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman who advises companies on sanctions, said: ""Based on these facts, there appears to be a violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution by the parties involved.""
""Also those involved in arranging, financing, and carrying out the shipments could likely face U.S. sanctions,"" he said.
The United States has led efforts to toughen U.N. sanctions to force North Korea to give up development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting America. 
Asked about the shipments, a U.S. State Department spokesman said: ""It's clear that Russia needs to do more. All U.N. member states, including Russia, are required to implement sanctions resolutions in good faith and we expect them all to do so.""
Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson accused Russia of not implementing all the U.N sanctions and said Moscow ""may be frustrating"" some of the steps.
Tillerson said the Russian failure to comply with the U.N. measures ""primarily"" concerned fuel ""but some other areas potentially as well.""
A State Department official said it was time for Russia to act.
""There is no more time for excuses,"" the official said. ""The world is watching Russia’s actions closely.""
""Russia says it wants better relations with the United States, so Moscow should prove that by cooperating with us, not working against us, on this urgent threat to all nations."" 
The independent panel of experts that reports to the Security Council on violations of sanctions was not available for comment. 
North Korea has refused to give up the development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States. It has said the sanctions infringe its sovereignty and accused the United States of wanting to isolate and stifle North Korea.
An independent panel of experts reported to the Security Council on Sept. 5 that North Korea had been ""deliberately using indirect channels to export prohibited commodities, evading sanctions.""
Reuters reported last month that Russian tankers had supplied fuel to North Korea at sea and U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in an interview on Jan. 17 that Russia was helping Pyongyang get supplies in violation of the sanctions.
The U.S. Treasury on Wednesday imposed sanctions on nine entities, 16 people and six North Korean ships it accused of helping the weapons programs. 
GRAPHIC: North Korean coal shipments via Russia - http://tmsnrt.rs/2DRokNW 
TWO ROUTES
Two separate routes for the coal were identified by the Western security sources.
The first used vessels from North Korea via Nakhodka, about 85 km (53 miles) east of the Russian city of Vladivostok. 
One vessel that used this route was the Palau-flagged Jian Fu which Russian port control documents show delivered 17,415 tonnes of coal after sailing from Nampo in North Korea on Aug. 3 and docking at berth No. 4 run by LLC Port Livadiya in Nakhodka. It left the port on Aug. 18. 
The vessel had turned off its tracking transmitter from July 24 to Aug. 2, when it was in open seas, according to publicly available ship tracking data. Under maritime conventions, this is acceptable practice at the discretion of the ship's captain, but means the vessel could not be tracked publicly. 
Another ship arrived at the same berth -- No. 4 -- on Aug. 16, loaded 20,500 tonnes of coal and headed to the South Korean port of Ulsan in Aug. 24, according to Russian port control documents.
Reuters was unable to reach the operator of the Jian Fu, which was listed in shipping directories as the China-based Sunrise Ship Management. The Nakhodka-based transport agent of the Jian Fu did not respond to written and telephone requests for comment. LLC Port Livadiya did not respond to a written request for comment.
The second route took coal via Kholmsk on the Russian Pacific island of Sakhalin, north of Japan.
At least two North Korean vessels unloaded coal at a dock in Kholmsk port in August and September after arriving from the ports of Wonsan and Taean in North Korea, Russian port control data and ship tracking data showed.
The Rung Ra 2 docked in Kholmsk three times between Aug. 1 and Sept. 12, unloading a total of 15,542 tonnes of coal, while the Ul Ji Bong 6 unloaded a total of 10,068 tonnes of coal on two separate port calls -- on Aug. 3 and between Sept. 1 and Sept. 8, according to the official Russian Information System for State Port Control. 
The coal did not pass Russian customs because of the UN sanctions taking effect, but was then loaded at the same dock onto Chinese-operated vessels. Those vessels stated their destination in Russian port control documents as North Korea, according to a source in Sakhalin port administration who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Reuters has seen the port control documents which state the destination of the coal as North Korea. But the vessels that loaded the North Korean coal sailed instead for the ports of Pohang and Incheon in South Korea, ship tracking data showed.
In Beijing on Friday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters she did not know anything about the situation but China was clear in its hope that the UN resolutions are followed fully. 
China will not allow any Chinese company or individual to do anything that goes against the resolutions and if there is cast-iron proof this is happening, China will handle it seriously and in accordance with the law, she added. 
The U.S. Treasury on Wednesday included the owner of the Ul Ji Bong 6 under sanctions for delivering North Korean coal to Kholmsk after the sanctions took effect. 
It was unclear which companies profited from the coal shipments.
Asked about the shipments, a South Korean foreign ministry official said: ""Our government is monitoring any sanctions-evading activities by North Korea. We're working closely with the international community for the implementation of the sanctions.""
The official declined to say whether the ministry was aware of the shipments reported by Reuters. 
The Japanese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The European security sources said the route via Russia had developed as China, North Korea's neighbor and lone major ally, cracked down on exports from the secretive Communist state. 

""The Chinese have cracked down on coal exports from North Korea so the smuggling route has developed and Russia is the transit point for coal,"" one of the European security sources said.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for March delivery rose 63 cents to settle at $66.14 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 0.07% to trade at $70.47 a barrel.
The number of oil rigs operating in the US jumped by 12 to 759, the highest level since Sept. 1, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes, which tracked the seven-day period ending Jan. 26.
That added little to existing fears of rising US output as crude prices settled at their highest since December 2014, supported by ongoing dollar weakness and optimism that both oil demand growth and major oil producers’ output curbs – as part of OPEC-led output-cut deal – would continue to rid the market of excess supplies.
Dollar-denominated assets such as oil are sensitive to moves in the dollar – a decline in the dollar tend to make oil cheaper for holders of foreign currency and thus, raises demand.
US crude output is nearing an unprecedented 10 million barrels per day after the Energy Information Energy Reported Wednesday domestic crude production rose to nearly 9.9 million barrels a day last week. That level is close to an all-time high of 10.04 million barrels per day (bpd) reached in 1970, bringing the US closer to world\'s top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia."
487,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",Turkey's Erdogan says military operation to make big sweep east across Syria,"By Ece Toksabay and Lisa Barrington
ANKARA/BEIRUT (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday Turkish forces would sweep Kurdish fighters from the Syrian border and could push all the way east to the frontier with Iraq -- a move which risks a possible confrontation with U.S. forces allied to the Kurds.
The Turkish offensive in northwest Syria's Afrin region against the Kurdish YPG militia has opened a new front in the multi-sided Syrian civil war but has strained ties with NATO ally Washington.
Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist group but the militia has played a prominent role in U.S.-led efforts to combat the hardline Islamic State in Syria. 
Since the start of the incursion, dubbed ""Operation Olive Branch"" by Ankara, Erdogan has said Turkish forces would push east towards the town of Manbij, potentially putting them in confrontation with U.S. troops deployed there.
""Operation Olive Branch will continue until it reaches its goals. We will rid Manbij of terrorists, as it was promised to us, and our battles will continue until no terrorist is left until our border with Iraq,"" Erdogan said in a speech in Ankara.
A senior official in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias of which the YPG is the strongest, said any wider Turkish assault would face ""the appropriate response"". 
Redur Xelil also said in an interview that he was sure the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, which has backed the SDF in its battle against the jihadists, was trying to put pressure on Turkey to limit its offensive.
Any drive by Turkish forces toward Manbij, part of Kurdish-held territory some 100 km (60 miles) east of Afrin, could threaten U.S. efforts to stabilize northern Syria.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, officially as part of the international coalition against Islamic State.
U.S. forces were deployed in and around Manbij to deter Turkish and U.S.-backed rebels from attacking each other and have also carried out training missions in the area. 
Washington has angered Ankara by providing arms, training and air support to the Syrian Kurdish forces. Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a deadly insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast for three decades.
""How can a strategic partner do this to its partner?"" Erdogan said, referring to the United States. ""If we wage a battle against terror together, we will either do this together or we will take care of ourselves.""
HUMAN TOLL
Although the campaign is now in its seventh day, Turkish soldiers and their Free Syrian Army rebel allies appear to have made limited gains, held back by poor weather that has limited air support.
Three Turkish soldiers and 11 of their Syrian rebel allies have been killed in clashes so far, Turkey's health minister said on Friday. A further 130 people were wounded, he said, without saying if they were civilians or combatants.
Turkey said it had killed at least 343 militants since the operation started. The Kurdish-led forces have said Turkey was exaggerating the number it had killed.
The SDF said 308 fighters from the Turkish side had been killed in the first week of the incursion.
Forty-three SDF fighters had died, including eight women, the SDF said. In addition, 134 civilians had been wounded and at least 66 killed, it said. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitoring group, said at least 38 civilians have been killed since the start of the operation, two of them by SDF shelling.
Seven members of one family died and one was injured when a house collapsed under Turkish shelling in the early hours of Friday in the town of Maatala in Afrin region, the head of the Kurdish Red Crescent in Afrin, Nuri Sheikh Qanbar, said.  
U.S. POLICY RETHINK?
Erdogan's chief diplomatic adviser said Turkey's military action in Syria should prompt Washington to rethink its policy.
""The moment Turkey starts using its military power instead of soft power in the region, however sour ties are at that moment, it encourages Washington to stop and think,"" Gulnur Aybet told Reuters in an interview.
""I believe the U.S. will put forward some truly satisfying alternative solutions to ease Turkey's security concerns,"" she said.
While Aybet did not elaborate on what such measures could include, she said they would follow on from a recent U.S. proposal to establish a ""safe zone"" in northern Syria.
Turkey has said the United States has offered to work on a 30 km (19 mile) safe zone, but it says trust between the allies must first be restored.
Aybet said Turkey was aware that a confrontation on the ground in Manbij risked pushing ties to breaking point: ""Everyone is aware of that risk. We hope that the Americans are aware, too.""
The Kurdish-led autonomous administration that runs Afrin urged the Syrian government on Thursday to defend its border with Turkey despite Damascus' stance against Kurdish autonomy. 

The Syrian government has said it is ready to target Turkish warplanes in its airspace, but has not intervened so far. It suspects the Kurds of wanting independence in the long-run.

Futures inched 0.4 percent higher on Friday in New York, pushing the weekly advance to 3.9 percent. The dollar was poised for its worst weekly performance in 10 months amid concerns about anemic U.S. economic growth. Crude stowed in U.S. tanks and terminals has never been in more demand, as evidenced by the record, 10-week drawdown on American inventories.
Oil traders are reacting to “U.S. dollar movements,” Eric Nuttall, a portfolio manager with Ninepoint Partners LP in Toronto, said in a phone interview. “I’m encouraged that oil is better reflecting underlying fundamentals and an under-supplied market relative to last year, where it seemed to ignore those improving fundamentals for much of the year.”
Oil traded in New York is on track for its strongest January performance in 12 years as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other major producers pressed on with supply caps amid robust demand. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). expects London-traded crude futures to approach the $78 level by the beginning of the second quarter.
West Texas Intermediate for March delivery added 34 cents to $65.85 a barrel at 9:59 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Total  volume traded was about 17 percent below the 100-day average.
Brent for March settlement fell 3 cents to $70.39 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $4.50 to WTI.
The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge of the currency against 10 major peers, has declined about 1.7 percent this week.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",China's development push in poor countries worries non-profits,"By Paritosh Bansal
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - China's development push into poor countries is marginalizing the role of human rights bodies, green groups and other non-profits, making it harder for them to play their traditional role as a check on rampant development, advocates said.
China has embarked on one of the biggest overseas development plans since America's post-war Marshall Plan, with more than $100 billion of investments through its Belt and Road scheme to build highways, rail lines, ports and other infrastructure linking up Asia, Europe and Africa.
But unlike Western-backed lenders, where development financing often comes with social and environmental strings and strengthens the voice of non-profits, China-backed lenders are taking a more hands-off approach, according to interviews with NGO executives and a lender at the World Economic Forum.
""The situation with China right now is obviously the one to watch,"" said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International. ""What are the standards they are setting in the loans or the financing that they are doing around the world?""
Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, described China's approach as amoral and said it had eased the economic pressure that nations felt when aid or investment was ""more conditioned on respect for human rights"".
China-backed institutions take a different approach to the World Bank and other Western-backed development lenders.
For example, the World Bank has a strong bias against new coal-fired power stations on environmental grounds, but China's new Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which is helping finance the Belt and Road plan, is less strident.
The AIIB's vice president for policy and strategy, Joachim von Amsberg, told Reuters at Davos that the Chinese-backed lender wanted to encourage transition to renewable energy but it did not want to ""put on the front door the sign -- 'No Coal'.""
""We are not seeing every project as a lever into broader policy changes in our member countries,"" von Amsberg said.
""That is a welcome addition to the world of development finance because I think it avoids the risk of overreaching, of trying to do too much with individual investment projects.""
Financing through institutions such as the World Bank has long been used by rich countries as a way to push borrowers to improve their track record on social causes.
As part of that push, non-profits have played the role of watchdogs, helping to change the course on issues such as dam development and speaking up for human rights.
Advocates said the headwind had become stronger amid rising populism and as the United States under President Donald Trump took a more muted approach on issues like human rights or reversed policy, as it did on climate change.
""Am I concerned about shrinking civic space and not having as much voice in governments in various countries around the world? Absolutely,"" Morgan said.
NO STRINGS ATTACHED     
Von Amsberg, who spent some 25 years at the World Bank before joining the AIIB in 2016, said the lender with 84 member nations held itself to high standards on environmental, social and governance norms, and denied it weakened civil society.
In response to a question from Reuters, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a briefing in Beijing: ""The Chinese government has always asked companies that are going out to carry out operations in their host countries under a legal framework in accordance with the law and rules, and to positively fulfill their responsibility to society.""
Some sovereign governments welcome assistance without a broader agenda. Bangladesh, for example, struck deals with China for billions of dollars worth of loans for various projects when President Xi Jinping visited in late 2016.
""Anybody would prefer Chinese investment if the alternative is the World Bank,"" Moshiur Rahman, economic adviser to Bangladesh's prime minister, told Reuters in an interview in Dhaka this month.
""Unlike Western investors, they are not worried about how many people you put in jail.""
COMMON GROUND 
Some non-profits are looking for common ground to find areas that they can work on.
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has been working with Beijing on projects for more than a decade, and taking Chinese expertise in areas such as agriculture to other parts of Asia and Africa, said Mark Suzman, chief strategy officer for the foundation.
Suzman said the foundation was in discussions to see if Belt and Road projects in Southeast Asia could be used to work on malaria prevention in the Mekong delta, a disease where the Chinese have expertise.
""We actually feel pretty optimistic that there is a win-win potential to it,"" Suzman said.
Last month the Chinese government circulated an article to the United Nations about its approach to human rights, laying out how Beijing was turning its ""domestic governance philosophies into international consensus"".
""Peace and security are the most important human rights,"" wrote Li Baodong, vice minister for foreign affairs. ""Development is of paramount importance.""

""We have made fresh headway in increasing our say on human rights issues,"" he wrote.

The weaker dollar has made oil more attractive to investors.
Oil resumed gains this week after Saudi Arabia and Russia pledged to continue coordinated supply cuts to drain a global glut. A challenge for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies is expanding U.S. output, which rose last week to the highest level in more than three decades.
“Oil prices face yet another weekly gain due to the weak U.S. dollar,” said Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.

491,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2018 03:03AM ET</span>","Oil firms as dollar falls further, but weaker crude demand looms","By Henning Gloystein
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices reversed earlier falls on Friday as ongoing weakness in the U.S. dollar was seen supporting fuel consumption.
Brent crude futures were at $70.40 per barrel at 0756 GMT, down 3 cents from their last close, after dropping as low as $70.07 earlier in the day.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $65.52 a barrel, up 1 cent from their previous close, recovering from a session-low of $64.91 a barrel.
Crude oil futures have received support from a weakening dollar, which on Friday hit fresh 2014 lows against a basket of other leading currencies.
As oil is traded in dollars, swings in the greenback can also impact oil demand as it affects the price of fuel purchases for countries using other currencies.
""The weakening of the U.S. dollar against a basket of global currencies ... has positioned 2018 to lead off with strong levels of oil demand,"" said BMI Research.
Despite this, crude prices were prevented from further rises by a seasonally weakening demand outlook.
Georgi Slavov, head of research at commodities brokerage Marex Spectron, said despite a generally healthy outlook for oil demand, there were short-term headwinds due to the upcoming end of the peak-demand period during the northern hemisphere winter season.
Many refiners shut down after winter for maintenance, resulting in lower orders for crude, their most important feedstock.
""Demand is starting to weaken as ... refining capacity was taken out of the market,"" Slavov said.
U.S. bank Jefferies said ""a fairly heavy maintenance season"" was starting in the United States, adding there was also upcoming ""scheduled maintenance in the Middle East (including the 400,000 barrels per day Aramco Jubail refinery).""
This is reflecting in oil inventories.
""Global oil stocks built overall in the week ending Jan. 19, as both crude and product stocks saw small builds,"" U.S. bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said.
On the supply side, U.S. oil production is expected to hit 10 million bpd soon, after reaching 9.88 million bpd last week.
Output has grown by more than 17 percent since mid-2016 and is now on par with top exporter Saudi Arabia's.
Only Russia produces more, averaging 10.98 million bpd in 2017.
Rising U.S. output threatens to undermine the supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, aimed at propping up prices.

The cuts, coupled with demand growth, have contributed to a near 60 percent rise in oil prices since mid-2017 as excess crude inventories have been drawn down.

The decision to withdraw the ""once-in always-in"" policy is part of President Donald Trump's effort to roll back federal regulations and was sought by utilities, the petroleum industry and others. 
Sources of air pollution previously classified as ""major sources"" may be reclassified as ""area"" sources when the facility limits its emissions below ""major source"" thresholds, the EPA said. Area sources are subject to less strict pollution control standards than major sources.
""It will reduce regulatory burden for industries and the states, while continuing to ensure stringent and effective controls on hazardous air pollutants,"" Bill Wehrum, assistant administrator of the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation, said in a statement.
The ""once-in always-in"" policy, which was established in 1995, has been a disincentive for power plants, factories and other major sources of pollution to pursue technological innovations that would reduce emissions, the agency said.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said the decision ""is among the most dangerous actions that the Trump EPA has taken yet against public health.""
""This move drastically weakens protective limits on air pollutants like arsenic, lead, mercury and other toxins that cause cancer, brain damage, infertility, developmental problems and even death,"" John Walke, director of a clean air program for the NRDC, said in a statement.

The firm is shutting its Koppenberg Macro Commodity Fund by Jan. 31, according to the letter reviewed by Reuters. The firm will convert into a family office, the source said.
""Commodity trading is tough, with no coupons, dividends, or real price appreciation over time to soften the blows. It's becoming even tougher,"" Stephen Jamison said in a Jan. 24 letter to investors.
    The closure of Jamison, one of the largest commodity-focused hedge funds, comes after several other big names have closed shop in recent months. They include hedge fund manager Andy Hall, who closed his Astenbeck Capital Management last summer, and Texas tycoon T. Boone Pickens, who said this month that he was closing his fund, in part due to declining health. 
A spokesperson for Jamison did not respond to requests for comment. 
In his letter, Jamison said machine learning and artificial intelligence has eliminated short-term trading opportunities for the firm, and long term, commodities do not offer any obvious benefits. 
He added that there are wiser places to invest such as master limited partnership (MLP) firms and bitcoin, which he called ""digital gold."" 
    Jamison was down 9 percent last year, according to two other sources familiar with the fund's returns, driven in part by some losses on natural gas in the second half of the year.
Macro commodity hedge funds returned an average of 0.01 percent in 2017, making it one of the worst-performing strategies last year, according to data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research.
Commodity trading firms and banks posted major losses in 2017 due to muted client activity and wild fluctuations across energy markets. A number of firms were said to have suffered heavy losses in the first half of the year after the slide in natural gas prices, while others lost money in the second half due to swings in oil prices during Hurricane Harvey.
Even Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said the second quarter of 2017 was its worst quarter on record in commodities.     
    Stephen Jamison, a former Morgan Stanley trader, started the fund in 2009 and mainly invested in commodities, but also other assets when better opportunities arise.

499,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 08:06AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Small refiners hit EPA with surge of biofuel waiver requests: sources,"By Jarrett Renshaw
NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than two dozen small U.S. refineries are seeking waivers from the nation's biofuels law, an unusually high number that reflects growing oil industry resistance to the program, according to sources familiar with the matter.
The requests, made to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, add pressure on the administration of President Donald Trump to help an industry that claims the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) costs it billions of dollars a year by requiring refiners to blend increasing volumes of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation's gasoline and diesel.
Philadelphia Energy Solutions, the largest U.S. East Coast refiner, filed for bankruptcy on Monday and blamed its financial distress on the program.
While the White House and EPA chief Scott Pruitt have expressed concern for refiners and are mediating talks between representatives of the industry and the ethanol lobby, they have so far largely sided with corn-growing states with large Republican majorities. 
The sources familiar with the matter said the EPA was currently reviewing 27 waiver applications from small refineries, covering multiple years. They said more refiners had applied this year than usual, emboldened by the Trump administration's anti-regulatory stance as well as recent court rulings that broadened the EPA's criteria for granting waivers.
The EPA has the authority to grant exemptions from the program to refineries with a capacity under 75,000 barrels per day if the company can demonstrate financial hardship, but the agency has been reluctant to do so in the past.
In the four years ended in 2016, the EPA granted a total of 29 small-refiner exemptions - fewer than eight a year on average, according to data provided to Reuters by the EPA in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. 
A U.S. appeals court concluded last August, in a case filed by Sinclair Refining against the EPA, that the agency was being too strict in granting waivers only to companies that can prove the RFS would drive them out of business.
There are 53 refineries in the United States with capacity less than 75,0000 bpd, and their owners include some of the nation's largest oil companies, including  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and Andeavor (formerly  Tesoro ) (N:ANDV). 
Waiver requests and decisions are considered private business matters by the EPA and not typically disclosed. An official at the agency who asked not to be named said the EPA was reviewing waiver applications on a case-by-case basis but did not provide details on numbers.
An EPA spokesman declined to comment.
If all or most of the current applications were granted by the EPA, it could drive down prices for blending credits, called RINs, which must be earned or purchased by refiners to prove they are complying with the RFS program. 
That is because exempted refiners could sell any credits they have on hand, instead of using them for compliance. Aggressive use of the EPA's exemption authority could also reduce the total amount of ethanol that the nation's refiners must blend, and have a more dramatic impact on RIN prices. 

Since 2013, RIN prices have swung violently, from 16 cents to nearly $1.50. More recently, RIN prices have fallen to the low 60 cent range, in part because of unusual selling of credits, sparking speculation that exemptions will be, or already have been, granted, two credit brokers said.

500,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 25, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>","Within Days, Saudis Wobble on Timing of Aramco IPO and OPEC Cuts","(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia has insisted there’s no connection between plans to sell part of its state oil giant and an OPEC strategy that supports crude prices. But within days, it’s hesitated on the time-frame for both.
On Jan. 21, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih indicated it could be next year before OPEC and its allies can clear a supply glut. This could force the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to extend its production curbs, he told reporters in Oman’s capital Muscat, as global oil markets might not rebalance as anticipated in 2018.
Three days later, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Al-Falih said oil behemoth Aramco’s initial public offering will take place “when the time is right.” While he hoped that right time will still be this year, it’s a change from previous assurances that one of the most anticipated IPOs will proceed later in 2018.
There’s a direct link between the OPEC policy spearheaded by the Saudis and their ambitions to value Aramco at $2 trillion, according to  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG). Few outside the kingdom see that valuation as realistic.
“It’s all about the right price,” said Eugen Weinberg, Commerzbank’s head of commodities research in Frankfurt. “One of the goals of OPEC’s strategy, which was strongly led and influenced by Saudi Arabia, was indeed to hike prices in the short term, also in order to justify a high price tag for Saudi Aramco.”

Comex gold futures were at $1,357.80 a troy ounce by 04:15 AM ET (09:45 AM GMT), after rising as high as $1,365.40 overnight, the strongest level since August 2.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was last at 89.04, after hitting an overnight low of 88.62, a level not seen since December 2014.
A weaker dollar tends to support gold prices by making the dollar-denominated metal cheaper for holders of other currencies.
The dollar skidded lower after U.S. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday that a “weaker dollar is good for trade.”
The remarks were seen by markets as a departure from traditional U.S. currency policy.
His comments, along with this week’s decision by President Donald Trump to impose import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels reignited concerns over his administration’s protectionist stance and its possible impact on global trade.
President Trump is due to speak on Friday in Davos and investors are concerned he will use the speech to signal a more protectionist policy stance.
The risk of a weaker dollar is that it could undermine confidence in a wide swath of U.S. assets, including the U.S. Treasury market.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Brent oil prices hit $71 per barrel on Thursday for the first time since 2014 as the dollar continued to weaken and crude inventories in the United States fell for a 10th straight week, amid ongoing supply cutbacks by OPEC and top producer Russia.
Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, hit a session high of $71.05 per barrel - the highest since early December 2014 - before dipping back to $70.86 by 0801 GMT. That was still up 32 cents, or 0.5 percent from the last close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbed to $66.35 per barrel, also the highest level since early December 2014, before dipping to $66.14. That was still up 0.8 percent from the last settlement.
Both crude benchmarks have risen by almost 60 percent since the middle of last year.
Price have been supported by supply restrictions led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, the world's biggest oil producer. The output cuts started last year and are set to last throughout 2018.
""That (the producer cut), the U.S.-dollar fall, along with another inventory draw combined to drive (crude) up,"" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.
U.S. crude inventories fell 1.1 million barrels in the week to Jan. 19, to 411.58 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday.
That is the lowest seasonal level since 2015 and below the five-year average of about 420 million barrels.
In foreign exchange markets, the U.S. dollar hit its lowest level since December 2014 against a basket of other leading currencies.
A weakening dollar often results in financial traders taking investments out of currency markets and putting money into commodity futures like crude. 
OIL FUELS INFLATION
Fereidun Fesheraki, chairman of consultancy FACTS Global Energy, told Reuters in Tokyo on Thursday that oil prices could rise further still. 
""The market is so tight ... The problem with this environment is that if you have something in say, Libya, and production goes down by 500,000 barrels (per day) ... it (Brent) can easily go to $75 by May,"" he said.
Analysts said rising oil prices would likely start to have an inflationary effect. 
""Higher oil prices will eventually be reflected in higher consumer prices as the costs of transport of most goods will rise,"" said William O'Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia's Rivkin Securities.
Looming over the generally bullish market has been U.S. oil production, which is edging ever more closely towards 10 million barrels per day (bpd), hitting 9.88 million bpd last week.
U.S. output has grown by more than 17 percent since mid-2016, and is now on par with that of top exporter Saudi Arabia.
Only Russia produces more, averaging 10.98 million bpd in 2017.

LONDON (Reuters) - More global oil and gas firms expect to increase capital spending this year as confidence picks up after crude prices climbed above $70 a barrel in January for the first time in the three years, according to a survey by DNV.
DNV, a technical adviser to energy industry sector, reported that 66 percent of the 813 senior oil and gas professionals surveyed said their company would maintain or increase capital spending this year, compared to 39 percent last year.
Confidence that the industry would grow rose to 63 percent this year from 32 percent last year, the survey found.
Many companies, including oil majors  BP  (LON:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa), cut capital expenditure and costs in 2016 after the price of Brent oil fell to a 12-year low of under $30 a tonne. 
Capital expenditure in global oil production fell to $200 billion in 2016 from an all-time high of around $520 billion in 2014 as companies tried to save cash, according to consultancy firm McKinsey.
The price of Brent, the global benchmark, has slowly recovered since then, helped by output curbs by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and others. The pact began in January 2017 and expires at the end of 2018.
""Our research indicates that the oil and gas industry is becoming more confident that its successful focus on cutting costs and building new efficiencies into the value chain will last,"" DNV Oil & Gas Chief Executive Liv Hovem said.
""Intentions to increase capital and innovation spending in 2018 come alongside a clear signal that oil and gas industry costs will not return to pre-2014 norms,"" she said in a statement.
Half of the survey respondents said they would maintain efforts to increase cost control measures this year, and nearly two thirds believe these changes would be permanent.
Just 37 percent of those surveyed said the oil price was a barrier to growth this year, compared to 64 percent a year ago, the DNV survey found.

Dollar-denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar – a decline in the dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency and thus, increases demand.
Meanwhile, renewed geopolitical uncertainty triggered modest safe-haven demand, which further supported upside momentum in the yellow metal. 
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross claimed that China’s tech ambitions under its 2025 were a “direct threat” that is being implement “by disrespect for intellectual property rights” among other “very bad things.”
Ross’s comments come amid growing investor expectations that President Trump will impose a bevy of steeper tariffs on steel, aluminium and intellectual property.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Saudi oil giant Aramco is looking to expand in the United States where President Donald Trump's tax cuts and support for the oil industry are making business increasingly attractive, its chief executive told Reuters.
Aramco already controls a large refinery in Texas. It is also preparing to launch what could be the world's largest initial public offer (IPO) and is considering listing its shares in New York among several possible exchanges.
""We are looking at new business opportunities in the U.S. and with the tax cuts it will make it much more profitable ... It is part of our strategy to grow our business in the U.S.,"" Amin Nasser said in an interview.
""The Trump administration has been positive towards the energy industry. As long as what they are doing is in the interest of all and the U.S. economy is growing, we are happy,"" Nasser said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
""The whole oil industry is benefiting from the current administration.""
Trump is due to speak in Davos on Friday and has encouraged Aramco to list in New York.
Aramco wants to list this year. Saudi Arabia has shortlisted New York, London and Hong Kong -- singly or in a combination of two or even all three -- for the international portion of the state-owned firm's listing, sources say.
Washington has been a long-standing political ally of Riyadh while New York offers the best liquidity of all exchanges but requires more disclosure than exchanges in London or Hong Kong.
""This is a company that provides a significant portion of the country's GDP. There are pros and cons for every exchange. It needs to be well analyzed,"" Nasser said.
""Of course, the New York stock exchange is the best in terms of liquidity. But it is not just the question of liquidity. It is also about other rules and regulations and the ease of doing business in these markets.""
Saudi Arabia is also considering listing Aramco shares on the local stock exchange, Tadawul, but there are concerns that this could swamp the bourse. Nasser noted an official advisory council's request for the securities regulator to study the impact of Aramco's listing on Tadawul.
""All of these things need to be looked at... They (the advisory council) are asking a legitimate question.""
LOWEST-COST PRODUCER
Nasser said he was not concerned by a growing number of funds and investors -- including Norway's sovereign fund, the world's biggest -- moving away from investing in oil stocks.
""We know we are the lowest-cost producer in the world ... I'm sure Aramco will be attractive"".
Nasser said healthy global demand combined with OPEC supply cuts should help oil markets achieve a balance of supply and demand and lead to a reduction in oil stocks to a five-year average by the end of the year.
He also said he was not concerned by rising U.S. oil exports though the Saudi market share in some core markets was declining.
""We have a good share in each market. We don't have an issue in terms of market share. Our long-term sales agreements work well.""
The Aramco share listing is part of wider reforms driven by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Nasser said economic and social reforms were speeding up.
""Diversification is key ... We need to identify other sectors rather than relying on oil and gas. Privatization is also key as you can improve the quality of service. Regulatory frameworks are also changing big time. We are working on easing the climate for business,"" he said.

""We are opening the country in a big way ... These are drastic changes.""

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories declined by 1.1 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 19. That was the tenth consecutive weekly drawdown and compared with analysts' expectations for a decline of around 1.0 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 3.15 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 411.6 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be in the middle of the average range for this time of year.
U.S. crude oil production rose by 128,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.87 million bpd, the highest level since the early 1970s and close to the output of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 3.1 million barrels, compared to expectations for a gain of 2.4 million barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a rise of 0.6 million barrels.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures tacked on 65 cents, or around 1%, to $65.14 a barrel by 10:40AM ET (1540GMT), their highest level since Dec. 2014. Prices were at around $64.52 prior to the release of the inventory data.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., were up 7 cents at $70.03 a barrel, not far off the Jan. 15 three-year high of $70.37 a barrel.
Oil prices have risen almost 50% from around $43 a barrel in June, benefiting from production cut efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The producers agreed in December to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
Analysts and traders have recently warned that U.S. shale oil producers could ramp up production as they look to take advantage of higher prices, potentially derailing an OPEC-led effort to curb excess supply.
In other energy trading, gasoline futures shed 0.1% to $1.905 a gallon, while heating oil tacked on 0.3% at $2.093 a gallon.
Natural gas futures rallied 11.0 cents, or 3.2%, to $3.553 per million British thermal units. It soared to its highest level since Dec. 30, 2016 on Tuesday, boosted by forecasts that call for frigid temperatures again in parts of the U.S. during early February.

515,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 07:16AM ET</span>","Special Report: Mexico's drug cartels, now hooked on fuel, cripple nation's refineries","By Gabriel Stargardter
SALAMANCA, Mexico (Reuters) - The first call, from someone claiming to belong to the Michoacan Family drug cartel, came in February 2015.
""They said they knew who I was and where I lived,"" said Alberto Arredondo, who got the call at work as a pump technician at an oil refinery in the central Mexican city of Salamanca. ""They wanted information.""
At first, Arredondo hung up.
""But they were insistent,"" he said, calling back and demanding details of when fuels would be pumped and through which pipelines.
Over the next two years, Arredondo said, he would be hounded, kidnapped, pistol-whipped and stabbed so severely that surgeons removed his gall bladder. In December 2016, he fled to Canada, where he now seeks asylum from gangs that steal fuel from Salamanca and five other refineries operated by Pemex [PEMX.UL], the state-owned oil company.
Fuel theft is fast becoming one of Mexico's most pressing economic and security dilemmas, sapping more than $1 billion in annual revenue from state coffers, terrorizing workers and deterring private investment in aging refineries that the government, following a 2014 energy reform, hoped instead would be thriving with foreign capital.
Because of government offensives that toppled narco kingpins in recent years, Mexico's drug cartels have splintered and are eager for new sources of revenue. Now, their increasingly dominant role as fuel thieves pits two of the country's biggest industries - narcotics and oil - against one another.
The cash-rich cartels, believed by the Mexican government to generate well over $21 billion each year, are an increasing threat to Pemex, which in 2016 reported revenue of about $52 billion and generates about a fifth of government income.
""The business is more profitable than drug trafficking because it implies less risk,"" said Georgina Trujillo, a ruling party congresswoman who heads the lower house energy commission.
""You don't have to risk crossing the border to look for a market,"" she added. ""We all consume gasoline. We don't all consume drugs.""
Pemex did not respond to detailed questions from Reuters about the cartels and fuel theft. Among other questions, Reuters asked about the cartels' impact on the refineries, Pemex's security measures and how the company responds to extortion and violence against its employees.
One senior Pemex refining executive, who asked not to be identified, said, ""We worry about the influence of organized crime,"" but would not discuss the issue further.
Fuel theft is not new or unique to Mexico. But cartels are taking it to calamitous new dimensions and, in the process, bolstering their bottom line.
""Fuel theft just makes these groups more powerful,"" according to one senior official from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, who asked not to be identified.
By targeting refineries, already suffering from a lack of investment, Mexico's most notorious criminals gain access to nerve centers for much of the country's fuel supply. 
That threatens an oil industry that accounts for about 8 percent of Mexico's economy and creates yet more uncertainty for a country already reeling from U.S. threats to dismantle the North American Free Trade Agreement.
(Graphic: As illegal fuel taps soar, refineries suffer - http://tmsnrt.rs/2DgsoX9)
""It hurts the national coffers, weakens national security and hinders the reform and development of Mexico's energy market,"" said Gustavo Mohar, a former Mexican energy and intelligence official.
BLEEDING MONEY AND FUEL
Between 2011 and 2016, the number of unauthorized taps discovered on Mexico's fuel lines nearly quintupled, according to a recent report by the federal auditor. Repair costs surged almost tenfold, to 1.77 billion pesos ($95 million).
A May 2017 study, commissioned by the national energy regulator and obtained by Reuters via a freedom of information request, found that thieves, between 2009 and 2016, had tapped pipelines roughly every 1.4 kms (0.86 mi) along Pemex's approximately 14,000 km pipeline network.
After decades of poor upkeep, the refineries are bleeding money as well as fuel. In addition to unscheduled outages, which cause big operational losses, maintenance problems have led to fatal accidents, including fires and explosions.
Together, the refineries have accumulated annual operating losses of about $5 billion in recent years. Production of refined products, meanwhile, fell to just over 700,000 barrels per day in 2017. That's about half the production levels at the refineries' peak in 1994.
The 2014 energy reform is the landmark economic initiative of President Enrique Pena Nieto. It ended more than seven decades of monopoly of the oil sector by Pemex. 
It also gradually phased out subsidies that kept retail fuel cheap, causing prices at the pump to climb by an average of nearly 25 percent since 2014, even though global oil prices fell by as much as 75 percent during that period.
Higher prices were meant to attract foreign oil companies and other private investors. 
They also attracted criminals, who undercut licensed retailers by selling stolen fuel at a discount. With know-how gained from extorting sectors including agriculture, transport and mining, drug gangs began applying their tried-and-true methods at refineries.
Using the habitual narco offer of ""plata or plomo,"" or ""silver or lead,"" gangs extort refinery workers into providing crucial information. Their tactics, coupled with fighting between groups jockeying for access to the racket, have led to a surge of violence in cities like Salamanca, home to a third of the fuel taps discovered in Mexico in 2016.
Mutilated corpses of refinery workers, police and suspected fuel thieves increasingly appear around the city, terrifying its 260,000 residents. Cartels routinely festoon Salamanca with ""narcomantas,"" banners that mark territory or spell out grisly threats to rivals.
In Guanajuato, the surrounding state, investigators opened 1096 murder cases last year, 14 percent more than in 2016. That is a 71 percent increase over 2013, Pena Nieto's first full year in office.
Interviews with Pemex and Mexican security officials, authorities in Guanajuato and locals affected by fuel theft describe an increasingly desperate situation for the industry and the regional economy. 
Interviews with Arredondo, the former pump technician, and Juan, a cartel member and admitted killer turned federal informant, show the heavy toll inflicted on people on both sides of the theft.
Juan, whose last name Reuters agreed not to disclose because of his ongoing role as an informant, is no longer in Guanajuato. His information is believed by the government to be credible and has been corroborated upon further investigation, according to one senior federal security official.
""DON'T PASS THROUGH SALAMANCA""
The Salamanca refinery, the second-oldest Mexican refinery in operation, was inaugurated on July 30, 1950. It was part of a nationalistic push by Mexico, 12 years after the government expropriated foreign oil assets and created Pemex, to assert economic and industrial might. 
Located in Guanajuato because of the state's central geography, with easy access to Mexico City and far-flung corners alike, the refinery became a symbol of progress. It put Salamanca, previously a farming town in a sea of sorghum fields, on the map.
Quickly, though, Salamanca and the refinery would also come to be associated with some of the deadly risks of the oil business. Jose Alfredo Jimenez, a legendary singer of Mexico's traditional ranchera music, penned a still-famous song after a brother died after getting sick at the refinery in 1953.
""Guanajuato Road,"" as the song is titled, leads to places where ""life has no value,"" he sang. ""Don't pass through Salamanca,"" he continued, ""the memory pains me there.""
The refinery grew to dominate the local economy, its fortunes rising and falling along with those of the Mexican oil industry. Although thieves targeted the pipelines leading to and from the facility, they rarely caused significant loss.
In recent years, that changed.
One particular gang of ""huachicoleros,"" as fuel thieves are known, now dominates the racket.
Allegedly run by a local, Jose Antonio Yepez, the gang is known as the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel, after a small town 60 km east of Salamanca. Yepez, himself known as ""El Marro,"" or ""The Mallet,"" is wanted by federal authorities and suspected of crimes ranging from drug trafficking to fuel theft.
Little is publicly known about him or his organization.
Reuters was unable to reach Yepez for comment.
Juan, the informant whose account of the organization has not been reported before, said he joined the gang in 2013.
Originally from the neighboring state of Jalisco, he was earning 600 pesos ($32) a week as a day laborer when a friend phoned about work in Guanajuato that paid many times more.
That April, Juan said, he moved to the town of Villagran, about 25 km east of Salamanca. Initially, he worked for the gang as a lookout, earning 5,000 pesos a week to report on soldiers and federal police driving through the area. 
Soon, though, he graduated to filling up giant, 60,000-liter fuel tankers at a ranch called ""El Caracol,"" connected by buried hose to a pipeline about three km away.
The chief fuel tapper, known as Fito, bragged to Juan and the gang about his refinery contacts and his unique tapping skills. Other tappers simply siphoned fuel from near the pipeline. Fito lined a hose along the underside of the duct, burrowed it far away and then ran it underground to the ranch.
The technique made taps difficult to detect, allowing the gang to milk pipelines continuously. One tap ran four years undetected, Fito boasted.
""ONE OF US"" 
By late 2013, El Marro's outfit faced incursions by others, Juan and federal security officials say. The interlopers included major gangs like the Zetas, the Knights Templar and a successor cartel known as the Michoacan Family, to which the people who extorted Arredondo claimed to belong.
To deter them, El Marro built up a militia.
""El Puma,"" a Marro lieutenant, recruited Juan for the force.
""Now you're one of us,"" Juan said he was told by El Puma. He handed Juan a gun and said the first order of business was to take down an emerging gang made up of bandits recruited from as far away as the Pacific coast.
El Marro, a proud local, told his gang that they had the upper hand on their own turf, Juan recalled. ""No dog is brave beyond its home,"" El Marro said.
Juan said he and fellow militia members killed six of the rivals.
Later, a group of Zetas approached El Marro and demanded three pesos for every liter of fuel he stole. El Marro's gang arranged a meeting with the Zetas. 
Before the meeting could begin, however, Juan and his colleagues ambushed 13 of the rivals, killed them and buried them in a mass grave in a region they refer to as the ""Bermuda Triangle."" In total, Juan said he had killed about 30 people.
Reuters could not independently verify Juan's claims.
The senior federal security official said the details and scope of the events Juan described are consistent with the bloodbath around Salamanca. Juan, aged 55, is the government's single best source of information on fuel theft across Mexico, the official said.
As the gang's strength grew, El Marro grew prominent. He bought land and racehorses and commissioned songs from a local band, a practice common among narcotraffickers to manufacture their personal mythologies.
In ""Bermuda Triangle,"" his signature ""corrido,"" as the songs are known, the group sings that ""the competition sweats and fast will be finished because the Mallet rules here and he and his men hammer.""
Yepez also built up a payroll that Juan and government security officials say includes politicians, local, state and federal police, and state and federal prosecutors. Juan said on several occasions he personally delivered a payoff of 30 million pesos to one official to ensure that law enforcement turn a blind eye to the theft and extortion.
Juan named the official he allegedly gave money to, but Reuters could not independently verify the payment. Prosecutors have not charged the official with any crime. 
Around late 2014, police surrounded El Marro, Juan and other gang members near the town of Celaya. El Marro remained calm, Juan recalled.
""I'm going to make a quick call,"" the boss said.
The police promptly let them go.
Graft among Salamanca police got so severe that the state recently fired the entire local force and replaced it with Guanajuato state officers. State police referred questions about the incident involving El Marro to state prosecutors, who did not respond to requests for comment.
The payoffs, like the theft, are all possible because of the gang's refinery sources. ""That's where we got everything,"" Juan said. ""It's the brain.""
""I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING""
Arredondo, the former refinery worker, grew up in Salamanca and is now 37 years old. He had been a pump technician for more than a decade when the extortionists phoned in 2015.
His job involved delivering gasoline, diesel and jet fuel through pipelines.
After the first call, Arredondo said he went to a manager, who told him not to disclose any information. Then the gang called again, threatening to kill him.
Arredondo folded, giving the caller details of a diesel delivery.
After work that day, a motorcyclist approached and offered Arredondo an envelope. ""The patron sends this,"" the helmeted rider said, using a Spanish term for ""boss.""
Arredondo said he declined the package. But the message was clear.
Despite salaries similar to his, a modest 30,000 pesos ($1550) a month, some of Arredondo's colleagues had grown affluent, buying expensive cars and watches and sending their kids to schools abroad. One colleague bragged of renting a strip club for one night, splurging on drinks and prostitutes for himself and for friends.
""They were providing information,"" Arredondo realized.
Such payoffs, he said, ""never interested me.""
After rejecting the envelope, Arredondo said he sought to lie low. He moved house. But the thieves wanted more.
In February 2016, as he left a supermarket, armed men pulled up and told Arredondo to climb into a white van. They yelled, threatened to kill him and drove him to a ranch.
There, another group waited. The leader of that group berated him, demanding to know details about the pump team. ""I told them everything,"" Arredondo said, explaining the team's eight-hour shifts, each staffed by four workers.
The group leader was unconvinced. He grabbed a pistol and struck Arredondo with the butt, cutting his forehead. The men forced him back into the van, drove off and tossed him by the roadside.
Going to the police was out of the question. That year, two refinery colleagues were killed. Family members of the victims told Arredondo that the colleagues had informed police about threats from fuel thieves.
Police referred questions about those deaths to the Guanajuato state attorney general's office. A spokeswoman there said it had records of three suspected murders of Pemex employees in recent years.
A Reuters review of local press coverage found at least seven alleged murders of Pemex workers around Salamanca since 2012. The company and law enforcement rarely confirm employment details of victims after such killings.
The calls to Arredondo intensified, now directly to his cell phone. He told managers once more, but said they were little help.
Arredondo moved again. But the men from the van caught up with him, lingering outside his new home and making sure to catch his eye.
""I felt cornered,"" he said.
He moved a third time.
On Oct 18, 2016, his 36th birthday, Arredondo went to a bar. As he left, a man stabbed him in the stomach and ran off, not bothering to speak or even rob him.
For two months, he recovered at his parents' house. The day before he planned to return to the refinery, he went home. But there were the gang members, yet again.
""I realized that this was never going to end,"" he said.
Arredondo immediately bought a plane ticket for Canada, where he once vacationed. He took a bus to Mexico City the next morning and left his country that night.
""NO LONGER A BLESSING"" 
Arredondo is not the only one now fleeing Guanajuato.
Before the surge in violence, the state's location had made it a hub for manufacturing and logistics and an emerging hotbed for business. Investment in Guanajuato, which peaked at $2.9 billion in 2015, is now falling steadily, reaching less than half that amount for most of 2017, according to state figures.
Up to 15 percent of Salamanca's 10,000 businesses have closed, said Francisco Gonzalez, head of a local chamber of commerce. ""The refinery, and Pemex in general, are no longer a blessing for us,"" he said. 
The refinery is underperforming, operating at just over 60 percent of its capacity in 2017 and getting less funding than in years past.
Despite Pena Nieto's promise to modernize the sector, low oil prices have handicapped investments in the six refineries. The 2017 budget allocated 18.92 billion pesos for refinery upgrades, less than half the 39.77 billion spent in 2014.
Efforts to lure private investment, meanwhile, have struggled.
Last month, Pemex reached a preliminary deal with Japan's Mitsui & Co Ltd to complete a $2.6 billion coking plant at its refinery in Tula de Allende, north of Mexico City, according to two people familiar with the decision. [nL1N1PB1JD] 
But Pemex officials last year sought separate refinery funding from companies including  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO) and  Tesoro  Corp (N:ANDV), according to two people familiar with those efforts.
Neither company was interested. [nL1N1I7012]
Mitsui, Valero and Tesoro, which last year changed its name to Andeavor, declined to comment.
""There is no incentive to invest in the Mexican refining system,"" said John Auers, executive vice-president of Turner, Mason & Company, a global refining consultancy, citing ""organized crime and corruption.""
The report commissioned by Mexico's energy regulator assigns blame inside and outside the sector. ""The problem is corruption, not just in security and judicial services, but also inside Pemex,"" it read.
In public pronouncements, Pemex has vowed to crack down. The company said in an October statement it had fired an unspecified number of employees for unspecified illegal activity at Salamanca's storage and distribution center. It did not elaborate.
""What we're starting to see is that we're approaching the end,"" Pemex Chief Executive Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya told lawmakers recently, referring to what he described as gains against fuel thieves. In late November, Pena Nieto named Gonzalez Anaya finance minister and announced a new Pemex chief.
Few in Salamanca see any end to the problem in sight. Police increasingly seize vehicles, including school buses, ambulances, and delivery trucks, gerryrigged to carry stolen fuel.
""El Marro,"" on the offensive after continued incursions by rivals, in October published a YouTube video in which he shouts expletives and vows to hunt down members of the Jalisco New Generation cartel. Behind him, about 70 men brandish automatic rifles, cheer and empty their magazines into the sky.
Juan, the former gang member, said he recently found religion and a girlfriend, with whom he had a son in 2016. He left the gang in early 2017 and sought out authorities.
Arredondo, meanwhile, is hoping for asylum.
In June, the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada rejected his initial petition. Although it called him ""a largely credible witness,"" the panel recommended he relocate within Mexico, suggesting two cities where the Michoacan Family is not present.
A spokeswoman for the refugee board said it could not comment on specific applications for asylum. 
Arredondo appealed the board's decision and has a ""good shot,"" said Christina Gural, his Canadian lawyer. Just in case, though, Arredondo is researching asylum possibilities in other countries, including Australia, Norway and Finland. Of one thing he is certain.
""I can't return to Salamanca,"" he said.

516,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 24, 2018 03:55AM ET</span>",Oil Prices Tread Water Ahead of EIA Weekly Supply Report,"Investing.com - Crude prices were largely unchanged on Wednesday, amid speculation weekly supply data due later in the day will show an increase in U.S. oil and fuel supplies.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended Jan. 19 at 10:30AM ET (1530GMT).
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories rose by nearly 4.8 million barrels last week. It was the first increase in ten weeks and compared with analysts' expectations for a decline of around 1.0 million barrels.
The API report also showed a gain of 4.1 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks, which include motor diesel and heating oil, fell by about 1.3 million barrels.
There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures tacked on 9 cents to $64.56 a barrel by 3:55AM ET (0855GMT). The U.S. benchmark hit its highest since Dec. 2014 on Jan. 16 at $64.89 a barrel.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., were down 13 cents at $69.83 a barrel, still not far off the Jan. 15 three-year high of $70.37 a barrel.
Oil prices finished higher on Tuesday amid ongoing optimism over global supply cuts.
Oil prices have risen almost 50% from around $43 a barrel in June, benefiting from production cut efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The producers agreed in December to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.

Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
Comex gold futures rose to a session high of $1,346.80 a troy ounce, a level not seen since Sept. 8. It was last at $1,345.80 by 3:25AM ET (0825GMT), up around $9.00, or 0.7%, from the last session's closing price, when it rose 0.3%.
Meanwhile, silver futures jumped 22.0 cents, or 1.3%, to $17.13 a troy ounce.
The dollar index, which gauges the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, wallowed at more than three-year lows. It was last at 89.67, after dropping as low as 89.62 earlier, its deepest nadir since December 2014.
The greenback has been on the backfoot since the start of the year on rising expectations that central banks in Japan and the euro zone could pare their monetary stimulus.
Investors are looking ahead to the European Central Bank's meeting on Thursday for further details on when the central bank plans to end its massive economic stimulus program.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday, weighed by data showing an increase in U.S. crude oil and gasoline inventories.
Brent crude futures were at $69.79 a barrel at 0749 GMT, down 17 cents from their last close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $64.45 a barrel, down 2 cents from their last settlement.
Prices were pressured by U.S. data showing an increase in crude and gasoline stocks.
The American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday crude inventories rose by 4.8 million barrels in the week to Jan. 19 to 416.2 million, after nine weeks of drawdowns.
Gasoline stocks climbed by 4.1 million barrels, while refinery crude runs fell by 420,000 barrels per day.
In Asia, oversupply of gasoline has pulled down refinery profits their lowest level since 2015.
Amid these indicators, traders are taking measures to protect themselves from a potential fall in crude prices.
Trading data shows open interest for Brent put options to sell at $70, $69 and $68 per barrel has surged since the middle of last week on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).
""The options market shows increased demand for downside protection. This makes sense considering how one-sided (to the upside) the speculative bets have become,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.
There is now far more demand for options to sell Brent than there is for call options, which are the right to buy Brent at a certain price.
Sukrit Vijayakar energy consultancy Trifecta said the rising options to sell were a result of huge amounts of long positions that have been built up over the past months of rising prices.
""We still have...nine long barrels for every short barrel, so a reversal should be interesting to watch,"" he said.
STILL STRONG SUPPORT
Despite this, traders said oil would unlikely tumble far as markets remain supported by strong economic growth and by supply restrictions led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday that an average Brent price of around $60 was a reasonable forecast for this year, Interfax news agency reported.
In the latest sign of healthy economic growth, Japanese manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in almost four years in January, a survey showed on Wednesday.
Economic growth is translating into oil demand growth and comes at a time that OPEC and Russia lead production cuts aimed at tightening the market. The deal to withhold output started in January last year and is currently set to last through 2018.

Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore said a ""beaming economic forecast along with stout compliance from OPEC (to withhold production) is providing convincing support.""

521,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2018 05:44PM ET</span>","SandRidge rebuffs Icahn, boosting ruckus over shale firm's fate","By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - U.S. shale oil producer SandRidge Energy Inc rejected demands from activist investor Carl Icahn on Tuesday to replace two of its board members and amend its bylaws, saying any changes should be approved by a majority of shareholders.
The move is likely to exacerbate tensions with Icahn, who has been known to move aggressively against companies he feels are mismanaged and undervalued, and could spark a showdown at the company's annual meeting later this year.
""The board believes that changes to the composition of the board of directors and other major governance changes, as proposed by Mr. Icahn, should be made with the fully informed approval of a majority of all of the company's shareholders, rather than at the behest of one,"" SandRidge's four independent directors said in a statement.
The rejection comes less than a week after SandRidge met privately with Icahn in New York and tried to quell rising tensions with the billionaire investor, its largest shareholder, who earlier this month accused SandRidge Chief Executive James Bennett of negligence.
A representative for Icahn, who owns about 13.5 percent of the company, was not immediately available to comment on Tuesday. Shares of SandRidge were unchanged in after-hours trading at $19.29.
Icahn asked the company earlier this month to replace two directors, with one designated by him and the second by other large shareholders. Icahn had also sought bylaw changes that would have required a super-majority of the board to approve large transactions. 
The push for change came after SandRidge last month terminated a $746 million deal to acquire rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc that Icahn and other investors said was too expensive and would burden the company with too much debt. 
SandRidge did acquiesce to part of Icahn's third demand over a shareholder rights plan, known as a poison pill, that bars individual shareholders from accumulating more than 10 percent of shares. The shale producer said it would increase the threshold, though only to 15 percent, not the 25 percent sought by Icahn. 
The company has not set a date for its 2018 shareholder meeting. The 2017 meeting was held in June. Most companies hold their annual meetings at the same time each year.

Icahn has until April 16 to submit any proposal for review by other shareholders at the 2018 meeting.

Futures in New York jumped 1.4 percent on Tuesday. Crude inventories held in U.S. terminals and tanks last week probably fell for a 10th week. That would be the longest stretch of declines in at least three decades, if government data on Wednesday confirms it.
Underpinning the price rally were also assurances from Russian and Saudi Arabian oil chiefs that a historic production accord by the world’s largest producers will endure. BBL Commodities LP, one of the world’s largest oil-focused hedge funds, believes Brent futures, the London-traded benchmark, will climb to $80 this year as stockpiles drop rapidly on OPEC’s curbs.
“You are seeing a rebalancing of the oil market,” Bart Melek, head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said by telephone. “We’ve had outsized inventory declines for the last little while.”
Prices are poised to reach $65 a barrel in New York and $70 in London as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers curb output for a second straight year. Refiners and exporters in the U.S. have turned to storage to acquire supplies, accelerating the reduction of the global glut.
The comments from Saudi Arabia and Russia quell investors’ “concerns about OPEC discipline deteriorating. That should be welcome news,” Paul Crovo, a Philadelphia-based oil and equity analyst at PNC Capital Advisors LLC, said by telephone. “Inventories continue to go down. That’s all good news.”
West Texas Intermediate for March advanced 90 cents to settle at $64.47 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 11 percent below the 100-day average. The February WTI contract expired Monday.
Brent for March settlement surged 93 cents to end the session at $69.96 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $5.49 to WTI.
U.S. crude inventories probably fell by 2 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Stockpiles are sitting at the lowest level since February 2015, while oil production ticked higher in last week’s government report.
Inventory figures will be released by the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday, while tallies from the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute will be released later Tuesday.

Prices fell as much as 2.6 percent to $6,885 a ton on the London Metal Exchange as inventories tracked by the bourse jumped by the most in 10 months, continuing a pattern of spikes and drawdowns in LME inventories seen throughout 2017. 
The delivery comes as manufacturers in China prepare to dial back output during the week-long Lunar New Year holiday next month, and adds to evidence that copper demand is hitting a soft patch often seen at this time of year, according to Robin Bhar, an analyst at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA.
“The funds had taken prices to increasingly rarefied levels which weren’t justified by the fundamentals,” Bhar said by phone from London, adding that physical premiums paid by buyers in China have also slipped in recent weeks. “The market probably knew this delivery was on its way, and now we’re seeing it being incorporated into the price.”
The red metal fell 2.1 percent to settle at $6,923 a metric ton at 5:51 p.m. in London, extending a three-week tumble. Copper futures for March delivery dropped 2.7 percent to $3.111 a pound at 1:05 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the lowest settlement since December.
Copper “may see more sideways-to-downward movement in the short run,” Andrew Cosgrove, the senior analyst of energy and mining equities at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note Tuesday. “While a weakening U.S. dollar has helped, a relief rally or stabilization in the interim may remove a tailwind the red metal’s enjoyed.”
There’s “strong support” at $6,600, he added.
Analysts are warning that cracks are beginning to appear in the bull case for industrial metals. Aluminum dropped 0.9 percent Tuesday on the LME, while zinc, lead and tin also fell. Nickel edged higher. Iron ore also slumped back toward $70 a ton, suffering the biggest rout since December on signs that declining profitability in China’s steel sector is denting demand."

(Reuters) - Angolan state oil firm Sonangol has issued its first public tender to buy refined products to widen its import base, market sources who have seen the tender said, in a sign the country is committed to reforming its oil industry.
For years OPEC member Angola has largely relied on commodities trader Trafigura for fuel imports. The trader still supplies gasoil but major competitor Vitol recently edged in to supply the country with gasoline.
Heavily reliant on oil sales for government income, Angola was crushed by the 2014 oil price crash, which pushed its economy into recession and created foreign currency shortages that crippled business.
President Joao Lourenco has committed to economic reforms and ordered a review of the country's oil industry after he took office last September, succeeding Jose Eduardo dos Santos who stepped down after 38 years in power.
Lourenco also sacked the former president's daughter Isabel as head of Sonangol - an appointment made by her father in 2016 - after oil majors complained of payment backlogs and delayed project approvals.
The tender to buy refined products signals one step towards reform of the oil industry.
One of the sources said the tender would close on Jan. 31 and was looking for 1.2 million tonnes of gasoline, 2.1 million tonne of gasoil and 480,000 tonnes of marine fuel.
""The real market liberalization is still to come as Sonangol remains the monopoly importer,"" one of the sources said.

Temperatures throughout the central U.S. and Midwest will also fall to below seasonal levels through Feb. 6 as Arctic blasts sweep through.

Blockchain technology may help keep track of the roughly $200 billion of the precious metal dug from remote mines, traded by middlemen and melted down by recyclers that’s sold each year to buyers scattered around the world.
The London Bullion Market Association, which oversees the world’s biggest spot gold market, will seek proposals including the use of blockchain for tracing the origins of metal, partly to help prevent money laundering, terrorism funding and conflict minerals, according to Sakhila Mirza, an executive board director.
“Blockchain cannot be ignored,” Mirza, also general counsel of the LBMA, said in an interview Monday. “Let’s understand how it can help us today, and address the risks that impact the precious metals market.”
Markets in commodities from crude oil to diamonds and even tomatoes are looking at using the digital ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin -- known to some as ""digital gold"" -- to track ownership. Tracing gold supply is key to preventing metal that funds armed conflict from entering world markets, identifying owners and maintaining security from mine to vault.
How London’s Gold Market, the World’s Largest, Evolved: Timeline
The LBMA has pushed ahead with efforts to modernize a trade that until recent years relied on phone auctions to set a key benchmark price for the market.
“For us, it’s a question of where the gold comes from,” Mirza said.
The LBMA oversees a list of refiners approved to supply the London market. Its London Good Delivery List sets global standards for large gold and silver bars.
“Everything that ends up in an LBMA good-delivery refiner needs to be tracked in the supply chain, regardless of whether it ends up as a large bar in a London vault, a kilo bar shipped to the Far East, or a coin owned by a collector,” Mirza said. “A lot has been done already but it’s still very paper-based. We now want to formalize it through an efficient and possibly technologically based solution.”

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday, lifted by healthy economic growth as well as the ongoing supply curtailments by a group of exporters including OPEC and Russia.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $69.38 a barrel at 0756 GMT, up 35 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last close, not far off the three-year high of $70.37 reached on Jan. 15.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $63.93 a barrel, up 36 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last settlement. WTI rose to its highest since December 2014 on Jan. 16 at $64.89.
Traders said oil markets were generally well supported by healthy economic growth.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday revised upward its forecast for world economic growth in 2018 and 2019, to 3.9 percent for both 2018 and 2019, a 0.2 percentage point increase from its last update in October.
The ""economic outlook and seasonally colder weather has led to firmer oil demand growth, facilitating the continuation of a fall in oil inventories towards OPEC's recent five-year average target,""  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) said in a note.
This growth, which is also translating into more oil consumption, comes at a time of supply curbs by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, which began in January last year and are set to hold throughout 2018.
""The outlook for 2018 is roughly balanced for most of the year, but inventories are set to rise in Q4'18,"" the French bank said, adding that it has hiked its 2018 oil price forecasts by $10 a barrel and expects WTI to average $60 and Brent $65.
But there have also been signs of a possible price correction.
Crumbling refinery profits, first in Asia and now also in Europe and the United States, as a result of rising feedstock prices and plentifully available fuel products, point to lower crude orders going forward.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) said it expected Brent to average $60 per barrel this year.
While that is $5 above its previous forecast, due to strong demand growth and falling output from OPEC-member Venezuela, the British bank said it had ""a bearish view on oil prices for the quarters ahead.""
In the long-term, investors are preparing for a decline in oil demand coming from the rise of electric vehicles.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said in a note this week it saw ""peak oil demand by 2030 on electric vehicles... (and that) electric vehicles will have replaced conventional (vehicles) by 2050.""

The bank also said that ""when gasoline demand peaks by 2025 (and total oil by 2030), refinery utilisation rates may decline permanently and refining margins suffer heavily.""

Gold futures for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.32% to $1,336.10 a troy ounce.
Overnight, gold prices eased from highs as safe-haven demand fell following news that Senators may be near an agreement to end the government shutdown.
Also weighing on gold prices was a continued rise in Treasury yields as the United States 10-Year rose to a nearly three-and-half-year high amid growing investor optimism on the outlook of inflation and economic growth.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Sentiment for gold remains bullish, however, as data showed traders continued to increase their bullish bets on gold for the fifth week in a row.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for March delivery rose 0.38% to $63.81 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent was last quoted down 0.12% to $69.23 a barrel.
American Petroleum Institute weekly crude and refined product estimates are expected on Tuesday.
As well, the official data from the Energy Information Administration will continue ""until further notice"" the government agency said Monday.
Initial estimates see a 1.3 million barrels decline in weekly crude stocks; a 1.580 million barrels decline in distillate inventories; and a 2.440 million barrels build in gasoline supplies.
Overnight, crude oil prices settled higher as rising Libyan oil output was offset by ongoing optimism that major oil producers would remain committed to the deal to curb production.
Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said he would like to see the deal between OPEC and Russia reducing exports by 1.8 million barrels per day to continue beyond the year-end expiration.
That stoked investor optimism that major oil producers would continue strong compliance with the OPEC-led deal to curb output despite the threat of a ramp up in US shale production.
Crude prices struggled to advance to session highs as reports that Libya’s As-Sarah oilfield resumed production, which is expected to add around 55,000 barrels per day (BPD) to global supplies, limited upside momentum.
Crude prices snapped a four-week winning streak last week as traders questioned whether the recent rally in oil prices was overdone amid expectations that US production would soon rise above 10 million barrels a day.
Investor fears over rising US production comes despite data showing the number of US rigs drilling for oil fell last week by 5 to 747, according energy services firm Baker Hughes.
U.S. crude production rose by 258,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.75 million barrels per day last week, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported last week.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Five workers were missing after a fiery explosion on Monday at an oil and gas drilling site in eastern Oklahoma, officials said.
The fire continued to burn, fed by gas from a well being drilled for Red Mountain Energy by Patterson-UTI Energy Inc (O:PTEN), and preventing a full search of the scene, said Kevin Enloe, director of the Pittsburg County Emergency Management Department.
Fire control specialists have been called to the scene, but were still developing a plan to extinguish the blaze, he said in a broadcast briefing Monday afternoon.
Enloe declined to provide the names or other details about the five missing workers. He said one of the 22 workers at the site when the explosion occurred was treated for injuries and 16 others were uninjured.
The blast occurred at around 9 a.m. (1500 GMT) near Quinton, Oklahoma, about 146 miles (235 km) from Oklahoma City.
Patterson-UTI, a contract driller, said in a statement that some of its employees were missing after the fire. The company said it was cooperating with first responders and authorities on the scene.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which investigates fatal workplace accidents, was closed on Monday because of the federal government shutdown.
Boots & Coots, Halliburton’s well control and prevention service, had been called to put out the fire. Staff from the state's energy regulator, Oklahoma Corporation Commission, were also on the scene, officials said. The explosion is the latest in a series of accidents at oil and gas fields in the state. A gas explosion occurred at a Trinity Resources well in the same area in February 2017, injuring a worker.
More recently, a 40-year-old Oklahoma man was killed in a backhoe accident this month at an oilfield near Ninnekah. A worker was killed last month when equipment collapsed at a site near Preston, and a 36-year-old man was killed in November when a fitting failed during fracking at a well near Watonga, according to media reports.
Accidents during oil and gas drilling claim about 100 lives a year in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the CDC reported 1,189 workers were killed in the 11 years ended 2013, a period of intensive drilling.
Two-thirds of the fatalities involved transportation or contact with objects or equipment, the CDC found. More than 50 percent involved employees of oilfield service companies.

Futures rose 0.2 percent on Monday after toggling between gains and losses. Producers should keep limits on output through this year as it may be 2019 before supplies sync with demand, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said in a Bloomberg television interview with Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak. Russia is prepared to prolong its alliance with OPEC even after their accord expires at the end of 2018, Novak said.
The comments came after crude futures registered their first weekly decline in a month on concern higher prices may spur more U.S. shale drilling.
Saudi Arabia and Russia “are re-affirming what we already know,” Michael Loewen, a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said by telephone. Still, with “OPEC continuing to manage supply and balance the markets long-term, that’s positive for the barrel.”
West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, which expires Monday, rose 12 cents to settle at $63.49 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 13 percent below the 100-day average. The more-active March contract added 26 cents to end the session at $63.57.
Brent for March settlement climbed 42 cents to settle at $69.03 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It traded at a premium of $5.46 to March WTI.

Al-Falih’s comment on when the market might rebalance led some to believe the cuts may not be tightening inventories fast enough.
The production limits “are obviously not working all that well if you need that much more time to achieve your objective,” John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund, by telephone. The televised remarks were “an attempt to try and talk up the market but I’m not sure that it didn’t backfire to a degree.”
Meanwhile, in the U.S., crude stockpiles are estimated to have shrunk by 2.5 million barrels last week, according to the median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be a 10th straight week of declines in the midst of refinery maintenance that typically lasts through March.
“Seasonally, you usually don’t see inventories fall,” Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, said by telephone. “This is your big build season for crude. If you continue to see falling refinery activity and falling inventories, that’s pretty important.”

The holdings rose for a 14th week to 154.43 million metric tons on Friday, the longest run of gains since 2014, according to Shanghai Steelhome E-Commerce Co. figures. That’s enough to cover more than 50 days’ of imports, based on average daily shipments in 2017, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Iron ore rallied into a bull market last month as the curbs in China are seen underpinning demand for higher-quality ore and paving the way for a snapback in demand when they end, but some analysts are now warning of a slump.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc said last week a decline in mills’ profitability after the curbs will spur a switch to lower-quality grades that are in abundance at the ports.
“Iron ore has clearly been oversupplied, and we’re still digesting the traditionally strong fourth-quarter shipments at a time when Chinese steel production is being reduced,” said Ian Roper, head of international business at Shanghai Metals Market. “Fundamentals will become a driving force over prices again, but that’s unlikely in the very near term. Steel demand should do well post-winter restrictions.”
Spot ore with 62 percent iron ore delivered to Qingdao rose 2.5 percent to $76.75 a dry ton on Friday, to pare a weekly decline, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd. So far in 2018, the commodity’s increased 5.7 percent, aiding major miners including  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group, BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd., and Vale SA.
Last week, BHP said quarterly iron ore output rose 3 percent on improved rail and operational performance, putting the world’s biggest miner on target for record annual production. Rio reported shipments from Australia jumped 3 percent to 90 million tons in the three months to Dec. 31 from a year earlier.
While steel production in China was a record last year, there’s been a slowdown in output in recent months. Supply in December was down slightly from the same month a year ago, according to government data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Philadelphia Energy Solutions, owner of the largest U.S. East Coast refinery, said on Monday its plan to get out of bankruptcy hinges on whether it can shed existing biofuel costs under the country's renewable fuel laws.
The plan revives a debate between U.S. refiners and ethanol producers over renewables policy, and could spur actions from other struggling refiners should the U.S. Environmental Protection Administration allow PES to reduce its biofuel obligations. 
The Trump Administration could also wade deeper into the fray should the Pennsylvania refinery, which has some 1,100 workers, face closure. 
PES told its employees on Sunday it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, pinning its financial difficulties on renewable fuel laws, Reuters reported. In its bankruptcy filing on Monday, the company said it does not have enough cash to comply with the laws for 2016 and 2017. 
But PES has also seen its debt grow after its backers took out a $550 million loan used for dividend-style payouts.
PES said its biofuels obligation for 2016 and 2017 totals about $185 million. The company also plans to sell $150 million worth of credits to help emerge from bankruptcy. 
Regulatory liabilities are generally given high priority in bankruptcy proceedings, making getting out of such obligations difficult. However, the government has provided relief in past cases, particularly when there is a political dimension, experts have said.
The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is a Bush-era law that requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuels or buy credits from those who do. Those credits used to trade at a nominal price of just a few cents, but have soared in recent years.
Stephen Lubben, a professor at Seton Hall Law School, said other struggling refiners may also attempt to offload these obligations if the PES bankruptcy gives the refiner relief.
""The EPA will look closely to make sure this is not a sham to leave them holding the bag,"" said Lubben. He said a debtor that cannot comply with such rules usually has to liquidate. “If you want to restructure, the business coming out the other side has to comply.”
The bankruptcy plan would be in jeopardy if the bankruptcy court forces the company to comply with its existing RFS obligations, PES warned.
Critics have argued the company's woes are due to a flawed program, while supporters of renewable fuel laws have said the refiner's troubles stem largely from a lack of access to relatively cheap crude oil supplies.
""Blaming the RFS is a better story than admitting strategic mistakes related to crude oil markets. But it’s a smokescreen,"" said Brooke Coleman, executive director at the Advanced Biofuels Business Council. ""Jobs matter, but the RFS is simply not the issue at PES."" 
In 2017, refiners including  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO) and CVR Refining (N:CVRR), through the latter's majority owner Carl Icahn, tried to get the Trump Administration to shift the cost obligation for the credits down the supply chain to blenders like Shell (LON:RDSa) or gas station operators like Wawa. 
That effort failed after lobbyists representing ethanol producers intervened, but the battle may now be revived. 
""The mechanism for enforcing the RFS is the primary cause for this bankruptcy filing and it must be fixed,"" said Pennsylvania's Republican Senator Pat Toomey in a statement. 
The bankruptcy comes six years after private equity firm  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG) and Energy Transfer Partners’ (N:ETP) Sunoco Inc rescued PES from financial distress, in a deal supported by tax breaks and grants that saved thousands of jobs. 
Shortly after the sale, Carlyle Group issued the controversial $550 million term loan, with the bulk of the proceeds going to investors in the form of dividend-style payouts.

JERUSALEM/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - In a fresh display of Western discord over Middle East peace efforts, the United States said on Monday its Israel embassy would move to Jerusalem by the end of 2019, while its European Union allies voiced support for East Jerusalem as capital of a Palestinian state.
Vice-President Mike Pence, visiting Jerusalem, announced the timing of the move in a speech to Israel's parliament, earning applause from Israeli legislators but also stirring a brief protest by Israeli Arab lawmakers, who held signs reading ""Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine"".
In Brussels, the EU's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini assured Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at a meeting that the EU supported his ambition to have East Jerusalem as capital of a Palestinian state.
U.S. President Donald Trump suddenly reversed decades of U.S. policy in December when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, generating fury from Palestinians and the Arab world and concern among Washington’s western allies.
Trump's move delighted Israel, Washington's closest Middle East ally, but stirred disquiet from world powers including Russia and China who worry it would stoke regional tensions and further drive a wedge between Israel and the Palestinians.
Many countries believe Jerusalem should ultimately be shared between Israel and a future Palestinian state and so are unwilling to make decisions about recognition of its status before a comprehensive peace settlement is agreed.
""In the weeks ahead, our administration will advance its plan to open the United States Embassy in Jerusalem – and that United States Embassy will open before the end of next year,"" Pence, part-way through a Middle East tour, said.
FAULTLINES
""Jerusalem is Israel's capital – and, as such, President Trump has directed the State Department to immediately begin preparations to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.""
Reaction to Pence locally split along Israeli-Palestinian faultlines.
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said on Twitter that Pence's speech showed the U.S. administration was part of the problem rather than the solution. 
""The messianic discourse of Pence is a gift to extremists"", he wrote. ""His message to the rest of the world is clear: violate international law and resolutions and the U.S. will reward you.""
Israeli analyst Amotz Asa-El told Reuters that Pence's speech was important in a practical sense because it set a deadline for the move.
He added: ""I think that he (Trump) is making it plain to the Palestinians that their policy of protestation - which was visible in the plenum with the Arab lawmakers, but even more importantly in Abbas's absence and his journey to Brussels - that none of this is going to make America budge.""
In Gaza, Essam Abu Ibrahim, 28, a store owner, said: ""It will not change the fact that Jerusalem is an occupied city and it will continue to be an occupied city after this decision.""
In Brussels, Abbas repeated his call for East Jerusalem as capital as he urged the EU member nations to recognize a state of Palestine immediately, arguing that this would not disrupt negotiations with Israel on a peace settlement for the region.
While Abbas made no reference to Trump's move on Jerusalem or Pence's visit to the city, his presence at the EU headquarters in Brussels was seized on by European officials as a chance to restate opposition to Trump's Dec. 6 decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.
SHARED CAPITAL
Palestinians seek East Jerusalem, including the walled Old City with its holy sites, as the capital of their own future state. Israel, which annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it in 1967 in a move not internationally recognized, regards all of the city as its ""eternal and indivisible capital"".
Mogherini, in what appeared to be a veiled reference to Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel, called on those involved in the process to speak and act ""wisely"", with a sense of responsibility.
""I want to reassure President Abbas of the firm commitment of the European Union to the two-state solution with Jerusalem as the shared capital of the two states,"" Mogherini said.
Before Abbas' arrival, she was more outspoken, saying: ""Clearly there is a problem with Jerusalem. That is a very diplomatic euphemism,"" in reference to Trump's position.
But Mogherini said she still wanted to work with the United States on Middle East peace talks and had discussed ways to restart them late last year with Pence and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
Pence, who visited Egypt and Jordan before traveling to Israel, said that with its policy shift on Jerusalem, ""the United States has chosen fact over fiction - and fact is the only true foundation for a just and lasting peace"".
Pence, an evangelical Christian, drew parallels between Jewish history dating back to biblical times and the European pilgrims who founded the United States. 
Welcoming Pence to the parliament, Netanyahu said he was the first U.S. vice president to have been accorded the honor.
Israel and the United States ""are striving together to achieve a true peace, lasting peace, peace with all our neighbors, including the Palestinians,"" Netanyahu said.

544,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 22, 2018 10:32AM ET</span>",Worst-Returning Precious Metal in 2017 Becomes Fund Darling,"(Bloomberg) -- After lagging behind other precious metals last year, platinum is finally outperforming, and hedge funds are taking notice.
Money managers increased their bets on a rally for platinum, a commodity used in pollution-control devices for cars. Investors had been pessimistic on prices until the start of this year, but that sentiment changed as signs of synchronized global growth boosted expectations for demand. The metal’s strong correlation to gold is also providing support as a weaker dollar propels alternative assets higher.
While platinum rose in 2017, it was a lackluster performance compared with gold, silver and palladium. After Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG admitted falsifying pollution data for its cars in 2015, the outlook for platinum had dimmed as purchases of diesel-fueled vehicles fell in Europe. Now, things are turning around as China starts implementing stricter emissions standards, fueling increased demand for the metal.
Precious metals have continued to climb even after the Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs in December for the third time in 2017 as traders sought a store of value. The dollar is trading near a three-year low against a basket of 10 currencies.
‘Sentiment Change’
“There has been a change in sentiment in platinum,” said Maxwell Gold, a director of investment strategy at ETF Securities, which overseas $2.5 billion in assets in the U.S. “With the price rebound since the Fed raised rates last year, platinum is beginning to catch up to palladium and gold.”
In the week ended Jan. 16, money managers raised their net-long position, or the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a decline, by 79 percent to 19,806 futures and options, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released Friday. That’s the highest since mid-September.
Platinum futures have climbed 8.9 percent in January to $1,021.60 an ounce on the Comex in New York. That compares with this month’s 2.4 percent gain for palladium, 1.8 percent for gold and a 0.4 percent slide for silver futures.
Tighter emission standards in China include lower pollution limits set this year for all diesel vehicles, which will mean higher use of platinum catalytic converters to meet the requirements, Gold said. 
Production Deficit
As consumption is poised to rise, stockpiles in warehouses tracked by the New York Mercantile Exchange have shrunk to the lowest since 2016. This year, supply will probably outpacing demand by 275,000 ounces, as jewelry and industrial uses climb, according to the World Platinum Investment Council. The deficit will widen from 15,000 ounces in 2017.
In South Africa, which accounts for more than 70 percent of global supply of platinum, an improving economic outlook has spurred a rally in the rand against the dollar. That raises the relative costs of producing metal, putting more pressure on South African mining companies already struggling to stay afloat, according to Shree Kargutkar, a portfolio manager at Toronto-based Sprott Asset Management, which oversees C$11.5 billion ($9.2 billion).
Investors are also piling into exchange-traded funds. On Jan. 16, the combined holdings of ETFs tracked by Bloomberg reached 2.54 million ounces, the highest since November 2015.
“That trend is definitely real, because it’s not one of those short-term blips that we see,” Kargutkar said. “Investors are looking at platinum as a store of value. In the short-term, that will be the primary driver.”

A weather system will track across the Midwest with areas of rain and snow through Jan. 27, but with only modest cooling, according to updated weather models.
Meanwhile, in the East, conditions will be warm with highs of 40s and 50s over the Great Lakes and Northeast, with 60s and 70s over the South and Southeast.
Looking further ahead, temperatures will fall to below seasonal levels across the East coast through the end of this months and into the first week of February.
Natural gas prices typically rise during the winter months as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Front-month U.S. natural gas futures tacked on 1.8 cents, or around 0.6%, to $3.203 per million British thermal units (btu) by 10:45AM ET (1525GMT). It touched its best level since mid-May at $3.288 last Wednesday.
U.S. gas futures lost about 0.5% last week after data showed that domestic supplies in storage fell less than forecast.
Market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 260 and 275 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Jan. 19.
That compares with a decline of 183 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 119 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 164 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.584 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 368 bcf, or around 12.5%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 362 bcf, or roughly 12.3%, below the five-year average for this time of year.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude March contract was down 9 cents or about 0.14% at $63.22 a barrel by 10:00 a.m. ET (14:00 GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London lost 8 cents or about 0.12% at $68.53 a barrel.
Prices found support after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Sunday that OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers have a consensus that they should continue cooperating on production after the end of 2018, when their current agreement on production cuts expires.
Falih added that this might mean a new form of deal rather than continuing the same supply cuts that have boosted prices in recent months.

LONDON (Reuters) - Crude futures edged higher on Monday, propped up by comments from Saudi Arabia that cooperation between oil producers who have cut production to boost prices would continue beyond 2018. 
Strong global economic growth coupled with a drop in U.S. drilling activity and the dollar also supported crude, traders said, while additional Libyan output capped further gains.
Brent crude futures were at $68.69 a barrel at 1008 GMT, up 8 cents from their last close. Brent on Jan. 15 rose to $70.37, its highest since December 2014. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $63.50 a barrel, up 13 cents. WTI climbed to $64.89 on Jan. 16, also its highest since December 2014. 
""A weak dollar and the weekend JMMC (oil producers meeting) are supporting prices but the restart of As-Sarah in Libya is serving as a brake on the rally,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM oil brokerage. 
Production at Wintershall's As-Sarah concession in eastern Libya resumed on Sunday and was expected to add 55,000 barrels per day (bpd) by Monday. Libya's oil production has been fluctuating around 1 million bpd.
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter and de-facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said on Sunday major oil producers agreed that they should continue cooperating on production after their deal on supply cuts expires this year.
""There is a readiness to continue cooperation beyond 2018 ... The mechanism hasn't been determined yet, but there is a consensus to continue,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in Oman.
U.S. drillers cut five oil rigs in the week to Jan. 19, bringing the count down to 747, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.
Despite this, the rig count in 2017 and early this year remains much higher than in 2016, resulting in a 16 percent rise in U.S. production since mid-2016, to 9.75 million bpd.
Beyond supplies, strong global economic growth was also supporting oil prices.
""During the last four quarters, the underlying global growth dynamic began to shift ... Global growth has become synchronized and accelerated above trend,"" U.S. bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said over the weekend in a note.
Despite the well-supported market, analysts warned oil had lost some steam since last week.

Bernstein Energy said on Monday that oil inventories might start rising soon due to a slowdown in demand that typically happens at the end of the northern hemisphere winter.

Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., were at $68.86 a barrel by 3:40AM ET (0840GMT), up 25 cents, or 0.4%, from their last close.
Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures tacked on 21 cents to $63.52 a barrel.
OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers have a consensus that they should continue cooperating on production after the end of 2018, when their current agreement on production cuts expires, Saudi Arabian energy minister Khalid al-Falih said on Sunday.
Falih added that this might mean a new form of deal rather than continuing the same supply cuts that have boosted prices in recent months.
He spoke at a news conference after a meeting of the joint ministerial committee which oversees implementation of the cuts.
Oil prices have added around 10% since early December, benefiting from production cut efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The producers agreed in December to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
Oil prices posted their first weekly loss in five weeks last week as traders fretted over a sharp rebound in U.S. production.
The International Energy Agency (IEA), in its monthly report Friday, warned that rapidly increasing production in the United States would offset a raft of positive factors supporting oil prices including ongoing OPEC output cuts.
The IEA said it expects U.S. output levels to soon exceed 10 million barrels per day (bpd), overtaking OPEC behemoth Saudi Arabia and rivaling Russia. U.S. crude production stood at 9.75 million bpd on Jan. 12, data from the Energy Information Administration showed.

Looking to the week ahead, global financial markets will focus on the European Central Bank's meeting for further details on when the central bank plans to end its massive economic stimulus program.
Staying on the central bank front, traders will pay close attention to a monetary policy decision from the Bank of Japan after a small tweak in its bond purchases earlier this month triggered talk that it would cut back on QE.
Mounting chatter that the world's leading central banks will start tightening monetary policy has sparked a global bond market selloff this month, with yields in the U.S., Europe and Asia all spiking higher.
Meanwhile, investors will keep an eye on a preliminary reading of fourth-quarter U.S. growth to gauge if the world's largest economy is strong enough to withstand multiple rate hikes in 2018.
The majority of economists believe that the Fed will hike rates in March, followed by another hike in June, with a third move higher arriving in December, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding nonyielding bullion.

551,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2018 09:23PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Philadelphia Energy Solutions to file for bankruptcy - memo,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Jarrett Renshaw
(Reuters) - Philadelphia Energy Solutions LLC, the owner of the largest U.S. East Coast oil refining complex, announced to its employees on Sunday that it plans to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to an internal memo reviewed by Reuters.
The bankruptcy would come six years after private equity firm  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG) and Energy Transfer Partners LP’s Sunoco Inc rescued Philadelphia Energy Solutions from financial distress, in a deal that was supported by tax breaks and grants that saved thousands of jobs. 
Following an agreement with its creditors, the company has secured access to $260 million in new financing, and said it expected the bankruptcy filing to have no immediate impact on its employees, according to the memo, which was confirmed by a spokeswoman for Philadelphia Energy Solutions. The spokeswoman declined to comment further.
Philadelphia Energy Solutions owns two refineries, Girard Point and Point Breeze. It can convert about 335,000 barrels of crude oil per day to products such as gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. It employs about 1,100 people.
Part of the refiner's financial troubles stem from a costly biofuels law called the Renewable Fuels Standard, which is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency and requires refiners to blend biofuels into the nation’s fuel supply every year, or buy credits from those who do.
Since 2012, Philadelphia Energy Solutions has spent more than $800 million on credits to comply with the law, making it the refiner's biggest expense after the purchase of crude, according to the memo.
The Philadelphia refinery's struggles have emerged as a potential flashpoint in the debate between Big Oil and Big Corn over the future of the Renewable Fuels Standard. 
Critics have argued the company's woes are an example of what is wrong with the program, while supporters say the company's troubles are more closely related to its lack of access to cheaper crude oil supplies.
The $260 million in financing secured by the company involves $120 million in debtor-in-possession and exit financing, $75 million in additional capital from Sunoco Logistics, and a $65 million equity investment from the company's shareholders, led by Carlyle along with the refiner's management.
East Coast refiners have lower profit margins than other refineries across the country, largely because of a reliance on crude imports from West Africa and other markets. 
Philadelphia Energy Solutions had strong profits in 2014 and 2015 because of investments in rail terminals that allowed the refiner to bring in discounted Bakken crude oil in mile-long trains from North Dakota.
But the boom turned to bust by the end of 2015 as oil prices plummeted and the discount for North Dakota crude disappeared. The fallout hit oil and gas explorers and producers hard, with scores of them, such as Linn Energy Inc and Breitburn Energy Partners LP, filing for bankruptcy in 2016.
LOAN COMES DUE EARLY THIS YEAR
Before Carlyle took over the complex, Philadelphia Energy Solutions was a ""zombie"" refiner at risk of being shuttered following the financial crisis, when demand for oil evaporated. In bringing in Carlyle as a majority investor in 2012, Sunoco agreed to contribute to the refinery’s assets and be a non-controlling partner.
The refinery owners enjoyed a taxpayer-funded rescue package, which included the creation of a tax-friendly zone, $25 million in grants and environmental liability waivers.
The company took on a $550 million loan that comes due early in 2018 to finish capital projects and pay out dividends to Carlyle and Sunoco.
Carlyle, which invested $175 million in 2012 in exchange for two-thirds of Philadelphia Energy Solutions, withdrew its plans to take the company public in 2016 at an expected valuation of $1.3 billion. In the same years, Carlyle also tried unsuccessfully to sell Philadelphia Energy Solutions. 
Philadelphia Energy Solutions has also been grappling with its labor union, which threatened to strike last summer unless cuts to benefits were restored.
Reuters first reported in August that Philadelphia Energy Solutions had tapped investment bank  PJT Partners Inc  (N:PJT) for advice on dealing with its debt burden. 

Philadelphia Energy Solutions will seek to restructure more than $100 million of its existing debt, and expects to complete the recapitalization process in the first quarter of 2018, according to the memo.

Investors will be focused on the outcome of monetary policy meetings by the ECB and fourth quarter growth from both the U.S., if it is released during the shutdown, and the UK. Canadian inflation data will also be in focus after last week's rate hike by the country’s central bank.
The World Economic Forum in Davos and talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement will also be closely watched for developments.
Last week, gold prices rose on Friday as the dollar hovered near three year lows amid fears over the prospect of a U.S. government shutdown, but the precious metal still ended the week slightly lower.

But Falih cautioned about the low-demand period ahead - a normal season of refinery turnarounds, particularly on the US Gulf Coast.
""We are entering a low demand period seasonally, and we have to let that pass and see how inventories look in the second half before we consider any alteration"" to current policy, he said.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday, if released, to further weigh what the impact of recent storm activity was on supply and demand.

MUSCAT (Reuters) - Global oil producers are in agreement that they should continue cooperating on production after their deal on supply cuts expires at the end of this year, Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih said on Sunday.
It was the first time Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, had publicly stated OPEC and non-OPEC producers would keep cooperating after 2018. 
The exact mechanism for cooperation next year has not yet been decided, Falih said, but if oil inventories increase in 2018 as some in the market expect, producers might have to consider rolling the supply cut deal into next year.
""There is a readiness to continue cooperation beyond 2018... The mechanism hasn’t been determined yet, but there is a consensus to continue,"" Falih said after a meeting of the joint ministerial committee which oversees implementation of the cuts.
The committee comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Venezuela and Algeria, plus non-OPEC producers Russia and Oman. The United Arab Emirates was also present on Sunday as it holds the presidency of OPEC.
Before the meeting, Falih said extending the cooperation framework beyond 2018 wouldn't necessarily mean sticking to countries' current production targets. 
The agreement was launched last January and Saudi Arabia has accounted for by far the largest share of the output cuts.
Falih said a deal on production levels after 2018 would be about ""assuring stakeholders, investors, consumers and the global community that this is something that is here to stay. And we are going to work together.""
Kuwait's oil minister Bakheet al-Rashidi said Sunday's meeting focused on compliance with the current agreement on output cuts, and discussion of the deal's future was expected to occur in June, when OPEC and other producers led by Russia are next scheduled to meet on oil policy.
Oman's oil minister Mohammed bin Hamad al-Rumhi said producers would discuss in November whether to renew their supply agreement or enter a new type of agreement. Oman is in favor of a new deal, he said without elaborating.
Falih said the global economy had strengthened while the supply cuts had shrunk oil inventories around the world. As a result, the oil market was on course to rebalance towards the end of 2018 or in 2019, he said.
But he stressed that producers still had a lot of hard work ahead to restore the market to health, and it was uncertain whether the current pace of the drawdown in oil inventories would continue in months to come.
""We are entering a low demand period seasonally, and we have to let that pass and see how inventories look in the second half before we consider any alteration"" to current policy, he said.
Falih and energy ministers from the UAE and Oman noted that the rise of the Brent oil price to three-year highs around $70 a barrel in recent weeks could cause an increase in supply of shale oil from the United States.
But both Falih and UAE minister Suhail al-Mazroui said they did not think the rise in prices would hurt global demand for oil.
OPEC has a self-imposed goal of bringing oil inventories in industrialized countries down to their five-year average. But Falih said that identifying the exact target for inventories had yet to be discussed by producers, and it might only become clearer in June. 
""I don't think that we are going to reach our target anytime soon, certainly not in the first half,"" he told reporters before Sunday's meeting.
""I think we have to identify more clearly what is the normal level because five-year average - which five-year? The longer we wait to reach that target, the more the running five-year average increases and represents bloated inventories.
“I think one of the things we need to define in the next few months, before we meet in June, is what is the real target more precisely, and that is work that still needs to be done, and we still need to reach a consensus.""

Falih said the overall compliance of OPEC and non-OPEC nations with the production cuts was 129 percent in December. The next meeting of the joint ministerial committee overseeing implementation of the cuts will be held in April in Saudi Arabia, an OPEC statement said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oilfield service companies exposed to Venezuela face new hits to earnings from the South American nation's ongoing economic turmoil and U.S. sanctions on the country and state-run oil company PDVSA.
Insufficient investment, payment delays to suppliers, and the sanctions imposed by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump have hammered Venezuela's oil industry and saw crude oil production fall 13 percent in 2017. 
On Friday, Schlumberger (N:SLB) disclosed a $938 million write-down on its Venezuelan assets and receivables, citing political and economic woes affecting the country. It was the first big energy company to report fourth quarter results.
Schlumberger and other suppliers accepted promissory notes or reclassified Venezuelan receivables in recent years as a way to manage debts from PDVSA [PDVSA.UL]. But Friday's charge signals troubles ahead for those with outstanding bills. 
However, that is likely to be offset by improving business outlooks elsewhere as higher prices for crude boost oilfield activity.
Halliburton (N:HAL) and Weatherford International (N:WFT), which will report results over the next two weeks, are also owed money for their Venezuelan operations, the companies said in 2017 filings. 
Halliburton in October said it was experiencing payment delays from its primary customer in Venezuela. At the time, it had $429 million in net trade receivables for its Venezuelan operations. 
Meanwhile, Weatherford said in November that it would reclassify $158 million in receivables owed from its largest customer in Venezuela as non-current assets to reflect payment delays.
""The sanctions could affect our ability to collect payment on our receivables,"" Weatherford said at the time.
A representative for Halliburton did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Weatherford declined to comment. 
Schlumberger said it would remain in Venezuela and continue to seek payment for its work. 
""It's likely they'll maintain a presence but only work if they are paid up front,"" James West, senior managing director and a partner at investment bank Evercore ISI, said of the suppliers. 

The United States in August slapped sanctions on Venezuela in a bid to punish actions by socialist President Nicolas Maduro, whose consolidation of power has sparked political turmoil. The sanctions prohibit dealings in new debt from the Venezuelan government and PDVSA.

562,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 03:00PM ET</span>",Crude Falls to Lowest in a Week as Shale Revival Fears Haunt,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil’s recent three-year highs are looking increasingly elusive as the week ends, with mounting fears that current prices will spark too much production, all over again.
Futures in New York slid 0.9 percent on Friday to the lowest level in more than a week and posted the first weekly loss since mid-December. The International Energy Agency on Friday said it sees “explosive” growth in U.S. oil output in 2018. A day earlier, the Energy Information Administration showed the biggest gain in U.S. crude production since October.
“The higher the price is, the more production we are going to get out of the U.S., which threatens the price,” James Williams, president of London, Arkansas-based energy researcher WTRG Economics, said by telephone. “We are in that threatening cycle right now.”
The enthusiasm that put the crude market in the groove for another year of rising prices is giving way to some caution. With technical indicators signaling oil is overbought, hedge funds cut their bullish bets on Brent crude from a record-high, according to ICE Futures Europe data released on Friday.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which will meet in Oman this weekend to review its strategy, is sticking to its production curbs. But some analysts expect the output-cut agreement will end earlier than planned. Plus, the compliance rate for the 10 non-OPEC nations participating in the deal plummeted to 78 percent in December, the lowest level since July, according to Bloomberg calculations from preliminary IEA data.
The ""probability is growing"" that the accord may conclude before the end of the year, said Harry Tchilinguirian,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA’s head of commodity strategy. Discussions around an early exit are likely to emerge at the OPEC’s meeting in June, he said.

West Texas Intermediate for February delivery dropped 58 cents to settle at $63.37 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 11 percent below the 100-day average. Prices are down 1.5 percent this week.
Brent for March settlement slipped 70 cents to end the session at $68.61 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Prices fell 1.8 percent this week. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $5.30 to March WTI.
The IEA expects non-OPEC supply to expand by 1.7 million this year, the biggest jump since the peak of the shale boom.
“The big 2018 supply story is unfolding fast in the Americas,” the IEA said in its monthly report. “Explosive growth in the U.S. and substantial gains in Canada and Brazil will far outweigh potentially steep declines in Venezuela and Mexico.”
Earlier in the week, an EIA report showed that while U.S. crude inventories tumbled for a ninth straight week, production rose by 258,000 barrels a day.
The decline in crude inventories “was a definite positive, but at the same time, there was a little bit of concern in the market that has really been brought out too by the IEA, with just continual production as we get closer to the $65 range,” Mark Watkins, a Park City, Utah-based regional investment manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which oversees $142 billion in assets, said by telephone.

563,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",Mexico's energy opening faces test in deepwater oil auction,"By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - An auction of deepwater oil and gas fields in Mexico this month may prove the last major opportunity for President Enrique Pena Nieto's government to capitalize on its opening of the energy sector, the central plank of its economic agenda.
The Jan. 31 tender of licenses to explore and drill in 29 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico is the biggest chunk of oil and gas wealth on offer since the completion of a 2013-14 legislative overhaul that ended state oil firm Pemex's decades-long monopoly. 
Many of the biggest global oil firms have registered to take part, including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa),  BP  Plc (L:BP),  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) and China Offshore Oil Corp.
The blocks that Mexico is offering could attract billions of dollars in investment from companies that have long coveted access to the deep waters on Mexico's side of the Gulf.
Looming over the auction, however, is a July presidential election in which the frontrunner, leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has attacked the energy reform and vowed to review contracts awarded to companies under Pena Nieto.
Another element of political risk for companies to consider is the potential for disruption to business if U.S. President Donald Trump makes good on threats to ditch the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell, seeking to temper expectations, said investors may also be influenced by Trump's corporate tax cuts and an increase in exploration and production opportunities in other parts of the world.
The Trump administration has vowed to open up nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, while auctions in Brazil and Argentina and new projects in nearby Guyana stake further claims to the capital Mexico is seeking to lure.
""In that context, we estimate that if we assign seven lots - seven blocks at a minimum - from there onward the auction could be highly successful,"" Joaquin Coldwell told Reuters.
Rising commodity prices and the relatively rare opportunity for global players to gain access to large, untapped fields, have spurred hopes for lively interest. The last deepwater round in Mexico in December 2016 saw eight of 10 blocks awarded.
""You have every ingredient you need for an active sale,"" said Tim Duncan, president and chief executive officer of Talos Energy, a U.S. company that won contracts in previous Mexican rounds but is not bidding this time around.
UNEXPLORED
Little drilling or exploration has been done in Mexico's deep waters because Pemex lacks the specialist technology needed, as well as the funds. The state energy firm focuses on oilfields in shallow water.
International oil firms are familiar with the geology of the region because it is similar to what is under the Gulf's U.S. waters. The fields on offer are concentrated in three areas, including the prolific Perdido Fold Belt.
Global oil majors have pumped billions of barrels of crude over decades of operation from the U.S. side, and Mexican waters are thought to hold similarly rich reserves of oil and gas.
The auction is the eighth group of fields put on the block since an inaugural Mexico tender in July 2015, which fell flat as crude prices were in the midst of a protracted slide.
Mexico plans another shallow water oil and gas auction in late March, but that is not expected to yield the same scale of investment as the deepwater round.
ELECTION RISK
Pena Nieto saw opening up production, exploration and retail of oil and gas as the key to boosting lackluster economic growth to five percent a year or above.
More than 2,000 gas stations across Mexico that were once Pemex-only have begun pumping fuel under international brand names, and tens of billions of dollars in investment have been pledged to tap extensive oil and gas reserves.
However, that investment will take years to raise output. Growth is stuck at around 2 percent, and the government has failed to reverse a steady decline in crude production.
After peaking at around 3.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2004, oil output is now below 1.9 million bpd - a contrast to solid growth in production in recent years in Brazil, Latin America's top oil producer.
Bill Richardson, a former U.S. energy secretary, said a successful auction would hand Pena Nieto a political victory as well as lift foreign investment.
""If this auction is done properly, then it could be a good windfall for Mexico's energy economy,"" he told Reuters.
Pena Nieto is barred by law from seeking a second term, and the possibility of a victory by leftist Lopez Obrador in July's election has freighted the energy opening with risk.
The 64-year-old Lopez Obrador has hinted at a softer stance on the overhaul, encouraging the hope that he would at least not renege on any existing contracts.

If oil companies believe Mexico may be less open after July, it could even spur bidding for contracts on Jan. 31, said Duncan at Talos Energy.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for January delivery fell 58 cents to settle at $63.37 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent lost 1.04% to trade at $68.59 a barrel.
Crude oil prices snapped a four-week winning streak as investors weighed the impact of rising US production on OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies. The International Energy Agency (IEA), in its monthly report, warned that rising non-OPEC production would offset a raft of positive factors supporting oil prices including ongoing OPEC output cuts.
“Given Venezuela’s astonishing debt and deteriorating oil network, it is possible that declines this year will be even steeper,” the IEA said. “Explosive growth in the U.S. and substantial gains in Canada and Brazil will far outweigh potentially steep declines in Venezuela and Mexico.”
Fears over rising US production comes as data this week showed the number of US rigs drilling for oil fell, while US production rose sharply, which offset a decline in US crude oil supplies for the ninth-straight week.
The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. rose by 5 to 747, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes. U.S. crude production rose by 258,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.75 million barrels per day last week, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported Thursday, while inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 6.86 million barrels, beating expectations for  of a draw of 3.54 million barrels."

567,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2018 09:43AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump's coal job push stumbles in most states - data,"By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's effort to put coal miners back to work stumbled in most coal producing states last year, even as overall employment in the downtrodden sector grew modestly, according to preliminary government data obtained by Reuters.
Trump made reviving the coal industry, and the declining communities that depend upon its jobs, a central tenet in his presidential campaign and has rolled back Obama-era environmental regulations to give the industry a boost.
But the effort has had little impact on domestic demand for coal so far, with U.S. utilities still shutting coal-fired power plants and shifting to cheaper natural gas - moving toward a lower carbon future despite the direction the White House is plotting under Trump.
Unreleased full-year coal employment data from the Mining Health and Safety Administration shows total U.S. coal mining jobs grew by 771 to 54,819 during Trump’s first year in office, led by Central Appalachian states like West Virginia, Virginia, and Pennsylvania - where coal companies have opened a handful of new mining areas for shipment overseas.
""You know, West Virginia is doing fantastically well,"" Trump told Reuters in an interview this week about the state, which gained 1,345 coal jobs last year, according to the data. ""It’s great coal."" 
But the industry also lost jobs in other Appalachian states like Ohio, Kentucky, and Maryland; the western Powder River Basin states Montana and Wyoming; as well as in several other states like Indiana, New Mexico, and Texas.
Texas lost the largest number, at 455, and Ohio was a close second, losing 414, according to the data. 
Pennsylvania, which gained 96 jobs in 2017, is also expected to go negative soon after Dana Mining announced this month it would close a mine employing about 400 people.
Overall, the number of U.S. coal jobs is still lingering near historic lows at less than one-third the level in the mid-1980s, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, as the industry loses market share to cheaper natural gas.

The bright spots in the industry in 2017 came amid a big surge in demand for shipments from overseas, said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association.
""We have seen production rise this past year by more than six percent and exports rise five-fold over the previous year,"" he told Reuters. 

""Honest people can differ over how much credit the president deserves for this revival and how much credit belongs to market forces,"" he added. ""To those of us closest to the coal industry, there is little question that the administration’s regulatory reset ... has made a decisive difference.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices slid on Friday, putting them on course for the biggest weekly falls since October, as a bounce-back in U.S. production outweighed ongoing declines in crude inventories.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $68.70 a barrel at 0949 GMT, down 61 cents from their last close. On Monday, they hit their highest since December 2014 at $70.37.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $63.38 a barrel, down 57 cents from their last settlement. WTI marked a December-2014 peak of $64.89 a barrel on Tuesday.
The International Energy Agency (IEA), in its monthly report, said that global oil stocks have tightened substantially, aided by OPEC cuts, demand growth and Venezuelan production hitting near 30-year lows. 
But it warned that rapidly increasing production in the United States could threaten market balancing. 
""Explosive growth in the U.S. and substantial gains in Canada and Brazil will far outweigh potentially steep declines in Venezuela and Mexico,"" the IEA said of 2018 production. 
U.S. crude oil production  stood at 9.75 million barrels per day (bpd) on Jan. 12, data from the Energy Information Administration showed. The IEA said it expects this to soon exceed 10 million bpd, overtaking OPEC behemoth Saudi Arabia and rivaling Russia. 
Analysts also pointed to an expected demand slowdown at the end of winter in the northern hemisphere and excessive long positions in financial oil markets as a likely brake on any upward momentum in prices.
ANZ bank said ""an upcoming soft patch in demand and extreme investor positioning does open up the possibility of some short-term weakness"".
Overall, however, oil prices remain well supported, and most analysts do not expect steep declines.
The main price driver has been a production cut by a group of major oil producers around the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, who started to withhold output in January last year.
The supply cuts by OPEC and its allies, which are scheduled to last throughout 2018, were aimed at tightening the market to prop up prices.
In the United States, crude inventories fell 6.9 million barrels in the week to Jan. 12, to 412.65 million barrels.

That's their lowest seasonal level in three years and below the five-year average marker around 420 million barrels.

The agency is joining a chorus of voices from Goldman Sachs and OPEC’s own analysts in warning of a surge in U.S. production as oil hits three-year highs. Output cuts led by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have been successful in eroding bloated stockpiles, and yet they risk becoming a victim of their own success.
The IEA boosted its forecasts for non-OPEC supply growth this year by 100,000 barrels to 1.7 million barrels a day compared to last month’s report. It also warned 2018 could be a “volatile” year amid geopolitical uncertainties, not least the risks to Venezuela’s oil industry.
“The big 2018 supply story is unfolding fast in the Americas,” the IEA said in its monthly report. “Explosive growth in the U.S. and substantial gains in Canada and Brazil will far outweigh potentially steep declines in Venezuela and Mexico.”
The agency raised its forecast for U.S. oil production growth this year by 240,000 barrels a day to 1.35 million barrels. The country’s crude output is on track to surpass Saudi Arabia and rival Russia.
While the U.S. gains, there are others that are still suffering. The IEA expects Venezuela’s troubles to continue after it had the biggest unplanned production decline last year.
“Given Venezuela’s astonishing debt and deteriorating oil network, it is possible that declines this year will be even steeper than the 270,000 barrels a day in 2017,” the report said. The country’s output last year was 1.97 million barrels a day, the lowest in nearly 30 years.
Yet, the IEA doesn’t see a “clear sign yet of OPEC turning up the taps to cool down oil’s rally” to “compensate for a precipitous drop in supply from Venezuela.”
OPEC and its partners will meet in Oman over the next two days to review their strategy for clearing the global oil glut. Ministers from the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and Kuwait have said the deal needs to continue. Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak has said talks this weekend could include mechanisms for gradually exiting the supply cuts after the agreement concludes at the end of 2018.

574,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 02:50PM ET</span>",Crisis-hit Venezuela's oil output plummets in 2017 to decades low,"By Marianna Parraga and Alexandra Ulmer
HOUSTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's crude oil production fell nearly 13 percent last year, according to figures released by OPEC on Thursday, hitting a 28-year annual low that points to a deepening economic crisis and increased chances of a debt default. 
The South American country produced 2.072 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 versus 2.373 million bpd the previous year, a nearly 300,000-bpd drop. 
That was the biggest decline among the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that have pledged to restrain production since the start of 2017 through 2018. 
But unlike voluntary cuts by Saudi Arabia, Russia and others intended to stoke higher crude prices by draining a global glut, Venezuela has been unable to stop a now six-year-long production decline. 
Insufficient investments, payment delays to suppliers, U.S. sanctions, and a brain drain have hammered Venezuela's oil industry. The production fall has hit oil exports – its only major source of foreign currency to repay debt - and refining, creating intermittent fuel scarcity in the country and at some of its main allies, such as Cuba. 
An alleged crackdown on oil graft in the last few months, seen by critics as an effort by President Nicolas Maduro to consolidate power, has sown panic across the energy industry and all but paralyzed state oil company PDVSA, according to people at the firm and in the sector. It is a remarkable downfall for the OPEC member home to the world's biggest crude reserves. 
""This is one of the worst collapses in history. It happened without an invasion like in Iraq, the breakup of a country like in the Soviet Union, or a civil war like in Libya,"" said Francisco Monaldi, a fellow in Latin American Energy Policy from Rice University's Baker Institute. Venezuela's oil ministry and PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] did not respond to a request for comment.
The output drop is likely to worsen a bitter recession and hyperinflation that have poor Venezuelans skipping meals or eating from the garbage. 
Opposition politicians say Venezuela's inefficient state-led economic model and rampant corruption are to blame for the oil industry's meltdown.
""This is the most irresponsible act against the Venezuelan people. They destroyed the industry that generates almost 96 percent of the country's foreign revenue,"" said opposition lawmaker Elias Matta. 
Socialist Maduro retorts that U.S.-backed opposition supporters have sabotaged the oil sector. 
HOW LOW WILL IT GO?
Venezuela's oil gloom is set to persist this year, with the main question among analysts just how low its production will fall. 
Just in December, Venezuela's output sank by 216,000 bpd from November to 1.621 million bpd, the OPEC figures showed, a 29-percent drop from December 2016 levels. 
Venezuela's new oil czar, former housing minister General Manuel Quevedo, has vowed that output will rise to more than 2.4 million bpd this year. But Quevedo, who has no experience in the energy sector, has yet to provide a detailed plan. 
January has seen an unprecedented surge in resignations, spurred by dislike of the new management and salaries that often do not allow workers to eat properly, current and former PDVSA employees say.
""They're desperate to maintain production. Increasing it is too difficult. Internal conditions are devastating,"" said one PDVSA employee, who asked to remain anonymous, referring to Quevedo's output recovery plan.
Still, the most vulnerable oilfields have already clocked the sharpest drops, according to Monaldi, which could limit this year's decline. He forecasts production to fall another 250,000 bpd-350,000 bpd in 2018, starting from December's average. 
Control Risks and Oxford Economics forecast a 470,000-bpd fall as PDVSA's unexperienced management struggle to reverse low investment, cronyism, lack of payment, and equipment theft.
Oil consultancy Energy Aspects expects a drop of at least 200,000 bpd in 2018, helping to balance an oversupplied global oil market. 
""Underperformance by Venezuela helps OPEC to reach its overall (production cut) target quicker for sure. Once balance is achieved, they will taper the cuts,"" Amrita Sen, co-founder of Energy Aspects, told Reuters.
A further production fall could also push cash-strapped Venezuela into full default, which experts say would be one of the largest and messiest credit events in history. Maduro has said Venezuela is willing to restructure its foreign debt, including some $60 billion in bonds issued by PDVSA and the government, but the country has been late with bond payments in the last few months.

As Venezuela is still making efforts to pay, holders of some of the world's highest yielding debt bonds have so far been tolerant of the delays, but that could change if Venezuela is perceived to no longer have enough income to pay.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for February delivery fell 2 cents to settle at $63.95 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent fell 0.12% to trade at $69.30 a barrel.
Crude oil prices pared gains heading into settlement as traders weighed a sharp rebound in production against a fall in crude supplies for the ninth week in a row while an unexpected fall in product inventories failed to lift sentiment.
Following a weather-related drop in the previous week, U.S. crude production rose by 258,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.75 million barrels per day last week, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported. US output is expected to rise above 10 million bpd in the coming weeks.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 6.86 million barrels for the week ended Jan. 12, beating expectations for  of a draw of 3.54 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – rose by 3.62 million barrels, slightly above expectations for a rise of 3.43 million barrels, while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil –  unexpectedly fell by 3.89 million barrels, confounding expectations for a rise of 86,000 barrels.
Fears over an uptick in US production were underscored in OPEC's monthly report as the oil cartel warned that higher oil prices are “bringing more supply to the market, particularly in North America and specifically tight oil.”
OPEC forecasts total non-OPEC to reach 58.8 million bpd in 2018, while global oil demand growth is expected to rise to 1.5 million bpd."

Gold futures for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $11.20, or 0.84%, to $1,327.90 a troy ounce.
Yields on United States 10-Year reached a ten-month high amid strong China economic growth data and rising expectations for faster inflation growth, which pressured gold prices to retreat from four-month highs.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. 
The fall in gold futures come amid comments from Macquarie warning that risk of a reversal in gold prices is rising, as it is “harder for gold to ignore the impressive snapback in real yields” since the turn of the year.
The bank said $1,320 to $1,325 is the support zone for gold prices, adding that the market will likely find buyers around these levels. 
Despite the bank’s warning, traders remain bullish on the yellow metal as data last week showed they increased their bullish bets on gold for the fourth-straight week.
Speculative net long position in gold rose by 40,000 contracts to a net long 203,300 contracts, a six-week high, according to the most recent Commitment of Traders (COT) report. 
In other precious metal trade, silver futures fell 1.29% to $16.95 a troy ounce, while platinum futures fell 0.42% to $1006.70. 
Copper rose 0.34% to $3.20, while natural gas fell 2.41% to $3.16. Natural gas futures came under pressure despite an Energy Information Administration report showing natural gas storage levels fell more than expected. "
577,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 01:54PM ET</span>",Nigeria sues JP Morgan for $875 million over Malabu oilfield deal,"By Libby George and Julia Payne
LONDON (Reuters) - Nigeria has filed a claim against  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) for more than $875 million, accusing it of negligence in transferring funds from a disputed 2011 oilfield deal to a company controlled by the country's former oil minister.
A spokeswoman for JP Morgan dismissed the accusation on Thursday, saying the firm ""considers the allegations made in the claim to be unsubstantiated and without merit"".
The suit filed in British courts relates to a purchase of the offshore OPL 245 oilfield in Nigeria by oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Eni in 2011.
At the core of the case is a $1.3 billion payment from Shell and Eni to secure the block that the lawsuit says was deposited into a Nigerian government escrow account managed by JP Morgan.
The lawsuit said JP Morgan then received a request from finance ministry workers to transfer more than $800 million of the funds to accounts controlled by the previous operator of the block, Malabu Oil and Gas, itself controlled by former oil minister Dan Etete. 
The lawsuit said that JP Morgan then transferred the funds to two accounts controlled by Etete, without sufficient due diligence to make sure the money did not leave accounts controlled by the Nigerian government.
Reuters was unable to reach either Etete or Malabu for comment.
MILAN CASE
The filing seen by Reuters was made in London in November on behalf of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and says that JP Morgan acted with gross negligence by allowing the transfer of the money without further checks.
It said JP Morgan should have known that, under Nigerian law, the money should never have been transferred to an outside company.
""If the defendant acted with reasonable care and skill and/or conducted reasonable due diligence it would or should have known or at least suspected ... that it was being asked to transfer funds to third parties who were seeking to misappropriate the funds from the claimant and/or that there was a significant risk that this was the case,"" the filing said. 
Late last year, a Milan judge ruled that Shell and Eni must stand trial in Italy, where Eni is headquartered, for a separate legal case in which Milan prosecutors allege bribes were paid to Etete and others as part of the same oilfield deal, including sums that went to Etete's Malabu.[nL8N1OK25L]
Both Eni and Shell have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in relation to that case. Malabu has never commented on the case and Reuters has not been able to contact it. [nL8N1HI1NA]
Shell last year said it knew some of its payment to the Nigerian government as part of the deal would go to Malabu ""to settle its claim on the block"", but that it was a legal transaction. [nL8N1HJ4EN] [nL8N1OK25L]
There are also ongoing investigations regarding the deal in Nigeria and the Netherlands, where Shell is based. [nL8N1O53PS][nL5N1FG757]
The license for the offshore block was awarded to Malabu in 1998 under then-President Sani Abacha, but Shell finalised a deal for the block with the Nigerian government in 2011.

A British court, in a judgment late last year that agreed to return to Nigeria $85 million in frozen funds related to the deal, said that Malabu was controlled by Etete. [nL8N1N244M]

Crude oil for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $0.19, or 0.30%, to trade at $63.78 a barrel by 11:02AM ET (16:02GMT) compared to $63.49 ahead of the report.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 6.861 million barrels in the week ended January 12. Market analysts' had expected a crude-stock draw of 3.536 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Wednesday reported a supply draw of 5.121 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 4.184 million barrels last week, the EIA said. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 412.7 million barrels as of last week, according to press release, which the EIA considered to be “in the middle of the average range for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 3.620 million barrels, compared to expectations for a build of 3.426 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles fell by 3.887 million barrels, compared to forecasts for an increase of 0.086 million.
The report came out one day later than usual due to Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday.
Meanwhile, Brent's premium to the WTI crude contract stood at $6.30 a barrel by 11:15AM ET (16:15GMT), compared to a gap of $5.41 by close of trade on Wednesday.
Prices have increased around 13% since early December, benefiting from production cut efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia. The producers agreed in December to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
Analysts and traders have recently warned that U.S. shale oil producers could ramp up production in the coming weeks as they look to take advantage of higher prices, potentially derailing an OPEC-led effort to curb excess supply.
In fact, OPEC raised its forecast for oil supply from non-member countries in 2018 on Thursday. In its monthly report, the cartel said outside producers would boost supply by 1.15 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, up from 990,000 bpd expected previously.
""Higher oil prices are bringing more supply to the market, particularly in North America and specifically tight oil,"" OPEC said in the report, using another term for shale.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for February delivery fell 0.3 cents to $1.86.64a gallon by 11:19AM ET (16:19GMT), while February heating oil dropped 0.7 cents to $2.0617 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for February delivery traded down 15.3 cents to $3.079 per million British thermal units."
579,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 10:43AM ET</span>",Natural Gas Futures Plunge After Weekly Storage Data,"Investing.com - Natural gas futures declined on Thursday, falling to the lowest levels of the session after data showed that domestic supplies in storage fell less than forecast last week.
Front-month U.S. natural gas futures sank 9.3 cents, or around 2.9%, to $3.139 per million British thermal units (btu) by 10:43AM ET (1543GMT). Futures were at around $3.191 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. fell by 183 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Jan. 12, below forecasts for a withdrawal of 199 bcf.
That compared with a whopping decline of 359 bcf in the preceding week, which was the highest on record, a fall of 243 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 203 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.584 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 368 bcf, or around 12.5%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 362 bcf, or roughly 12.3%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
U.S. gas futures rallied 3.3% on Wednesday to their strongest level since mid-May, as below freezing temperatures across most parts of the U.S. Northeast boosted heating-demand expectations.
Natural gas prices typically rise during the winter months as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.

580,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 09:00AM ET</span>","OPEC sees more oil supply from rivals, countering its cuts and Venezuelan woes","By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC has raised its forecast for oil supply from non-member countries in 2018 as higher prices encourage U.S. shale drillers to pump more, offsetting an OPEC-led deal to clear a supply glut and a deepening plunge in Venezuelan production.
In a monthly report on Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said outside producers would boost supply by 1.15 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, up from 990,000 bpd expected previously.
""Higher oil prices are bringing more supply to the market, particularly in North America and specifically tight oil,"" OPEC said in the report, using another term for shale.
OPEC, Russia and several other non-OPEC producers began to cut supply a year ago to get rid of a global glut of crude that had built up since 2014. They have extended the pact until the end of 2018.
The OPEC forecast of higher rival supply could add to a debate about the effectiveness of keeping the curbs in place. A ministerial monitoring panel meets this weekend in Oman and is expected to discuss the eventual exit strategy from the deal.
But the forecast was balanced by figures in the report showing OPEC's compliance with the supply cuts remained high in December and a further sharp slide in Venezuelan oil output.
Oil prices edged higher after the report was released to trade above $69 a barrel and later steadied. Prices are close to the highest since December 2014.
In a further sign excess supply is easing, OPEC said inventories in developed economies declined by 16.6 million barrels in November to 2.933 billion barrels, 133 million above the five-year average.
OPEC's stated goal is to reduce stocks to the five-year average.
VENEZUELA, UAE
OPEC's production in December based on figures it collects from secondary sources showed overall production rising.
Total output rose by 42,000 bpd to 32.42 million bpd, led by a gain in Nigeria which along with Libya was exempted from the supply cut because unrest had curbed their production.
But adherence by the 11 OPEC members with output targets rose to 129 percent, according to a Reuters calculation based on the OPEC figures, higher than 121 percent in November based on last month's report.
The figures that OPEC members reported themselves showed deeper declines in production.
Venezuela, whose output is dropping amid an economic crisis, told OPEC its production sank by about 216,000 bpd to 1.621 million bpd in December, believed to be the lowest in decades.
The UAE, which lagged many of its peers on compliance last year, said it cut output by 38,000 bpd to below its OPEC target for the first time. The compliance improvement comes as the country prepared to assume the rotating OPEC presidency in 2018.
With outside producers expected to pump more, OPEC in the report cut its estimate of global demand for its crude in 2018 by 60,000 bpd to 33.09 million bpd.
Should OPEC keep pumping at December's level and other things remain equal, the market could move into a deficit of about 670,000 bpd next year, suggesting inventories will be drawn down further.
Last month's report pointed to a similar deficit of about 700,000 bpd.

1. Bitcoin Storms Back Above $10,000 After Selloff
The prices of major cryptocurrencies rebounded sharply, with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple all enjoying strong gains after suffering their worst two-day selloff in more than a year.
Bitcoin was up around 11% at $11,155, following a double-digit drop a day earlier that dragged it to its lowest level since late November at $9,231 and sparking chatter of a bursting bubble.
Among other digital currencies, Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was up 12% at $991.90.
Meanwhile, Ripple's XRP token was trading at $1.4150, up around 33% for the day.
This week’s selling has been blamed in large part on worries about increased regulatory scrutiny in South Korea and other countries.
2. Global Stock Market Rally Showing No Signs of Slowing 
The rally in global stock markets showed no signs of slowing, as optimism for continued strong global growth and improving corporate earnings supported appetite for riskier assets.
Most major indexes in Asia closed higher, aided by strength in regional tech companies. Among notable standouts, Japan's Nikkei reached its strongest level since late 1991 earlier before ending down around 0.4%.
In Europe, the majority of the continent's bourses got off to an upbeat start, as investors monitored the release of fresh corporate earnings.
On Wall Street, U.S. stock futures pointed to a flat open as investors kept an eye on earnings from the likes of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS),  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) and  American Express  (NYSE:AXP).
U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday and the Dow closed above 26,000 for the first time as investors' expectations for higher earnings lifted stocks across the board.
3. Dollar Stays on the Backfoot, 10-Year Bond Hits 2.6%
The U.S. dollar failed to see much of a bounce back from recent lows, as investors kept an eye on upcoming U.S. data to gauge if the world's largest economy is strong enough to withstand multiple rate hikes in 2018.
The Commerce Department is to publish a report on building permits and housing starts for December at 8:30AM ET (1330GMT).
Besides the housing-related data, Thursday's calendar also features a survey on manufacturing conditions in the Philadelphia region as well as weekly jobless claims figures.
The dollar index, which gauges the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.2% at 90.45, not far from Tuesday's three-year low of 89.98.
Meanwhile, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose above the 2.6%-level for the first time since March, reaching an overnight high of 2.615%.
The majority of economists believe that the Fed will hike rates in March, followed by another hike in June, with a third move higher arriving in December, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
4. Oil Prices Tread Water Ahead of EIA Weekly Supply Report
Crude prices were largely unchanged as investors looked ahead to weekly data from the U.S. on stockpiles of crude and refined products.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its weekly report on oil supplies at 11:00AM ET (1600GMT), amid analyst expectations for a decline of 3.5 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories are expected to rise by 3.4 million barrels while stocks of distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, are forecast to increase by 8,600 barrels.

583,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2018 05:05AM ET</span>",Shady triangle: Southeast Asia's illegal fuel market,"By Henning Gloystein and John Geddie
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - An alleged oil heist in Singapore that has already led to 20 arrests, the seizure of at least one tanker and allegations that thieves siphoned thousands of tonnes of fuel from Shell's biggest refinery is shining a spotlight on an illegal trade worth tens of billions of dollars worldwide.
Working routes in a triangle of sea anchored by Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore and encompassing the oil facilities of Malaysia, the smugglers take advantage of a difficult-to-patrol sea and enticing black market prices, experts say.
The suspects in the latest case are accused of stealing oil from Royal Dutch Shell's (L:RDSa) Pulau Bukom refinery, often during business hours, and distributing it around the region.
Several of the men charged worked for Shell. Employees of a major Singaporean fuel trading company and a London-listed business that inspects and certifies cargos have also been charged.
""Siphoning off fuel is a common thing in Southeast Asia. There is a huge black market for it,"" said Ben Stewart, commercial manager of the shipping security firm Maritime Asset Security and Training, which has helped authorities in the region fight fuel theft and smuggling.
Singapore is by far the world's biggest ship refueling port, and Southeast Asia's petroleum refining hub. Hundreds of vessels pass through the small city-state's waters every day.
Security officers say the sheer amount of traffic makes checking every ship impossible, opening the door to illegal trade.
In most cases, oil is discreetly siphoned from legal storage tanks and sold into the black market. But there have also been thefts at sea and even hijackings of entire ships to steal their fuel.
Data from the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP), based in Singapore, shows more than half of the serious shipping incidents reported in the past year have occurred off the east coast of the Malaysian peninsula.
Some officials put the value of the illegal trade in Southeast Asia at $2 billion to $3 billion per year. But Yousuf Malik, principal at security consultancy Defence IQ, estimated about 3 percent of Southeast Asia's consumed fuel is sourced illegally, worth $10 billion a year.
""The scale of the illegal oil trade varies with oil prices – when oil prices are high, so is the level of smuggling,"" said Praipol Koomsup, former Thai vice minister of energy and professor at Thammasat University.
Crude oil prices (LCOc1) have risen by more than 50 percent since mid-2017 to about $70 per barrel, the highest level in over three years. That increases the black market demand in poorer Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam and Thailand.
""Smuggled oil has been known to be sold to factories for industrial use, or unnamed roadside oil stations. Regular citizens and fishermen are involved in the smuggling,"" Koomsup said.
OPEN SEA FUEL STATIONS
Several fuel traders told Reuters that the illegal sale of fuel is common enough that companies plan for losses of 0.2-0.4 percent of ordered cargo volumes.
Stewart said one common method of theft involves a simple fudging of paperwork at sea: captains overstate how much fuel their ship is using, then sell the excess. 
Sometimes entire ships are captured for their fuel cargo.
When fuel is stolen on such a large scale, it tends to be transferred to other ships at sea. 
Legal ship-to-ship transfers frequently happen between oil tankers in registered zones. In the South China Sea, however, illegal traders use purpose-built ships - with some even disguised as fishing trawlers - to take in and distribute fuel.
According to ReCAAP, the waters around the remote Natuna Islands, which sit between peninsular Malaysia and Borneo but belong to Indonesia, are a hot spot for piracy and illegal fuel transfers. 
The Atlantic Council, a policy research group, said many of the region's illegal fuel operations had links to organized crime.
Police in Thailand and Vietnam said most illegal fuel comes into the country by sea, usually transported on mid-size trawlers in unmarked drums. Smaller vessels then bring the fuel ashore for sale on the street.
""The coasts of Thailand and Vietnam are vast, and its cities big. To catch or even trace the illegal fuel in this area is virtually impossible. That's why it happens,"" said one security source, speaking on the condition of anonymity as he was not cleared to talk to media about contraband operations.
THE BUKOM HEIST
Bukom, just south of Singapore, is an island serving just one purpose: 1.5 square kilometers (0.6 square miles) of tropical land devoted to the biggest petroleum refinery owned by Anglo-Dutch Shell. It can process 500,000 barrels of crude oil per day.
As global markets were gearing up for a new year in early January, Singapore authorities conducted coordinated raids across the city-state, arresting 20, charging 14 Singaporean and Vietnamese men, and seizing millions of dollars in cash. They even confiscated an oil tanker.
At the heart of the police operations is Bukom, where suspects, including current and former Shell employees, are accused of stealing oil worth millions of dollars in the past six months.
Singapore's biggest marine fuel supplier, Sentek, last weekend saw its marketing and operations manager, as well as a cargo officer, charged in connection with the case.
Another person charged works for Intertek (L:ITRK) in Singapore, a British-listed company specializing in quality and quantity assurance, including for fuel products.
In a statement to Reuters, Shell said, “Fuel theft is an industry problem globally and not something that anyone can solve on their own."" The company added that it was working with governments and ReCAAP to address the issue.
A representative for Intertek was not immediately available for comment. Sentek declined to comment.
A lawyer representing one of the accused men said he had not yet had opportunity to obtain instructions from his client. Lawyers for some of the others charged were not immediately available for comment.
The Prime South, the small 12,000-tonne Vietnamese tanker police seized, frequently shipped fuel between Singapore and Ho Chi Minh City. The ship had also recently made stops at Rayong, Thailand.
Between ports, the tanker often switched off its transponder, which every merchant vessel is required to carry.
The scale of the theft was big enough that Shell did not think it could handle the case internally. Instead, in August the company contacted authorities, triggering one of the biggest police operations in Singapore in years.
Police investigations are ongoing. The charges in court documents allege the suspects in the Singapore case stole over $5 million worth of oil. 
Globally, oil theft could be worth as much as $133 billion, said Malik of Defence IQ.

""Its sheer scale and the flows of illicit cash related to oil and fuel theft and smuggling exacts a toll on virtually every aspect of the economy,"" Malik said.

Oil traders are also looking ahead to a monthly report from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties due later in the session to assess global oil supply and demand levels. The data will give traders a better picture of whether a global rebalancing is taking place in the oil market.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday on a reported decline in U.S. crude inventories, and as rebels in Nigeria threatened to attack the country's petroleum infrastructure.
However, prices stayed below recent three-year highs as fuel supplies remain ample and as refineries scaled back operations.
Brent crude futures were at $69.56 at 0255 GMT, up 18 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last close. On Monday, they hit their highest since December, 2014 at $70.37 a barrel.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $64.25 a barrel, up 28 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement. WTI marked a December-2014 peak of $64.89 a barrel on Tuesday.
Traders said prices had been pushed up after reports that Nigeria's militant group Niger Delta Avengers threatened to launch attacks on the country's oil sector in the next few days.
Markets were also supported by a drop in available crude inventories.
""Prices ... rallied on the back of noticeable de-stocking of crude inventories,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at future brokerage Forex.com.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.1 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 12 to 411.5 million, according to the American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday.
The tighter supplies come on the back of supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, who started to withhold production in January last year. The cuts are set to last through 2018.
Despite this, analysts warned that the recent oil price rally, which has lifted crude by around 14 percent since early December, may be about to run out of steam.
""The upside is now limited for oil prices ... U.S. oil producers will ramp up production in the coming months ... U.S. shale oil output will increase by a good 111,000 barrels per day (bpd) next month to 10 million bpd, and ... will rise to about 11 million bpd by the end of next year. This would put the U.S. on par with Saudi Arabia and Russia's output,"" Razaqzada said.
The API data also showed a well supplied fuel product market, which could mean lower crude demand going forward.
U.S. refinery crude runs fell by 420,000 bpd and refined product stocks rose, implying a well supplied market.
Gasoline stocks rose by 1.8 million barrels while distillate fuels stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, climbed by 609,000 barrels, the API data showed.

Official U.S. oil inventory and production data is due on Thursday from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Futures were little changed in New York after backing down from a three-year high on Tuesday. Strict adherence by OPEC, Russia and other major producers to self-imposed supply limits has been counterbalanced by concern that hedge fund managers may begin unwinding a record level of bullish bets on crude prices.
“The market continues to take support from signs that OPEC and Russia’s compliance with their production cuts is really high and it doesn’t seem that there are any worries that there is cheating going on yet,” Gene McGillian, a market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, said by telephone.
Despite Tuesday’s price drop, crude remains close to levels last seen in December 2014. The Organization of Petroleum Countries and allied crude producers complied with their output limits at a rate of 125 percent in December, up from 122 percent a month earlier. Discipline within the group should remain high this year, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Bakheet Al-Rashidi told reporters in Kuwait City. Citgroup Inc. said the cartel and its allies have already achieved their supply goals.

The OPEC-led group won’t be discussing how to end output cuts when they meet this weekend in Oman despite the recent run-up in crude prices, Al-Rashidi said.
“There is no plan at all to talk about any exit strategy,” he said. “We are committed until the end of the year, this is the agreement.”
U.S. crude inventories probably declined by 3 million barrels last week, according to the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The U.S. Energy Information Administration is scheduled to release its weekly tally on Thursday. Stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma, pipeline hub probably fell by 2.5 million barrels last week, according to a forecast compiled by Bloomberg.
“You continue to see the affects of increased demand and the production cut basically erasing that glut and supply that we had and that’s why the market continues to push higher,” McGillian said. “We’ll have to wait and see what the inventory report shows tomorrow.”
The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute is scheduled to release its stockpiles data on Wednesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices weakened following early gains on Wednesday, but remained underpinned by tightening supply and strong global demand.
Tighter fundamentals have lifted both crude futures benchmarks about 13 percent above levels in early December, helped by production curbs by OPEC and Russia, as well as by healthy demand growth.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $68.90 a barrel at 1314 GMT, down 25 cents from the last close, after hitting $69.37. Brent on Monday rose to $70.37 a barrel, its highest since December 2014.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $63.63 a barrel, down 10 cents on the day and down from an earlier high of $63.96. WTI hit $64.89 on Tuesday, also the highest since December 2014.
""Currently there is no reason to believe that there has been a significant change in the underlying fundamental sentiment and the sell-off is, so far, viewed as a technical correction,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst with PVM Oil Associates in London. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia have been curbing production since January last year and the cuts are set to last through 2018.
The curbs have coincided with healthy demand and solid economic growth, and as a result the market has tightened, helping to push prices up more than 50 percent from June 2017.
But markets may come under pressure from rising U.S. production, analysts say. 
On Tuesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said it expected the country's oil output to rise in February, with production from shale rising by 111,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 6.55 million bpd.
U.S. crude output  is expected to soon break through 10 million bpd, challenging top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Norbert Ruecker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer, also said that ""hedge fund expectations for further rising prices have reached excessive levels,"" threatening prices. 
Money managers have raised the bullish positions in WTI and Brent crude futures and options to a record, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Intercontinental Exchange.
BMI Research said seasonally high refining run rates from the northern hemisphere winter season were set to fall substantially as the end of winter approaches.
Brent spot crude futures contracts have already moved out of winter, now trading for March delivery.

""This will act as a substantial drag on global crude demand in Q1 and feeds into our bearish short-term outlook on Brent,"" BMI said.

A global slump in oil prices since late 2014 and mounting debt have forced the Mexican oil firm to seek partners to help fund key projects.
So far, Pemex has invested $1.24 billion in the $2.6 billion coking plant project, according to the company. Pemex's partner will need to finance the rest of the project, one of the sources said. 
The Tula facility, Pemex's second largest among six domestic refineries, has the capacity to process 315,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude. However, it only processed an average of 219,000 bpd in the first 11 months of 2017.
Pemex has said that the new coking plant will increase the refinery's gasoline output by 40 percent by allowing for the processing of fuel oil.

The construction of the plant began at the end of 2014 and is expected to be completed in 2021 by the new partner.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices dropped off three-year highs on Tuesday as traders booked profits but healthy demand underpinned prices near $70 per barrel, a level not seen since the market slump in 2014.
Prices have been driven up by oil production curbs in OPEC nations and Russia, and demand amid healthy economic growth. 
Imports to India, the world's third-biggest oil consumer, rose by about 1.8 percent in 2017 to a record 4.37 million barrels per day (bpd) as the country boosted purchases to feed its expanded refining capacity.
Brent futures (LCOc1) fell $1.11, or 1.6 percent, to settle at $69.15 a barrel after hitting a session low of $68.83. The global benchmark hit a peak of $70.37 on Monday, matching a high from December 2014 at the start of a three-year market decline.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) ended at $63.73 a barrel, down 57 cents, or 0.9 percent. WTI hit a December 2014 peak of $64.89 earlier in the session.
""It's such a quiet day ... I think this is a pause as you try and decide what the rise in rig counts means and what the Russia comments mean,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. 
Reacting to the three-year price high, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the oil market was not yet balanced and that the global deal to cut output should continue as the price rise could be due to cold weather.
The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose by 10 oil rigs last week to 752 and is much higher than a year ago when only 522 rigs were active. [RIG/U]
""All in all, this is still a pretty positive day because even though there is no news to drive prices, you're not giving up much ground here,"" Haworth said.
Most analysts and market participants said oil is vulnerable to profit taking as hedge funds and money mangers have amassed a record number of bullish bets on U.S. crude. 
In addition, trading was thin on Monday due to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday in the United States.
Fundamentally, oil has been pushed higher by an effort led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia to withhold production since January last year. The cuts are set to last through 2018.
The restraint has coincided with healthy oil demand, pushing up crude by almost 15 percent since early December.
""This rally has been driven first by robust fundamentals, with strong demand growth and high OPEC compliance accelerating,"" U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note. 
""We see increasing upside risks to our $62 per barrel Brent and $57.5 per barrel WTI forecast for the coming months.""
Other banks, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), have raised their price forecasts. 
""Our view is that prices are overheated, and will correct lower,"" SocGen said in a note. ""We believe that the current situation, with strong uplift from fundamentals, non-fundamentals, and geopolitics all at the same time, is not sustainable.""
A factor that held back crude prices in 2017, the surge in U.S. production, has stalled at least temporarily due to icy winter weather. 
U.S. production  has fallen from 9.8 million barrels per day in December to 9.5 million bpd currently. Oil production in North Dakota rose 11,000 bpd to 1,195,000 bpd in November, monthly data showed.
However, most analysts still expect U.S. output to break above 10 million bpd soon.

U.S. shale production for February is expected to rise by 111,000 bpd to 6.55 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange WTI crude futures for January delivery fell 57 cents to settle at $63.73 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent fell 76 cents to trade at $69.50 a barrel.
It what was a thin trading day, following the Martin Luther King holiday Monday, oil prices fell as traders took profit on the recent rally which saw both Brent crude and WTI crude prices hit three-year highs supported by rising global demand growth and OPEC’s ongoing commitment to the output-cut pact.
“We see that the market is becoming balanced. We see that the market surplus is decreasing, but the market is not completely balanced yet,” he told reporters. “Of course, we need to continue monitoring the situation,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak.
Rising US oil production, however, remains a concern for investors as data last week showed the number of U.S. oil rigs drilling for oil, an early indicator of future production, rose by 10 to 752, its highest level in more than four months.
Production has yet to rise above 10 million barrels per day (bpd) as data on Friday showed US oil production dropped by the most since October as the “bomb cyclone” winter storm disrupted output.
That said, however, sentiment on oil prices at current levels remains positive as Morgan Stanley raised its Brent forecast for the third quarter of 2018 to $75 per barrel, up from $63 per barrel.
“With many equity markets at all-time highs, interest rates still low, and oil prices lagging their usual correlation with inflation this is should keep oil futures well underpinned,” said Morgan Stanley in a note to clients."

Front-month U.S. natural gas futures tumbled 13.7 cents, or around 4.3%, to $3.062 per million British thermal units (btu) by 8:10AM ET (1310GMT). It touched its best level since early Nov. 15 at $3.224 last Friday.
U.S. gas futures did not settle on Monday due to the Martin Luther King Day holiday.
Below freezing temperatures will continue to linger across most parts of the Northeast through Jan. 20, with light snow expected throughout the region.
However, Northeast temperatures were expected to return to seasonal levels from Jan. 21-to-28, with mild conditions dominating during the period, according to updated weather forecasting models.
Natural gas futures soared nearly 15% last week, after data showed the largest withdrawal on record of U.S. supplies in storage as freezing temperatures boosted heating demand.
Natural gas prices typically rise during the winter months as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 190 and 205 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Jan. 12.

Copper, aluminum and nickel slid more than 2 percent on Tuesday as investors focused on the rebounding dollar and evidence of ample supply in the physical market. Precious metals also retreated, with silver falling as much as 3.2 percent.
“We’ve had a significant rally across base metals, and it’s hard to justify a further move higher at these levels,” Warren Patterson, a commodities strategist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV, said by phone from Amsterdam. “There’s probably a fair bit of profit-taking going on.”
Read: One Thing Missing From Copper Boom Is Buyers of Actual Metal
Metals have been on a tear since May as enthusiasm over growth in China and demand from electric vehicles brought in new investors. The rally has been across base and precious metals, sending copper above $7,000 a metric ton for the first time in three years and palladium to a record.
COPPER
Copper dropped as much as 2.4 percent on Tuesday to $7,054 a ton. High stockpiles and a slack forward price curve, with LME spot prices trading below futures, suggest that suggest buyers aren’t yet rushing to secure copper as factories ramp up.
The metal advanced almost every day in December, but has started to retreat this month. Prices are down almost 3 percent so far in 2018.
 HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) has raised its copper price forecast, responding to a recent slump in the dollar and rebounding factory output growth that’s lending support across commodity markets in recent weeks.
“A lot of the wage negotiations taking place this year are taking place in the second half of the year,” Patterson said. “The market has been pricing in the risk premium quite early on.”

610,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 05:12AM ET</span>",Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, January 16:
1. Cryptocurrencies Plunge as Bitcoin Suffers Double-Digit Selloff
The prices of major cryptocurrencies plunged sharply, with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple all suffering severe double-digit percentage losses amid a broad-based selloff.
Declining Japanese and South Korean trading volumes as well as fears over rising scrutiny from global regulators were blamed for spooking the market.
Bitcoin was down around 18% at $11,276. It fell by more than 20% to a six-week low of $10,891 at one point. It is now down more than 40% from the record high in mid-December.
Ethereum, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was down 22% at $1,039, well below a lifetime-high of $1,423.20 reached on Saturday.
Meanwhile, Ripple's XRP token was trading at $1.2527, down around 31% for the day.
2018 has not started well for cryptocurrencies, with last week marking the second week in a row of poor performances.
2. Dow Futures Point to Big Open Ahead of  Citigroup  Earnings
Wall Street futures traded significantly higher, pointing to another record session when traders return from the long holiday weekend.
The blue-chip Dow futures were up 256 points, or around 1%, to a fresh record of 26,058 ahead of markets stateside re-opening following Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
S&P 500 futures rose 14 points, or around 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures added 34 points, or roughly 0.5%.
This week marks the first big week of the fourth-quarter earnings season, with Citigroup (NYSE:C) and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) the big names on the docket today.
3. Dollar Licks Its Wounds
The U.S. dollar languished near three-year lows, weighed by rising expectations that central banks in Japan and the euro zone could pare their monetary stimulus sooner than expected.
The dollar index, which gauges the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was last at 90.40, after dropping as low as 90.05 on Monday, when U.S. markets were closed. That was its deepest nadir since December 2014.
Against the yen, the dollar was at 110.62, after slumping to a four-month low at 110.33 on Monday.
The euro was at 1.2230, not far from a three-year peak of 1.2296 reached a day earlier.
The dollar has weakened broadly recently amid the view that the global economic recovery will outpace U.S. growth and prompt other major central banks, led by the ECB to begin unwinding loose monetary policy at a faster pace than has been expected.
4. Oil Falls From 2014 Highs on Rising U.S. Rig Count
Crude prices edged away from their strongest level since late 2014, as the market weighed rising U.S. drilling activity against ongoing efforts by major producers to cut output to reduce a global glut.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures dipped 0.1% to $64.28 per barrel, while Brent futures shed 0.7% to $69.75 per barrel.
Both benchmarks reached their best levels since Dec. 2014 in the prior session.
Analysts and traders have recently warned that U.S. shale oil producers could ramp up production in the coming weeks as they look to take advantage of higher prices, potentially derailing an OPEC-led effort to curb excess supply.
5. UK Inflation Posts First Decline in 6 Months 
British inflation eased for the first time in six months in December, thanks to the cost of air fares as well as games and toys.
The decline took the rate to 3.0% from 3.1% in November, which was the fastest in more than five years. A core measure of consumer-price growth slipped to a five-month low of 2.5%.
The Office for National Statistics said it's too early to say if the move is the “start of any longer-term reduction in the rate.”
The pound remained slightly lower following the data release, with GBP/USD down 0.2% at 1.3760.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2018 02:07AM ET</span>","U.S. oil industry set to break record, upend global trade","By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Surging shale production is poised to push U.S. oil output to more than 10 million barrels per day - toppling a record set in 1970 and crossing a threshold few could have imagined even a decade ago.
And this new record, expected within days, likely won't last long. The U.S. government forecasts that the nation's production will climb to 11 million barrels a day by late 2019, a level that would rival Russia, the world's top producer.
The economic and political impacts of soaring U.S. output are breathtaking, cutting the nation's oil imports by a fifth over a decade, providing high-paying jobs in rural communities and lowering consumer prices for domestic gasoline by 37 percent from a 2008 peak.
Fears of dire energy shortages that gripped the country in the 1970s have been replaced by a presidential policy of global ""energy dominance.""
""It has had incredibly positive impacts for the U.S. economy, for the workforce and even our reduced carbon footprint"" as shale natural gas has displaced coal at power plants, said John England, head of consultancy Deloitte's U.S. energy and resources practice.
U.S. energy exports now compete with Middle East oil for buyers in Asia. Daily trading volumes of U.S. oil futures contracts have more doubled in the past decade, averaging more than 1.2 billion barrels per day in 2017, according to exchange operator CME Group (NASDAQ:CME).
The U.S. oil price benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude, is now watched closely worldwide by foreign customers of U.S. gasoline, diesel and crude.
The question of whether the shale sector can continue at this pace remains an open debate. The rapid growth has stirred concerns that the industry is already peaking and that production forecasts are too optimistic. 
The costs of labor and contracted services have recently risen sharply in the most active oilfields; drillable land prices have soared; and some shale financiers are calling on producers to focus on improving short-term returns rather than expanding drilling.
But U.S. producers have already far outpaced expectations and overcome serious challenges, including the recent effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to sink shale firms by flooding global markets with oil.
The cartel of oil-producing nations backed down in November 2016 and enacted production cuts amid pressure from their own members over low prices - which had plunged to below $27 earlier that year from more than $100 a barrel in 2014.
Shale producers won the price war through aggressive cost-cutting and rapid advances in drilling technology. Oil now trades above $64 a barrel, enough for many U.S. producers to finance both expanded drilling and dividends for shareholders.
BOOMING OIL EXPORTS 
Efficiencies spurred by the battle with OPEC - including faster drilling, better well designs and more fracking - helped U.S. firms produce enough oil to successfully lobby for the repeal of a ban on oil exports. In late 2015, Congress overturned the prohibition it had imposed following OPEC's 1973 embargo.
The United States now exports up to 1.7 million barrels per day of crude, and this year will have the capacity to export 3.8 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Terminals conceived for importing liquefied natural gas have now been overhauled to allow exports. 
That export demand, along with surging production in remote locations such as West Texas and North Dakota, has led to a boom in U.S. pipeline construction. Firms including  Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI) and Enterprise Products Partners added 26,000 miles of liquids pipelines in the five years between 2012 and 2016, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Several more multi-billion-dollar pipeline projects are on the drawing board.
U.S. drillers say they can supply plenty more.
""We continue to see and drive improvements"" in drilling speed and efficiency, said Mathias Schlecht, a technology vice president at Baker Hughes,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's oilfield services business. 
New wells can be drilled in as little as a week, he said. A few years ago, it could take up to a month.
TECHNOLOGY OPENS UP NEW FIELDS
The next phase of shale output growth depends on techniques to squeeze more oil from each well. Companies are now putting sensors on drill bits to more precisely access oil deposits, using artificial intelligence and remote operators to get the most out of equipment and trained engineers.
As expanded investments push more producers to add wells in less productive regions, technology will help make those plays more profitable, said Kate Richard, chief executive of Warwick Energy Group, which owns interests in more than 5,000 U.S. wells.
In an interview, she estimated about a third of the money from private equity investments in shale will be used to wring more oil from overlooked regions.
Higher prices - up about $10 a barrel in the last two months - also may encourage the industry to work through a backlog of some 7,300 drilled-but-uncompleted shale wells that have built up because of crew and equipment shortages.
The higher prices have suppliers that provide hydraulic fracturing services, such as Keane Group and Liberty Oilfield Services, buying expensive new equipment in anticipation of more work.
U.S. fracking service revenues are expected to grow by 20 percent this year, approaching a record of $29 billion set in 2014, according to oilfield research firm Spears & Associates. 
OIL MAJORS JOIN SHALE FRAY
The shale revolution initially upended the traditional industry hierarchy, making billionaires out of wildcatters such as Harold Hamm, who founded Continental Resources, and the late Aubrey McClendon of Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK). 
Top U.S. oil firms such as  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) a decade ago turned much of their focus to foreign fields, leaving smaller firms to develop U.S. shale. Now they're back, buying shale companies, land and shifting more investments back home from overseas.
Exxon last year agreed to pay up to $6.6 billion for land in the Permian basin, the epicenter of U.S. shale. Chevron this year plans to spend $4.3 billion on shale development. 
The majors' shift is driving up costs for labor and drillable land in the region, another boost to wages and wealth in rural areas.
In the shale industry hub of Midland, Texas, unemployment has fallen to a mere 2.6 percent, said Willie Taylor, executive director of the Permian Basin Workforce Development Board, a group that helps firms find staff. 
Companies are now offering signing bonuses to attract workers to West Texas. One oil company flies workers to Midland from Houston weekly to fill a local labor void, he said.

""It was an employer's market,"" he said. ""Now it's more of a job seeker's market.""

Initial estimates point to a 3.89 million barrels weekly decline in crude stocks and a 2.625 million barrels build in gasoline supplies.
US West Texas Intermediate crude February contract rose 0.31% to $64.50 a barrel after overnight limited trading with the NYMEX exchange floor closed on Monday because of the Martin Luther King Day holiday. All electronic transactions will be booked with Tuesday's trades for settlement. Elsewhere, Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London fell 0.37% to $69.97 a barrel after crossing $70 overnight and earlier in Asia.
""The current level of backwardation in oil futures curves is still a relatively recent phenomenon,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients.
""If this persists for an extended period, we expect it will continue to attract inflows into the futures market. As these flows can be much larger than physical flows, this should drive oil futures prices higher during the course of this year. We raise our Brent forecast to $75/bbl by 3Q18.""
Overnight, crude oil prices were mixed on Monday, but they were still hovering near multi-year highs as overall optimism regarding the rebalancing of the market continued to support the commodity.
Oil prices dipped earlier, after data from  General Electric  (NYSE:NYSE:GE)'s Baker Hughes energy services unit showed that the number of oil drilling rigs climbed by 10 to 752 in the week to Jan. 5, the first increase to drilling numbers in five weeks.
But the commodity remained supported amid ongoing optimism that OPEC-led output cuts would continue to drain the market of excess supplies.
Futures have added around 13% since early December, benefiting from production cut efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The producers agreed in December to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
However, analysts and traders have warned that the recent rally could encourage U.S. shale oil producers to ramp up production as they look to take advantage of higher prices.

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Oil hovered near a three-year high above $70 a barrel on Monday on signs that production cuts by OPEC and Russia are tightening supplies, although analysts warned of a ""red flag"" due to surging U.S. production.
International benchmark Brent crude futures (LCOc1) last traded 29 cents higher at $70.16 by 1937 GMT, having risen to a high of $70.37 a barrel earlier in the session.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) gained 51 cents at $64.81 a barrel. Both benchmarks hit levels not seen since December 2014, although trading was thin due to a holiday in the United States.
A production-cutting pact between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers has given a strong tailwind to oil prices.
Growing signs of a tightening market after a three-year rout have bolstered confidence among traders and analysts.
""It’s catching a lot of people by surprise and I think (prices) are sustainable,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group. ""We're seeing the reality of strong demand and declining supplies.""
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) on Monday raised its 2018 Brent price forecast to $64 a barrel from $56, forecasting a deficit of 430,000 barrels per day (bpd) in oil production compared to demand this year.
""OPEC and non-OPEC producers remain committed to production cuts at the same time world oil demand continues to increase,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.
""As we go through 2018, the market is also going to continue to look at geopolitical supply disruptions that could occur in Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela.""
RED FLAG
Still, some analysts have warned that the 13 percent rally since the start of the year could peter out due to global refinery maintenance and rising North American production.
U.S. energy companies added 10 oil rigs in the week to Jan. 12, taking the number to 752, energy service firm Baker Hughes (N:GE) said on Friday. 
That was the biggest increase since June 2017. 
In Canada, energy firms almost doubled the number of rigs drilling for oil last week to 185, the highest level in 10 months.
Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy expects U.S. production to grow by 600,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a year earlier. 
""From a fundamental perspective, the surge in U.S. managed money raises a clear red flag for us. We see the U.S. complex as decidedly bearish over the next two months.""
But Flynn said a fast climb in U.S. output is not so clear.

""The realities of the shale market are starting to sink in. Shale producers have to add a lot of rigs, frack crews and add a lot of investment. It takes time to raise that production.""

Below freezing temperatures will continue to linger across most parts of the Northeast through Jan. 20, with light snow expected throughout the region.
However, Northeast temperatures were expected to return to seasonal levels from Jan. 21-to-28, with mild conditions dominating during the period, according to updated weather forecasting models.
Front-month U.S. natural gas futures shed 8.0 cents, or around 2.5%, to $3.120 per million British thermal units (btu) by 8:45AM ET (1345GMT). It touched its best level since early Nov. 15 at $3.224 in the last session.
It soared nearly 15% last week, after data showed the largest withdrawal on record of U.S. supplies in storage as freezing temperatures boosted heating demand.
Natural gas prices typically rise during the winter months as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 190 and 205 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Jan. 12.
That compares with a whopping decline of 359 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 243 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 203 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.767 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 415 bcf, or around 13.0%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 382 bcf, or roughly 12.1%, below the five-year average for this time of year.

Meanwhile, March Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., advanced 61 cents, or roughly 0.9%, to settle at $69.87 a barrel by close of trade. The contract broke above $70 on Thursday for the first time since December 2014.
For the week, Brent enjoyed a gain of about 3.3%, notching a four-week win streak.
Oil prices have added around 13% since early December, benefiting from production cut efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The producers agreed in December to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
However, analysts and traders have warned that the recent rally could encourage U.S. shale oil producers to ramp up production as they look to take advantage of higher prices.
The number of oil drilling rigs climbed by 10 to 752 in the week to Jan. 5, data from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s Baker Hughes energy services unit showed, the first increase to drilling numbers in five weeks.
In other energy trading, gasoline futures rose 1.2 cents, or 0.7%, to end at $1.849 a gallon on Friday, for a weekly gain of about 3.6%.
Heating oil inched up 0.8 cents, or 0.4%, to $2.085 a gallon, notching a weekly increase of around 1.3%.
Meanwhile, natural gas futures surged 11.6 cents, or 3.8%, to $3.200 per million British thermal units, the highest most-active contract settlement since early November. It ended nearly 15% higher for the week, after data showed the largest withdrawal on record in U.S. supplies in storage last week.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Wednesday and Thursday to further weigh what the impact of recent storm activity was on supply and demand.
The reports come out one day later than usual due to the Martin Luther King Day holiday on Monday.
Oil traders will also focus on monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency to assess global oil supply and demand levels.
The data will give traders a better picture of whether a global rebalancing is taking place in the oil market.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.
Wednesday
The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, is to publish its weekly report on U.S. oil supplies.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Saturday that the OPEC member's oil output capacity is nearing 5 million barrels per day, but the country will remain in full compliance with its output target under a global pact to cut supplies.
Luaibi said the supply cut agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC producers should continue despite a rise in oil prices.
""The market now is not 100 percent stable,"" he said at an industry conference in Abu Dhabi, adding that current oil prices could be sustained, but there might be some fluctuations.
For the week, Brent crude rose 3.3 percent, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude jumped 4.7 percent, having hit its hit its strongest since late 2014 at $64.77 on Thursday.
The deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia to cut 1.8 million barrels per day of crude, which started in January 2017, is due to last until the end of 2018. 
Luaibi said current Iraq's oil production is about 4.3 million barrels per day.
Despite the increase in oil production from the United States, ""so far there is a balance"" in the oil market, Luaibi said. 
""We are watching the market and the market is okay in terms of supply and demand balance. There’s still a gap, inventories are still high. The inventory level will decrease gradually and we will see how things will go,"" he told reporters.
Luaibi also said that his ministry plans to conclude three contracts with international gas companies by mid-2018 to utilize gas from Basra, Maysan and Nassiriyah southern provinces.
He said that by 2021, the country plans to ""reach zero gas flaring"".
Iraq is forced to flare some of the gas produced alongside crude oil as it lacks the facilities needed to capture and process it into usable fuel. 
The country has just one gas processing company, the Basrah Gas Company, a joint venture between Iraq's state-run South Gas Co., Shell (LON:RDSa) and Mitsubishi.

OPEC’s second-largest crude producer after Saudi Arabia, Iraq is seeking to increase its oil and gas income, which account for nearly all its public budget.

629,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>","U.S. ultimatum on nuclear deal, new sanctions draw Iran threat","By Andrey Ostroukh
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Iran said on Saturday it would retaliate against new sanctions imposed by the United States after President Donald Trump set an ultimatum to fix ""disastrous flaws"" in a deal curbing Tehran's nuclear program.
Trump said on Friday he would waive nuclear sanctions on Iran for the last time to give the United States and European allies a final chance to amend the pact. Washington also imposed sanctions on the head of Iran's judiciary and others.
Russia - one of the parties to the Iran pact alongside the United States, China, France, Britain, Germany and the European Union - called Trump's comments ""extremely negative.""
The ultimatum puts pressure on Europeans, key backers of the 2015 nuclear deal, to satisfy Trump, who wants the pact strengthened with a separate agreement within 120 days.
While approving the waiver on U.S. sanctions related to the nuclear deal, Washington announced other sanctions against 14 Iranian entities and people, including judiciary head Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, a close ally of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Describing sanctions against Larijani as ""hostile action"", Iran's Foreign Ministry said the move ""crossed all red lines of conduct in the international community and is a violation of international law and will surely be answered by a serious reaction of the Islamic Republic,"" state media reported.
It did not specify what any retaliation might involve.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had earlier said on Twitter that the deal was ""not renegotiable"" and that Trump's move ""amounts to desperate attempts to undermine a solid multilateral agreement.""
Iran says its nuclear program has only peaceful aims and says it will stick to the accord as long as others respect it. But it has said it would ""shred"" the deal if Washington quit.
""LAST CHANCE""
Trump, who has sharply criticized the deal reached in Barack Obama's presidency, had chafed at having to once again waive sanctions on a country he sees as a threat in the Middle East.
""Despite my strong inclination, I have not yet withdrawn the United States from the Iran nuclear deal,"" Trump said in a statement, saying the options were to fix ""the deal’s disastrous flaws, or the United States will withdraw.""
""This is a last chance,"" Trump said, pushing for a separate agreement and saying the United States would not waive sanctions again to keep Iran in the pact without such an agreement.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov called Trump's remarks ""extremely negative"", RIA state news agency reported. ""Our worst fears are being confirmed,” he said.
The EU said in a statement it had taken note of Trump’s decision and would assess its implications. ""It's going to be complicated to save the deal after this,"" said one European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Britain, France and Germany had called on Trump on Thursday to uphold the pact. 
Senior U.S. administration officials told reporters Trump would work with Europeans on a follow-on deal to enshrine triggers that the Iranian government could not exceed related to ballistic missiles.
Republican Senator Bob Corker said ""significant progress"" had been made on bipartisan congressional legislation to address ""flaws in the agreement without violating U.S. commitments.""
CONDITIONS
Trump laid out conditions to keep Washington in the deal. Iran must allow ""immediate inspections at all sites requested by international inspectors,"" he said, and ""sunset"" provisions imposing limits on Iran's nuclear program must not expire.
Trump said U.S. law must tie long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs together, making any missile testing by Iran subject to ""severe sanctions.""
The president wants U.S. Congress to modify a law that reviews U.S. participation in the nuclear deal to include ""trigger points"" that, if violated, would lead to the United States reimposing its sanctions, the official said.
This would not entail negotiations with Iran but would be the result of talks with European allies, the official said.
A decision to withhold a waiver would have effectively ended the deal between Iran and the other international signatories. The other parties to the agreement would have been unlikely to join the United States in reimposing sanctions.

Two EU diplomats said EU foreign ministers would discuss next steps at their next regular meeting on Jan. 22 in Brussels.

The metal used to curb pollution from gasoline-fueled engines climbed to a record in the spot market amid signs of robust demand. In China, Honda Motor Co.’s vehicle sales climbed 16 percent to a record last year. General Motors Co (NYSE:GM).’s sales in the Asian nation, the company’s biggest retail market, exceeded 4 million units last year for the first time.
Palladium climbed 56 percent in the spot market in 2017, while its counterpart in the futures market beat returns of 33 other most-actively traded commodities tracked by Bloomberg. Supplies of the metal are expected to tighten further. Palladium production will lag behind consumption until at least 2022,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a Dec. 11 report.
Palladium inventories in warehouses tracked by the New York Mercantile Exchange shrank 25 percent in December, capping a fourth straight annual decline, the longest streak since 2000.
The precious metal for immediate delivery climbed as much as 3.9 percent to $1,128.68 an ounce in New York, surpassing the record $1,125 set 17 years ago, according to Bloomberg generic pricing. Palladium traded at $1,123.48 at 2:46 p.m. in New York. On the Comex, the metal for March delivery settled at $1,105.35, after extending its climb to an all-time high.
“It’s the same supply-and-demand story that’s been driving palladium since last year,” Bob Haberkorn, a senior market strategist RJO Futures in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “It’s the better outlook for demand, from an industrial standpoint, and the squeeze in supply” that’s making palladium outperform other metals, he said.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange WTI crude futures for January delivery rose 54 cents to settle at $64.30 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 56 cents to trade at $83 a barrel.
The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S. rose by 10 to 752, its highest level in more than four months, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes.
The sharp uptick in US rigs drilling for oil did little to halt the rally in oil prices as investors remained optimistic that the bullish global economic growth would continue to fuel oil demand growth while major oil producers’ compliance with the deal to cut output would remain strong.
This comes as data earlier this week showed US crude oil production dropped by the most since October as the “bomb cyclone” winter storm has disrupted output.
That said, however, the steep run-up in oil prices above three-year highs has led some to question whether the current rally is on borrowed time.
“It is premature to expect further upside to be sustainable, at least until the market gains a better grasp of the pace of U.S. production growth,” said Michael Tran, a commodities strategist with RBC Capital Markets.
The four-week rally in crude prices comes as investors mulled over president Donald Trump’s decision to extend sanctions relief temporarily for Iran, keeping the Obama nuclear deal alive, dampening the prospect of a reduction in global supplies.
Ahead of Trump’s decision on the Iranian nuclear deal, some market participants were of the view that an end to sanctions relief for Iran would slashed the country’s oil exports significantly, ridding the market of excess supplies, extending the oil rally."

""On the other hand, most investors are still positioned to benefit from further price gains,"" he said.
Analysts and traders have warned about the risk of a price correction since the start of 2018, but they say overall market conditions remain strong, mainly due to output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia.

Relatively weak Chinese December oil data weighed on prices, traders and analysts said. China's crude imports in December fell 9 percent month-on-month to 33.7 million tonnes, or 7.97 million bpd, customs data showed.

This has contributed to a fall in Singapore refinery profit margins  to below $6 per barrel this month, their lowest seasonal level in five years, leading some refiners to scale down crude runs.

The initial public offering (IPO) will also include the Saudi stock exchange, Tadawul, and is still set for late 2018, the sources said. 
The shortlist means Tokyo, Singapore and Toronto are no longer in the running for what is likely to be the world's biggest IPO. Riyadh could raise as much as $100 billion in the sale of up to 5 percent of Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] if it achieves a projected $2 trillion valuation.

Saudi Aramco said in response to a Reuters request for comment: ""A range of listing options continue to be held under active review. However, no decision has been taken."" 
The Aramco listing is a centrepiece of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan championed by Prince Mohammad to reduce the dependence of the Saudi economy on oil.
Saudi officials have left the door open to other options for the Aramco IPO, including listing exclusively on Tadawul and a domestic listing coupled with a private placement to a strategic investor as a precursor to an international IPO. 
China has offered to buy up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco directly, sources told Reuters in October. Senior industry sources say Riyadh is keen on China, its biggest buyer of oil, becoming a cornerstone investor in the company.
The chief executive of the Saudi stock exchange, Khalid al-Hussan, told Reuters on Wednesday he believed Tadawul could handle the entirety of the IPO despite having a capitalization of about $450 billion in total. 
""As an exchange, it is natural for us to aspire to be the only place for listing and we are taking all necessary measures to be ready for that, if that is the decision. We are waiting for the decision,"" he said in a telephone interview. 
Saudi Arabia changed Aramco to a joint-stock company as of Jan. 1. A senior Aramco source told Reuters the change was ""a customary step in the preparation process"" for an IPO in Saudi Arabia.

The change also indicated the listing was moving ahead despite market speculation it could be delayed or totally shelved.

U.S. natural gas futures jumped 9.5 cents, or around 3.3%, to $3.002 per million British thermal units by 10:45AM ET (1545GMT). Futures were at around $3.015 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. declined by 359 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Jan. 5, compared to forecasts for a withdrawal of 318 bcf.
That surpassed the record draw of 287 billion cubic feet in the week ended Jan. 10, 2014, Energy Information Administration data showed.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.767 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 415 bcf, or around 13.0%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 382 bcf, or roughly 12.1%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Prices have gained around 5% so far this week as investors reacted to the severe winter storm hitting much of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard.

Crude oil prices continued their bullish start to the week as traders cheered signs of ongoing tightening in domestic crude oil supplies which offset a larger-than-expected build in both gasoline and distillate stockpiles.

For tax purposes refiners tend to ramp up activity at the end of the year burning through crude supplies but this activity traditionally slows down in January, supporting a build in product inventories.
Investor fears of rising US production capped upside momentum, however, despite data showing U.S. output fell by nearly 300,000 barrels a day to 9.49 million barrels a day (bpd).

Deputy Mines Minister Ricardo Labo said the proposed railway would start in the highland region of Apurimac and stretch 600 km (373 miles) to the coast, carrying concentrates from Chinese-owned MMG Ltd's Las Bambas mine and other copper and iron projects slated to come online in the next 15 years.
Preliminary estimates suggest the project would cost at least $2.4 billion and would likely be paid for through joint public-private financing, Labo said. But the transportation ministry must first study the proposal and determine if it would be feasible, he added.
A railway might help ease tensions between mining companies and farming communities in the Andes that have complained about the dust and noise created by hundreds of diesel trucks that transport MMG's copper over unpaved roads every week.
In 2016, a farmer near Las Bambas was killed in clashes with police in a protest over MMG's use of local roads, and three were killed in 2015 demonstrations against the mine. Villagers sometimes block roads used by Las Bambas to demand compensation or action from the government or company.
Peru's southern copper belt is expected to be a key source of the country's future copper output.
The railway could transport copper from future mines in the region, including deposits such as First Quantum Minerals Ltd's Haquira, Southern Copper Corp's Los Chancas, Panoro Minerals Ltd' Cotabambas and Buenaventura's Trapiche, said Labo.
Las Bambas alone produced about 453,000 tonnes of copper last year, said Labo.
""That kind of volume...requires more efficient transportation solutions, such as a railway,"" Labo said.
On Monday, Kuczynski had called for a railway to transport copper from Las Bambas as part of his government's renewed bid to focus on key infrastructure projects after he was nearly removed from office in the wake of a graft scandal.
""For example, in Las Bambas, I spoke with the Chinese. I told them, you've got to put a railway there,"" Kuczynski said in broadcast comments following a meeting with regional governors.
Kuczynski reiterated that his government still plans to pave roads around Las Bambas as promised.
Peru, the world's second biggest producer, expects to produce at least 3 million tonnes of copper in 2021.

Futures rose 1 percent in New York after the U.S. government said refiners and exporters withdrew almost 5 million barrels from storage last week. While the draw was smaller than the 11.2 million barrels reported in an industry tally on Tuesday, it still was the largest for this time of year since 2014. The last time winter stockpiles shrank at this pace was a decade ago.
Even though investors were expecting a massive draw, “it was still a very sizable one,” said Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC, which handles $16 billion in energy-related assets. We’re seeing “falling inventories and rising geopolitical risk and that signals higher oil prices.”
Prices have surged amid renewed optimism that cutbacks by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners are helping to drain a global glut. Tempering the rally is the concern that shale producers will boost U.S. output, which the EIA expects to top 11 million barrels a day in November 2019.
OPEC would try to talk down a Brent rally above $70 to cushion the impact on the global economy and rival supplies,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). said.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., on the other hand, predicted that war, Middle East tensions, Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un could drive crude toward $80.

Stockpiles in Cushing, Oklahoma, the nation’s biggest oil-storage hub, fell for a third week to the lowest in almost three years, while crude production ticked lower. As for fuels, the report showed a rise in gasoline and diesel supplies.
“The inventory report still shows that crude stocks are plummeting like a stone,” Adam Wise, who oversees an $8 billion energy portfolio at John Hancock Financial Services Inc. in Boston, said by telephone.

Additionally, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) raised its 2018 world oil demand growth forecast by 100,000 bpd from its previous estimate.
Official EIA stocks data is due at 1530 GMT on Wednesday. 
Oil prices have risen more than 13 percent since early December, and there are indications of overheating. Analysts warned that the market is ignoring U.S. production increases at its peril. 
The average price for Asian crude grades has risen to $70.62, Thomson Reuters Eikon data showed, which has pressured the region's refinery margins.
""Selective perception is the reason why the market is completely ignoring this just now,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Carsten Fritsch said of rising U.S. production. ""Attention is paid only to news that tallies with the picture of rising prices.""

Comex gold futures were up 0.69% at $1,322.80 a troy ounce by 08:30 a.m. ET (12:30 GMT), just off a four-month peak of 1,328.60 hit earlier in the day.
The U.S. dollar received no support after official data on Wednesday showed that U.S. import prices rose less than expected in December, while export prices unexpectedly fell.
Market participants were now focusing on the release of U.S. inflation data due on Friday, for clues on the potential pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
The greenback had initially strengthened after San Francisco Fed President John Williams said on Saturday that the Fed should raise interest rates three times this year given that economy will benefit from tax cuts.
The comments came a day after Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she expects about four interest rate hikes this year, thanks to solid U.S. economic growth and low unemployment.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.49% at 91.77, off the previous session's one-week high of 92.36.
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

657,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2018 08:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Trump's EPA aims to replace Obama-era climate, water regulations in 2018","By Valerie Volcovici and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will replace Obama-era carbon and clean water regulations and open up a national debate on climate change in 2018, part of a list of priorities for the year that also includes fighting lead contamination in public drinking water.
The agenda, laid out by EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt in an exclusive interview with Reuters on Tuesday, marks an extension of the agency’s efforts under President Donald Trump to weaken or kill regulations the administration believes are too broad and harm economic growth, but which environmentalists say are critical to human health.
""The climate is changing. That's not the debate. The debate is how do we know what the ideal surface temperature is in 2100?... I think the American people deserve an open honest transparent discussion about those things,” said Pruitt, who has frequently cast doubt on the causes and implications of global warming.
Pruitt reaffirmed plans for the EPA to host a public debate on climate science sometime this year that would pit climate change doubters against other climate scientists, but he provided no further details on timing or which scientists would be involved. 
Pruitt said among the EPA’s top priorities for 2018 will be to replace the Clean Power Plan, former President Barack Obama’s centerpiece climate change regulation which would have slashed carbon emissions from power plants. The EPA began the process of rescinding the regulation last year and is taking input on what should replace it. 
“A proposed rule will come out this year and then a final rule will come out sometime this year,” he said. He did not give any details on what the rule could look like, saying the agency was still soliciting comments from stakeholders.
He said the agency was also planning to rewrite the Waters of the United States rule, another Obama-era regulation, this one defining which U.S. waterways are protected under federal law. Pruitt and Trump have said the rule marked an overreach by including streams that are shallow, narrow, or sometimes completely dry - and was choking off energy development. 
Pruitt said that in both cases, former President Barack Obama had made the rules by executive order, and without Congress. ""We only have the authority that Congress gives us,"" Pruitt said.
Pruitt's plans to replace the Clean Power Plan have raised concerns by attorneys general of states like California and New York, who said in comments submitted to the EPA on Tuesday that the administrator should recuse himself because as Oklahoma attorney general he led legal challenges against it.
BIOFUELS AND STAFF CUTS
Pruitt said he hoped for legislative reform of the U.S. biofuels policy this year, calling it “substantially needed and important” because of the costs the regulation imposes on oil refiners.
The Renewable Fuel Standard, ushered in by former President George W. Bush as a way to help U.S. farmers, requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel supply every year. 
Refining companies say the EPA-administered policy costs them hundreds of millions of dollars annually and threatens to put some plants out of business. But their proposals to change the program have so far been rejected by the Trump administration under pressure from the corn lobby. 
The EPA in November slightly raised biofuels volumes mandates for 2018, after previously opening the door to cuts. 
The White House is now mediating talks on the issue between representatives of both sides, with input from EPA, and some Republican senators from states representing refineries are working on possible legislation to overhaul the program.
Pruitt said he also hoped Congress could produce an infrastructure package this year that would include replacing municipal water pipes, as a way of combating high lead levels in certain parts of the United States. 
“That to me is something very tangible very important that we can achieve for the American people,"" he said. 
Pruitt added that EPA also continuing its review of automobile fuel efficiency rules, and would be headed to California soon for more meetings with the California Air Resources Board to discuss them. 
California in 2011 agreed to adopt the federal vehicle emission rules through 2025, but has signaled it would opt out of the standards if they are weakened – a move that would complicate matters for automakers serving the huge California market.
In the meantime, Pruitt said EPA is continuing to reduce the size of its staff, which fell to 14,162 employees as of Jan. 3, the lowest it has been since 1998, under Ronald Reagan when the employment level was 14,400. The EPA employed about 15,000 when Obama left office. 

Nearly 50 percent of the EPA will be eligible to retire within the next five years, according to the agency.

U.S. natural gas futures tacked on 1.9 cents, or around 0.7%, to $2.942 per million British thermal units (btu) by 8:15AM ET (1315GMT).
It surged 8.8 cents, or 3.1%, on Tuesday as freezing temperatures stoked demand for the heating fuel across the U.S. Northeast.
Early withdrawal estimates for this Thursday’s storage data range from 320 billion cubic feet to 345 billion cubic feet.
That would surpass the record draw of 287 billion cubic feet in the week ended Jan. 10, 2014, Energy Information Administration data showed.
The five-year average change for the week is a decline of 170 billion cubic feet.
Natural gas supplies fell by 206 billion cubic feet last week to 3.126 trillion cubic feet, approximately 5.8% lower than the five-year average for this time of year.
Prices have gained around 5% so far this week as investors reacted to the severe winter storm hitting much of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard.
Bullish speculators are betting that the cool weather will increase demand for the heating fuel. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.

Comex gold futures were trading at $1,315.20 a troy ounce by 04:59 AM ET (09:59 AM GMT), up around $2.00 or 0.14% from their last close, after losing around 0.7% on Tuesday.
The dollar extended losses against the yen into a second session, falling to the lowest levels since December 1 after the Bank of Japan tweaked the size of its bond purchases on Tuesday, reminding investors that it will eventually normalize monetary policy.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, edged down to 92.15 from Tuesday’s one-week high of 92.36.
Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned by expectations for further interest rates hikes by the Federal Reserve this year after Friday’s U.S. jobs report did little to alter the outlook for monetary tightening.
While the rate of jobs growth cooled in December a pick-up in wage growth pointed to strength in the labor market.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, as they increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
Recent weakness in the dollar had supported gold prices by making the dollar-denominated metal cheaper for holders of other currencies. Last week, gold registered a fourth consecutive weekly gain for the first time since April.

661,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 11:50PM ET</span>",Trump administration bars oil drilling off Florida after governor's plea,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration will not allow drilling for oil and gas off the coast of Florida after urging from the state's governor, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said on Tuesday.
""I support the governor's position that Florida is unique and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver,"" Zinke said in a statement. ""As a result of discussion with Governor (Rick) Scott and his leadership, I am removing Florida from consideration for any new oil and gas platforms.""
The Trump administration last week proposed opening nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, a move aimed at boosting domestic energy production and which sparked protests from coastal states, environmentalists and the tourism industry.
The administration's decision on Tuesday removes from consideration a portion of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, an area that oil drillers have said they are interested in exploring – but not all of it.
Florida state waters extend 3 nautical miles from the shore on the Atlantic, and 9 nautical miles on the Gulf side, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Scott last week announced his opposition to the drilling plan and said he had asked to meet with Zinke.
Zinke's decision to exempt Florida from offshore drilling leaves the door open for other governors opposed to offshore oil and gas development to seek a similar prohibition for their states.
Oceana, an environmental lobby group, said it was pleased that Zinke had removed Florida from areas open to drilling.
""Such a quick reversal begs the question: Will the Trump administration give equal consideration to all the other coastal Governors from both parties who overwhelmingly reject this radical offshore drilling plan?"" Oceana campaign director Diane Hoskins said in a statement. 
On Twitter, several governors, attorneys general and lawmakers representing coastal states asked Zinke to extend the exemption for Florida to their coastal waters.
The governors of New York and Oregon and the attorneys general of Maryland and California were among those who called on Zinke to ban offshore drilling.
Environmental groups Greenpeace and the League of Conservation Voters called the move to protect Florida a political ploy meant to bolster the governor who is reportedly planning to run for an open U.S. Senate seat.
""President Trump has directed me to rebuild our offshore oil and gas program in a manner that supports our national energy policy and also takes into consideration the local and state voice,"" Zinke said in Tuesday's statement.
Zinke said last week that the department's draft National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2019 to 2024 would make over 90 percent of the outer continental shelf’s total acreage available for leasing to drillers, a national record.
That would reverse the Obama administration order placing 94 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf off limits to drillers. Obama's 2017-2022 plan would be replaced by the new program when it is finalized.
The effort to open previously off-limits acreage in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans comes less than eight years after  BP  Plc's (L:BP) Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico - the largest in American history. The disaster caused billions of dollars in economic damage and led the Obama administration to increase regulation of the industry.

The Defense Department has also raised concerns about opening drilling that had been banned off the eastern Gulf of Mexico, where military exercises are held.

662,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 10:03PM ET</span>",U.S. producers seek to block Chinese aluminum shipped via Vietnam,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. aluminum products makers sought new trade protections against Chinese imports on Tuesday, accusing China Zhongwang Holdings Ltd and its affiliates of evading U.S. anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties by shipping aluminum products through Vietnam.
In a filing with the U.S. Commerce Department, the Aluminum Extruders Council said that aluminum extrusions from Zhongwang were being shipped to affiliate Global Vietnam Aluminum Co Ltd for conversion work before being exported to the United States.
Duties on Chinese extrusions are currently a combined 106 percent, according to the Commerce Department. 
In response, Zhongwang told Reuters that the ""allegations made are without grounds"".
The anti-circumvention petition follows a number of U.S. actions to raise barriers to Chinese aluminum, including Commerce Department preliminary duties on Chinese aluminum foil and a rare U.S. government-initiated investigation into imports of Chinese aluminum alloy sheet products. 
It also comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is considering much broader global restrictions on aluminum imports on national security grounds. 
The Commerce Department is due to issue recommendations to Trump from its ""Section 232"" investigation into aluminum imports on Jan 22. Recommendations from a similar probe into steel imports are due on Jan. 16, but it is not clear whether either report will immediately be made public.
China's excess production capacity of both metals has emerged as a major trade irritant for the United States and Europe, prompting them to consider new steps to protect domestic industries and jobs from a flood of Chinese imports. 
In the Vietnam petition, the Aluminum Extruders Council said it provided evidence that Zhongwang's affiliate in Vietnam was changing the shape and form of Chinese extrusions in minor ways but claiming their origin as Vietnamese.
""These blatant attempts to evade duties and flood the market with unfairly traded Chinese aluminum extrusions must be halted,"" the trade group's president, Jeff Henderson, said in a statement.
In June, the Commerce Department ordered that fabricated aluminum pallets imported from China should be subject to the U.S. duties after determining that they were part of a duty evasion scheme. The Aluminum Extruders Council argued that these products are being shipped through Vietnam with minor changes.
The Commerce Department has shown receptiveness to similar anti-circumvention cases in the steel sector. In December, the agency slapped steep duties on steel products from Vietnam that originated as Chinese made hot-rolled steel.

Gold prices retreated further from four-month highs on Tuesday as treasury yields surged, supporting dollar strength amid growing expectations for global monetary policy tightening after the Bank of Japan’s cut its purchases of long-term bonds.
In a rising interest rate environment, investor appetite for gold weakens as the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal increases relative to other interest-bearing assets such as bonds.
Also supporting the dollar strength was a drop in safe-haven demand as global equity markets continued to top multi-year highs amid ongoing risk-on sentiment.
Some market participants suggested that gold could retreat further toward its 100-day moving average around $1,290. Recent data, however, pointed to ongoing support for gold as hedge funds and speculators increased their bullish bets on the precious metal.
The net long position in Comex gold futures and options - the difference between bets on rising and falling prices – rose nearly 40% to 152,650 contracts, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) reported Friday.
Despite the prospect of global monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve, Bank of England and Bank of Canada this year, BofA Merrill Lynch said it expects gold prices to rise to $1,350 an ounce by the third quarter of the year.
The Bank of Canada could raise rates as soon as next week, Action Economics said, as the recent swathe of positive labor market data may force the central bank’s hand on monetary policy tightening.
Nomura’s George Buckley – who correctly predicted that the Bank of England would hike interest rate in November – said recently that there is room for more rate hikes, estimating the Bank of England would raise rates four times by the end of 2019 to curb inflation, which is running well above target.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production is expected to surpass 10 million barrels per day (bpd) next month, en route to an all-time record months ahead of previous forecasts, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Tuesday.
Production was expected to rise to an average 10.04 million bpd during the first quarter of this year, the agency said in a monthly report. The 10 million-bpd milestone previously had not been expected to be reached until the fourth quarter. 
That would match the all-time monthly record of 10.04 million bpd set in Nov. 1970; oil production declined after that as the United States increasingly relied on imported crude. That has changed in the last several years due to the shale revolution, but these projections surpass earlier expectations.
The monthly average for February is expected to surpass 10 million bpd, said Tim Hess, the lead analyst for the report. That will be the first time production has reached that level since 1970. 
Only Russia and Saudi Arabia have produced more crude, hitting peak output of over 11 million bpd and about 10.7 million bpd respectively in recent years.
The EIA revised its production growth forecast for 2018 sharply higher to 970,000 bpd from 780,000 bpd in its previous outlook. 
U.S. output will continue to rise in 2019, surpassing 11 million bpd by the end of that year, the EIA report said. The average production in 2019 will rise 580,000 bpd to 10.85 million bpd, the agency said in its first outlook for next year.
""The major risk factors would be more global in nature, rather than anything specific domestically,"" EIA acting administrator John Conti said on a conference call. ""Domestically, things are lining up in terms of moderate prices and increased opportunity for production.""
Much of the production growth will be concentrated in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield stretching across Texas and New Mexico, said John Staub, the EIA director of the office of petroleum, natural gas and biofuels analysis. As a result, pipeline capacity constraints should not be a major limiting factor in starting new production, he said. 
Despite the rising production, oil prices edged higher on Tuesday, with U.S. crude touching its highest since December 2014, closing at $62.96 a barrel.
The market was supported by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations that U.S. crude inventories have dropped for an eighth week. Oil traders have closely watched U.S. crude production to see whether output gains from U.S. shale formations will surpass the 1.8 million bpd cuts. [O/R]

U.S. demand growth of 150,000 bpd was estimated for 2017, slightly lower than previous expectations. The agency increased its demand estimates for 2018 to 470,000 bpd from 410,000 bpd. Demand is expected to climb an additional 340,000 bpd in 2019 to 20.65 million bpd, the agency said.

In a rising interest rate environment, investor appetite for gold weakens as the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal increases relative to other interest-bearing assets such as bonds.
Also supporting the dollar strength was a drop in safe-haven demand as global equity markets continued to top multi-year highs amid ongoing risk-on sentiment. 
Some market participants suggested that gold could retreat further toward its 100-day moving average around $1,290. Recent data, however, pointed to ongoing support for gold as hedge funds and speculators increased their bullish bets on the precious metal. 
The net long position in Comex gold futures and options - the difference between bets on rising and falling prices – rose nearly 40% to 152,650 contracts, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) reported Friday.
Despite the prospect of global monetary tightening from the Federal Reserve, Bank of England and Bank of Canada this year, BofA Merrill Lynch said it expects gold prices to rise to $1,350 an ounce by the third quarter of the year.
The Bank of Canada could raise rates as soon as next week, Action Economics said, as the recent swathe of positive labor market data may force the central bank’s hand on monetary policy tightening. 
Nomura’s George Buckley – who correctly predicted that the Bank of England would hike interest rate in November – said recently that there is room for more rate hikes, estimating the Bank of England would raise rates four times by the end of 2019 to curb inflation, which is running well above target.

671,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>","Block Trades Come to Agriculture, Sparking Transparency Concern","(Bloomberg) -- Block trading -- when two customers agree outside of open outcry or outside of the electronic trade to transact a deal -- has come to the world of Chicago agriculture trading, and not everyone’s happy about it.
CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME) data show the exchange cleared four block trades in agricultural futures Monday, the first day when registered participants were allowed to make the transactions. Block trades took place in hog futures, Black Sea wheat and urea fertilizer.
In hogs, the block trade accounted for 8.2 percent of Monday’s estimated June futures volume, raising concerns that the price discovery purpose of the exchange is less transparent, Roy Huckabay, executive vice president at Chicago-based Linn & Associates said in an email. Block trades are required to be reported within 15 minutes of completion.
Block trading “is aimed at big funds and does not fit most commercial firms,” Huckabay said. “It will not help encourage participation from the customers that matter.”
CME began offering block trading based on “customer demand,” spokesman Chris Grams said by email.
“These transaction types will enable many types of clients to execute trades when market liquidity is not readily evident, including in deferred contract months, less liquid option strikes or in spread or combination strategies,” Grams said. “By allowing block trades, these trades can now be conducted at the exchange, which will enhance transparency, as reporting is required.”"

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil's price rally this year to its highest since May 2015 may seem a source of glee for OPEC, but some in the producer group fear the gains could prompt shale companies to crank open their spigots and flood the market.
Benchmark Brent crude rose further above $68 a barrel on Tuesday, supported by oil output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia that are due to run until the end of 2018.
The surge comes as a welcome boost for the revenues of oil-producing nations, many still reeling from a price collapse that started in mid-2014 when crude began to fall steeply from above $100 per barrel due to oversupply. 
Some in OPEC are worried a prolonged rally could stimulate more U.S. shale oil output, however, creating more oversupply that could weigh on prices and market share.
""We all are excited about the rally and want to see if it will be sustainable during the year, as it will certainly whet the appetite of shale producers,"" an official from an OPEC country said.
The oil minister of Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer, said on Tuesday that the organization's members were not keen on increased prices as such gains would encourage more shale production.
OPEC has no formal target for oil prices. However, Saudi Arabia, OPEC's top producer, wants to see crude above $60 to boost the valuation of its national oil company Aramco before an initial public offering of shares this year and to reduce the gap in its state budget, Saudi sources have said.
OPEC sources say Saudi Arabia has become a strong advocate of higher prices, a shift from a more moderate stance in the past, and Saudi officials have downplayed the threat of a boost in shale production.
Even so, U.S. production is expected soon to rise above 10 million barrels per day, close to Saudi levels, due largely to soaring output from shale drillers, government data shows. [EIA/M] 
OPEC officials also think the 2018 rally has been mainly driven by unrest in Iran, rather than a tighter balance between supply and demand, giving rise to concern it may not last.
""Oil prices rose because of the political situation in Iran,"" an OPEC source said. ""There is a worry now that this would be followed by a sharp decline in prices.""
A third OPEC source said market fundamentals did not justify the price rally. 
""It is only politics that is changing the mood. The push in prices will mean the peak is near and hence prices will give up some of the gains.""

While OPEC sources say oil market fundamentals remain strong on the back of the supply cuts, others are worried that economic growth in consuming countries could slow and higher prices might encourage some producers to pump above their output target.

673,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2018 11:32AM ET</span>",Oil prices hit highest in nearly three years on tighter market,"By Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday, touching its highest since May 2015, supported by OPEC-led production cuts and expectations that U.S. crude inventories have dropped for an eighth week.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia are keeping supply limits in place in 2018, a second year of restraint, to reduce a price-denting glut of oil held in inventories.
Brent crude was up 18 cents at $67.96 per barrel by 11:08 a.m. EST (1608 GMT) and earlier touched $68.29, its highest since May 2015. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) rose 36 cents to $62.09 and also reached its highest since May 2015 at $62.56.
""We expect oil demand growth to outpace non-OPEC supply growth in both 2018 and 2019,""  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) analysts said in a note.
""In our view, the back of the Brent and WTI curves are both still underpriced. We do not think that prices below $65 per barrel are sustainable into the medium term."" 
OPEC is cutting output by even more than it promised [OPEC/O] and the restraint is reducing oil stocks globally, a trend most visible in the United States, the world's largest and most transparent oil market. 
Supply reports this week from industry group the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration are expected to show U.S. crude stocks fell by 4.1 million barrels, an eighth week of decline. [EIA/S]
The API releases its data at 4:30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT) on Tuesday and the government report is due at 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday. 
Many producers, still suffering from a 2014 price collapse, are enjoying the rally, although they are wary it will spur rival supply sources. Iran said on Tuesday that OPEC members were not keen on increased prices. 
Unrest in Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer, has lent support to prices this year although output and exports have not been affected. Economic collapse is leading to involuntary production cuts in Venezuela, another OPEC member. 
There is no sign yet that OPEC is prepared to relax its supply restraint.
A senior OPEC source from a major Middle Eastern oil producer said on Monday OPEC would boost output only if there were significant and sustained production disruptions from Iran and Venezuela.
The rise in prices is expected to drive gains in U.S. production during 2018, offsetting curbs by others. 
Some analysts have said a potential rise in U.S. shale oil production could discourage OPEC and Russia to maintain their deal to curb supply until the end of the year for fears of losing market share.
""I am now on the lookout for bearish technical patterns to emerge on oil prices as I believe they will struggle to go north of $65-$75 per barrel given the above fundamental consideration,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst for Forex.com.

""If WTI were to go back below the 2017 high of $60.48, which was hit late in the year, and the 2018’s opening price of $60.09, then the technical outlook would turn bearish on oil. But for now, the bullish trend remains intact as prices remain above key supports.""

Elsewhere, Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London added 10 cents or about 0.16% to $67.88 a barrel, not far from last week's nearly three-year peak of $68.27.
Oil prices remained supported since after Baker Hughes on Friday reported a decline by five to 742 in the number of U.S. rigs in the week to January 5.
The commodity also continues to benefit from production cut efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The producers agreed in December to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
However, concerns over rising U.S. oil production continued to linger, especially following reports hits week that U.S. production is expected to exceed 10 million barrels per day (bpd) very soon.

“Since the December hike, gold is beating stocks, the dollar and bitcoin,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone wrote in a note. “Unless greenback weakness reverses, gold should shine.”
The metal’s sparkling performance in the face of tighter rates, though counter-intuitive, has become the norm. Gold prices have been turning higher soon after the Fed raises rates ever since the global financial crisis.
Since Dec. 12, the day before the Fed moved, gold climbed 5.7 percent to $1,314.36 an ounce, last week touching the highest level in three months.

Comex gold futures were down 0.40% at $1,315.10 a troy ounce by 08:05 a.m. ET (12:05 GMT).
The greenback remained supported after San Francisco Fed President John Williams said on Saturday that the Fed should raise interest rates three times this year given that economy will benefit from tax cuts.
The comments came a day after Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she expects about four interest rate hikes this year, thanks to solid U.S. economic growth and low unemployment.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.18% at 92.25, the highest since December 29.
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

Comex gold futures were trading at $1,314.90 a troy ounce by 04:04 AM ET (09:04 AM GMT), down around $5.50 or 0.4% from their last close.
The euro fell to more than one-week lows against the dollar as investors took profits after its recent rally amid concerns that the European Central Bank may attempt to talk down the strengthening currency ahead of its monetary policy meeting later this month.
After getting off to a strong start to the year the single currency had hit a four-month high on Thursday, putting it within striking distance of a September peak of 1.2092, its strongest level since early 2015.
The weaker euro helped support the dollar. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.17% to 92.24.
Demand for the dollar was also underpinned by expectations for further interest rates hikes by the Fed this year after Friday’s U.S. jobs report did little to alter the outlook for monetary tightening.
While the rate of jobs growth cooled in December a pick-up in wage growth pointed to strength in the labor market.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, as they increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
Recent weakness in the dollar had supported gold prices by making the dollar-denominated metal cheaper for holders of other currencies. Last week, gold registered a fourth consecutive weekly gain for the first time since April.
Elsewhere in metals trading, silver was down 0.43% at $17.07 a troy ounce, while platinum fell 0.95% to trade at $967.10 a troy ounce.
Palladium was up 0.37% to $1,099. a troy ounce, not far from Thursday’s record high of $1,101.30.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.32% at 92.04, the highest since December 29.
Gold is sensitive to moves in the dollar. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency.
The dollar had initially weakened after the U.S. Department of Labor reported on Friday that the economy added 148,000 jobs in December, disappointing expectations for an increase of 185,000. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.1%, as expected.

HOUSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration has proposed opening up nearly all of America's offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, but the industry says it is mainly interested in one part of it, now cordoned off by the Pentagon: the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
The industry's focus on an area located near a sprawling network of existing platforms, pipes and ports could ease the path to new reserves, and assuage the drilling opponents near other places offered under the Interior Department's proposed drilling plan issued last week, like California's Pacific, the Atlantic and Arctic.
But accessing it would likely require the consent of the U.S. military. The eastern Gulf has been formally off-limits to drilling since 2006 due mainly to the Defense Department's concerns oil development would interfere with extensive military testing and training exercises in the area.
""The eastern Gulf of Mexico could be very attractive to industry because of the proximity to existing infrastructure in the central and western Gulf of Mexico,"" the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents the offshore oil and gas industry, said in a statement.
""Investing in the eastern Gulf could yield results - new jobs, new oil and gas production and increased energy security - quicker than investing in other offshore areas."" 
The American Petroleum Institute and the Independent Petroleum Association of America have also expressed an interest in the eastern Gulf on behalf of its members, and big driller Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) told Reuters in October that ""we have appetite and we are interested"" in the eastern Gulf. 
Trump's Interior Department has set up an ""interagency working group"" with the Defense Department to negotiate the issue, according to a Defense Department letter seen by Reuters.
In the letter, sent by Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in September, Shanahan says the Pentagon ""supports the development of national domestic energy resources in concert with enabling military operations, training and testing.""
Defense Department spokeswoman Major Carla Gleason said collaboration with Interior on the issue was ""a priority."" 
Major offshore producers such as  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM),  BP  Plc (L:BP), Anadarko Petroleum Corp (N:APC) and ConocoPhillips (N:COP) declined to comment.
Shell welcomed the expanded offshore prospects the Trump administration plans to make available, but has not committed to any new activity, said spokesman Curtis Smith.
A  Chevron  (N:CVX) spokeswoman, Veronica Flores-Paniagua, said the company is happy with Trump's move and wants to continue to explore parts of Gulf, and also to better understand the geology of the Atlantic Seaboard.
WEAK AUCTIONS
Other regions offered in the proposed five-year drilling plan unveiled by Trump's Interior Department last week are unlikely to see much interest, given the ample and relatively cheap opportunities to drill from shale plays on land. 
The Arctic is remote and expensive, Pacific states such as California have vowed to block drilling, and other areas also harbor deep opposition from politicians, environmental groups and business interests worried about spills.
Sajjad Alam, an analyst focusing on oil and gas in Moody’s corporate finance group, said the high costs and difficulties in many of the areas offered for lease under the plan are likely to keep them low on an oil company's priority list.
Recent leasing statistics in the Gulf of Mexico already show soft demand for acreage from the oil industry. 
The amount of money per acre that oil companies spent in the Gulf in 2017 was about a third what they spent in 2013 when oil prices were higher, according to a Reuters review of government data. Energy firms bid for less than 1 percent of total U.S. acreage in 2017, compared with 4.5 percent in 2013.
But for oil companies, the option of exploring new areas is nice to have, and one they might exploit if oil prices rise.
""We'd like an opportunity to look at all of the areas (including the Eastern Seaboard and Alaska),"" said Tracy Krohn, the chief executive of W&T Offshore Inc (N:WTI), which currently produces oil in the Gulf of Mexico.
""I don't know that we would exclude any areas.""
The API said some of its members could be interested in looking at parts of the mid- and southern-Atlantic too, because of successful wells drilled in similar geology off Brazil, Africa and Canada.

""It would make sense to go out there and run seismic and do some exploratory drilling down the road,"" said Erik Milito, API's director of upstream operations.

DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC is monitoring unrest in Iran as well as Venezuela's economic crisis, but the group will only boost output if there are significant and sustained production disruptions from those countries, a senior OPEC source from a major Middle Eastern oil producer said. 
Venezuela's economic troubles have hit the country's oil output, which is at near 30-year lows, but Iran's output has not been affected by a wave of anti-government protests. 
Traders said political tensions in Iran, the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), had pushed prices higher.
Brent crude (LCOc1), the international benchmark, was trading at around $67.52 a barrel, on Monday. Brent hit $68.27 high last week, the highest since May 2015, on Iran tensions.
Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de-facto leader, wants to see oil prices above $60 a barrel, to boost the valuation of its national oil company Aramco ahead of an initial public offering (IPO) later this year and to reduce the gap in its state budget, Saudi sources have said.
""Even if there was a supply disruption (from Iran or Venezuela)... OPEC will not raise output,"" the senior OPEC source said. 
""OPEC’s policy is to bring inventories down to their normal levels and will stay the course, unless the disruption in supply of something like 1,000,000 barrels per day persists for more than a month, and causes shortages of crude supply to consumers.""
Venezuela's dilapidated energy sector is struggling as U.S. sanctions and a lack of capital hobble operations, and its economic crisis threatens to do further harm to the OPEC country.
The senior OPEC source also said the oil market was on its way to being re-balanced, but so far global oil inventories remained above their five-year average and much more time was needed to drain the oil glut.
""Any change in production limits must be driven by a change in market fundamentals and not just speculations for a short period of time, for OPEC to change the output ceiling,"" he said.
The protests in Iran that began in late December have posed no immediate threat to oil production but there is concern that U.S. President Donald Trump may reimpose sanctions on Iranian oil, which could disrupt oil exports.
Trump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports under the terms of an international nuclear deal. 
The senior OPEC source said that while more U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil were possible, they would take time to affect oil supplies and so their impact was difficult to gauge.
OPEC, supported by Russia and other non-members, began to reduce output a year ago to remove an oil glut built up in the previous two years. Compliance has been high, as producers have decided to extend the supply pact until the end of 2018.

OPEC's cuts are helping to reduce global inventories, even as production continues to rise in the United States. U.S. production rose to 9.78 million barrels in the last week.

Comex gold futures were trading at $1,317.00 a troy ounce by 03:54 AM ET (08:54 AM GMT).
Prices of the precious metal were pressured lower as the dollar moved higher against a basket of the other major currencies.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.25% to 91.98, up from its January 2 trough of 91.47, which was the lowest level since September 20.
The U.S. economy added 148,000 jobs in December, the Labor Department reported Friday, well below the 190,000 forecast by economists.
The dollar briefly slid to the day’s lows following the report before regaining ground.
The jobs data was seen as unlikely to alter investor expectations for a rate hike by the U.S. central bank at its March meeting. Fed officials have penciled in three rate increases this year and two in 2019.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, as they increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
Recent weakness in the dollar had supported gold prices by making the dollar-denominated metal cheaper for holders of other currencies.
Elsewhere in metals trading, silver was down 0.69% at $17.16 a troy ounce, while platinum fell 0.41% to trade at $971.20 a troy ounce.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude February contract was steady at $61.42 a barrel by 04:00 a.m. ET (08:00 GMT), not far from last week's two-and-a-half year high of $62.21.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London slipped 0.12 cents or about 0.21% to $67.48 a barrel, still close to the previous session's nearly three-year peak of $68.27.
Oil services firm Baker Hughes on Friday reported a decline by five to 742 in the number of U.S. rigs in the week to January 5.
However, optimism was limited by news U.S. production is expected to exceed 10 million barrels per day (bpd) very soon, mainly due to increasing output from shale drillers.
Rising U.S. production could undermine production cut efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The producers agreed in December to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oilfield service companies are gearing up for initial public offerings, according to regulatory filings and analysts, after several shelved equity sales last year during a weak period for oil prices.
Oil is trading near its highest level since early 2015, fueling demand for service firms to bring new shale wells to production. Energy executives surveyed last month said they would increase drilling sharply at prices above $60 a barrel. Crude (CLC1) recently traded at about $61.50 a barrel.
Investors' appetite for the shares will be tested soon. Liberty Oilfield Services, which provides hydraulic fracturing services to shale producers, last week filed to raise about $160 million by selling 10.7 million shares at about $15 a share. 
If its IPO performs well, it could open the gates for several other companies aiming to raise funds for new expansion or to buy rivals. Since August, the Van Eck Vectors Oil Services ETF (P:OIH) is up nearly 28 percent, behind the 32 percent gain in the SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Exploration and Production ETF (P:XOP). 
Denver, Colorado-based Liberty was one of four oilfield firms that shelved IPOs last year after producers trimmed spending budgets as crude dipped to $45 a barrel. Liberty did not respond to requests for comment. Other service firms also have updated their filings, signaling they may try again.
""We could see a quick ramp up (in IPOs) because there are so many in a good position to go quickly once market conditions improve,"" said A.J. Ericksen, a partner with law firm Baker Botts who focuses on mergers and acquisitions and capital markets. His firm represents the underwriters in Liberty's public offering. 
Underpinning the improving market for fracking services, there are some 7,300 drilled-but-uncompleted wells across the United States as of November, the U.S. Energy Information Administration recently reported. Those are wells that have yet to be hydraulically fractured.
BJ Services, FTS International and Nine Energy Service, all of which offer hydraulic fracturing of shale wells, last year filed registration statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission but did not proceed. Fracking involves pumping sand and liquids at high pressure into a well to release trapped oil and gas.
Representatives from the three companies did not respond to requests for comment.
In late October, FTS amended its registration filing and said its average pricing was up by more than 50 percent since late 2016. It also said it expects to reactivate six pressure-pumping fleets through mid-2018, suggesting strong demand for hydraulic fracturing.
Nine Energy Service in late December also filed an amended registration form, a possible sign it is positioning itself to go public this year. BJ Services, which named a new chief financial officer in November, has not updated its filing since July. 
""Everyone that filed in 2017 but took no additional action is probably a candidate (to go public) in 2018,"" said Richard Spears, vice president of oilfield service research firm Spears & Associates. He estimates as many as five oilfield service companies could go public in the first quarter of this year.
Pressure pumping firm Keane Group (N:FRAC) went public a year ago at $19 a share, just as energy prices were moving higher after OPEC agreed to curb production. After falling to $12.51 last May as crude prices slipped, its shares have recovered and currently trade around $18.52.

""We look at Keane as the closest peer to Liberty. So if Keane is trading well, that should bode well for Liberty,"" said Kathleen Smith, who manages exchange-traded funds for IPO specialist Renaissance Capital.

About 30,000 barrels per day of crude will be trucked to Iran's Kermanshah refinery in the first instance, he said. ''God willing, we will start before the end of the month,'' he added.
Trucking crude to Iran comes under a swap agreement announced last month by the two countries to allow a resumption of oil exports from Kirkuk.
Iraq and Iran have agreed to swap up to 60,000 barrels per day of crude produced from Kirkuk for Iranian oil to be delivered to southern Iraq, Luaibi said last month.
Kirkuk crude sales have been halted since Iraqi forces took back control of the fields from the Kurds in October. 
Kurdish forces took control of Kirkuk in 2014, when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic State. The Kurdish move prevented the militants from seizing the region's oilfields. 
Iraq and Iran are also planning to build a pipeline to carry the oil from Kirkuk to avoid having to truck the crude, Luaibi said last month.
The planned pipeline could replace the existing export route from Kirkuk via Turkey and the Mediterranean.

Also helping stem losses in oil prices was a report from Reuters, citing a survey, indicating that Opec members deepened production cuts in December, raising compliance with the deal to curb output to 128% from 125% in November.
OPEC in November agreed to extend 1.2 million bpd output cuts through 2018 to rid the market of excess supplies in an effort to ensure global inventories revert to their five-year average."

Gold futures for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $0.20, or 0.02%, to $1,321.80 a troy ounce.
The Labor Departed reported the US economy created just 148,000 jobs in December, below the 190,000 jobs expected by economists, while wage growth, was in line with expectations, rising 0.3%.
The subdued jobs report reduced investor expectations for a more aggressive path to higher interest rates, said TD Securities, as the Federal Reserve would likely need to see more “convincing evidence” of inflationary pressures prior to raising rates in March.
Jim Vogel, strategist at FTN , however, said that the jobs report does little to change the Federal Reserve’s trajectory for rate increases in 2018, as the trend of job creation remained solid after the economy created more than 200,000 jobs in November and October.
Gold prices have remained steady in recent weeks despite investor expectations for tightening global monetary as both the Bank of England and Bank of Canada are expected to follow the Fed's lead and raise rates this year.
The Bank of Canada could raise rates as soon as the end of the January, CIBC’s Nick Exarhos said, as Friday’s bullish labor market report strengthened the central bank’s case to raise rates.
Nomura’s George Buckley – who correctly predicted that the Bank of England would hike interest rates in November – said recently that there is room for more rate hikes, estimating the central would raise rates four times by the end of 2019 to curb inflation, which is running well above target.
In a rising interest rate environment, investor appetite for gold weakens as the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal increases relative to other interest-bearing assets such as bonds.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures fell 0.06% to $17.28 a troy ounce, while platinum futures gained 0.49% to $975. Platinum futures have made a bold start to the year on fears that rising demand for the autocatalyst metal would further tighten supplies.
Copper fell 0.98% to 3.23, while natural gas fell 3.33% to $2.78. The fall in natural gas comes amid data Thursday showing natural gas storage fell by 206 billion cubic feet, missing expectations for a draw of 219.43 billion cubic feet."

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude February contract was down 43 cents or about 0.65% at $61.58 a barrel by 04:00 a.m. ET (08:00 GMT), just off a a fresh two-and-a-half year high of $62.21 hit on Thursday.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London declined 29 cents or about 0.43% to $67.80 a barrel, still close to the previous session's nearly three-year peak of $68.27.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Thursday that crude oil inventories declined by 7.4 million last week, beating expectations for a 5.1 million drop.
Oil prices were already supported in recent session by political tensions in Iran, where protests are marking the biggest challenge to the country's clerical leadership since 2009. Iran is the world's third biggest oil producer.
The commodity is also underpinned by production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The producers agreed in December to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.

700,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 07:14AM ET</span>","China says will limit oil, refined product exports to North Korea","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Commerce Ministry said on Friday it will limit exports of crude oil, refined oil products, steel and other metals to North Korea, in line with tough new sanctions imposed by the United Nations for Pyongyang's missile tests.
The statement comes after the U.N. Security Council last month unanimously voted in favor of new penalties on North Korea for its recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil.
The move by China will be effective on Jan. 6, it said.
It also follows an agreement on Friday by North Korea to hold official talks with the South next week, the first in more than two years amid rising tensions over its nuclear and missile programs.
On Tuesday, the Chinese government said it would continue to adhere to the recent U.N. sanctions.
In November, China, one of North Korea's top trading partners, exported no oil products to the isolated country, apparently going above and beyond the U.N. restrictions.
Among the measures in the December resolution, the U.N. prohibits nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year and limits crude oil supplies to 4 million barrels a year.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Investors sense opportunities in Big Oil - but mind the gap,"By Helen Reid and Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are gaining confidence - up to a point - that 2018 will be the year of oil stocks.
While shares in top energy companies have risen since mid-2017, they have failed to keep step with recovering crude markets, opening up a historically unusual performance gap. Big oil stocks have also underperformed broader equity indexes.
Uncertainty over whether the crude rally can stick and fears that advances in electric vehicles will undermine longer-term demand for oil still overshadow the sector.
But a brighter outlook for oil prices compared with the slump of 2014-15 - coupled with a revival in energy companies' profits and cash generation after three years of brutal cuts - could mark a turning point, according to investors and a string of global banks. 
""2017 was a challenging year for investors but there are now real opportunities in the energy sector,"" said Olivia Markham, portfolio manager at BlackRock Commodities Income Investment Trust. She expects oil prices to rise gradually by 2020 as supplies tighten due to a dive in investment in recent years.
UBS, RBC and JP Morgan have put out strongly positive outlooks for the sector in recent weeks, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts predicted on Thursday that earnings for the European integrated oil stocks could grow 20 percent from the third quarter.
Optimists point to developments like Shell's (L:RDSa) raising in November of its cash flow outlook to $30 billion from $25 billion by 2020, assuming prices at $60 a barrel.
""Annus Mirabilis. Highest free cashflow in a decade bodes well for 2018,"" Bernstein said in its outlook for European oil majors.
Figures for last year are grim, due largely to a dismal first half. The MSCI world energy index <.dMIWO0EN00PUS>, which tracks top oil stocks, gained just 1.3 percent even though Brent crude hit 2-1/2 year highs. Europe's oil and gas sector (SXEP), which includes Shell,  Total  (PA:TOTF),  BP  (L:BP) and Eni (MI:ENI), was the worst-performing in the region. 
LITTLE CONVICTION
Oil majors' shares typically move in step with prices of the crude that they extract, but that correlation broke down last year. Since June, the MSCI index has gained 20 percent but Brent (LCOc1) shot up 50 percent to around $68 a barrel, after OPEC and other major producers agreed to cut output.
The majors are set to cut spending on oil and gas exploration for a fifth year in a row in 2018, determined to maintain the capital discipline they imposed during the slump.
With production from U.S. shale deposits expected to increase sharply, scepticism remains over whether crude can stay at current levels.
""There's little conviction on the oil price sustainability both from the market and from the oil majors because no one is touching capex plans or investment. Everyone is waiting to understand what's going on,"" said Angelo Meda, head of equities at Italian fund manager Banor SIM.
As well as slashing spending, the majors made tens of thousands of staff redundant and sold off assets to adapt to lower oil prices which, despite the recent gains, remain far below levels above $100 in 2011-14. Such savings have led to sharp increases in earnings in recent quarters.
Whether the sector can extend the share rally and close the performance gap in 2018 depends on a belief that majors can still prosper should oil prices fall back again.
""From here it's a question of whether or not investors think something has really changed in the industry, that you can still have earnings improving even if the macro doesn't help you out,"" said Peter Hackworth, oil equity analyst at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
As well as the strong cash flow generation at the European majors, early signs of capital discipline among U.S. explorers and producers also point to a better picture for the sector this year.
Goldman predicts big oil firms will return 13 percent in 2018, ahead of a forecast 9 percent rise in the Brent price. 
SCRAPPING THE SCRIP
One crucial component in winning back investors' confidence is a return to paying dividends fully in cash. Offering the option of taking dividends in stock has saved the majors billions upfront but diluted their earnings per share.
Shell and BP have both made enough revenue in recent quarters to boost their payouts. Goldman Sachs estimates most big oil firms will have scrapped scrip dividends or made share buy-backs which offset the dilution in the next 12 months.
Average dividend yields of 5.5 percent will be more than covered by cash flow this year, Hackworth said.
But not all investors have yet accepted the message that current payout levels will continue.
""The market is still discounting these dividends as unsustainable whereas today, right now, they are sustainable. So I think the market is overreacting,"" said Eric Moore, European income fund manager at Miton, who has been increasing his oil holdings in the past year.
Moore's fund holds BP, Shell,  Statoil  (OL:STL), Eni and  Premier Oil . (L:PMO)
Analysts have also been revising up their earnings forecasts since October after sharp downgrades earlier in 2017. Any uptick in mergers and acquisitions - noticeably absent as the majors concentrated on restructuring rather than purchases during the slump – could also boost the sector. 
    
PEAK DEMAND?
Investors remain wary that oil demand may peak due to eventual mass adoption of battery-powered cars and more curbs on fossil fuel emissions by industry to meet environmental targets.
""Electric vehicles and government policies on carbon have led investors to question the longer-term outlook for oil,"" Blackrock's Markham said. 
Some are hedging their bets, buying shares in battery companies and chipmakers involved in making electric cars while lessening their exposure to pure oil plays.    
But the shift to cleaner energy doesn't necessarily mean investors are dumping the oil majors. Many are sticking with them but favoring companies which put more emphasis on renewables. 
Nick Davis, European income fund manager at Polar Capital, said he prefers Total, which is investing more in gas as well as venturing into battery and solar power.    
But in the shorter term, and with the electric vehicle picture still unclear, stocks do not yet fully price in these risks, analysts said.
Evercore ISI analyst Doug Terreson said cash preservation remains the key for investors focusing on returns more than growth. For him, BP, Shell,  Chevron  (N:CVX) and ConocoPhillips (N:COP) offer the best proposition in 2018, he said in a note.
""The historical investment model which assumed that higher oil prices would always lead to higher share prices in energy appears disrupted. It failed in 2017 and will again in 2018, in our view.""

702,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 03:44AM ET</span>",Oil slips away from 2015 highs as doubts emerge over rally,"By Henning Gloystein
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday, dropping away from highs last seen in 2015, as soaring U.S. production undermined a 10-percent rally from lows hit in December that was driven by tightening supply and political tensions in OPEC member Iran. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $61.81 a barrel at 0750 GMT. That was 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, below their last close. WTI hit a $62.21 the previous day, which was its strongest since May, 2015.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $67.88 a barrel, 19 cents, or 0.3 percent, below their last settlement. Brent hit $68.27 the day before, also the highest since May, 2015.
Traders said political tensions in Iran, the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), had pushed prices higher.
""The protests in Iran add more fuel to the already bullish oil market mood,"" said Norbert Ruecker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer.
Oil prices have received general support from production cuts led by OPEC and by Russia, which started in January last year and are set to last through 2018, as well as from strong economic growth and financial markets. 
That has helped tighten markets. U.S. commercial crude inventories  fell by 7.4 million barrels in the week to Dec. 29, to 424.46 million barrels, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
That is down 20 percent from their historic peaks last March and close to the five-year average of 420 million barrels.
CAN THE BULL-RUN LAST?
Yet given Iran's oil production has not been affected by the unrest, and that U.S. output  will likely break through 10 million barrels per day (bpd) soon, a level so far only reached by Saudi Arabia and Russia, doubts are emerging whether the bull-run can last.
U.S. bank Jefferies said the oil price ""upside from here is not obvious to us"", although it added that ""we believe the oil market will remain undersupplied through 2018"".
Ruecker of Julius Baer said crude prices above $60 per barrel project an ""overly rosy picture (as) oil production disruptions (in Iran) remain a very distant threat ... disruptions in the North Sea have been removed ... (and) U.S. oil production surpassed the 2015 highs in October and is set to climb to historic highs this year.""
Lukman Otunuga, analyst at futures brokerage FXTM, struck a similarly cautious tone.
""Oil started the New Year on an incredibly bullish note ... in part due to ongoing tensions in Iran ... (and) over OPEC's supply cut rebalancing the markets,"" he said.

""While the current momentum suggests that further upside is on the cards, it must be kept in mind that U.S. shale remains a threat to higher oil prices.""

703,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2018 03:02AM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia converts Aramco into joint-stock company ahead of historic IPO,"By Rania El Gamal and Aziz El Yaakoubi
DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has changed the status of its national oil giant Aramco to a joint-stock company as of Jan. 1, in a key step for an initial public offering (IPO) planned for later this year.
The sale of up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco, expected to go ahead in the second half of 2018, is a centerpiece of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan to reduce the dependence of the Saudi economy on oil. The plan is championed by Saudi crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.
The change, which was published in a cabinet decree in the kingdom's official bulletin on Friday, is a requirement for local companies in Saudi Arabia ahead of listing, a senior Aramco source, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
""As a customary step in the preparation process for a Saudi IPO, Saudi Aramco has converted to a joint stock company,"" the source said.
""This establishes the framework to allow future investors to hold shares in the company alongside its shareholder, the government.""
But it is an important step as it shows the IPO process, which could be the biggest in history raising up to $100 billion, is moving ahead despite market speculation it could be delayed or totally shelved.
Prince Mohammad told Reuters in October it was still on track for 2018.
Aramco has a fully paid capital of 60 billion riyals ($16.00 billion) divided into 200 billion ordinary shares, according to the company's bylaws published in the official bulletin. 
The firm's board will have 11 members and the power to list the company in domestic and international markets, it said. The government will propose 6 members of Aramco's board, but shareholders with a more than 0.1 percent stake will have the right to propose a member to the general assembly.
The government will have the right to appoint or change the company's chairman, a position currently held by Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih.
The government will remain the major shareholder of Aramco and retain the ultimate decision on output levels and production capacity, it said.
""The state will remain the only responsible entity to make the final decisions regarding the maximum levels of hydrocarbons that can be produced at any time,"" it said. 
Saudi officials have said domestic and international exchanges such as New York, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong have been looked at for a partial listing of the state-run oil firm.
They also left the door open for other options including an exclusive listing on the kingdom's bourse Tadawul and an IPO coupled with a private placement to a strategic investor as a precursor to an international IPO.
Aramco's IPO will comply with regulations of the Saudi stock exchange and also regulations of the international market where it will be listed, the official bulletin said.
Investors have long debated whether Aramco could be valued anywhere close to $2 trillion, the figure announced by the crown prince, who wants to raise cash through the IPO to finance investment aimed at helping wean the world's biggest oil exporting nation off its dependency on crude.
A kingpin of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi Arabia is also leading members and other rival oil producers such as Russia to restrict oil supplies under a global oil pact to drain inventories and boost oil prices.
In November, OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 as they try to finish clearing a global glut of crude while signaling a possible early exit from the deal if the market overheats.

Comex gold futures were down 0.15% at $1,319.50 a troy ounce by 09:00 a.m. ET (13:00 GMT), off the previous session's four-month peak of $1,327.20.
The greenback had come under pressure after the release of mixed U.S. economic reports on Thursday.
Payrolls processor ADP reported on Thursday that U.S. private employers added 250,000 jobs in December, well above economists' expectations.
A separate report showed that U.S. jobless claims increased by 3,000 last week to 250,000, disappointing expectations for a 6,000 decline.
The data came a day after Federal Reserve policymakers acknowledged, in the minutes of the Fed's December meeting released Wednesday, that the U.S. labor market and economic activity remain strong, despite persistently low inflation.
The minutes seemed to suggest that the central bank will continue to raise rates gradually but the pace could pick up if inflation rises.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.13% at 91.72.

705,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 08:31PM ET</span>",From Bromance to Break-Up: 4 Ways the OPEC Deal Could End Early,"(Bloomberg) -- OPEC and Russia have surprised the industry with the success of their grand alliance as oil surges to a three-year high. As the unlikely bond enters a second year, there are challenges ahead.
Here are four scenarios that could end their deal earlier than planned.
Street Fighting
Tension is flaring in OPEC members Iran and Venezuela, the two countries that RBC Capital Markets LLC says pose the biggest risk of supply disruption. If either nation shuts oil output as a result, fellow producers could just decide the restraints are no longer appropriate, and instead boost supplies to prevent a damaging price shock.
Discontent with economic stagnation has sparked the biggest street protests since 2009 in Iran, rekindling memories of the 1979 revolution that paralyzed crude production. To top it, U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to pull out of a nuclear accord that helps OPEC’s third-biggest producer trade with other nations.
In Venezuela, food shortages and rampant inflation have threatened to trigger a massive social collapse. Even if the country can avoid that, the industry has already been hit so hard that production could slump anyway.
Mission Accomplished
Russian President Vladimir Putin could heed pressure from his country’s biggest oil companies for a swift exit. Though he gave his blessings to extending the deal, Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC have warned that if the measures drag on too long they could lose market share to rivals. With oil prices rising and stockpiles draining, Russia could persuade other countries to end the deal before its time.
To keep the Russians happy, OPEC has agreed to review the agreement at their next meeting in June.
“What happens in the second half is interesting,” Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd., said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “Do they continue with the cuts? Do they slowly raise production? Because the market is tightening, and it’s tightening very quickly.”
Temptation to Cheat
OPEC’s biggest weakness is “we tend to cheat,” former Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi famously observed.
Last year, Iraq -- which initially resisted output curbs as it recovered from years of war -- was so slow to deliver on promised cuts that its petroleum minister was summoned to Riyadh. The country’s very public ambitions to expand capacity as soon as possible only add to doubt about its commitment. 
“As seasonal demand picks up in the summer months, we expect Iraq’s compliance with the agreement to slip,” said analysts at BMI Research.
Though OPEC has produced less than the promised levels in the past few months, Libya and Nigeria remain the wildcards. Being initially exempt from the agreement, they boosted output at such a pace last year that the other countries enforced a limit on them as well.
Yet Libya’s production remains far below its theoretical cap. With the economy still ravaged by years of internal conflict, consultants Wood Mackenzie and Eurasia Group expect the country will pump every barrel it can.
Too Much of a Good Thing
The OPEC-Russia strategy has always contained a contradiction: by boosting oil prices, they risk triggering a fresh surge of output from the original source of the glut -- U.S. shale.
Crude in New York has increased to a three-year high, topping $60 a barrel, a level often cited by the shale industry as profitable for new drilling.
If the U.S. opens up more shale taps,  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG) says OPEC and Russia’s logical response will be to abandon their strategy and return to the days of pump-all-you-can. The unlikely bromance could turn out to be a victim of its own success.

Gold futures for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.12% to $1,323.20 a troy ounce.
Overnight, gold prices moved off session lows shrugging off the prospect of further Federal Reserve rate hikes amid upbeat labor market data pointing to underlying strength in the US economy.
The recent rally in gold futures came under pressure amid investor concerns that continued upbeat US economic data could strengthen the case for the Fed to raise rates more than currently priced in.
Private payrolls grew by 250,000 for December, a sharp increase from the 185,000 private jobs created in the previous month, according to a report released Wednesday by ADP and Moody's Analytics. That beat economists’ forecast of 191,000.
In a rising interest rate environment, investor appetite for gold weakens as the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal increases relative to other interest-bearing assets such as bonds.
Losses in gold, however, were capped by a continued slump in the greenback as it struggled to rebound from three-month lows.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for February delivery eased 0.13% to $61.93 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent was quoted at $68.00.
Overnight, crude oil prices settled higher on Thursday after data showing crude stockpiles fell for the seventh-straight week offset a larger than expected build in product inventories.
Crude oil prices' bullish start to the week continued following an Energy Information Agency (EIA) inventory report showing crude stockpiles fell more-than-estimated but gains were capped somewhat as both distillates and gasoline inventories rose.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 7.4 million barrels for the week ended Dec. 29, beating expectations of a draw of 4.7 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – rose by 4.8 million barrels, well above expectations for a rise of 2 million barrels, while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – rose by 8.9 million barrels, confounding expectations for a rise of just 500,000 barrels.
US distillate supplies are 20 million barrels below 2016 levels but just one million barrels shy of the ten-year seasonal average.
Crude production, however, continued to advance toward 10 million barrels per day, despite the Enchilada platform fire halting some Gulf of Mexico production. Total weekly U.S. production jumped by 28,000 barrels a day to nearly 9.8 million barrels a day, EIA reported on Thursday.

708,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 07:30PM ET</span>",Trump administration aims to open nearly all U.S. offshore to oil drilling,"By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday proposed opening nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, a move aimed at boosting domestic energy production that sparked protests from coastal states, environmentalists and the tourism industry.
The effort to open previously off-limits acreage in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans comes less than eight years after  BP  (LON:BP) Plc's Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico - the largest in American history. The disaster caused billions of dollars in economic damage and led former President Barack Obama's to increase regulation of the industry.
Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said on Thursday the department's draft National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2019 to 2024 would make over 90 percent of the outer continental shelf’s total acreage available for leasing to drillers, a national record. 
That would reverse the Obama administration order placing 94 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf off limits to drillers. Obama's 2017-2022 plan would be replaced by the new program when it is finalized.
""We want to grow our nation’s offshore energy industry, instead of slowly surrendering it to foreign shores,"" Zinke said in prepared remarks. 
He said 25 of 26 planning areas on the Outer Continental Shelf will be considered for leasing, covering all U.S. coastlines. Proposed sales include 19 off the coast of Alaska, seven in the Pacific, 12 in the Gulf of Mexico and nine in the Atlantic Region. The last offshore lease sales for the East and West coasts were in the 1980s.
Alaska's North Aleutian Basin/Bristol Bay will be exempted after drilling was barred there by a previous executive order.
Zinke said the proposal was just the start of a dialogue with local stakeholders and the plan was not final. The draft will be subject to a 60-day comment period.
The proposal marks a huge shift from previous policy.
Weeks before leaving office, Obama banned new oil and gas drilling in federal waters in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, protecting 115 million acres (46.5 million hectares) of waters off Alaska and 3.8 million acres (1.5 million hectares)in the Atlantic from New England to the Chesapeake Bay. 
Trump in April ordered the Interior Department to overhaul the leasing schedule to promote increased drilling. At the time, low oil prices and soaring onshore production were curtailing demand for offshore leases, raising questions about the benefits of the move. Oil prices have since risen to around three-year highs.
Industry groups welcomed Thursday's announcement. 
""Expanding access to additional offshore reserves allows the United States to better understand where production potential exists and where capital should be invested,"" said Independent Petroleum Association of America senior vice president Dan Naatz. 
OCEANS TO OIL FIELDS
But lawmakers from both parties, environmental groups, governors and local business leaders said they were opposed to any effort to open coastlines to drilling rigs, citing environmental risks and threats to lucrative tourism industries.
Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott said he is aggressively fighting to plan. ""I have already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration,"" he said.
Environmental groups described the plan as dangerous. “Trump’s trying to turn our oceans into oilfields. His reckless plan would expose more wildlife and coastal communities to devastating oil spills,” said Kristen Monsell, ocean program legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity. 
Coastal tourism business groups were girding for a long fight against the proposal, which comes as the Gulf Coast recovers from the Deepwater spill. The plan would open the California coast where drilling opposition has been fierce since a major oil spill in the 1960s soiled popular beaches.
Frank Knapp, founder of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, accused the federal agency of favoring the oil and gas sector over the tourism sector.
""What part of the business sector are they listening to? It’s certainly not small or coastal businesses,” Knapp said.

The Defense Department has also raised concerns about opening drilling that had been banned off the eastern Gulf of Mexico, where military exercises are held.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose on Thursday to its highest since May 2015, on concern about supply risks due to unrest in Iran and another decline in U.S. inventories as refining activity hit a 12-year high.
U.S. oil stocks fell more than expected, continuing a steady drawdown of supplies in the world's largest oil consumer, though stocks of distillates and gasoline rose on heavy refining activity driven in part by year-end adjustments. 
However, cold weather across much of the country was expected to keep demand high, as heating oil prices were just off highs not seen since early 2015.
Brent crude (LCOc1), the international benchmark, rose 5 cents to $67.92 a barrel as of 1:53 a.m. EST (1853 GMT) after hitting a high of $68.27 earlier in the session. U.S. crude (CLc1) rose 34 cents to $61.97, after earlier hitting $62.21, its highest since May 2015.
Freezing weather in the United States has spurred short-term demand, especially for heating oil. Heating oil futures were down 0.8 percent to $2.0712 a gallon; the contract hit highs not seen since February 2014 earlier in the week.
U.S. crude stocks  fell by 7.4 million barrels in the last week of 2017, exceeding expectations, as refiners boosted activity to their highest rate since 2005, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Thursday.
""The draw was fairly in line with what we've seen in the latter half of 2017,"" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky. U.S. crude stocks have dropped by more than 78 million barrels since the middle of 2017 to 424.5 million, the lowest since September 2015.
Anti-government protests since last week in Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer, have added a geopolitical risk premium to oil prices, though the country's production and exports have not been affected, sources said.
Apart from a spike in May 2015, oil is trading at its highest since December 2014 - the month after a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to stop cutting output to support prices.
Analysts at JBC Energy said the price reaction to the Iranian unrest was overdone, while Swiss bank Julius Baer said prices projected ""an overly rosy picture"" that left the market at risk of profit-taking.
OPEC, supported by Russia and other non-members, began to reduce output a year ago to remove a glut built up in the previous two years. Compliance has been high, aided by involuntary declines in Venezuela, where the economy is collapsing, plus unrest in Nigeria and Libya. 
Producers have decided to extend the supply pact until the end of 2018.

OPEC's cuts are helping reduce global inventories, even as production continues to rise in the United States, where OPEC efforts are spurring more output from shale. U.S. production rose to 9.78 million barrels in the last week. [EIA/S]

710,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>",Commodities' Modest Growth Is Offset by Risk: Shelley Goldberg,"(Bloomberg View) -- The Bloomberg Spot Commodities Index has risen for 14 straight days to its highest since 2014. But don't expect the euphoria to last: 2018 will be a year of just modest growth.
Although each commodity has its own idiosyncratic characteristics and market, there are major macroeconomic factors influencing global prices.
China: As the largest consumer and producer of most global commodities, from steel to soybeans, China is set to continue on its path of growth and infrastructure development. Downside risks include rising leverage of the non-financial sector and uncertainty about housing prices. In December, the World Bank raised its forecast for China’s 2017 economic growth, supported by personal consumption and foreign trade, to 6.8 percent from 6.7 percent. But the government's campaign to reduce the financial sector has forced up borrowing costs, heightening concerns that gross domestic product growth could slow in 2018.
On the upside, it’s in China’s best interest to keep the price of export commodities high (these include rare-earth and industrial metals, coal, and grains). The country also wants to give a boost to commodities such as soybeans and corn, which are trading at depressed levels due to a global glut. China wants to increasingly call the shots when it comes to commodity prices in its effort to become a price-maker. To enable a large role in price discovery, commodity exchanges such as the Shanghai Futures Exchange and the Dalian Commodity Exchange are seeing increasing volumes from their efforts to increase the nation’s market share of exchange-traded commodities.
The dollar: Global commodities are typically traded in dollars, making the currency a major influence on prices. The dollar is negatively correlated to commodities, meaning a weak greenback boosts commodity prices. Throughout 2017, the dollar weakened against major currencies, while commodity prices benefited. More recently, with the signing of the U.S. tax bill, the dollar bounced from its annual lows. The Trump administration’s emphasis on growth generation, coupled with low inflation in the euro zone and Japan, means potentially moderate strength in the dollar and thus some pressure on global commodity prices.
Interest rates: Low rates are good for commodities. They allow businesses to expand and consume raw materials, and they encourage home building and auto sales, supporting energy, industrial metals, lumber and rubber. U.S. interest rates are at historically low levels, even though the Federal Reserve’s raised them three times in 2017 to reach its target of a 1.25 percent to 1.50 percent federal funds rate. Yet factoring in inflation at 1.5 percent makes the fed funds rate effectively 0 percent. So even though rates may be raised twice, and possibly four times, in 2018, expectations are already baked into forward curves, and such small moves, from a global perspective, should be manageable. Furthermore, the appointment of Jerome Powell to replace Janet Yellen as Fed chair will have minimal effects as they are, for the most part, like-minded in their approach to monetary policy. Global inflation, particularly in developed nations, is low and not a threat.
U.S. policy: If President Donald Trump follows through with his infrastructure plan, including a controversial border wall, commodity prices -- particularly steel, copper, zinc and lumber -- should soar. But little of this plan has come to fruition after his first year as president. Given how long it took to pass the tax bill, any rapid outcome on the infrastructure package is wishful thinking. Trump may be able to come through on his promises, though for now sheer hope continues to support commodity prices.
In advance of the Trump trade tariffs expected to take effect in 2018, many overseas producers have rushed to ship cargo to the U.S., particularly steel. This means shipments will slow down until inventory is consumed, pressuring prices early in 2018. 
The tax bill is largely bullish for commodity prices as it lowers the corporate tax to 21 percent from 35 percent and allows for a deduction of capital equipment. In a perfect commodities world, these savings would go toward capital spending. But that won’t happen. Savings may go toward cutting prices or to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks, or to employees through higher wages or additional funding for pension liabilities. As for individuals, the average household is expected to save about $1,000 in taxes but will likely pay off loans in light of rising rates.
Trump’s desire to drill for more energy could create a supply glut, pushing down prices of oil, gas and refined products. Although the measures will harm the environment, the easing of Environmental Protection Agency regulations and the passage of legislation opening Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling are initially good for energy equities, but not for oil and gas prices. There is only so much OPEC can cut before its actions become detrimental to its member nations.
Adding to a potential glut is the global drive for sustainability, recycling and resourcefulness through advanced technologies, such as electric cars, batteries, solar panels and biofuels. The world is increasingly eager for greater commodity efficiency, and while the U.S. did not sign the Paris climate accord, most American business chose to adhere to its standards anyway.
Geopolitical risk and mother nature: There’s plenty on the geopolitical front to keep supply-focused investors on edge: escalation of war in the Middle East and Africa, threats of a North Korean nuclear attack, terrorist groups and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of the Trump campaign's Russian ties. In addition, 2017 was a banner year for natural disasters. There’s an $81 billion package of relief for hurricane and wildfire victims in the U.S. as well to address the destruction from the Mexico earthquake. Fear of more to come from global warming or otherwise is supportive of commodities.
The upsides to commodity prices for 2018 look modestly consistent and rational, while the headwinds and their strength are far less predictable and more dangerous. A small gold hedge is advisable in a blended portfolio of consistently monitored commodity positions.

711,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>","Crude Prices Settle Higher, Shrugs Off Huge Gasoline, Distillates Build","Investing.com – Crude oil prices settled higher on Thursday after data showing crude stockpiles fell for the seventh-straight week offset a larger than expected build in product inventories.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for February delivery rose 0.62% to settle at $62.01 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 0.18% to trade at $67.97 a barrel.
Crude oil prices' bullish start to the week continued following an Energy Information Agency (EIA) inventory report showing crude stockpiles fell more-than-estimated but gains were capped somewhat as both distillates and gasoline inventories rose.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 7.4 million barrels for the week ended Dec. 29, beating expectations  of a draw of 4.7 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – rose by 4.8 million barrels, well above expectations for a rise of 2 million barrels, while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil –  rose by 8.9 million barrels, confounding expectations for a rise of just 500,000 barrels.
US distillate supplies are 20 million barrels below 2016 levels but just one million barrels shy of the ten-year seasonal average.
Crude production, however, continued to advance toward 10 million barrels per day, despite the Enchilada platform fire halting some Gulf of Mexico production. Total weekly U.S. production jumped by 28,000 barrels a day to nearly 9.8 million barrels a day, EIA reported on Thursday.
Sentiment in oil prices is expected to remain bullish through 2017, Merrill Lynch said in a note to clients, adding that the recovery in oil prices is sustainable as “oil cycles do not end abruptly” but through “gradual rebalancing of supply and demand.”"

Gold futures for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $1.30, or 0.10%, to $1,319.90 a troy ounce.
The recent rally in gold futures came under pressure amid investor concerns that continued upbeat US economic data could strengthen the case for the Fed to raise rates more than currently priced in. 
Private payrolls grew by 250,000 for December, a sharp increase from the 185,000 private jobs created in the previous month, according to a report released Wednesday by ADP and Moody's Analytics. That beat economists’ forecast of 191,000.
Bank of Montreal said the ADP data showed robust gains “across the board” and could raise expectations for a bullish non-farm payrolls report due Friday, which would keep the Fed on track for more rate hikes.
In a rising interest rate environment, investor appetite for gold weakens as the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal increases relative to other interest-bearing assets such as bonds.
Losses in gold, however, were capped by a continued slump in the greenback as it struggled to rebound from three-month lows.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures rose 0.05% to $17.27 a troy ounce, while platinum futures gained 0.64% to $968.80. 
Copper traded at $3.26, rose 0.11%, while natural gas fell 3.96% to $2.89. The fall in natural gas comes amid data showing natural gas storage fell by 206 billion cubic feet, missing expectations for a draw of 219.43 billion cubic feet. "

Crude oil for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained $0.14, or 0.23%, to trade at $61.77 a barrel by 11:02AM ET (16:02GMT) compared to $61.81 ahead of the report.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 7.419 million barrels in the week ended December 22. Market analysts' had expected a crude-stock draw of 5.148 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Wednesday reported a supply draw of 4.992 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 2.441 million barrels last week, the EIA said. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 424.5 million barrels as of last week, according to press release, which the EIA considered to be “in the middle of the average range for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 4.813 million barrels, compared to expectations for a build of 2.182 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles rose by 8.899 million barrels, compared to forecasts for an increase of 0.477 million.
The report came out one day later than usual due to the New Year’s holiday.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for March delivery fell $0.14, or 0.21%, to $67.70 by 11:07AM ET (16:07GMT), compared to $67.87 before the release.
Meanwhile, Brent's premium to the WTI crude contract stood at $5.94 a barrel by 11:13AM ET (16:13GMT), compared to a gap of $5.21 by close of trade on Wednesday.
Oil prices have been holding near their highest level since May 2015 this week as recent unrest in Iran supported prices.
Six days of anti-government protests marked the biggest challenge to the country's clerical leadership since 2009, while Iran's Revolutionary Guards deployed forces to three provinces in order to put down the rebellion.
So far the unrest has had little impact on Iranian oil production with experts suggesting that, beyond worker strikes, the country’s oil resources are located far from where protests are currently taking place.
Crude prices have also been underpinned by production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers led by Russia who agreed at the end of November to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
However, concerns remain that increasing production levels from U.S. shale production will derail OPEC’s efforts to rebalance markets.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for February delivery fell 1.7 cents to $1.7897 a gallon by 11:11AM ET (16:11GMT), while February heating oil dropped 1.2 cents to $2.08 a gallon.

The State Department also said it had re-designated 10 other nations as ""countries of particular concern"" under the International Religious Freedom Act for having engaged in or tolerated egregious violations of religious freedom.
The re-designated countries were China, Eritrea, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. They were re-designated on Dec. 22.
""The protection of religious freedom is vital to peace, stability, and prosperity,"" the department said in a statement. ""These designations are aimed at improving the respect for religious freedom in these countries.""
U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized Pakistan for not doing more to combat terrorism, and his administration has informed members of Congress that it will announce plans to end ""security assistance"" payments to the country.

Pakistan has said it is already doing a lot to fight militants, and summoned the U.S. ambassador to explain a tweet by Trump that said the United States had been foolish in dispensing aid to Islamabad.

715,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 10:32AM ET</span>",Commodities - Natural Gas Futures Turn Negative After Storage Data,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures turned around and registered losses in North American trade on Thursday, after data showed that natural gas supplies in storage in the U.S. declined less than expected last week.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. fell by 206 billion cubic feet in the week ended December 29, while analysts had forecast a decline of 221 billion.
After the release, natural gas for delivery in February on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 0.3 cents, or about 0.10%, to trade at $3.003 per million British thermal units by 10:32AM ET (14:32GMT).
Futures had been rising by 2.4 cents, or about 0.8%, at $3.032 prior to the release of the supply data.
That compared with a draw of 112 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the preceding week and represented a decline of 192 billion from a year earlier and was also 192 bcf below the five-year average.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.126 trillion cubic feet, 5.8% lower than levels at this time a year ago and also 5.8% below the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas started off the year above the $3.00 mark this week where it has remained despite some profit-taking in the last few of days.
A wave of freezing weather hitting the eastern United States has spiked demand as cold weather entices customers to turn up their thermostats. In fact, Bloomberg data showed that the U.S. burned record levels of natural gas just as temperatures hit all-time lows on New Year’s Day. 
Adding to the supply side of the bullish equation, the severe cold is actually cutting production as water vapor in pipeline systems freezes and thus hinders the flow of gas.
However, observers remark that these shutdowns are temporary and that the bigger picture in natural gas prices reflects the belief that the solid growth in output that began in the second half of 2017 will continue, limiting the possibility of supply shortages."

For instance, a recent Reuters poll of about three dozen economists and analysts called for Brent North Sea crude to average about $60 a barrel in 2018. The West Texas Intermediate average was about $56..In fact, that's less than new-year levels of $67 for Brent and $61 for WTI.Analysts say current prices reflect a bit of a boost from concerns that civil unrest in major oil producer Iran could lead to supply disruption. Without that happening, market watchers say prices are bound to decline a bit. The other risk to prices is supply. Right now, solid global demand, especially from China, and reduced production from OPEC and Russia, are supporting the market.If major producers don't stick to previously agreed production cuts, prices will suffer."

West Texas Intermediate futures closest to expiry are trading at the biggest premium to the next month in more than three years, as inventories plunge at the key storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma. Stockpiles at Cushing -- the delivery point for WTI contracts -- slid to the lowest since February 2015 last week.
A winter storm in the U.S. is also boosting demand for heating oil, while some power plants are running short of supplies. Brent and WTI closed on Wednesday at the highest since December 2014 amid optimism that OPEC-led output cuts will continue to rebalance the market. Equity markets have also been buoyed by gains in oil and gas stocks.
“You have the continued stock draws in Cushing supporting the WTI spreads,” Petromatrix Managing Director Olivier Jakob said by phone. “The harsh weather in the U.S. is a supportive factor. There’s a global move into oil as we start the year.”
Options traders are now also betting on continued strength in WTI. The equivalent of more than 10 million barrels of bullish call options contracts that profit most with WTI in backwardation of more than 15 cents a barrel traded on Wednesday. The premium on WTI for February delivery versus March widened to as much as 16 cents on Thursday, the most backwardated since November 2014.
The global Brent benchmark has seen similar strength, with the premium of December 2018 Brent futures over December 2019 rising to $3.81 a barrel on Thursday, the highest since it began trading. As well as tightening supply and the U.S. storm, Brent has also been supported by political tensions in Iran, said Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates Ltd.
“The market is tightening and it’s tightening very quickly,” Energy Aspects Ltd. Chief Oil Market Analyst Amrita Sen said on Bloomberg TV. “The inventory overhang for all intents and purposes has drawn down, there’s not that much really left.”

719,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>",Quest for new oil discoveries still on back burner,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Despite the strongest start for oil prices in four years, the world's top oil companies are hesitating to accelerate the search for new resources as a determination to retain capital discipline trumps the hope of making bonanza discoveries.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), Total and their peers are set to cut spending on oil and gas exploration for a fifth year in a row in 2018, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie (WoodMac), despite a growing urgency to replenish reserves after years of reining back investment.
(For graphic 'Global spending on oil and gas exploration' click http://reut.rs/2CjAONv)
Global investment in exploration, vital to increase output and offset the natural decline of existing fields, will reach $37 billion in 2018, down 7 percent from a year earlier and over 60 percent below the 2014 peak, according to WoodMac.
For majors, spending will collectively drop by around 4 percent this year to represent about a tenth of investment in oil and gas production, known as upstream.
""This could be the new normal, with the days of one dollar in six or seven going to exploration forever in the past,"" WoodMac said in a report. 
The declines, however, mask a modest uptick in drilling activity as lower rig rates and a focused approach on well-charted basins allow firms to do more with their money, according to WoodMac analyst Andrew Latham.
""Investment will be down year-on year but activity will be flat to slightly higher,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
The collapse in oil prices in 2014 led to a deep retrenchment in spending for the sector, but companies still need to increase their resources as reserves dwindle.
As crude prices and profits recover - prices are currently above $65 a barrel, the highest since mid-2015 - the push to beef up reserves will only increase. 
The exploration success rate has dropped from 40 percent to 35 percent over the past decade, highlighting the importance of acquisitions as an alternative, albeit generally more expensive, to build resources.
""Exploration spending (is) to remain low ... implying the need for more merger and acquisition"" activity, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said.
After spending more than $30 billion on acquisitions in 2017, oil Majors are expected to continue to make bolt-on purchases in areas where they already operate, even though the ""upstream M&A window is starting to close,"" RBC said, alluding to higher asset valuations and fewer distressed sellers. 
The majors will once again be the ones to watch thanks to stronger balance sheets compared with smaller rivals, WoodMac's Latham said. 
Exploration is expected to focus on deepwater basins such as Mexico, Brazil and Guyana where large discoveries have been made in recent years, offering more confidence that additional resources could be found, he added.
The most watched exploration wells include  BP  (LON:BP) and Kosmos Energy in Senegal, Total and Petrobras in Brazil, Exxon in Guyana, Total and Pemex in Mexico and Eni in Cyprus, according to WoodMac.

The growing appetite for exploration was made clear last October when the top oil companies vied for blocks in Brazil's first deepwater oil auction for foreign operators, where Shell was awarded half of the blocks.

Minutes of the Fed's December meeting showed officials expect reductions in corporate and personal taxes to provide boosts to consumer and business spending, though they remain somewhat unsure of how much impact the recently passed reform effort will have.
The Federal Open Market Committee increased their expectations for 2018 GDP growth from 2.1%, or about trend since the post-financial crisis recovery, to 2.5%. “Most participants indicated that prospective changes in federal tax policy were a factor that led them to boost their projections of real GDP growth over the next couple of years,” the minutes stated.
While generally looking favorably on the rising stock market indexes, some officials have expressed concern that keeping policy overly accommodative could inflate bubbles.
“In light of elevated asset valuations and low financial market volatility, a couple of participants expressed concern that the persistence of highly accommodative financial conditions could, over time, pose risks to financial stability,” the minutes said.

725,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 03:55PM ET</span>","Canada criticizes U.S. softwood lumber duties, vows to resist","By Rod Nickel
WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - The Canadian government on Wednesday criticized the United States for a decision to impose duties on certain softwood lumber exports and underlined its determination to fight the move.
The duties, which went into effect on Wednesday, are ""unfair, unwarranted and troubling,"" Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.
Ottawa has already launched challenges against the duties - which range from about 10 percent to nearly 24 percent, below a preliminary range of about 17 percent to 31 percent - with the World Trade Organization (WTO) and through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
""The government of Canada will continue to vigorously defend our industry and its workers against protectionist trade practices,"" Freeland said.
The U.S. Commerce Department's decision imposes anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties affecting about $5.66 billion worth of lumber and comes amid increasingly acrimonious talks on renegotiating NAFTA, the trilateral trade pact between the United States, Canada and Mexico.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said he had every confidence the administration of President Donald Trump would win the trade challenges Canada has launched.
""(We) will continue to stand up against unfair trade practices that harm American workers and businesses. Even our closest allies must follow the rules,"" he said in a statement.
The Commerce Department accuses Canada of unfairly subsidizing and dumping softwood lumber, which is commonly used in the construction of homes. Canada denies it is dumping the lumber.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed confidence that the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission closely followed U.S. law and that their actions were consistent with the country's WTO obligations.
""We will of course defend this case and expect to prevail,” Lighthizer said. 
Some of the main affected Canadian firms are West Fraser Timber Co Ltd, Canfor Corp, Conifex Timber Inc, Western Forest Products Inc, Interfor Corp and Resolute FP Canada Ltd. Shares in the firms were little changed on Wednesday.
The decision to impose tariffs followed failed talks to end the decades-long dispute between the two countries. The row centers on the fees paid by Canadian lumber mills for timber cut largely from government-owned land. Those fees are lower than fees paid on U.S. timber, which comes largely from private land.
Joe Patton, U.S. Lumber Coalition Co‐Chair and Vice President of Wood Products at The Westervelt Company, defended the U.S. move on Wednesday.
""These duties are a fair enforcement of U.S. trade law. For decades, the Canadian government has abused the law and provided massive subsidies to its lumber industry, harming U.S. producers and workers,"" he said.
The Lumber Trade Council of British Columbia, a province with a significant forestry industry, said last month it was confident the decision would be overturned, calling it ""completely without merit.""

Around 33 percent of the lumber used in the United States in 2016 was imported, with more than 95 percent coming from Canada, according to the U.S. National Association of Homebuilders.

Wednesday’s 2 percent jump in New York-traded futures delivered exactly what the largest cohort of oil executives in a Dallas Federal Reserve survey last month said they needed to justify more shale exploration: prices above $61. If crude continues to climb and crosses the $66 mark, even more corporate chiefs indicated they’re ready to pile in, according to the survey.
U.S. shale drillers have become OPEC’s bogeyman because of their penchant for lightning-fast drilling expansions that threaten to undo the cartel’s hard-won reductions of a worldwide glut. For the day, oil rose on expectations that a U.S. government report scheduled for release on Thursday will register the longest decline in crude stockpiles since the summer driving season.
“The U.S. shale-OPEC tug of war will simultaneously cap upside price potential and downside risks,” said Stephen Brennock, an analyst at PVM Oil Associates Ltd. in London.
In its survey of more than 100 oil industry executives in Texas, New Mexico and Louisiana, the Dallas Fed found 42 percent would expand drilling with prices between $61 to $65. Another 31 percent would increase investment when prices topped $66, the survey found.
Oil has risen for the past two years as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers including Russia trimmed supplies to reduce a global glut.
West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rose $1.10 to $61.48 a barrel at 12:26 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That’s the highest intraday price since June 2015.

The 14 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 32.47 million barrels a day, according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts, oil companies and ship-tracking data.
Libya saw a 30,000-barrel-a-day decline to 970,000 a day following a pipeline blast, which was offset by an increase from Nigeria. Both countries were exempt from cuts last year but are now expected to join the effort with a combined limit of 2.8 million barrels a day. OPEC and its allies agreed Nov. 30 to extend their output agreement until the end of 2018 to balance the market.
Production in Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest member, slipped by 20,000 barrels a day to 9.95 million a day, the surveyed showed. Venezuela, which has suffered a slump in output amid economic collapse and U.S. sanctions, reduced volumes by a further 50,000 barrels a day to 1.81 million a day.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude February contract was up 68 cents or about $1.13 at $61.05 a barrel by 04:00 a.m. ET (08:00 GMT), the highest since June 2015.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was little changed at $66.56 a barrel, close to the nearly three-year peak of $67.29 hit in the previous session.
Oil prices had climbed amid Iranian protests, marking the biggest challenge to the country's clerical leadership since 2009. However, the protests were showing no signs of impacting Iran's oil production.
Crude prices continued to be supported by production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The producers agreed in December to extend current oil output cuts until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
Overall optimism appeared to overshadow reports that U.S. production is set to rise further and doubts over whether demand growth can continue at current levels.

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday to new two-and-a-half year highs as robust output in the United States and Russia balanced tensions from a sixth day of unrest in OPEC member Iran. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $60.87 a barrel at 1241 GMT, up 49 cents from their last close and their highest level since June 2015.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) - the international benchmark for oil prices - were at $67 a barrel, up 43 cents but still trailing Tuesday's high of $67.29 that was the most since May 2015.
Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), warned that prices faced a correction as support lent by unrest in Iran will weaken unless the situation begins to affect oil production, which is not yet the case, or the United States re-imposes sanctions. 
""It's surprising that prices remain at such elevated levels near two-and-a-half year highs despite the main cause of the recent rally disappearing,"" Fritsch said, referring to the restart of the North Sea Forties pipeline system. 
Commerzbank predicts Brent will see out 2018 at $60 a barrel. 
Traders said markets had recently overshot as U.S. production is set to rise further and doubts are emerging about whether demand growth can continue at current levels.
Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark's Saxo Bank, warned ""multiple but temporary supply disruptions"" like the North Sea Forties and Libyan pipeline outages (and) protests across Iran ... helped create a record speculative long bet.""
With the pipeline outages resolved and the protests in Iran showing no signs of affecting its oil production, Hansen said there was potential for a price downturn in early 2018, especially due to rising U.S. output.
""It is only a matter of time before the 10 million barrel per day (bpd) (U.S.) production target will be reached,"" Hansen said.
Supplies were healthy. U.S. oil production  has risen by almost 16 percent since the middle of 2016, hitting 9.75 million bpd at the end of last year.
Concerns over Russia potentially not fully living up to its OPEC pledge to cut output by 300,000 bpd from the 30-year monthly high of 11.247 million bpd hit in October 2016 weighed on sentiment. 
The latest data for 2017 shows Russian output rose to an average of 10.98 million bpd, compared with 10.96 million bpd in 2016 and 10.72 million bpd in 2015.
""Even though they have reduced that astronomical number (from Oct. 2016), they are still producing more (in 2017 than in 2016),"" said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services (FIS) in Dubai.
Commerzbank said in a note that despite the marginal annual increase Russia was still complying with its deal to cut output as seen in the lower December production figure of 10.95 million bpd. 
Saxo Bank's Hansen said he also had ""some concerns about the Chinese economy in 2018 that ultimately could lead to lower than expected demand growth.""

As a result, he said his bank saw lower crude prices by the end of the year, with Brent at $60 per barrel and WTI at $57.

732,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 08:27AM ET</span>",Column: OPEC's focus on stocks risks prices overshooting - Kemp,"By John Kemp
LONDON (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is sticking doggedly to its plan to cut commercial oil inventories down to the five-year average to rebalance the oil market.
But in doing so, the organization risks tightening the market too much, sending prices sharply higher and encouraging a faster-than-expected acceleration in production from U.S. shale producers.
Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, who is the organization's de facto leader, has reiterated that stocks are still around 150 million barrels too high and it would be premature to discuss an exit strategy or change of course.
“Almost the single metric we look at is global inventories and of course the most transparent and trustworthy is the OECD,” he said in an interview before Christmas (“Saudi energy minister Q&A with Reuters”, Dec. 20).
OPEC, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) all have slightly different figures for OECD commercial crude and products stocks, but they show a similar trend.
OPEC estimates that total stocks were around 137 million barrels higher than the five-year average in October, down by around half since May (“Monthly Oil Market Report”, OPEC, December 2017).
IEA puts commercial stocks about 111 million barrels above the prior five-year average at the end of October (“Oil Market Report”, IEA, December 2017).
EIA data shows commercial stocks 167 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average at the end of October, down from a surplus of 380 million barrels in July 2016 (http://tmsnrt.rs/2CgLBYl).
While the specific numbers differ, mostly for definitional and methodological reasons, the data from each of the agencies shows the stock overhang compared with the five-year average has narrowed significantly.
Most of the remaining overhang is concentrated in crude oil rather than refined products such as gasoline and heating oil.
Product inventories are already tight in some cases, notably for middle distillates such as gasoil, diesel fuel and heating oil.
BRENT SPREADS
OPEC seems determined to drive total stocks down to the five-year average, or very close to it, before starting to increase its own output.
But that would almost certainly leave stockpiles uncomfortably low, send benchmark Brent prices well above $70 per barrel and push the market into a big backwardation.
Global oil consumption has increased by more 6 million barrels per day over the last five years, according to the EIA.
Other things equal, the oil industry will want to carry significantly higher stocks in 2018 than in 2013 to cover the increase in consumption.
Brent futures prices for the next six months are already trading in a backwardation of around $2 per barrel, which is consistent with a market that is already tight and undersupplied.
The six-month Brent calendar spread is trading around the 78th percentile of its historical range, up from the 22nd percentile at the same point last year.
The calendar spread is watched by many physical traders as the most reliable indicator of the balance between production, consumption and inventories.
Backwardation is normally associated with a market that is undersupplied and a low and declining level of inventories, while contango is normally associated with oversupply and high/rising stocks.
The Brent market has cycled regularly between backwardation and contango over the last 25 years as it moves between periods of under- and oversupply.
The sustained shift from contango in 2015/16 to backwardation in late 2017 and at the start of 2018 strongly suggests the market has switched from oversupply to undersupply.
Calendar spreads for all months in 2018 have tightened significantly over the last six months suggesting traders see the market moving towards a sustained period of undersupply.
SEASONAL VARIANCE
Most forecasters, including the IEA and OPEC, predict the oil market will be in a small surplus during the first half of 2018, followed by a deficit in the second.
The expected rise in stocks during the first half is one reason why OPEC and its allies think market rebalancing will not be completed until later in the year and agreed to keep their output unchanged.
But a seasonal increase in stocks is normal during the first six months, which includes the principal maintenance period for many refineries.
Later in the year, the summer driving season in the United States and winter heating season in the northern hemisphere typically boost consumption in the second half.
Increasing crude stocks during the first half of 2018 would only signify a weakening market if stocks rise faster than normal.
TIGHTEN TOO MUCH
History suggests that OPEC will gamble on tightening the market too much, with prices overshooting on the upside, rather than risk not tightening it enough and prices fall back.
After the past two oil market slumps, in 1997/98 and 2008/09, prices subsequently overshot the organization's formal and informal targets of $28 and $75 per barrel respectively.
Front-month Brent futures prices reached almost $35 per barrel in late 2000 and more than $125 per barrel in early 2011.
The six-month calendar spread hit about $4.50 per barrel backwardation in both cases before starting to ease lower.
OPEC has not declared a price target for 2018, though some senior officials from member countries have briefed they want to see a Brent price floor of $60, which implies an annual average well above this.
In the past, OPEC members have tended to revise their price targets upwards as market prices rise, in a ratchet effect.
Re-running history, informal price targets, as implied in statements made by officials from OPEC members, have already risen significantly since the start of 2017.
Most OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, want to see higher oil prices to boost revenues and close their budget and current account deficits.
Saudi Arabia also needs higher prices to finance its ambitious social and economic transformation program and create positive sentiment around the planned sale of shares in its national oil company.
In practice, if OPEC comes anywhere near achieving its objective of draining stocks down to the five-year average level, prices will likely end up well above $70, which will probably be welcomed by most OPEC members.
But the more prices increase, especially with Brent prices near $70, and WTI prices above $60, the more likely U.S. shale drilling and production rates will accelerate, which will tend to frustrate the objective of lowering stocks.

734,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2018 07:53AM ET</span>",Column: Hedge funds gamble OPEC will tighten oil market too much - Kemp,"By John Kemp
LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds are the most bullish about oil prices in years, expecting further gains even as prices touch multi-year highs and ignoring the risk linked to such a large concentration of positions.
A record net long position has been accumulated by hedge funds and other money managers, amounting to 1,183 million barrels in the five biggest futures and options contracts covering crude, gasoline and heating oil.
Portfolio managers held a record 1,328 million barrels of long positions in Brent, WTI, U.S. gasoline and U.S. heating oil on Dec. 26, according to data published by regulators and exchanges.
By contrast, hedge funds held only 145 million barrels of short positions, the lowest level for 10 months and among the lowest at any point since the start of 2013.
Fund managers now hold more than nine long positions for every short position, the most bullish picture for at least five years (http://tmsnrt.rs/2CduGpC).
There are record net long positions in Brent crude (561 million barrels), WTI (461 million barrels) and U.S. heating oil (82 million barrels).
There are also large, if not quite record, net long positions in U.S. gasoline (79 million barrels) and European gasoil (131 million barrels).
In many of these contracts hedge fund positioning appears extremely stretched, with the ratio of long to short positions at multi-year highs.
DOWNSIDE RISK
The concentration of so many bullish positions poses a significant downside risk to prices if and when portfolio managers decide to close them out and realize some of their paper profits.
For the time being, however, most fund managers are ignoring the liquidation risk and focusing on the prospect of further price increases first.
There are plenty of reasons to be bullish about the outlook in 2018. The global economy is in a synchronized upswing and world trade is growing at the fastest rate since the start of the decade.
Stocks of crude and products have fallen significantly since the middle of 2017. Oil demand is growing rapidly while OPEC and its allies have extended their production pact until at least the middle of the year.
History suggests OPEC is more likely to tighten the oil market too much and allow prices to overshoot on the upside than rather than relax production cuts too early and risk prices falling back.
Such was the case after both the previous oil market slumps in 1997/98 and 2008/09, with prices overshooting the producer group's initial targets.
OPEC’s tightening bias probably explains why many hedge funds remain bullish despite benchmark Brent prices moving towards $70 a barrel.
The main downside risk comes from a resurgence of U.S. shale oil production, with WTI prices now above $60 a barrel.
If shale output starts to climb faster than expected OPEC could be forced to halt production cuts earlier than currently envisaged.
The existence of so many hedge fund long positions could eventually magnify the downside risk posed by U.S. shale.
However, most hedge fund managers seem to have concluded that the risk is some way off and prices have more scope to climb before the inevitable correction.

Gold futures for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.26% to $1,319.50 a troy ounce.
In his tweet, Trump said: ""North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!""

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for February delivery rose 0.08% to $60.42 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 0.09% to trade at $66.55 a barrel.
On Wednesday, the American Petroleum Institute will report its weekly estimates of US crude and refined product inventories followed by official data from the Energy Information Administration on Thursday.
Initial analyst estimates see a 5.260 million drop in crude, a 1.030 million build in distillates and a 1.864 million gain in gasoline stocks.
Military officials say that a ballistic missile launch by North Korea is possible, if not likely, in the coming days. US intelligence has seen the kind of activity (moving around equipment, etc) that has, in the past, presaged an ICBM launch, according to two officials who requested anonymity.
One official said that a possible launch could happen mid-week. The other official characterized the timeline as the “short-term.”
Iran faces another day of demonstrations in some of the country's most widespread street protests in nearly a decade, with protesters demanding an end to the Islamic Republic regime and a change in leadership.
Overnight, crude oil prices settled lower on Tuesday, as the North Sea Forties pipeline restarted offsetting support from potential supply disruptions in Iran amid ongoing anti-government protests.
Crude oil prices started the year on a sour note as pipelines in the North Sea and Libya reopened offsetting gains on expectations unrest in Iran could spark supply disruptions.
The 450,000 barrel per day (bpd) capacity Forties pipeline system in the North Sea returned to full operations on Dec. 30 after an unplanned shutdown while a Libyan pipelined gradually returned to production after an explosion last week disrupted operations.
The restart of the Fourties pipeline weighed heavily on Brent crude, narrowing the Brent-WTI spread to its lowest in nearly two weeks.
The sharp rise in oil prices, however, has encouraged US shale oil producers to ramp up output raising fears US output could hit record highs of over 10 million bpd in the weeks ahead.
U.S. oil production averaged about 9.6 million barrels per day in 2017, rising 1.8% to 9.64 million barrels a day in October.
Sentiment on oil prices remained bullish despite fears over rising US production as data published by regulators and exchanges showed portfolio managers held a record 1.33 billion barrels of long positions in Brent, WTI, U.S. gasoline and U.S. heating oil during the week ending Dec. 26.
The recent rally in oil prices above the $60 barrel has been largely supported by the OPEC-led output cuts and expectations for growing global demand.
In November, OPEC agreed to extend joint production cuts with Russia of 1.8 million barrels per day through 2018.

739,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>","U.S. Cold Blast Menaces Winter Wheat, Cattle as Prices Climb","(Bloomberg) -- Bitterly cold weather in the middle of the U.S. is threatening wheat plants as cattle battle to stay warm.
A wide swath of the U.S. wheat belt faced readings below 0 Fahrenheit (-18 Celsius) on Monday, damaging crops that didn’t have a protective layer of snow, according to World Weather Inc. Temperatures through Jan. 4 are forecast at 15 to 25 degrees below normal from the Southern Plains to Ohio Valley, the National Weather Service forecasts. The chill can also slow grain movement as ice builds on rivers and railways.
March futures tracking both hard red winter and soft red winter wheat climbed to the highest since early December in Chicago, while the February cattle contract reached a one-month high. Feeder-cattle futures rose as much as 4.5 cents, the exchange limit.
For wheat, “widespread winterkill occurred on Monday across southeastern Colorado, much of Kansas, far northern Oklahoma, central Missouri, southern Illinois, and southwestern Indiana,” according to Radiant Solutions.
The full extent of the grain damage won’t be known until the crop begins to grow again in the spring, said Mike O’Dea, risk management consultant for INTL FCStone in Kansas City, Missouri. Winter wheat is planted in the fall and lies dormant during the winter months until warmer weather triggers further plant development. Several of the top U.S. growing states have also faced an expanding drought in the past few months.
The cold weather means it takes longer for cattle to add pounds, though the impact isn’t expected to last long, said Dennis Smith, a senior account executive at Archer Financial Services in Chicago. While hogs and poultry are primarily raised indoors, cattle graze on pastureland and bulk up in outdoor feedlots throughout the year.
“When it’s so cold, they have to consume so much energy just to stay warm that the weight gain is going to be minimal,” Smith said. Once the freeze ends, “they also will probably recover fairly quickly because it’s not going to be a huge muddy mess,” thanks to recent dry weather, he said.

740,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 02, 2018 02:00PM ET</span>",OPEC Wins Over Investors for Most Bullish Start of Year Ever,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil bulls are charging into the new year with unprecedented vigor, and the credit goes to OPEC.
The signs that the group is winning its tug of war with shale are compelling, and money managers have taken note: Their combined bets on rising prices for West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude ended the year at a record. The question now is: Will all that enthusiasm persist for the rest of this year?
“At least through the first half of 2018, they’ll stay pretty bullish,” said Ashley Petersen, lead oil-market strategist at Stratas Advisors in New York. “June will be a real turning point because that’s when we’ll hear about unwinding the deal, and if OPEC doesn’t handle it delicately, then there will be concern that the market will be flooded with oil again.”
The last week of 2017 saw futures trading above $60 a barrel in New York and $67 in London for the first time since mid-2015, after the two most important oil benchmarks surged more than 40 percent from their doldrums in June. The rally came on the back of a well-orchestrated campaign led by Saudi Arabia and Russia to enforce and extend supply curbs implemented by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing nations.
The effort culminated with a meeting in Vienna in November, where the group and its allies agreed to extend the cuts through the end of 2018. Meanwhile, U.S. crude stockpiles have declined by about a fifth since peaking in March and approached the end of 2017 at their lowest level since October 2015. 
While the threat of too much shale production still looms, producers ended the year a lot less gung-ho than they started. Under pressure from investors to focus on profits over growth, explorers have slowed down on drilling with the U.S. rig count stalling in December.
“The expectation is that the rebalance will continue,” Gene McGillian, a market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, said by telephone. “We’ve approached an area where we really need to see a steady diet of positive information.”
The optimism wasn’t so widespread earlier in 2017. Concern that OPEC’s efforts weren’t enough and would end abruptly in March 2018 led short-sellers to dominate the scene for several months, with WTI plunging to the low-$40s in June.
""It really wasn’t until the fourth quarter that we saw a resounding faith in the recovery,"" Stratas Advisors’ Petersen said.
Global events also swung the market up and down along the way, such as Hurricane Harvey, supply disruptions in Libya and Kurdistan, a pipeline shutdown in the North Sea, and last but not least, a brutal cold snap in the final week of 2017 that drove up demand for heating oil, fuel oil and natural gas.
One of the most remarkable shifts that occurred in 2017, if a very technical one, was the change in the futures curve -- first for Brent and more recently for WTI. Contracts for nearby delivery are trading at a premium to longer-dated ones as demand rises and supplies tighten. This pattern, known as backwardation, hadn’t been seen so consistently since 2014.
Hedge funds boosted their Brent net-long position -- the difference between bets on a rally and wagers on a decline -- by 4.3 percent to a record 561,284 futures and options during the week ended Dec. 26, according to data from ICE Futures Europe. Longs increased 4.3 percent to an all-time high 622,607, while shorts, which reached a nine-month low in November, rose 4.5 percent to 61,323.
The net-long position on WTI increased 7.3 percent to 411,972, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday. That was close to a record set in February. Longs rose by 5.3 percent and shorts fell by 11 percent.
Record Hedging
The net-short position of swap dealers, an indication of hedging, increased for the 11th straight week to a fresh record, according to the CFTC data.
In the fuel market, money managers increased their net-long position on benchmark U.S. gasoline by about 10 percent. Meanwhile, the net-bullish position on diesel rose by 26 percent to a record as the cold snap boosted heating demand.
But all that enthusiasm could start waning this year. Prices for both Brent and WTI will probably be stuck between $40 and $60 a barrel for most of this year as U.S. shale production rises, global supplies remain high and compliance with OPEC-led output cuts falters, Moody’s Investors Service said Tuesday.
WTI fell 0.2 percent to $60.29 a barrel at 12:50 p.m. in New York on Tuesday, while Brent lost 0.6 percent to $66.45 in London.
“Prices will likely remain range-bound, and possibly volatile, on a combination of increasing U.S. shale production, reduced but still significant global supplies, and potential non-compliance with agreed production cuts -- especially if demand growth is more tepid,” Moody’s senior vice president Terry Marshall said in the report.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Tuesday after hitting mid-2015 highs in early trading, as major pipelines in Libya and the UK restarted and U.S production soared to the highest in more than four decades. 
It was the first time since January 2014 that the two crude oil benchmarks opened the year above $60 per barrel, buoyed by large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) traded 20 cents lower at around $60.22 a barrel by 11:34 a.m. EST (1634 GMT). In early trading WTI hit $60.74, the highest since June 2015.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1), the international benchmark, were down 53 cents, or 0.8 percent at $66.34 a barrel. The session high of $67.29 was the highest since May 2015.
The spread between U.S. crude and Brent  hit the narrowest in nearly two weeks. 
The 450,000 barrel per day (bpd) capacity Forties pipeline system in the North Sea returned to full operations on Dec. 30 after an unplanned shutdown.
Repairs have been finished on a Libyan oil pipeline damaged in a suspected attack last week and production is restarting gradually, engineers said.
""The resolution of the North Sea pipeline issue is having the expected result that the Brent-WTI spread is narrowing today,"" David Thompson, executive vice-president at Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington.
Thompson added that traders have been returning to work from the holidays, boosting volumes.
""Despite the day's price weakness, both Brent and WTI remain in solid, long-term bullish trends - $58.95 is nearby support on WTI front-month futures and $65.60 is the corresponding support on front-month Brent futures,"" Thompson said.
Iran's Supreme Leader on Tuesday accused the country's enemies of stirring unrest, as the death toll rose to 21 from anti-government demonstrations that began last week.[nL8N1OX0XY] 
Iran is OPEC's third largest crude producer. Iranian oil industry and shipping sources said protests have had no impact so far on oil production or exports.
""Geopolitical risks are clearly back on the crude oil agenda after having been absent almost entirely since the oil market ran into a surplus in the second half of 2014,"" Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, said, also citing Kurdistan and Libya.
Oil markets have been supported by a year of production cuts led by the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. The cuts started in January 2017 and are scheduled to cover all of 2018.
U.S. commercial crude oil inventories have fallen by almost 20 percent from their historic highs last March, to 431.9 million barrels.
Strong demand growth, especially from China, has also been supporting crude.
However, rising U.S. production, which is on the verge of breaking through 10 million bpd, has tempered the bullish outlook.
""We think U.S. tight oil production growth warrants close monitoring as it could spoil OPEC's market-balancing efforts, pushing the market into surplus in 2018,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) bank said.
October U.S crude production rose 167,000 barrels per day to 9.64 million bpd, according to the EIA's monthly production report. If the figure is not revised next month, it would be the highest monthly level since May 1971.

Bullion advanced for an eighth session to head for the longest stretch of gains since mid-2011, building on an annual surge.
Bullion for immediate delivery advanced 0.8 percent to $1,313.73 an ounce at 8:57 a.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg generic pricing. Last year, the commodity climbed 14 percent, the best performance in seven years. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index lost 8.5 percent in 2017.
Gold’s strong run in 2017 came even as U.S. stock markets surged to records and the Federal Reserve increased interest rates three times amid signs of an improving economy. Fed policy makers are projecting another three hikes in 2018, while other central banks around the world have also shifted toward a tighter monetary stance, with the European Central Bank planning to halve its asset purchases starting this month. Higher rates can make non-interest-bearing assets such as gold less competitive.
“As global complacency over the trajectory of U.S. rates continues to be astoundingly low, precious metals in general should continue to benefit,” Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. in Singapore, said in a note. “The old adage that the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent appears to be alive and well in the gold market at the moment.”
Bullion’s 14-day relative strength index was at 73.1, up from 69.1 on Friday and above the level of 70 that can indicate that an asset may be set for a decline. “The relative strength index is now at very overbought levels,” Halley said.

The International Energy Agency has said that oil demand rose by 1.5 million barrels a day in 2017, and will increase further in 2018 by 1.3 million barrels a day.
In other energy trading, gasoline futures lost 0.22% to end at $1.7870 a gallon on Friday, while heating oil rose 0.78% to $2.0657 a gallon.
Meanwhile, natural gas futures rose 1.44% to $2.956 per million British thermal units in late trade.

751,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 01, 2018 08:18AM ET</span>",Gold / Silver / Copper Prices - Weekly Outlook: January 2 - 5,"Investing.com - A weaker dollar helped propel gold prices to a three-month high back above the $1,300 level on Friday in the final trading day of 2017.
Gold futures for February delivery settled up 0.61% at $1,305.10 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, its highest close since September.
For the year, the precious metal gained 14%, the largest yearly percentage gain since 2010.
Recent weakness in the dollar has supported gold prices by making the dollar-denominated metal cheaper for holders of other currencies.
The dollar fell to its lowest levels in more than three months against a basket of the other major currencies on Friday and posted its largest annual percentage decline since 2003.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell as low as 91.83, the weakest level since September 22. For the year, the index was down 9.8%.
The index started 2017 at a 14-year high, boosted by hopes for U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-growth economic agenda. But barring a sweeping tax overhaul enacted last week, the Trump administration has struggled to pass legislation.
The dollar also lagged despite the Federal Reserve’s rate increases amid increased investor expectations for other central banks to reduce their stimulus.
Geopolitical risks also remain a focus for gold buyers, as gold is a haven asset that many investors favor when they think markets might turn rocky.
Elsewhere in precious metals trading, silver was at $16.98 a troy ounce late Friday, to end the year with a gain of 6.0%.
Palladium posted the strongest increase among precious metals in 2017, advancing 57% amid concerns over the supply outlook.
Palladium eased 0.78% to settle at $1,055.15 an ounce late Friday after rising to a high of $1,064.20, a level not seen since February 2001 in the previous session
Among base metals, copper ended Friday down 0.41% at $3.295 a pound but added 31% for the year.
Prices of the industrial metal were boosted by robust demand from China, the world’s largest base metals consumer, as well as a favorable global economic outlook and supply disruptions around the world.
In the week ahead, gold prices will remain vulnerable to any rebound in the greenback as well as in increase in yields. The opportunity cost of holding non-interest bearing bullion increases when yields rise elsewhere.
Investors will get back to work when markets reopen on Tuesday after the Christmas and New Year’s holidays, with all eyes on the monthly U.S. employment report due Friday.
Market watchers will also focus on Wednesday’s minutes of the Fed’s December policy meeting for further hints on the future path of monetary policy.

752,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2017 08:00AM ET</span>","Israeli pipeline, once a link to Iran, will remain a mystery","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An oil pipeline company established decades ago by Israel and Iran, and a new Israeli company that is meant to replace it, can continue to operate secretly, an Israeli parliamentary committee ruled on Sunday.
The Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Co (EAPC) was a joint venture set up in 1968, when the two nations were friendly, to transport Iranian oil via Israel to the Mediterranean. Ties were cut after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, and the enemies are now locked in arbitration that could be worth billions of dollars.
Although Iranian oil no longer flows through the pipeline, EAPC has become a major distributor of oil in Israel, with ambitions to become a leading trade hub.
It also added a reverse-flow system so oil from the Black or Caspian Seas can be shipped from Eilat, Israel's southernmost city and port, to southern Asia and the Far East, and increased its storage capacity for traders in the region.
Israel, worried about national security, maintains tight control over EAPC, to the extent that articles about its business dealings must pass through the military censor.
Instead of renewing EAPC's concession, which came up this year, Israel formed a new company with the same initials, the Europe Asia Pipeline Co, owned by the government. It will take over the original EAPC's responsibilities by September, with an option to extend the handover period an additional six months.
Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee said in a statement on Sunday that it had extended the gag order on EAPC for five more years and broadened it to include the new company, known as EAPC-B, as well.
Calls to end the secrecy surrounding EAPC emerged after its pipe burst in 2014, spilling millions of liters of oil into a desert nature reserve in Israel’s worst spill.

After an Israeli environmental group petitioned the Supreme Court, the gag order was narrowed slightly to exclude issues like environmental impact and safety measures. The company's primary dealings, including the sources of oil and how it is used, are still under censorship.

753,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 06:21PM ET</span>",Gold soars toward largest annual gain since 2010 on dollar boost,"By Chris Prentice and Jan Harvey
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Gold extended its rally to a three-month high on Friday, leaping toward its biggest one-year rise in seven years as a wilting U.S. dollar, political tensions and receding concerns over the impact of U.S. interest rate hikes fed into its rally.
Gold's gains coincide with the greenback, in which gold is priced, sliding toward its worst year since 2003, damaged by tensions over North Korea, the Russian scandal surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump's election campaign, and persistently low U.S. inflation.
The dollar index (DXY) touched three-month lows on Friday, lifting bullion to its highest level since late September at $1,307.60 an ounce before paring gains. 
Strong charts, the weaker dollar and expectations of bullish fundamental factors ahead have bolstered gold prices in year-end trade, said David Meger, director of metals trading for High Ridge Futures in Chicago.
Spot gold prices  were up 0.67 percent at $1,303.37 per ounce by 2:05 p.m. EST (1905 GMT), poised to finish 2017 up 13 percent. Benchmark U.S. gold futures  settled up $12.1, or 0.93 percent, at $1,309.30 per ounce, finishing the year 12 percent higher.
""Going back to the last Fed meeting with its slightly more dovish tone, commodities markets have gotten a bit of a green light,"" Meger said, referring to indications this month that the U.S. central bank will keep its rate outlook unchanged in the coming year. 
""This recent bout of weakness in the dollar certainly is fostering a commodities rally and we’ve seen a light downturn in equities as well.""
The metal will be vulnerable next year to a rebound in the currency, as well as any gains in yields, ABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele said. The opportunity cost of holding non-interest bearing bullion increases when yields rise elsewhere.
Gold's chart signals look positive after it broke above its 100-day moving average this week at $1,295 an ounce, ScotiaMocatta's technical team said in a note, pointing to a target of October's high at $1,306.
Among precious metals, palladium posted the strongest rise this year, climbing 57 percent as concerns grew over availability after years of deficit.
Palladium  eased 0.31 percent to $1,062.05 an ounce, having hit its highest level since February 2001 at $1,072 in the previous session. It has held in a historically unusual premium to platinum this quarter.

Silver  was up 0.51 percent at $16.926, paring gains from a one-month high of $17.111. Platinum  was up 0.11 percent at $924 after touching a four-week high of $936.20. This year, the two metals have risen by 6 percent and 3 percent, respectively.

754,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 04:36PM ET</span>",U.S. crude ends year above $60 on strong global oil demand,"By Nia Williams
CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices closed above $60 a barrel on the final trading day of the year, the first time since mid-2015, as the commodity ended 2017 with a 12 percent gain spurred by strong demand and declining global inventories.
International benchmark Brent crude futures ended the year with a 17 percent rise, supported by ongoing supply cuts by top producers OPEC and Russia as well as strong demand from China. The spread between the benchmarks widened throughout the year, as Brent responded to the drawdown in supply from major world producers while U.S. output continued to grow.
The gains indicate that the global glut that has dogged the market since 2014 is shrinking.
Earlier this year, oil prices slumped on concerns that rising crude production from Nigeria, Libya and elsewhere would undermine output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia. But prices have rallied nearly 50 percent since the middle of the year on robust demand and strong compliance with the production limits.
""That trend is likely to continue into 2018 and worldwide oil inventories will continue their decline,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.
Lipow said he expected U.S. crude prices to creep up to around $63 a barrel by the end of next year, while Brent would remain around $67 a barrel as U.S. oil exports rise to record levels.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled at $60.42, the highest close since June 2015. Brent crude futures were last up 45 cents at $66.62 a barrel at 1932 GMT. Brent broke through $67 this week for the first time since May 2015.
WTI prices were supported by data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration late on Thursday showing domestic oil production declined last week to 9.75 million barrels per day (bpd) from 9.79 million bpd the previous week.
Monthly EIA data released on Friday showed U.S. crude production hit a 46-year high in October, but the country's oil exports and demand also rose.
U.S. output is up almost 16 percent since mid-2016. Analysts expect production to top 10 million bpd in the next few weeks and to keep growing, limiting efforts by other producers to cap global supplies.
""The U.S. shale impact is now encroaching on uncharted territory,"" analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote this month, saying it had ""redrawn the global crude flow map."" 
WTI prices were further boosted by an EIA report of a 4.6 million barrel weekly drop in U.S. commercial crude storage levels. Inventories are down by almost 20 percent from historic highs last March, and well below this time last year or in 2015.
Extreme cold weather across much of North America could also boost U.S. crude prices by causing production problems in the oilfields.
PIPELINE OUTAGES
In international markets, China has issued crude oil import quotas totalling 121.32 million tonnes for 44 companies in its first batch of allowances for 2018.
China's imports at around 8.5 million bpd, already the world's biggest, are expected to hit another record in 2018 as new refining capacity is brought online and Beijing allows more independent refiners to import crude.
Pipeline outages in Libya and the North Sea have supported oil prices, although both disruptions are expected to be resolved by early January. 

Libya is to start repairing the pipeline near the Es Sider terminal this weekend, a Libyan oil official said, while the Forties pipeline was already pumping close to normal levels, according to trading sources.

755,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 04:31PM ET</span>","As Oil Rises, Shale Drillers With Few or No Hedges Stand to Gain","(Bloomberg) -- As the price of oil rises, heavily-hedged shale drillers may find it harder to meet investor demands for payback, boosting the value of producers that haven’t locked in returns for future production.
When West Texas Intermediate breached $60 a barrel, it was good news generally for U.S. shale producers. But the higher the price, the less gain will come to companies that hedged their production as crude held below $55 for 10 months of the year.
At least 60 percent of next year’s crude output has been hedged, more than in previous years, according to RBC Capital Markets LLC. The result: Rising crude prices will boost the profile of companies with fewer hedges, according to a report by Cowen & Co. Among the winners: EOG Resources Inc (NYSE:EOG)., Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC)., and Continental Resources Inc., the note said.
“If crude were to move higher, we would expect to see more E&Ps lag as collar ceilings are reached,” Cowen analysts led by Charles Robertson wrote.
U.S. shale producers often choose to hedge a portion of their production due to their capital constraints and short life cycles of their wells. With WTI up 34 percent in the last six months, many have increased their hedging to protect their cash flows against a downturn. Hedged volumes more than doubled in the third quarter, according to a study by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
“It’s a directional bet on the future of the market,"" said Peter Pulikkan, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who co-authored the report released on Dec. 13. “Some of them believe, based on the fundamentals, that oil is still going to go higher.""
Representatives for EOG and Anadarko declined to comment. Kristin Thomas, a spokeswoman for Continental, did not immediately return phone and email messages seeking comment. But executives at the companies have taken a bullish tone in recent months.
“We think U.S. production hasn’t been growing quite as prolifically as what others have originally estimated,"" Lance Terveen, a senior vice-president at Houston-based EOG, told analysts on an earnings call last month when asked about hedging. “We’ve been disciplined since 2015, and we’ve been waiting for this turn. So we’re going to continue to watch here going into 2018.""
More to Run
Continental sees “a little bit more to run here for sure,"" Harold Hamm, the explorer’s billionaire chief executive officer, said on a Nov. 8 call. “We’ll keep a close eye on it and the opportunity, when it comes, well, we’re going to be there to take advantage of it.""
If prices rise, drillers that might lag the peer group include Concho Resources Inc., Lonestar Resources U.S. Inc., Oasis Petroleum Inc. and  QEP Resources  Inc (NYSE:QEP)., the Cowen report said. Requests for comment from these companies weren’t immediately returned.

756,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 04:30PM ET</span>",Gold Bulls Hang Tough for Best Year Since `10 Amid Fed Rate Push,"(Bloomberg) -- Gold bulls weathered rising U.S. interest rates, record-high equity markets and an improving global economy to push the metal to its best year since 2010.
Bullion futures on the Comex in New York jumped 13 percent in 2017 for a second straight annual gain. Other measures of the metal also defied the interest-rate odds: Holdings in exchange-traded funds backed by bullion advanced for a second year, as did the net-long position in the metal held by hedge funds and other large speculators. 
Gold benefited as declines in the dollar fueled demand for alternative assets, while geopolitical tensions and uncertainty over the impact of a new U.S. tax plan boosted the appeal of havens. That helped cushion the blow from a surge in equities and the Fed’s campaign to tighten monetary policy, which can make non-interest-bearing assets such as gold less competitive. 
The longest run of gains in 18 months sent gold past the 100-day moving average this week, which for some chart watchers positions it for further gains heading into 2018.
“Next year, it might not get the benefit of a dollar as weak as it was in 2017, but I think it will do well despite that,” Marty McGuire, managing director of market strategy at TJM Investments LLC, said by telephone.
Gold rose 0.9 percent to $1,309.30 an ounce on Friday, closing out the year with a seventh straight daily gain that was the longest rally since June 2016."

LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Industrial metals, liquefied natural gas and steel finished 2017 in stunning fashion as a crackdown on pollution in China, the world's no. 2 economy, boosts demand for cleaner fossil fuels and raw materials vital to clean-tech industries.
The world's most traded commodity, oil, rallied to finish the year at levels not seen in more than two years on increased demand and efforts by major producers to cut supply. 
For 2018, analysts predict more of the same: accelerating growth in major economies and increased infrastructure spending driving prices for industrial commodities and energy sources above current multi-year highs.
""I think we have seen the end of low commodity prices as funds are expected to focus on commodities in 2018, with strong economic growth,"" said Terry Reilly, senior commodities analyst with Chicago-based Futures International.
Metals used in the booming renewable energy sector, including copper for transmission lines and solar panel wiring, have seen strong demand and price rises, as have materials like aluminum used in electric vehicles.
This year's best performing metal, palladium, is chiefly used as a component in catalytic converters, which clean vehicle exhaust fumes. Buoyant car sales in China and Europe, plus tightening emissions standards, have stoked fears over metal availability after years of market deficit. 
Palladium has gained 57 percent this year, hitting its highest since early 2001 on Thursday at $1,072 an ounce and outstripping a buoyant year in fellow precious metal gold, up 13 percent in its biggest annual rise since 2010.
""$1,000/oz is the new support and while it stays above this level, technically speaking the forecast is still bullish,"" Italpreziosi's head of finance Filippo Finocchi told the Reuters Global Gold Forum this month. 
""Growing gasoline and hybrid vehicle worldwide sales, which represent around 75 percent of palladium demand, should again boost prices.""
Copper and aluminum have risen by almost a third this year to four-year highs in the last trading week of 2017 of $7,312.50 and $2,284.75 a tonne, respectively.
Pan Pacific Copper, Japan's biggest copper smelter, expects copper prices to rise by more than a quarter over the next two years as global demand continues to grow and outpaces supply.
Shanghai rebar futures climbed 46 percent this year, driven by the closure of low-quality Chinese steelmaking plants and production curbs to fight pollution. High construction activity also supported steel.
CHINA DRIVES GAS, OPEC CUTS OIL
Brent crude oil broke through $67 per barrel for the first time since mid-2015 in the last week of 2017, ending up 17 percent for the year amid record trading volumes.
Oil has benefited from efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to withhold production in order to prop up prices.
U.S. West Texas crude futures gained more than 12 percent on the year, closing above $60 a barrel on the final day of trading for the first time since mid-2015.
Preventing further price rises has been U.S. oil production, which has soared more than 16 percent since mid-2016 thanks to a rebound in major shale patches in Texas, and is approaching 10 million barrels per day. Only OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and Russia produce more. [O/R]
""The U.S. shale impact is now encroaching on uncharted territory,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Tran earlier this month, saying that U.S. production has ""redrawn the global crude flow map."" 
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) went from loser to winner, in part due to seasonal factors.
Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas have doubled since June, to the highest level since late 2014 of more than $11 per million British thermal units.
Until the last quarter of the year, LNG had been one of 2017's worst-performing commodities.
The late rally has been driven by a huge gasification program in China which this year alone moved millions of households and industry from coal to gas for heating, just as a winter bites.
China's gasification is aimed at reducing coal use to help address pollution that has plagued cities for years.
""We have seen some serious crackdown on pollution in China, that will boost demand for metals and gas,"" Reilly said.
China is making huge investments into renewable power generation.
World solar power capacity has ballooned to around 300 gigawatts (GW) from just 1 GW in 2000, according to International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) data, a number set to double by 2020.
Growth is largely driven by China, approaching 100 GW of capacity. Irena says China can add 50 GW a year of capacity.
Still, coal prices did relatively well in 2017.
Australian coal prices rose 10 percent to over $100 a tonne, as China ordered the closure of several domestic mines, forcing utilities to import more.
RECORD CROP YIELDS, LOW PRICES
Most agricultural products will finish 2017 with lower prices, squeezed by record output.
Raw sugar lost 22 percent, with the International Sugar Organization forecasting a global sugar surplus of 5 million tonnes in 2017/18 compared with a deficit of 3.1 million in 2016/17.
London cocoa ended down 20 percent, a second successive slump after a 23 percent fall in 2016, with prices depressed following a record global surplus in the 2016/17 season.
World corn production has hit a record high for eight of the past 10 years. Soybean production has climbed to all-time highs in four of the last five years, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This led to a 5 percent decline in prices.
Wheat is on track for a modest 5 percent gain in 2017, after losing ground for four years, as world supplies of high-protein wheat tighten due to crop losses in the United States and Australia, in part related to La Niña weather occurrence.
Malaysian palm oil dropped 10 percent in 2017 with production in Southeast Asia outpacing demand from top importers China and Europe.

Tokyo rubber has fallen 18 percent in 2017 after being one of the best performing commodities in 2016.

Also supporting oil prices were ongoing pipeline outages in Libya and the North Sea.
The North Sea the Forties pipeline system with a 450,000 bpd capacity was shut earlier this month due to a crack, while, a pipeline bombing in Libya took an estimated 90,000 barrels per day (bpd) off-line.

The Bloomberg Commodity Index, which measures returns on 22 raw materials, closed up 11 days in a row -- a repeat on Friday would result in the longest run in records dating back to 1991. While the index has been lifted this month by gains in crude oil, copper and gold, it still remains well below 2008 highs.
Big Oil
West Texas Intermediate rose above $60 a barrel to its highest level in more than two years on Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, buoyed by falling U.S. inventories and a recent pipeline explosion in Libya. That coincides with rising global demand and reduced output from the Organization of Petroleum exporting countries and allies including Russia.
“The key driver for the oil market this year has been that the OPEC and Russian production cuts were introduced, complied with and extended,” said Ric Spooner, a Sydney-based analyst at CMC Markets. 
Copper Flying
Copper had its best run in almost 30 years this month on the London Metal Exchange. The metal, used in everything from electrics to plumbing, jumped to the highest since 2014 as concerns grew about supply disruptions in China, demand remained strong and a weakening U.S. dollar buoyed commodities.

763,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 07:40AM ET</span>",Beijing may be starting to win its battle against smog,"By Muyu Xu and Elias Glenn
BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing may have turned a corner in its battle against the city's notorious smog, according to Reuters calculations, and environmental consultants say the Chinese government deserves much of the credit for introducing tough anti-pollution measures.
The Chinese capital is set to record its biggest improvement in air quality in at least nine years, with a nearly 20 percent change for the better this year, based on average concentration levels of hazardous breathable particles known as PM2.5.
The dramatic change, which has occurred across North China, is partly because of favorable weather conditions in the past three months but it also shows that the government's strong-arm tactics have had an impact. 
The Reuters' estimates show that average levels of the pollutants in the capital have fallen by about 35 percent from 2012 numbers, with nearly half the improvement this year.
""The improvement in air quality is due both to long-term efforts by the government and short-term efforts this winter,"" said Anders Hove, a Beijing-based energy consultant. ""After 2013, the air in summers got much cleaner, but winter had not shown much improvement. This year is the first winter improvement we've seen during this war on pollution.""
Government officials this week signaled they were confident they were starting to get on top of the problem. 
""The autumn and winter period is the most challenging part of the air pollution campaign. However, with the intensive efforts all departments have made, we believe the challenge is being successfully overcome,"" Liu Youbin, spokesman for the Ministry of Environmental Protection, told reporters on Thursday. 
    
STILL A LONG WAY TO GO
But environmental experts say that while they are optimistic, it may be too early to celebrate.
""The turning point is here but we cannot rule out the possibility we can turn back,"" said Ranping Song, developing country climate action manager for the World Resources Institute.  ""We need to be cautious about challenges and not relax now that there have been improvements. There are lots of issues to be solved.""
And while China has scored an initial victory over smog, it still has to reverse public opinion outside China on its air quality. 
New York-based travel guidebook publisher Fodor's advised tourists in mid-November in its 'No List"" for 2018 to shun Beijing until the city's anti-pollution campaign had reduced the ""overwhelming smog"". Fodor's did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In Beijing there is certainly plenty of room for further progress as average air quality is still significantly worse than the World Health Organization's recommendations.
And the region still sees bouts of heavy smog. On Friday afternoon the U.S. embassy's website said Beijing's air was ""very unhealthy"" and the city issued a pollution alert on Thursday. 
EMBASSY MONITORING 
The Reuters calculations showing the improvement were based on average hourly readings of PM2.5 concentrations at the United States Embassy in Beijing from April 8, 2008 to Dec. 28, 2017. The data was compiled from figures from the U.S. embassy's air monitoring website, as well as data provided by AirVisual, a Beijing company that analyses air quality data. 
The data from the embassy, though not fully verified or validated, is the only set available for PM2.5 levels in the capital over that time period. AirVisual provided the hour-by-hour air pollution data from the embassy for recent months.
PM2.5 levels are the most closely monitored because they account for the majority of air pollutants in China and can be harmful to the body when breathed.

Beijing's air was actually worse in the first nine months of this year than in the same period last year, but PM2.5 concentrations from October to Dec. 28 this year were nearly 60 percent lower than last year, the Reuters figures show. 
Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Huang Wei said that less than half of the improvement is due to favorable weather - particularly stronger northerly winds and low humidity – with the government's policies behind most of the change.
The Chinese government launched a winter smog ""battleplan"" in October for 28 northern cities that called for strict rules on emissions during the winter heating months when pollution typically worsens. 
The authorities also sought to make sure that Beijing wasn't too polluted during October's Communist Party congress, which is only held once every five years, at which Xi Jinping consolidated his power as the nation's leader. Some of the more-polluting businesses in and around the capital were told to shut down for a period before and during the gathering.
The plan for the winter months included switching millions of households and some industrial users to natural gas from coal for their heating and some other needs. There were also mandated cuts in steel production by up to 50 percent in some of the areas surrounding the city.
CONTRAST WITH INDIA
Beijing's improving air quality stands in stark contrast to India's capital New Delhi, where pollution has steadily become worse over the past few years, and is now well above Beijing's.
China's improvement, and deterioration in some other countries, means China is now not among the ten worst countries for pollution in the world anymore, according to at least one measure.
""At the national level, India tops the index rankings, followed by Bangladesh and Thailand,"" said Richard Hewston, global head of environment and climate change at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, which measures 198 countries for air quality.
(For a graphic on Beijing average annual PM2.5 concentration, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2BRDCAL)
Beijing's clean-air campaign hasn't been without its challenges. 
The government this year botched the switch from coal to natural gas, leading to recent widespread shortages of gas, soaring liquefied natural gas prices, leaving some residents freezing in their homes and some factories shuttered.
There is also a wider economic cost. Growth in industrial output, especially in northern China, has slowed because of the pollution crackdown, economists say, and the prices of some key commodities, from LNG to copper, have risen.
Some of those who had been benefiting from the poor air quality by selling air filtration products have been taking a hit.
""Overall demand in China is down... Some companies have 100 million yuan ($15.35 million) in unsold inventory this year as a result of the improved air quality,"" said Liam Bates, CEO of Beijing-based Kaiterra, which makes air filters and air quality monitoring products. 

""We haven't seen huge impact because we're expanding heavily overseas. While the air in China is getting better, the air in India is much, much worse and we just opened our India office,"" he said.

764,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 29, 2017 05:00AM ET</span>",Gold's Bulls and Bears Have Plenty to Chew Over in New Year,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s not just politics that’s polarized right now. Gold investors are also split down the middle. 
A Bloomberg survey of 38 market professionals shows a $700 divide between the most optimistic and most pessimistic forecasts for prices next year. That leaves the median estimate of $1,290 an ounce at the end of 2018 little changed from current levels.
Here’s what could go right or wrong for the bulls and bears:
Stock Prices
As major stock indexes in the U.S., Europe and Asia are already at or close to record annual closes, and valuations stretched by historical standards, some expect a correction. That would benefit gold, according to Carsten Fritsch and his colleagues at  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG). However, a continued rally, helped by interest rates that remain low relative to past decades, could sap demand for havens such as gold.
U.S. Elections
With investigations into alleged Russian interference in U.S. elections potentially coming to a head in coming months, mid-term voting in November will add to uncertainty over the outlook for Donald Trump’s administration, according to Adrian Day, president of Adrian Day Asset Management. Yet Trump has managed to weather previous storms thanks to support from his base and Republican lawmakers.
Bitcoin Bonanza
If 2017’s hottest asset comes crashing back to Earth, speculative money may be drawn back into gold, according to Walter Otstott, a senior broker at Dallas Commodity Co. in the Texas city. He sees gold peaking at $1,600 an ounce next year, compared with the price on Friday of about $1,297. With bitcoin trading up about 1,400 percent this year, tech libertarians and apocalypse survivalists who may have previously bought gold have been lured away by virtual currencies. If bitcoin resumes gains in January, gold could suffer.
North Korea
And talking of the apocalypse, Kim Jong-Un’s nuclear ambitions could yet see a revival for haven investments. Bullion dealer GoldCore Ltd.’s Mark O’Byrne predicts gold could end the year at $1,500 if geopolitics heats up in North Korea or the Middle East. On the other hand, Pyongyang’s missile tests this year have had little effect on the market as investors become inured to the regime’s war of words with President Trump.
Real Rates
Inflation and rates, for many analysts, are the biggest factors influencing the gold price. The opportunity cost of holding the metal should increase when rates are high, while its inflation-busting qualities are attractive when policy is loose and the cost of goods is rising. Yet with the U.S. in a tightening cycle and Europe expected to follow, higher rates haven’t led to gold price declines, even with inflation moderate by historic standards.
Indian Demand
The World Gold Council has said Indian demand in 2017 is more likely to be at the lower end of its 650 to 750 metric ton forecast, close to the seven-year low recorded in the previous year. Traders like Ajay Kumar Kedia of Kedia Commodity in Mumbai are betting consumers in India and China will return to buy more gold in 2018. Then again, they might not.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.28% to 92.08, levels not seen since the end of September.
Despite Trump finally signing off on the long-anticipated tax reform in what was the first major legislative achievement of his presidency and the gradual path of monetary policy tightening from the Federal Reserve throughout 2017, the dollar index heads towards the end of the year with annual losses of 10%.
Gold has also benefitted in 2017 from investors piling into the safe-haven asset in the face of continuous geopolitical tension. North Korea has been at the forefront of those worries as the U.S., China, North Korea and Japan all work to curb Pyonyang’s nuclear program.

766,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 01:50PM ET</span>",Higher oil prices needed to sharply boost U.S. drilling: Dallas Fed,"By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil prices will need to rise further for energy companies to significantly expand drilling activities, according to a survey released on Thursday by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. 
U.S. energy companies have added rigs and boosted production to near record levels, as oil prices have more than doubled from a low of about $26 per barrel touched in early 2016.
But prices above $60 a barrel are needed to see a significant uptick in activity, according to the survey, which questioned 134 firms headquartered in Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Louisiana.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was trading at about $59.50 on Thursday, down slightly from a 2-1/2-year high of $60.01 earlier this week.
The jump in prices, coupled with technological improvements that make drilling cheaper, has pushed the U.S. rig count to 931, up about 43 percent from last year, according to data from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's oil services arm Baker Hughes.
Slightly more than half the survey's respondents expect the rig count to continue to climb six months from now but nearly all said oil prices need to be above $60 a barrel for a substantial increase.
Of the firms surveyed, nearly 48 percent reported an increase in spending from the previous quarter and roughly 64 percent reported an increase from a year ago. About 8 percent reported a decrease over the previous quarter, and nearly 10 percent reported a decrease from a year ago. 
Services firm Keane Group in December said it had placed orders for three additional hydraulic fracturing fleets, a signal that it expects demand for production-related services to grow. 
U.S. oil and gas production has climbed for five consecutive quarters, the survey found, as a deal among major global producers to cut output has helped lift prices.
Total domestic production is at 9.75 million barrels per day (bpd), according to the latest figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and is expected to climb to more than 10 million bpd next year. 
Of the service firms surveyed, 52 percent said they are receiving higher prices for services from a year ago, while 40 percent reported no change. 

The survey's respondents included 77 companies focused on exploration and production activities and 57 that operate in the oilfield service sector.

767,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 12:13PM ET</span>",Hundreds protest against high prices in Iran,"By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin
LONDON (Reuters) - Hundreds took to the streets of Iran's second largest city of Mashad on Thursday to protest over high prices, shouting slogans against the government.
Videos posted on social media showed demonstrators in Mashad in northwest Iran, one of the holiest places in Shia Islam, chanting ""death to (President Hassan) Rouhani"" and ""death to the dictator"".
The semi-official ILNA news agency and social media reported demonstrations in other cities in Razavi Khorasan Province, including Neyshabour and Kashmar. 
Rouhani’s signature achievement, a deal in 2015 with world powers to curb Iran’s nuclear program in return for lifting most international sanctions, has yet to bring the broad economic benefits the government says are coming. 
Many Iranians believe their economic situation has not improved due to corruption and mismanagement.
Unemployment stood at 12.4 percent in this fiscal year, according to the Statistical Centre of Iran, up 1.4 percent from the previous year. About 3.2 million Iranians are jobless, out of a total population of 80 million.
Mashad governor Mohammad Rahim Norouzian was quoted by the semi-official ISNA news agency as saying that ""the demonstration was illegal but the police dealt with people with tolerance"".
He said a number of protesters were arrested for ""trying to damage public property"".
Videos posted on social media showed riot police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse crowds.
Norouzian was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA that the protests were organized by ""enemies of the Islamic Republic"" and ""counter-revolutionaries"".
Demonstrators also chanted ""leave Syria, think about us”, criticizing Iran's deployment of troops to support President Bashar al-Assad against the uprising that broke out in 2011. 
Tehran has also provided funds to prop up Syria's struggling economy.
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has repeatedly criticized the government's economic record, said on Wednesday that the nation was struggling with “high prices, inflation and recession”, and asked officials to resolve the problems with determination.

768,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 28, 2017 11:16AM ET</span>",Commodities - WTI Oil Futures Waver After Crude Inventories,"Investing.com – West Texas Intermediate oil underwent extreme volatility in North American trade on Thursday, after data that showed that oil supplies in the U.S. registered a larger-than-expected inventory draw.
After initially extending losses slightly, crude then turned positive within the first couple minutes of trade, only to once again turn lower.
Crude oil for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange slipped $0.08, or 0.15%, to trade at $59.56 a barrel by 11:08AM ET (16:08GMT) compared to $59.55 ahead of the report.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 4.609 million barrels in the week ended December 22. Market analysts' had expected a crude-stock draw of 3.970 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Wednesday reported a supply draw of 6.0 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 1.584 million barrels last week, the EIA said. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 431.9 million barrels as of last week, according to press release, which the EIA considered to be “in the middle of the average range for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 0.591 million barrels, compared to expectations for a build of 1.278 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles rose by 1.090 million barrels, compared to forecasts for a draw of 0.584 million.
The report came out one day later than usual due to the Christmas holiday.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for March delivery fell $0.08, or 0.12%, to $65.91 by 11:12AM ET (16:12GMT), compared to $65.92 before the release.
Meanwhile, Brent's premium to the WTI crude contract stood at $6.34 a barrel by 11:13AM ET (16:13GMT), compared to a gap of $6.35 by close of trade on Wednesday.
Oil prices have rallied more than 10% this year thanks to the agreement between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other non-OPEC producers led by Russia to curb output by about 1.8 million barrels per day until the end of 2018 in a bid to rebalance the global market.
However, as market participants turn their attention to 2018, there are concerns that increasing U.S. shale production may offset OPEC attempts to cut down on the global supply glut.
The balance of these two opposite forces may be why a Reuters’ monthly poll showed on Thursday that analysts expect Brent crude to stay close to $60 in 2018.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for February delivery edged down less than a cent to $1.7867 a gallon by 11:13AM ET (16:13GMT), while February heating oil rose 1 cent to $2.8404 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for February delivery gained 20.5 cents to $2.937 per million British thermal units."

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices stood near their highest in two and a half years, supported by strong data from top importer China amid thin trading activity ahead of the New Year weekend.
Heading into 2018, traders said market conditions were relatively tight because of supply cuts led by the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were up 2 cents at $59.66 a barrel by 1328 GMT. 
WTI this week broke through $60 a barrel for the first time since June 2015 and was supported by a report from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showing a 6 million barrel drop in crude oil inventories to 432.8 million barrels.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were flat at $66.44 a barrel, having breached $67 this week for the first time since May 2015.
Support also came from China's release of strong import quotas for 2018, which could lead to another record for purchases by the world's biggest importer.
China's oil thirst has also led to a 3 percent monthly drawdown in its crude inventories in November, to a seven-year low of 26.15 million tonnes, Xinhua data showed on Thursday.
Oil markets have also been tightened by a year of OPEC and Russia-led production cuts that started last January and are scheduled to continue throughout 2018.
A Reuters monthly poll showed on Thursday that analysts expect Brent crude to stay close to $60 in 2018. [O/POLL]
Pipeline outages in Libya and the North Sea have also supported prices.
""Given the much stronger price response to supply disruptions in the wake of OPEC supply cuts, the market is poised to make further gains,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda.
Libyan oil supplies were disrupted by an attack on a pipeline this week and flows towards the port of Es Sider were reduced by about 70,000 bpd on Thursday.
In the North Sea, the 450,000 bpd capacity Forties pipeline system was shut this month after a crack was found.
Both pipelines are expected to return to normal operations over the new year or in early January. Forties removed a restriction on shipping on Thursday but force majeure remains in place for supplies.
Countering efforts by OPEC and Russia to prop up prices is U.S. oil production  that has soared more than 16 percent since mid-2016 and is fast approaching 10 million bpd.
Only OPEC king-pin Saudi Arabia and Russia produce more.
The latest official U.S. production figures are due to be published on Thursday.

Putin was speaking on Thursday at an awards ceremony in the Kremlin for Russian personnel who served in Syria.
""You know that yesterday in St Petersburg a terrorist act was carried out,"" Putin told the audience, referring to the explosion that injured 13 shoppers in a branch of the Perekrestok supermarket chain.
Investigators have opened a criminal case into Wednesday evening's blast, which they said was caused by a homemade bomb packed with pieces of metal.
Russian media reports said the bomb was hidden in a locker where shoppers leave their belongings.
Putin said the FSB security service had recently prevented ""another attempted terrorist act.""
He gave no details, but the Kremlin said earlier this month that a U.S. tip-off had helped thwart a planned attack on St. Petersburg's Kazansky Cathedral.
Putin also told the ceremony that the security situation in Russia would be much worse if thousands of Russian citizens who fought with Islamic State in Syria had been allowed to return home.
Putin said security forces should take no chances with their own lives if confronted by terrorist suspects.

""I yesterday ordered the FSB director to act within the framework of the law when detaining these bandits of course, but if there is a threat to the life and well-being of our employees ...to act decisively, not take any prisoners, and liquidate the bandits on the spot.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Financial oil trading is booming, hitting records this year, with volumes in U.S. contracts outpacing growth elsewhere on the back of the U.S. shale oil boom.

This is more than double the 71 million trades for spot Brent futures, the international benchmark, further widening a gap that has yawned open as U.S. crude output has surged nearly 70 percent over the past five years.
The trend is also showing in market open interest, the number of daily open contracts across all months, where WTI started edging ahead of Brent in September.
Oil producers use derivative markets to lock in profits while buyers aim to protect themselves against rising prices, with liquidity further boosted by a raft of sophisticated trading strategies and speculation by investors.
""U.S. shale oil epitomizes the modern way of dealing with things,"" said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker with brokerage Freight Investor Services (FIS) in Dubai.  (Graphic: http://reut.rs/2BJPSTL)
""Producers in the USA have a plethora of modern tools available, allowing them to hedge forward production (and) make use of traditional (oil) reserve base lending arrangements, of which many ... will have caveats in them that forward production is to be hedged prior to release of funds for investment.""
U.S. crude output is fast approaching 10 million barrels per day, with only top exporter Saudi Arabia and top producer Russia churning out more.
As new producers trade U.S. crude futures and more hedge funds offer their services to producers, WTI volumes have run away, leaving Brent behind.
Outside the United States, Middle East producers - which mostly price their crude off Brent - barely hedge output.
Enjoying low production costs, their largely government-owned oil firms sell most of their crude in long-term supply deals under fixed Official Selling Prices (OSP). 
Asia's big buyers from China to Japan - the biggest customers for Middle East oil - also use futures markets very little, resulting in far lower derivative market activity during Asian trading hours.
But things might change. In Iraq, OPEC's second biggest producer, state-owned oil company SOMO may start hedging some of its output as a way to protect government revenue against the risk of falling oil prices.

""All eyes will be on the first Middle East producers to really start hedging their production next year,"" FIS's Stanley said. ""Then the market share battle is well and truly on.""

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Wednesday, as a rally ran out of momentum a session after crude hit a near 2-1/2-year high on supply outages in Libya and the North Sea.
Brent crude futures settled at $66.44 a barrel, down 0.9 percent, or 58 cents. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled at $59.64 a barrel, down 33 cents, or 0.6 percent.
The previous day, Brent broke through $67 for the first time since June 2015 and WTI rose above $60 a barrel for the first time since May 2015.
""The market continues to gravitate towards bullish news but today we are seeing a little bit of profit-taking,"" said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
Prices briefly pared losses in post-settlement trade after industry group American Petroleum Institute said U.S. crude stocks fell more than expected last week. [API/S]
On Tuesday, Libya lost around 90,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil supplies after a pipeline feeding Es Sider port was blown up. Repairs could take a week but will not have a major impact on exports, the head of Libyan state oil firm NOC told Reuters on Wednesday.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Helima Croft said in a note to clients that political unrest ahead of national elections could further dent Libyan production in the coming months.
Other supply disruptions of recent weeks included closure of Britain's largest Forties pipeline. On Wednesday, Forties was pumping at half its normal capacity. Its operator was pledging to resume full flows in early January.
The Forties and Libyan outages together amount to around 500,000 bpd, relatively small in a global market of about 100 million bpd.
""While supply impact is immaterial, it shows that with the market structurally undersupplied and inventories continuing to draw, geopolitical risk has now re-emerged as an important factor in day-to-day trading dynamics,"" analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt Energy Research said in a note. 
Oil markets have tightened due to supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC Russia. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows global oil markets gradually came into balance by 2016 and started to show a slight supply deficit this year. 
The data implied a shortfall of 180,000 bpd for the first quarter of 2018.
Limiting OPEC and Russian efforts to prop up prices, U.S. oil production has soared more than 16 percent since mid-2016 and is approaching 10 million bpd.

The EIA is due to publish the latest U.S. production figures on Thursday.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for January delivery fell 33 cents to settle at $59.64 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent lost 54 cents to trade at $65.90 a barrel.
Reports reported Wednesday, citing comments from the head of Libyan state oil firm NOC, that repair of the Libyan pipeline that feeds the Es Sider sea terminal could take about one week but will not have a major impact on exports.
That dampened expectations for a prolonged outage in Libya, where a pipeline bombing took an estimated 90,000 barrels per day (bpd) off-line.
The Mediterranean port of Es Sider is the largest oil depot in Libya with a capacity of more than 400,000 bpd. 
Crude oil prices topped at $60.01 on Tuesday, levels last seen in June of 2015, as the Libyan outage added to recent supply disruptions which include the ongoing Forties North Sea pipeline shutdown.
The Forties pipeline, which carries 40% of North Sea oil and gas, has been on an outage since Dec. 11. 
In the U.S. meanwhile, traders turned attention to the American Petroleum Institute weekly inventory report expected Wednesday after US markets close, while the US Energy Information Administration issues its supply totals Thursday at 10:30 a.m. ET. 
US oil production and exports are expected to be closely monitored after rising close to record highs last week at 9.79 million bpd, and 1.86 million bpd, respectively. "

Gold futures for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $3, or 0.24%, to $1,290.60 troy ounce.
Gold futures remained close to four-week highs as the dollar continued to trend lower after a mixed bag of economic data failed to lift sentiment on the greenback amid light trading volumes.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.1% to 92.79.
Pending home sales were mostly unchanged in November, rising by 0.2% month-on-month, according to the National Association of Realtors. That topped expectations for a 0.4% decline.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge fell to 122.1 in December from a revised reading of 128.6 in November, missing economists' forecast for a reading of 128.
Gold’s bullish start to the week comes as data showed the traders increased their bullish bets on the previous metal last week.

U.S. demand for the juice has been weakening for years. Add that to a declining citrus crop in Florida, the top domestic grower, and you’ve got a recipe for shrinking investor interest as fewer people want to use futures to hedge. Prices have slumped about 17 percent this month.
The liquidity drain has also sapped market swings: 60-day historical volatility for most-active futures is at the lowest since November 2014.

Jiangxi Copper Co. was told to cut production for at least a week before a new assessment is made on local pollution levels. Earlier in the month, the No. 2 smelter, Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group, was asked to make similar cuts.
The advance in 2017 has been backstopped by supply disruptions just as the outlook for global growth improves and investors and miners target potential new uses, including in electric vehicles. The world’s largest producer, Chile’s Codelco, has said prices may test records above $10,000, while UBS Group AG’s wealth management unit on Wednesday predicted further gains.
“The China shutdown news is certainly propping up copper further than it would be potentially without it,” David Meger, a director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “All of that is tied into this whole thread of optimism in U.S. and global growth.”
Copper for delivery in three months rose 1.6 percent to $7,236.50 a metric ton ($3.28 a pound) on the London Metal Exchange as trade resumed after the Christmas break. The price earlier touched $7,259, the highest since January 2014. The metal has now risen for nine days, the longest streak since 2004, and has gained 31 percent this year, the most among LME metals after aluminum.
Sustained Deficits
Copper futures for March delivery rose 0.2 percent to $3.286 a pound on the Comex in New York. Jiangxi Copper gained 3.4 percent in Hong Kong and Tongling Nonferrous added 0.7 percent in Shenzhen, the highest close since Nov. 9.
This quarter, Codelco said the company’s projections showed a sustained increase in deficits and “we don’t have any reason -- that we know of -- for closing them in the future.” The International Copper Study Group said the global deficit was 181,000 tons in the first nine months of 2017.
Copper may rise to $7,400 a ton in 2018, Dominic Schnider, head of commodities and Asia-Pacific foreign exchange at UBS’s wealth-management unit, told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. Schnider listed the metal among his picks for next year, along with aluminum, which also faces cutbacks in China.
Still, as prices climbed on Wednesday, there were warning signs the metal may have risen too fast. The 14-day relative strength index was just above the 70 mark that signals an asset may be overbought.
Aluminum climbed 1.4 percent to $2,222 a ton, heading for the highest close since 2012. Orders to withdraw the metal from warehouses tracked by the LME rose 20 percent to 255,225 tons, the biggest increase since March 2016.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude February contract fell 31 cents, or 0.52%, to $59.66 a barrel by 9:45AM ET (14:45GMT) Wednesday.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London traded down 43 cents, or 0.65%, to $66.03 a barrel.
Prior to Wednesday’s trading, the U.S. benchmark had rallied around 4.7% in the prior six days and was up about 2.4% this week alone. Despite the current moderate losses, WTI oil is still pocketing gains of about 2% so far this week.
News on Tuesday that an Islamist militant group had been accused of attacking a Libyan oil pipeline was enough to spur the best one-day rally in black gold since in the string of six sessions of gains, outweighing any concerns of the impending return of production at the Britain's largest Forties pipeline.
Meanwhile, Baker Hughes’ data revealed last Friday that the number of U.S. rigs drilling for oil had remained stable at 747, perhaps putting a pause on considerations of whether American shale production would upset OPEC plans to curb production in 2018.
Later on Wednesday, traders will focus on U.S. demand and supply as the American Petroleum Institute is scheduled to publish its weekly stockpiles, followed by the official U.S. government data on Thursday, amid expectations for a draw of about 3.9 million barrels.

WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States announced sanctions on two of North Korea's most prominent officials behind its ballistic missile program on Tuesday, while Russia reiterated an offer to mediate to ease tension between Washington and Pyongyang.
The new U.S. steps were the latest in a campaign aimed at forcing North Korea - which has defied years of multilateral and bilateral sanctions - to abandon a weapons program aimed at developing nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.
""Treasury is targeting leaders of North Korea’s ballistic missile programs, as part of our maximum pressure campaign to isolate (North Korea) and achieve a fully denuclearized Korean Peninsula,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
The move followed new United Nations sanctions announced last Friday in response to North Korea's Nov. 29 test of an ICBM that Pyongyang said put all of the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. Those sanctions sought to further limit North Korea's access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad.
North Korea declared the U.N. steps to be an act of war and tantamount to a complete economic blockade.
The standoff between the United States and North Korea has raised fears of a new conflict on the Korean peninsula, which has remained in a technical state of war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.
The United States has said that all options, including military ones, are on the table in dealing with North Korea. It says it prefers a diplomatic solution, but that North Korea has given no indication it is willing to discuss denuclearization.
LEADING EXPERTS
The U.S. Treasury named the targeted officials as Kim Jong Sik and Ri Pyong Chol. It said Kim was reportedly a major figure in North Korea's efforts to switch its missile program from liquid to solid fuel, while Ri was reported to be a key official in its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) development.
The largely symbolic steps block any property or interests the two might have within U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit any dealings by U.S. citizens with them.
With their ruling Workers Party, military and scientific credentials, the men are two of three top experts considered indispensable to North Korea’s rapidly developing weapons programs. 
Photographs and television footage show that the men are clearly among North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s favorites. Their behavior with him is sharply at variance with the obsequiousness of other senior aides, most of whom bow and hold their hands over their mouths when speaking to the young leader.
Ri is one of the most prominent aides, and likely represents the Workers Party on the missile program, experts say.
Born in 1948, Ri was partly educated in Russia and promoted when Kim Jong Un started to rise through the ranks in the late 2000s.
Ri has visited China once and Russia twice. He met China’s defense minister in 2008 as the air force commander and accompanied Kim Jong Il on a visit to a Russian fighter jet factory in 2011, according to state media. 
Kim Jong Sik is a prominent rocket scientist who rose after playing a role in North Korea’s first successful launch of a rocket in 2012.
He started his career as a civilian aeronautics technician, but now wears the uniform of a military general at the Munitions Industry Department, according to experts and the South Korean government. 
Many other details, including his age, are not known.
KREMLIN OFFER
On Tuesday, the Kremlin, which has long called for the United States and North Korea to negotiate, said it was ready to act as a mediator if the two sides were willing for it to play such a role.
""Russia's readiness to clear the way for de-escalation is obvious,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Asked to comment on the offer, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, Justin Higgins, said the United States ""has the ability to communicate with North Korea through a variety of diplomatic channels"", and added:
""We want the North Korean regime to understand that there is a different path that it can choose, however it is up to North Korea to change course and return to credible negotiations.""
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who made a similar offer on Monday, told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call on Tuesday that ""Washington's aggressive rhetoric"" and beefing up of its military presence in the region had heightened tension and was unacceptable, his ministry said. 
Lavrov underscored the need for ""the fastest move to the negotiating process from the language of sanctions"", it said.
Another U.S. State Department spokesman, Michael Cavey, said Washington remained open to talks, but the onus was on North Korea “to take sincere and meaningful actions toward denuclearization and refrain from further provocations.”
South Korea’s Unification Ministry forecast on Tuesday that North Korea would look to open negotiations with the United States next year while continuing to seek recognition as a de facto nuclear power.
The United States has stressed the need for all countries, especially Russia, and China - North Korea's main trading partner - to fully implement sanctions, including by cutting off oil supplies. 
According to Chinese customs data, China exported no oil products to North Korea in November, apparently going above and beyond U.N. sanctions imposed earlier in the year.
China also imported no North Korean iron ore, coal or lead in November, the second full month of those trade sanctions, the data showed. 
China has not disclosed its crude exports to North Korea for several years, but industry sources say it still supplies about 520,000 tonnes, or 3.8 million barrels, a year to the country via an aging pipeline.
North Korea also sources some of its oil from Russia.
Trade between North Korea and China has slowed through the year, particularly after China banned coal purchases in February.

Chinese exports of corn to North Korea in November also slumped, down 82 percent from a year earlier to 100 tonnes, the lowest since January. Exports of rice plunged 64 percent to 672 tonnes, the lowest since March.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices surged to 2-1/2-year highs and U.S. crude touched $60 a barrel in light trading volume on Tuesday, boosted by news of an explosion on a Libyan crude pipeline as well as voluntary OPEC-led supply cuts.
Armed assailants blew up a pipeline pumping crude oil to the port of Es Sider on Tuesday, cutting Libya's output by up to 100,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to military and energy sources.
The state-run National Oil Corporation (NOC) said in a statement that output had been reduced by 70,000 to 100,000 bpd. The cause of the blast was unclear, it added.
The North African country's output had been recovering in recent months after being held down for years amid armed conflict and unrest.
Brent crude (LCOc1), the international benchmark for oil prices, settled at $67.02 a barrel, up by $1.77, or 2.71 percent. During the session, front-month prices touched a high of $67.10 a barrel, their highest since mid-May 2015.
U.S. crude (CLc1) climbed $1.50, or 2.6 percent, to end the session at $59.97 a barrel after touching a session high of $60.01, the highest since late-June 2015. 
The impending restart of Forties, a key North Sea pipeline, limited the extent of the rally. Oil and gas flows through the pipeline will be increased gradually, its operator Ineos said on Tuesday, adding that the Kinneil processing plant was partially restarted.
""Keep in mind that the field and pipeline are old and it may have issues and it's probably why the market isn't selling off,"" said Scott Shelton, a broker at ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Durham, North Carolina.
Trading activity was thin following the Christmas holiday and London trading was muted during Boxing Day. About 72,000 contracts of front-month Brent futures changed hands on Tuesday, well below the typical daily average of more than 250,000 contracts.
In the United States, the energy complex was led higher by heating oil futures. Prices (HOc1) rose as much as 3.6 percent to a session high of $2.0410, the highest since early June 2015 on forecasts for cold weather.
Brent has risen 17 percent in the year to date while U.S. crude has rallied about 11 percent so far in 2017. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and other non-members, have been withholding some output since Jan. 1 to relieve a glut. The producers have extended the supply cut agreement to cover all of 2018.
Iraq's oil minister said on Monday there would be a balance between supply and demand by the first quarter, leading to a boost in prices. Global oil inventories have decreased to an acceptable level, he added.
That outlook is earlier than predicted in OPEC's latest official forecast, which calls for a balanced market by late 2018. [OPEC/M]
U.S. shipments to China, one of the world's biggest oil consumers, have benefited from the OPEC-led output cuts. Russia, however, was China's largest crude oil supplier for the ninth month in a row in November, topping Saudi Arabia for the year so far, China's customs data showed on Tuesday.
While the OPEC action has lent support to prices all year, market participants have said the unplanned shutdown of the Forties pipeline on Dec. 11 is what helped push Brent to its 2-1/2-year high.
Forties is the biggest of the five North Sea crude streams underpinning Brent, the benchmark for oil trading in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
Still, rising production in the United States is offsetting some of the OPEC-led cuts. 
The U.S. rig count , an early indicator of future output, held steady at 747 in the week to Dec. 22, according to the latest weekly report by Baker Hughes.

U.S. crude oil inventories were likely down for a sixth straight week, while gasoline stockpiles saw a probable build last week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.

Futures in New York and London touched the highest in more than two years after reports of an explosion at a pipeline operated by Waha Oil that carries crude to the Es Sider terminal in Libya. Waha output fell by 60,000-70,000 barrels a day, according to a person familiar with the situation. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia is said to expect oil revenue to jump about 80 percent by 2023.
The blast is “certainly something of a set-back because Libya had been very steadily staying online,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund. “It’s just a reminder of the geopolitical risk premium that’s going to haunt this market all of next year.”
Waha production was at 260,000 barrels a day, said a person familiar with the situation. The explosion “is a big thing” that could push prices higher still amid a tighter supply picture, said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia is said to expect its first budget surplus in a decade, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Under a six-year program to balance the budget, officials predict rising prices and expanded output will push income from oil sales to 801.4 billion riyals ($214 billion) from 440 billion riyals this year, the people said.
Oil is poised for a fourth straight monthly advance as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners including Russia cut output and promise to continue doing so through the end of next year.

788,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 26, 2017 08:30AM ET</span>",Saudis Are Said to Expect Oil Revenue Increasing 80% by 2023,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia expects oil revenue to jump about 80 percent by 2023 to help the kingdom record its first budget surplus in a decade, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Under a six-year program to balance the budget, officials predict rising oil prices and output will push income from oil sales to 801.4 billion riyals ($214 billion) from 440 billion riyals this year, the people said on condition of anonymity because they aren’t authorized to share the data publicly. It assumes the price of oil will reach $75 a barrel. Non-oil revenue, excluding income from the Public Investment Fund, would increase 32 percent to 337 billion riyals, they said.
While Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plan to transform the economy aims to reduce its reliance on oil in the long term, higher crude prices are central to efforts to support growth while introducing measures that would help boost revenue from other sources. The kingdom has led a drive among major non-OPEC members to stabilize oil markets through production cuts that have helped Brent crude prices exceed $60 a barrel.
Authorities expect oil production to increase from an average of 10 million barrels a day this year to 11.03 million barrels in 2023. For 2020, they predict output of 10.45 million barrels a day, generating 605 billion riyals in revenue, the people said.
The Ministry of Finance declined to comment.
The scenario may signal that the world’s biggest oil exporter doesn’t currently see a need to extend the agreement to cut production beyond 2018 as a global supply glut eases.
Easing austerity “could prove premature if oil prices disappoint,” Jean-Michel Saliba, an economist at BofA Merrill Lynch in London, wrote in a report last week. “Energy policy is likely to remain focused on supporting the oil market rebalancing and enabling the government’s shift to boost growth near-term.”
Top Saudi officials last week rolled out an expansionary budget for 2018 to revive an economy battered by austerity and low oil prices. Gross domestic product contracted 0.5 percent in 2017.
A document outlining some details of the fiscal program and published by the Saudi Press Agency showed authorities expected non-oil economic growth to stay above 3 percent through 2020 from 1.5 percent this year. The document has since been deleted from the agency’s website.

Economy Minister Mohammad Al Tuwaijri, speaking after the budget release on Tuesday, said that the kingdom “found it appropriate to move to a more optimistic scenario” in fiscal planning. “We’re very satisfied with what happened in 2017, and we’ll continue on this journey.”
The budget deficit narrowed to about 9 percent of GDP this year.

Comex gold futures rose 0.28% to $1,282.30 a troy ounce by 4:18AM ET (9:18GMT) Tuesday, just off its intraday high of $1,283.50 which was its highest level since December 1.
The dollar was little changed on Tuesday with Wall Street preparing to reopen its doors after the Christmas holiday. Most European stock markets remained closed on Tuesday for Boxing Day and with New Year’s just around the corner, trading was expected to remain thin.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.14% at 92.97.
Gold is sensitive to moves in the dollar. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency.
On a very light economic calendar, investors digested Japanese data for November out overnight that showed inflation that rose more than expected, the unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked down to 2.7% and household spending gave a strong reading with a 2.1% rise that beat consensus.
The focus stateside will be on the Conference Board’s consumer confidence for December, although the S&P/Case-Shiller housing price index for October, and manufacturing indices from the Richmond and Dallas Fed will also be released.

Futures were little changed in New York after gaining 2 percent last week. The number of U.S. rigs targeting oil remained unchanged at 747, Baker Hughes data showed Friday. A repair of the North Sea’s Forties Pipeline System is complete and pressure testing has started, operator Ineos Group said Monday. The halt of the line earlier this month sent prices surging.
Oil is heading for a second yearly advance as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia prolong supply curbs through the end of 2018. Iraq’s Oil Minister Jabbar Al-Luaibi said Monday that he’s optimistic prices will gain next year with global stockpiles falling and demand rising in China and India.
“It’s a bit too early to say whether U.S. rigs will continue to decline as we can’t ignore the fact that it’s winter and some seasonal factors could be stalling drilling activity,” Will Yun, a commodities analyst at Hyundai Futures Corp., said by phone. “The shutdown of the Forties pipeline has kept prices higher and it will support oil’s bull run until at least the end of this year.”
West Texas Intermediate for February delivery was at $58.54 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 7 cents, at 2:23 p.m. in Seoul. Total volume traded was about 53 percent below the 100-day average. The contract on Friday added 11 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $58.47.
Brent for February settlement added 2 cents to $65.27 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Prices gained 35 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $65.25 Friday. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $6.73 to WTI.

791,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 26, 2017 01:00AM ET</span>",Oil's Bull Run Wavers as Investors Wait to See What 2018 Holds,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil’s bull run is grinding to a halt.
Hedge funds lowered their bets on Brent crude after they rose to a record a week earlier. And the net-bullish position on West Texas Intermediate, which hit a nine-month high last month, dwindled for a third straight week. The message: After a months-long build-up, investors are wavering, concerned U.S. crude will continue to boom in 2018, undercutting OPEC’s push to drain a global glut.
""It seems like now most people have got their positions and are waiting to see what 2018 brings,"" said Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.
Oil futures in New York have jumped almost 40 percent since June as OPEC and its allies extended their production-cut deal and U.S. inventories shrank to two-year lows. But the decline in American stockpiles is largely due to refinery maintenance and exports near an all-time high. Meanwhile gushers in the country are producing at a record pace.
Global stockpiles won’t fall enough to reach the level targeted by OPEC when the group meets in June, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said last week.
American output is poised to reach 9.99 million barrels a day in May, according to the Energy Information Administration. That would surpass Saudi Arabia’s curtailed production of 9.97 million barrels a day in November.
Net Positions
The Brent net-long position -- the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a drop -- fell 1.1 percent to 538,045 contracts in the week ended Dec. 19, according to data from ICE Futures Europe. That’s after reaching a record 544,051 contracts in the previous week. Longs fell 1.2 percent, while shorts decreased 1.8 percent.
Money managers cut their WTI net-long position by 1.8 percent to 383,828 futures and options during the week, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday. Longs fell by 1.2 percent, while shorts rose 3.9 percent.
""It’s been a good year,"" but there’s ""some worry about what next month is going to bring,"" said John Kilduff, founding partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. ""There’s not as much enthusiasm about the OPEC/non-OPEC accord as there was even a few weeks ago.""
Pipeline Outage
The North Sea’s Forties Pipeline System, which carries crude used to price the Dated Brent benchmark, is set to return to normal flows early in the new year, according to a statement from operator Ineos Group. The outage, which gave a boost to prices, was the first time a force majeure had been declared in the North Sea since 1988. Repairs are expected to be completed by “around Christmas.”
In the fuel market, money managers reduced their net-long position on benchmark U.S. gasoline by 2.1 percent. Meanwhile, the net-bullish position on diesel rose by 1.9 percent.
Heading into next year, investors will be watching how long it takes to get inventories back to the five-year average, Thummel said. The OPEC deal extension brought some certainty to the market, which is now waiting to see how the cuts and U.S. production play out.
""That was the big cloud overhanging the oil market and prices,"" he said."

The State Council said on its website late on Monday the goal to control the size of the city was part of Shanghai's masterplan for 2017-2035, which the government body had approved. 
""By 2035, the resident population in Shanghai will be controlled at around 25 million and the total amount of land made available for construction will not exceed 3,200 square kilometers,"" it said.
State media has defined ""big city disease"" as arising when a megacity becomes plagued with environmental pollution, traffic congestion and a shortage of public services, including education and medical care.
Many of China's biggest cities also face surging house prices, stirring fears of a property bubble.
Shanghai, which sits on China's eastern coast, had a permanent population of 24.15 million at the end of 2015, the official Xinhua news agency said last year.

The city has also said it would intensify efforts to protect the environment and historic site as part of its masterplan.

The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), which regulates offshore oil and gas drilling, proposes relaxing requirements to stream real-time data on oil production operators to facilities onshore, where they are available for review by regulators, the Journal reported.
The BSEE has also proposed cutting a provision requiring that third-party inspectors of critical equipment - such as the blowout preventer that failed in the Deepwater Horizon case - be certified by the BSEE, the Journal reported.
The agency had sent its proposal to the White House budget office, the newspaper reported.
Reuters could not independently verify the proposals, which the Journal said have not yet been made public.
The Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico left 11 dead and led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history. Oil company  BP  (LON:BP) paid out around $60 billion in fines and clean-up costs.

Ahmadreza Djalali, a medical doctor and lecturer at the Karolinska Institute, a Stockholm medical university, was accused of providing information to Israel to help it assassinate several senior nuclear scientists.
Djalali was arrested in Iran in April 2016 and later convicted of espionage. He has denied the charges, Amnesty said. 
At least four scientists were killed between 2010 and 2012 in what Tehran said were assassinations meant to sabotage its efforts to develop nuclear energy. Western powers and Israel said Iran aimed to build a nuclear bomb. Tehran denied this.
The Islamic Republic hanged a man in 2012 over the killings, saying he was an agent for Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.
On Monday, Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi said the Supreme Court recently upheld the death sentence against Djalali, the news site of Iran's judiciary, Mizan, reported.
Dolatabadi said Djalali had confessed to meeting Mossad agents repeatedly to deliver information on Iran's nuclear and defense plans and personnel, and helping to infect Defense Ministry computer systems with viruses, Mizan reported.
London-based Amnesty International and Djalali's wife said earlier this month that his lawyers were told that the Supreme Court had considered his case and upheld his death sentence.
Iranian state television broadcast last week what it described as Djalali's confessions. His wife said he had been forced by his interrogators to read the confession.
Djalali was on a business trip to Iran when he was arrested and sent to Evin prison. He was held in solitary confinement for three months of his detention and tortured, Amnesty said. 
It said Djalali wrote a letter inside prison in August stating he was being held for refusing to spy for Iran.
Sweden condemned the sentence in October and said it had raised the matter with Iranian envoys.

Seventy-five Nobel prize laureates petitioned Iranian authorities last month to release Djalali so he could ""continue his scholarly work for the benefit of mankind"".

(Reuters) - Energy companies and other businesses that accidentally kill migratory birds will no longer be criminally prosecuted, the Trump administration said Friday in a decision hailed by industry but denounced by environmental groups.
The decision, in a legal memo from the U.S. Department of Interior, reverses a longstanding practice at the agency as well as a last-minute rule released by the outgoing Obama administration. It comes after several appeals courts ruled that the government was interpreting a century-old law aimed at protecting birds too broadly.
""Christmas came early for bird killers,"" said David O'Neill, chief conservation officer for the National Audubon Society. ""The White House is parting ways with more than 100 years of conservation legacy.”
The administration's move is the latest of several actions Trump has taken to weaken environmental protections viewed as burdensome to industry, including shrinking the size of two national monuments in Utah and reconsidering protections for the Greater Sage Grouse, a Western bird whose population has dropped precipitously amid threats to its habitat. 
In the legal opinion issued late Friday, the Interior Department's principal deputy solicitor, Daniel Jorjani, said that a 1918 law that officials have used to prosecute those who kill birds ""incidentally"" as part of doing business was really aimed at preventing poaching and hunting without a license.
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act ""applies only to direct and affirmative purposeful actions that reduce migratory birds, their eggs, or their nests, by killing or capturing, to human control,"" Jorjani wrote.
His opinion reverses a January effort by outgoing former President Barack Obama to encode the Interior Department's ability to prosecute those who accidentally kill migratory birds, which never went into effect as it was suspended shortly after Trump came into office.
But it also makes clear that law enforcement officials working for the department are not to attempt to file criminal charges in such cases, which Jorjani said would be a change in the agency's practices.
Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, said oil and gas companies “protect birds every day” and accused the Obama administration of abusing the law by making companies criminally liable.
“The MBTA was enacted by Congress as a criminal statute to stop the hunting and poaching of migratory birds,"" she said in a statement. ""It was not meant to address activities that do not directly kill birds.”
But environmentalists predicted the Trump administration’s decision meant no accountability for the deaths of otherwise unprotected birds, from songbirds to falcons.
The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment form Reuters.

797,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 10:29PM ET</span>",U.N. Security Council imposes new sanctions on North Korea over missile test,"By Rodrigo Campos and Hyonhee Shin
UNITED NATIONS/SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Friday for its recent intercontinental ballistic missile test, seeking to limit its access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad.
The U.N. resolution seeks to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year and, in a last-minute change, demands the repatriation of North Koreans working abroad within 24 months, instead of 12 months as first proposed.
The U.S.-drafted resolution also caps crude oil supplies to North Korea at 4 million barrels a year and commits the Council to further reductions if it were to conduct another nuclear test or launch another ICBM.
North Korea on Nov. 29 said it successfully tested a new ICBM that put the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons.
Tension has been rising over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House.
In November, North Korea demanded a halt to what it called ""brutal sanctions"", saying a round imposed after its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 constituted genocide.
U.S. diplomats have made clear they are seeking a diplomatic solution but proposed the new, tougher sanctions resolution to ratchet up pressure on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
""It sends the unambiguous message to Pyongyang that further defiance will invite further punishments and isolation,"" Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said after the 15-0 vote.
The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Wu Haitao, China's deputy U.N. ambassador, said tensions on the Korean peninsula risk ""spiraling out of control"" and he repeated Beijing's call for talks.
China's foreign ministry said it hoped all parties would implement the resolution and urged all sides to exercise restraint.
It also reiterated a call for what it calls a ""dual suspension” proposal for the United States and South Korea to stop major military exercises in exchange for North Korea halting its weapons programs.
South Korea welcomed the sanctions and called on the North to ""immediately cease reckless provocations, and take the path of dialogue for denuclearization"".
North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea, the United States and Japan, and says its weapons are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.
On Friday, North Korea called U.S. President Donald Trump's recently released national security strategy the latest attempt to ""stifle our country and turn the entire Korean peninsula"" into an outpost of American hegemony.
INCREASING PRESSURE
Speaking before the Security Council vote, analysts said the new sanctions could have a major effect on the North's economy.
""The cap on oil would be devastating for North Korea's haulage industry, for North Koreans who use generators at home or for productive activities, and for (state-owned enterprises) that do the same,"" said Peter Ward, a columnist for NK News, a website that tracks North Korea.
The forced repatriation of its overseas workers would also cut off vital sources of foreign currency, he said.
China, which supplies most of North Korea's oil, has backed successive rounds of U.N. sanctions but had resisted past U.S. calls to cut off fuel supplies to its neighbor.
John Park, director of the Korea Working Group at the Harvard Kennedy School, said it was important to manage expectations about sanctions, which could take years to have a full impact while the North was making progress in its weapons programs at a pace measured in weeks and months.
""If the game plan is to use sanctions as the last non-military policy tool to induce North Korea’s return to the denuclearization table, we may quickly find Washington prioritizing military options,” Park said.
The move to curb Chinese fuel exports to North Korea may have limited impact after China National Petroleum Corp  suspended diesel and gasoline sales to its northern neighbor in June over concerns it would not get paid.
Business has slowed since then, with zero shipments of diesel, gasoline and other fuel from China in October. 
Russia quietly boosted economic support for North Korea this year, and last week Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov said Moscow was not ready to sign up to sanctions that would strangle the country economically.
In a bid to further choke North Korea's external sources of funding, the resolution also seeks to ban North Korean exports of food products, machinery, electrical equipment, earth and stone, wood and vessels.
It also bans exports to North Korea of industrial equipment, machinery, transport vehicles, and industrial metals as well as subjecting 15 North Koreans and the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces to a global asset freeze and travel ban.
The resolution seeks to allow countries to seize, inspect and freeze any vessel they believe was carrying banned cargo or involved in prohibited activities.
Even if the sanctions have an economic effect, it is not clear whether that would push Pyongyang to negotiate or stop its weapons development, said Kim Sung-han, a former South Korean vice foreign minister.

""We have had numerous ... sanctions against North Korea over the past 25 years,"" he said. ""Almost none have worked effectively to halt the regime's military and nuclear ambitions.""

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose in light volumes on Friday, steadying near their highest levels since 2015 on pledges from OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Russia that any exit from crude output cuts would be gradual.
Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, ended the session up 35 cents at $65.25 a barrel, its highest close since June 2015.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled 11 cents higher at $58.47 a barrel. WTI has also been touching values not seen since mid-2015 over the past two months.
Both contracts settled one hour early due to the upcoming Christmas holiday. Market liquidity was also drying up on Friday as traders closed positions ahead of the Christmas and New Year breaks. 
About 280,000 front-month U.S. crude futures changed hands while front-month Brent crude futures saw the lowest trade volumes in about seven months, excluding expiration days.
""I think the market is looking balanced overall but think the risk remains to the upside in Brent spreads due to continued price appreciation,"" said Scott Shelton, a broker at ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Durham, North Carolina.
""Traders who are flat and waiting for a dip will come in on the first trading day of the month in January in 2018 with a fresh P&L wondering if $60 WTI and $66 Brent are buys or not."" 
Oil prices have recovered in the past year on the back of oil production cuts by OPEC, Russia and other producers, helping reduce the global inventory overhang.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told Reuters OPEC and Russia would exit cuts smoothly, possibly extending curbs in some form to avoid creating any new surplus.
""There is a consensus among the (oil) ministers that we should avoid oversupply on the market when exiting the deal,"" Novak said, comments that will calm investor worries that Moscow wants a speedy exit.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said it was premature to discuss changes to the pact on supply cuts as market rebalancing was unlikely to happen until the second half of 2018.
The OPEC-led pact to withhold supplies started in January this year. The producer group and its allies last month extended the agreement until the end of next year.
The supply restraint has reduced oil inventories and helped push up Brent by more than 45 percent since June this year. 
""OPEC's extension of its production cuts through the end of 2018 is a necessary condition for continued inventory drawdown,"" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said, raising its 2018 Brent forecast to $63 from $57, and its WTI forecast to $59 from $54.
Novak said some pressure on prices was possible in the first quarter of 2018 when demand traditionally declines and added he saw prices hovering at around $50 to $60 in 2018.
Analysts said crude output in the United States, fast approaching 10 million bpd, would be a drag on prices in the longer term.
""Supply is expected to grow further, paving the way to an oversupplied market, which can again exercise downward pressure on oil prices,"" consultancy Rystad Energy said.

Novak said he expected U.S. oil output to grow by 0.6 million bpd in 2018 but added that rising U.S. demand should help offset an increase.

799,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 22, 2017 08:13AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices Decline Amid Sustained U.S. Output Worries,"Investing.com - Crude oil prices moved lower on Friday, still weighed by concerns over rising U.S. output and as the Forties pipeline in the North Sea was set to re-open in January.
Trading volumes were thin on Friday as investors closed positions ahead of the upcoming Christmas and New Year holidays.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude February contract was down 42 cents or about 0.72% at $57.95 a barrel by 08:10 a.m. ET (12:10 GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for February delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was down 40 cents or about 0.62% at $64.50 a barrel.
In addition to the ongoing outlook for rising supplies in the U.S., the expected return of the 450,000 barrels per day Forties pipeline system in the North Sea in January dampened demand for the commodity.
The pipeline was shut earlier this month due to a crack but its operator said on Thursday that it expected to complete repairs around Christmas and to gradually restart the system in early January.
Fears that rising U.S. output could dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies have been weighing on the commodity in recent months.
The producer group, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed last week to extend current oil output cuts for a further nine months until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
Elsewhere, gasoline futures were down 0.26% at $1.741 a gallon, while natural gas futures gained 1.12% to $2.627 per million British thermal units."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - OPEC and Russia will exit from oil production cuts very smoothly, possibly extending the curbs in some form to avoid creating any new surplus in the market, the Russian energy minister told Reuters.
Alexander Novak also said in comments cleared for publication on Friday that he saw no direct connection between the oil cuts and Saudi Arabia's plan to list Saudi Aramco, the world's top oil producer. 
""Everyone in the market is interested in achieving balance,"" Novak said in response to a question on whether Saudi Arabia could abruptly exit the cuts as soon as it lists Aramco sometime in 2018. The share sale promises to be the world's biggest.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other large oil producers led by Russia agreed last month to extend until the end of next year their deal to cut a combined 1.8 million barrels per day of output.
The move is aimed at clearing a global stocks overhang and propping up oil prices.
Russia and Saudi Arabia have significantly improved bilateral ties this year, resulting in a visit to Moscow by Saudi King Salman accompanied by a large political and business delegation. 
Oil is a key source of budget revenue for both countries and Novak said he expected prices to fluctuate at $50-$60 per barrel next year. 
On Thursday, King Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a telephone conversation during which they agreed to continue close cooperation to ensure stability on global hydrocarbon markets. 
A YEAR OF BALANCE
OPEC and Russia together produce more than 40 percent of the world's oil. Moscow's cooperation on output cuts with OPEC, arranged with Putin's help, has been crucial in roughly halving an excess of global oil stocks since January.
With oil prices rising above $60, Russia has expressed concern that an extension for the whole of 2018 could prompt a spike in crude production in the United States, which is not participating in the deal.
Russia has been pushing for a timely exit from the cuts to make sure the market doesn't overheat. 
Novak said it would take time for the deal to be brought to an end. 
""Detailed parameters will be discussed by the time we approach balance. There could be different timeframes, depending on forecasts of supply and increasing demand in global markets,"" he said.
""We have a common understanding on this issue but I don't want to discuss hypothetical scenarios now,"" Novak said.
""There is a consensus among the (oil) ministers that we should avoid oversupply on the market when exiting the deal."" 
Novak said there was an option to extend the deal beyond 2018, while he sees markets balancing in the third or fourth quarters of next year.
""Our task, above all, is (to achieve a) sustainable demand and supply balance. We aim to reach this result, this could be achieved, if things are going well ... during 2018,"" Novak said. 
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday it was premature to discuss any changes to the OPEC-led supply pact as market rebalancing was unlikely until the second half of 2018.
Novak said he expected Russian oil output to stay at about 547 million tonnes (10.98 million bpd) next year but added the country would export more refined products and less crude as it was upgrading its refineries.

He added that he expected U.S. oil output to rise by 0.6 million bpd next year. ""But they also have rising demand, which is partially offseting the rise in production,"" he said.

A Reuters examination of Semlex emails, corporate records and signed contracts found that Karaziwan has won business in the Comoros and elsewhere in Africa - on paper worth hundreds of millions of dollars - through political connections, sometimes without going through open tender processes and sometimes while making payments to intermediaries.
At the same time, presidential decrees and other documents from the Comoros shed new light on how Comoros passports, supplied by Semlex, are being bought by foreign citizens, some of whom are suspected by Comoros and foreign authorities of being security threats. Reuters determined that at least two buyers of Comoros passports are people accused by U.S. authorities of breaking sanctions against Iran.
Karaziwan's political links are remarkable. In the Comoros, where Semlex first won a contract to supply passports and other documents in 2007, he was made a special adviser and roving ambassador by former president Ahmed Abdallah Mohammed Sambi. At least eight of his staff and associates acquired Comoros honorary consulships, according to Comoros government documents reviewed by Reuters. The honorary consulships, nominated between 2010 and 2012, ranged from Mombasa to Monaco.
On receiving questions from Reuters, Sambi indicated he would answer but did not respond by the time of publication.
Karaziwan is listed on a Comoros government database as having three current Comoros passports. The database shows his Belgian wife, Catherine Laurent, was issued with a Comoros diplomatic passport in 2010, and that their 27-year-old son, Alexandre, who works for an IT consultancy in Brussels, also has one. Some Semlex staff were also issued with them.
Reuters was unable to determine why the Comoros granted these credentials or why the Karaziwans and Semlex associates may have sought them. In general, according to law enforcement officials, such passports and consular nominations facilitate travel, open doors and, in some cases, make doing business easier.
Karaziwan did not respond to a request for an interview or to questions sent to him by email. A Brussels-based lawyer representing Semlex, Francois Koning, said Karaziwan would not comment for this article, claiming that unidentified third parties were manipulating Reuters with the aim of damaging Karaziwan and Semlex.
Laurent said she had no role at Semlex and did not know whether she had a Comoros diplomatic passport. ""It is possible, but I don't use one, so I am not sure,"" she said. Alexandre Karaziwan did not respond to several requests for comment sent to him via his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) account.
Albert Karaziwan's activities have come at a cost for many ordinary citizens of Africa, the world's poorest continent, Reuters inquiries show.
In April, Reuters reported how Karaziwan struck a deal to supply biometric passports to the Democratic Republic of Congo for which its citizens have to pay $185 each. Congo previously charged $100 for passports. The current deal arranged for $60 from each passport to go to an obscure Gulf company owned by a close relative of Congo's President Joseph Kabila, according to documents and a source familiar with the arrangements.
This year, Mozambique terminated a 10-year Semlex contract, potentially worth several hundred million dollars, that had been awarded in 2009 by the country's previous government. The deal was struck without an open tender, two sources close to Semlex said. The current Mozambique government says Semlex invested a fraction of the $100 million it had promised to spend on training, electronic scanners at borders and other infrastructure. It says citizens have lost out from the deal.
When the passports were introduced, they cost Mozambique citizens $80 while the average income per capita was under $500 per year, though currency changes meant the cost later fell in dollar terms.
A review of the contract published in 2015 by Mozambique's Centre for Public Integrity (CIP), a transparency organization, said official figures showed that the state collected just 8 percent of the revenues from ID documents produced between 2011 and 2014.
In October, Semlex issued a statement in Mozambique saying it had shut down its operations in the country, but alleging that its contract had been ""unjustifiably"" terminated. It called for an independent audit; the government rejected that request. A government official told Reuters the contract was terminated because Semlex had not met ""the rules we agreed upon."" He did not elaborate.
In the Comoros, a parliamentary commission of inquiry is investigating the sale of passports to foreigners to determine whether the process has been legal, who has been involved and where revenues have gone. Investigators have found that more than 2,800 Comoros diplomatic passports have been issued since 2008 in a country with a population of about 800,000. In that period, at least 184 diplomatic passports were sold to non-Comorans, data gathered by the investigators shows.
Since Semlex still produces all Comoros passports, the commission is investigating the company's role in the matter. Dhoulkamal Dhoihir, vice president of the Comoros National Assembly and chairman of the commission investigating the passports issue, said: ""Semlex is a key player … We have convoked Karaziwan to come here.""
The commission summoned Karaziwan in September, hoping he would give evidence. Semlex said Karaziwan would be available for questioning on Nov. 20. He did not turn up.
COMMISSIONS FOR OFFICIALS
Karaziwan was born in Aleppo, Syria, in 1958, in a family of eight children. In the 1980s, he moved to Brussels to study and went on to marry Laurent.
Over the years, Karaziwan developed businesses in real estate, restaurants and hotels, according to his company website and corporate documents. He set up Semlex in 1992 and prospered. In a copy of his CV shared with colleagues in 2008, Karaziwan said his businesses had a combined value of 100 million euros.
Semlex is a family company and not listed on a stock exchange. Its main operating unit, Semlex Europe, has a core of only about a dozen employees, according to company documents. Semlex emails reviewed by Reuters show the informal way Karaziwan and his associates have worked behind the scenes to punch above their weight.
In June 2004, for example, Helder Tavares Proenca, a writer and politician, was named as Semlex's agent in the West African country of Guinea-Bissau, according to Semlex documents reviewed by Reuters. In November 2005, Proenca became defense minister and in early 2006 Semlex won contracts to supply the country with passports, visas, ID cards and foreign resident cards, according to Semlex copies of the agreements.
Semlex documents show the company paid Proenca at least 80,000 euros ($94,000) between 2004 and 2009. Proenca was killed in 2009 in an assassination that police suspected was related to drug smuggling. Arnaldo Mendes, an official in charge of identification issues in Guinea-Bissau's justice ministry, said he could not comment on whether Proenca had influenced the awarding of contracts under a previous government.
In 2010, Semlex employees discussed in emails what percentage of revenue they would have to pay former and serving Guinea-Bissau officials to secure a further contract to provide the country with passports and resident cards for foreigners. According to Semlex emails reviewed by Reuters, a proposal was made to pay a commission amounting to 20 percent of the price each citizen would have to pay for a passport and 15 percent of the revenue that Semlex received for residence permits issued to foreigners.
On Jan. 24, 2011, a Semlex official asked Karaziwan to sign off on the offer. The next day, Karaziwan replied: ""You can confirm it.""
However, Guinea-Bissau government officials told Reuters Semlex did not win a further contract.
Other Semlex emails show that company staff described some payments as bribes. In November 2010, Michele Bauters, the firm's finance manager, asked an employee to detail how he had spent nearly 80,000 euros provided in cash for operations in Africa, according to Semlex emails reviewed by Reuters.
Much of the money had gone on rent and utility bills, the employee said, and 10,000 euros had gone on a ""pot de vin"" – French for bribes. The employee's explanation for what had happened to half of the 10,000 euros was blunt: ""A bribe that Albert Karaziwan made me pay recently.""
In response to the employee's apparent irritation at being asked for explanations, Bauters said Karaziwan had merely wanted to know how the money had been spent and made no reference to the mention of bribes.
Bauters did not respond to requests for comment by email. When Reuters rang Semlex headquarters, staff several times said she was busy.
Other documents illustrate how Semlex appears to benefit more than the state coffers of countries that agree to its deals. In 2013, Semlex extended an existing contract with Madagascar to supply passports and more than doubled the amount it charged. Under the new deal, citizens have to pay 36.25 euros (around $47) for a passport; of that, the state receives 2.5 euros and Semlex gets 33.75 euros, a contract between the two sides shows. Previously, Semlex received 15.50 euros per passport, the prior contract shows.
The cost of making such passports can be modest. Invoices from Imprimerie National, a French state-owned printing firm that used to produce blank passports for Semlex to complete with personal details, show that Semlex paid 1.75 euros to 2 euros per document for projects in Madagascar, Gabon and Comoros in 2007 and 2008. Semlex now has its own printing operation to produce passports.
DIPLOMATIC POST
Through his high-level connections, Karaziwan was able to help non-Comoros individuals become representatives of the islands. From May 2010 to May 2011, Karaziwan was in frequent contact with Ibrahim Fahmi Said, then minister of foreign affairs in the Comoros, about diplomatic appointments, Semlex emails discussing honorary consulships show.
In July 2010, Karaziwan sent Fahmi a CV belonging to a Lebanese businessman called Nizar Dalloul. Karaziwan attached a covering letter saying he was corresponding in reference to Dalloul's nomination as the Comoros ambassador to UNESCO in Paris.
""As already discussed with the president, it would be good to move forward to nominate him quickly,"" Karaziwan wrote to the foreign minister. Dalloul was officially named ambassador on Sept. 1 that year, according to a decree signed by the Comoros president.
Dalloul told Reuters that the possibility of being UNESCO ambassador arose during talks he had with former Comoros president Sambi. He said he was named ambassador, but the appointment was rescinded shortly afterwards when Sambi left power. After this happened, Karaziwan did not seek to get him reinstated, Dalloul said.
In an emailed response to questions, Fahmi told Reuters that Dalloul had been named an ambassador by the president, not by him as foreign minister. He said Karaziwan had a role because he was an adviser to the president.
Fahmi said any relationship he had with Semlex was purely linked to work he did for the company as a lawyer, and that he did not receive any payment from them in relation to his work as a minister.
A spokesman for UNESCO said he could not comment on the matter.
Dalloul runs a company called Comium, which describes itself as a provider of internet services in Lebanon, Iraq and other areas of the Middle East, and as a leading provider of telecoms in Africa. He said he met Karaziwan through a friend who was looking for potential investors in the Comoros. Reuters could not establish why Karaziwan wanted to help Dalloul become a UNESCO ambassador.
Karaziwan also became involved in a Comoros program to raise cash by selling citizenship. The plan was mainly aimed at the stateless Bidoon people of Kuwait and United Arab Emirates who, for a variety of reasons, do not have citizenship of any country. The program offered the Gulf governments a way of helping the Bidoon without giving them citizenship, and it offered the Comoros a way to raise revenue, according to the law authorizing the scheme.
Comoros government documents from 2012 show that the country was paid just over $4,500 for each citizenship issued.
However, Comoros citizenship and passports were also sold outside the official program to non-Bidoon people – sometimes at much higher prices, according to Comoros investigators and sources with direct knowledge of Semlex operations. The passports are potentially valuable because they offer a citizenship with no tax obligations and can be used to open bank accounts and facilitate travel in the Gulf and beyond, law enforcement officials say.
The former Comoros government allowed some of these sales to be handled by a Dubai-based company called Lica International Consulting, according to a Comoros agreement with Lica reviewed by Reuters. Three sources, one with direct knowledge of Semlex operations, said Lica is controlled by Karaziwan. Two of the sources said Cedric Fevre, a business associate of Karaziwan, ran Lica on Karaziwan's behalf.
A lawyer representing Fevre, Henri Nader Zoleyn, said his client would not comment due to the confidentiality of contracts linked to passports and citizenship. When a Reuters reporter went to Lica's office in Dubai, no one appeared to be present.
Lica was meant to vet candidates for citizenship and pay the Comoros government $10,000 per document it issued, according to the agreement reviewed by Reuters. Two sources with direct knowledge of Karaziwan's activities said Lica asked at least 100,000 euros ($118,000) for supplying a Comoros passport.
A Comoros presidential decree, issued in March 2016 and reviewed by Reuters, shows a list of 21 foreigners, including an American, a South African and several Syrians, who had been proposed by Lica and granted citizenship by the president. A former Comoros government official said he knew of at least 23 other passports sold via Lica.
A Comoros decree from Dec. 28, 2015, reviewed by Reuters, authorized two prominent figures in the Democratic Republic of Congo to have Comoros citizenship and passports: Congolese presidential advisor Emmanuel Adrupiako and Makie Makolo Wangoi, a relative of President Kabila. Adrupiako and Wangoi were both involved in a separate Semlex deal to supply passports to Congo, as Reuters reported in April. Reuters could not determine clear how they obtained Comoros citizenship, or what role, if any, Lica or Semlex played.
In an email to Reuters, Adrupiako said he held no citizenship or nationality other than his Congolese one, and that he had never filed a formal, written request for other citizenship. However, Adrupiako said he did receive an unsolicited Comoros passport in his name in December 2015 after holding talks with a representative of the country over a potential tourism project between Congo and Comoros. Adrupiako said he sent the passport back.
Wangoi did not respond to an emailed request for comment and could not be contacted by telephone.
A Comoros presidential decree also shows that in July 2015 a man named Hamid Reza Malakotipour was granted Comoros citizenship. Malakotipour was sanctioned in 2014 by the United States, which alleged he held an Iranian passport and had helped to supply equipment to forces of Iran's Revolutionary Guards in Syria. Reuters was unable to establish how Malakotipour obtained Comoros citizenship or whether he acquired it through Lica or Semlex.
Reuters was unable to contact Malakotipour and could find no public response from him to being sanctioned. Mahan Air, the airline for which Malakotipour was working when he was sanctioned, declined to comment.
Also issued with Comoros citizenship was a Turkish-Iranian man named Mohammad Zarrab, according to the July 2015 Comoros presidential decree. In an indictment filed in the Southern District of New York in 2016, U.S. prosecutors accused Zarrab and others of violating American sanctions by carrying out hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business on behalf of Iran. Zarrab's whereabouts are unclear and he could not be contacted for comment.
Reuters was unable to establish how Zarrab obtained Comoros citizenship or whether he acquired it through Lica or Semlex.
In 2016, a new government came to power in the Comoros. Souef Mohamed El Amine, the current foreign minister, said the government is now trying to establish how many passports have been issued and who has received them. El Amine told Reuters that the government has a list of at least 100 people who had been provided with Comoros passports and were potential security risks.
""It doesn't matter if it is dozens or hundreds, it is the principle itself,"" El Amine said. He added: ""Semlex is the one who makes the Comoros passports.""
BELGIAN INVESTIGATION
On May 7, 2012, the public prosecutor's office in Brussels sent Karaziwan a letter calling him in to answer questions related to potential money laundering involving Semlex operations in Africa. Over the course of 2012, Karaziwan faced several rounds of questions about Semlex and its activities, prosecutor's documents reviewed by Reuters show.
At one point a lawyer acting for Karaziwan met the prosecutor and later told Karaziwan in a letter that the prosecutor planned to recommend an audit by the tax authorities or to file charges. Neither happened. Instead, the investigation was dropped in 2012.
Belgian authorities declined to comment on that investigation, but the federal prosecutor's office in Brussels told Reuters this month that it is currently examining Karaziwan's activities. Sources close to that investigation said it relates to the deal to provide passports to Congo, and that it is studying documents retrieved from the laptops and telephones of some individuals involved in the Congo deal.
Meanwhile, Semlex still has hopes for a bigger deal in Congo. The country's budget ministry has approved a government proposal to hand Semlex the contract to register and provide ID cards for Congo's 70 million citizens, according to a December 2015 Congo government letter seen by Reuters. No deal has yet been finalised. But if the contract does go ahead, it could be worth $430 million, the document shows.
As he did with the former leaders of the Comoros, Karaziwan appears to have grown close with the Congo government led by President Kabila, who is refusing to step down, a year after his mandate ended.

Earlier this year Karaziwan turned up at the United Nations again, according to the foreign minister of the Comoros, who saw him there. This time, though, Karaziwan was not with the Comoros team. He was with the delegation from Congo.

In New York, futures closed at their highest in two weeks. Crude stockpiles last week plunged by the most since the height of North America’s summer driving season, a government report showed Wednesday. Meanwhile, Ineos Group’s Forties Pipeline System, which hauls oil from North Sea fields and helps set international prices, has been shut since Dec. 11 after a hairline crack was discovered.
Bullish sentiments linger among traders following the “bigger-than-expected inventory draw,” said Rob Haworth, who helps oversee $150 billion at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. “That’s still on the minds of market participants.”
Oil is set to post a yearly advance following a decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to press on with supply curbs through the end of 2018. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia’s King Salman Bin Abdulaziz agreed on the need to continue cooperating to maintain energy market stability, the Kremlin said in a statement. The Forties shutdown boosted prices up a notch.
Ineos said it’s making preparations to restart the Forties network that snakes across the sea floor and delivers crude to the U.K. mainland. Normal operations probably will resume in early January, the company said.
Brent for February settlement added 34 cents to end the session at $64.90 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $6.54 to WTI.
West Texas Intermediate for February delivery gained 27 cents to settle at $58.36 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 50 percent below the 100-day average.
“We’ve had a nice run up based on the combination of bullish forecasts, crude inventory declines and problems in the North Sea,” Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts, said by telephone. “More likely, we’ll see the pipeline coming back on, so people figure take your profits before year end.”

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for January delivery rose 27 cents to settle at $58.36 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 35 cents to trade at $64.91 a barrel.
Ineos, operator of the Forties pipeline, which had been on outage since Dec. 11, said it expected the pipeline to resume operations in early January.
""Based on current estimates the company expects to bring the pipeline progressively back to normal rates early in the new year,"" Ineos said in a statement.
The shutdown of the Forties pipeline, which carries 40% of North Sea oil and gas, has provided key support for Brent crude prices to steady above two-year highs amid signs that market rebalancing is underway.
The sharp uptick in Brent crude prices, however, has widen the WTI, Brent crude oil spread, encouraging US producers ramp up output and exports to meet growing demand.
The Energy Information Administration figures on Wednesday showed U.S. oil production at 9.79 million barrels a day, while exports reached 1.86 million barrels a day, near record highs.
The uptick in US production last week was offset somewhat by falling crude supplies for a fifth straight week.

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC has started working on plans for an exit strategy from its deal to cut supplies with non-member producers, two OPEC sources said, a sign that an eventual winding down of the deal is coming onto producers' radar, at least in theory.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other non-OPEC producers on Nov. 30 extended an oil output-cutting deal until the end of 2018 to finish clearing a glut. But the market is increasingly interested in how producers will exit the deal once the excess is cleared.
Two OPEC sources said the group's secretariat in Vienna has been tasked to work on a plan with different options and it was too early now to say what the plan would look like.
""It's a continuity strategy, rather than exit,"" one of the OPEC sources said.
Oil prices have rallied this year and are trading near $64 a barrel, close to the highest since 2015, supported by the OPEC-led effort. This is above the $60 floor that sources say OPEC would like to see in 2018.
Publicly, OPEC ministers say it is too early to talk of an exit strategy. But OPEC has said producers want to continue working together beyond the end of 2018, including on supply management.
While oil prices have risen to levels seen as favorable by OPEC, the stated goal of the supply cut is to reduce inventories in developed economies, which built up after a supply glut emerged in 2014, to the level of the five-year average. 
OPEC is making progress and said in October OECD inventories stood 137 million barrels above the five-year average. Since the start of deal in January, the overhang relative to that average is down by 200 million barrels, Kuwait's oil minister said on Wednesday. [OPEC/M]
A discussion on exiting the deal may be needed before December 2018 if, as OPEC expects, the world oil market returns to balance by late 2018. 
OPEC and its allies hold their next full ministerial meeting in June, which will be a opportunity to review progress.

Non-OPEC Russia, which has been the biggest contributor to cuts from outside the group, has been suggesting a review of the deal as early as June. However, its biggest producer Rosneft said this week the cuts could last into 2019.

809,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2017 07:06AM ET</span>",Surge in U.S. shale hedging to boost drilling in 2018,"By Catherine Ngai
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When oil prices rocketed towards $60 a barrel this fall, U.S. shale producers hedged more barrels of oil during the quarter than in at least three years, which could help propel the country to record crude production by next year.
More than 144 million barrels were added to hedges, after global oil markets (LCOc1) rallied by as much as $13 in the quarter. Higher prices help producers lock in profits for future sales.
That should guarantee that total production exceeds 10 million bpd in 2018, which would be an all-time record for U.S. drilling. Traders say growth next year will likely exceed government forecasts, heralding a record year that could pressure prices in the near term. 
For oil traders, hedging data from shale companies serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. 
""After a slow start in the first half of 2017, U.S. oil producers sped up hedging activities for their 2018 production in third quarter amid the rebound in crude oil prices,""  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analysts said in a note last week. 
According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most rushed back into hedging in the three months to Sept. 30. 
In total, 17 companies increased outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by 144 million barrels between the second and third quarter. Another 10 companies decreased their hedging positions by 31 million barrels; three others did not hedge at all.
Together, the companies have nearly one-third more barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 129 million barrels, compared to the previous quarter. 
Reuters compiled the data through information publicly available in quarterly regulatory filings. 
Citigroup analysts said the third-quarter hedge ratio - the percentage of production where shale companies have locked in future sales - for 2018 jumped from 12 percent to 27 percent. For the same period in 2015 and 2016, producers had locked in 15 and 18 percent of the coming year, they said.
Several firms, including  Hess Corp  (N:HES), Newfield Exploration Co (N:NFX) and  Marathon Oil  Corp (N:MRO) loaded up their hedges, and more than doubled volumes last quarter. Together, they added 74 million barrels.
Among the companies that rolled off the most include Anadarko Petroleum Corp (N:APC) and EP Energy (N:EPE). 
All 30 firms contacted by Reuters either did not respond to a request for comment or referred to questions about strategy to recent earnings calls. 
Shale firms are said to have continued adding to hedges in the fourth quarter. Swap dealer gross shorts data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [3067651SSHT], an indicator of producer hedging activity, touched a record in the most recent week. 
Last week, a Texas-based producer was said to have hedged some 30,000 barrels per day (bpd) for 2018 in U.S. crude futures, according to two sources familiar with money flows.
PRODUCTION GROWTH
U.S total oil production is expected to rise by 780,000 bpd to 10.02 million bpd next year, which would be a new annual record, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Traders estimate that growth could be as high as 1.2 million bpd, with at least 500,000 bpd to 600,000 bpd out of Texas's prolific Permian basin alone.
That could complicate an extension by OPEC to curb global supplies through 2018 to keep prices low.
But forecasts for new output may be optimistic, said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group in Houston. 
""People have modeled in the absolute perfection when it comes to drilling. I think we'll see new growth, but there's a lot of evidence that getting new fracking and completion crews is tough,"" he said.
Drilled but uncompleted wells rose for a 12th straight month to a record in November, according to EIA data dating to December 2013. 
Despite greater levels of hedging, and the rise in production, the U.S. crude forward curve remains in backwardation, a market structure where near-term prices are higher than those in the future. 
On Wednesday, WTI for December 2019 was trading around $2.46 a barrel over WTI for December 2018 . That spread, a popular trade, signals the health of the oil market. 

That implies U.S. supply is unlikely to overwhelm global markets, Saucer said.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been promoting free trade as a pillar of his growth strategy. Japan and the EU, which concluded negotiations on the trade pact, hope that it will go into effect early 2019, media reports say.
The Cabinet office estimated that the trade pact would lift Japan's GDP by 5 trillion yen ($44 billion) per year, or about 1 percent, and create an additional 290,000 jobs, according to the estimate by the Cabinet Office. 
However, Japan's farmers would be hit as tariffs on wheat, beef and other food imports will be slashed, intensifying competition with domestic producers. The Cabinet office estimated that domestic farm production would drop by 60 billion to 110 billion.
The deal will remove the EU's 10 percent tariffs on Japanese cars and 3 percent typically applied to car parts.
The agreement will also scrap Japanese duties of 30 percent on EU cheese and 15 percent on wines as well as allowing it to increase its beef and pork exports.
The Cabinet Office also estimated the 11-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership - which requires more works after the United States pulled out of it early this year - would boost Japan's GDP by about 1.5 percent annually, or 8 trillion yen, and create 460,000 jobs.
In November, the countries remaining in the TPP agreed on the core elements to move ahead without the United States but more work need to be done before it is finalised.
The Cabinet Office also showed the TPP 11 would cut Japan's farm production by 90 billion to 150 billion yen. 
In 2015, the government predicted the 12-nation TPP, including the U.S., would increase Japan's GDP by 2.6 percent, or 13.6 trillion yen, and would add 795,000 jobs. It would also lower farm output by as much as 210 billion yen. 
Japan's economy grew an annualized 2.5 percent in the third quarter to mark a seventh straight quarter of expansion thanks to a business spending splurge and buoyant exports.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices were stable on Thursday, supported by falling crude inventories in the United States but capped by output that is fast approaching 10 million barrels per day, a level only surpassed by Saudi Arabia and Russia.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $58.16 a barrel at 0756 GMT, up 7 cents from their last settlement.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1), the international benchmark for oil prices, were up 6 cents at $64.54 a barrel. 
Both crudes gained around 1 percent during their previous sessions, lifted by official data showing a 6.5 million-barrel fall in U.S. crude inventories  in the week to Dec. 15 to 436 million barrels, the lowest level since October, 2015.
Countering this on Thursday was another increase in American crude oil production, while a rise in gasoline stocks pointed to a slowdown in demand. 
""The rally which has defined H2 looks to have run out of steam as the year draws to a close, and we might be hard pressed to say where further upside can come from at this point, barring some unforeseen supply outage,"" JBC Energy said in a note.
The energy minister of Saudi Arabia, the world's top crude exporter and OPEC's de-facto leader, said it would take more time to rein in a global supply overhang, which was created by strong global production increases in the years up to 2015. 
""We expect the first few months of 2018 to be either flat or a build (in inventories), as it is typically the case with the seasonality in the oil market,"" Khalid al-Falih told Reuters on Wednesday. 
U.S. oil output is close to breaking through 10 million bpd, undermining efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to tighten the market through withholding supply this year and next. 
U.S. crude production  hit 9.79 million bpd last week, its highest since the early 1970s, the only time American output breached 10 million bpd. 
This brings U.S. output close to that of top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia, which pump around 10 million and 11 million bpd, respectively. 
JBC Energy said ""U.S. crude exports are starting to increase"".
Oil traders this week also eyed with interest the passing of a U.S. tax bill, which is seen weighing on crude prices in the longer term. 
""The passage of the U.S. tax bill is ... a bearish long-term development for oil and gas markets,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) bank said.

""The policies ... are likely to reduce demand for gas and oil and raise supplies ... (as) the tax bill preserves renewable energy tax credits, a tax credit for EVs (electric vehicles), and opens up drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude prices rose on Wednesday, supported by a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. inventories and the continued outage of the North Sea Forties pipeline system.
U.S. crude stocks fell by 6.5 million barrels, more than expected, in the week to Dec. 15, while gasoline stocks rose 1.2 million barrels, less than anticipated, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, even though refining activity rose.
West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled up 53 cents at $58.09 a barrel, while Brent crude ended up 76 cents at $64.56 a barrel.
Crude stocks, excluding the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, are at 436.5 million barrels, the lowest since October 2015. 
Inventories have been steadily declining in the United States due to strong export demand and efforts by major oil producers to restrict supply. 
Refiners in the United States continue to run at above-average rates than is typical for this time of year, which is offsetting strong U.S. production, and resulting in product that is ready for export or domestic use.
For the most recent week, refiner capacity utilization rose to 94.1 percent, the highest since the summer, and above average for December, notes Richard Hastings, macro strategist at Seaport Global Securities in Charlotte.
""Crude oil stocks are getting gobbled up and that is preventing a buildup from U.S. oil production,"" he said. ""It's a stable story where the floor for crude prices is looking very firm."" 
OPEC and 10 other producers led by Russia last month extended an agreement to cut oil production by 1.8 million bpd until the end of next year to eliminate an oil glut. 
Some producers, including Russia, had raised concerns over whether the deal should continue through the end of 2018. On Wednesday, Saudi Arabian energy minister Khalid al-Falih said it would be premature to discuss changes to OPEC's policy. He said the drawdown of inventories would likely take through the second half of 2018.
On Wednesday, Kuwait's oil minister Bakhit al-Rashidi said compliance among both OPEC and non-OPEC members currently stands at 122 percent, highest since the deal was implemented in January.
Rising U.S. crude production, which has soared by 16 percent since mid-2016 to 9.8 million bpd, was capping prices. The all-time U.S. production record of more than 10 million bpd was set in the early 1970s and is based on monthly EIA figures. 
Most analysts expect U.S. output to break that record soon, and take it to levels on a par with top exporter Saudi Arabia and close to top producer Russia, which pumps around 11 million bpd.
Prices have been supported by the continuing outage of Britain's Forties pipeline in the North Sea, which delivers crude underpinning Brent futures. 

Operator Ineos said repairs were under way on Wednesday after a crack was found that closed the pipeline on Dec. 11. Repairs are expected to take two to four weeks.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for January delivery rose 0.89% to settle at $58.09 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent rose 1.02% to trade at $65.45 a barrel.
Crude oil prices notched their biggest gain of the week so far following an Energy Information Agency (EIA) inventory report showing crude stockpiles fell more-than-estimated while the build in gasoline inventories eased.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 6.5 million barrels for the week ended Dec. 15, beating expectations  of a draw of 3.8 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – rose by 1.2 million barrels, below expectations for rise of 1.9 million barrels, while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil –  fell by 769,000 barrels, confounding expectations for a fall of 870,000 barrels.
Upward momentum in crude prices, however, was capped somewhat by rising US production as domestic producers seek to capitalise on an increase in demand for crude over Brent oil amid the widened spread between the two measures.
The EIA figures on Wednesday showed U.S. oil production jumped to 9.79 million barrels a day, while exports rose 1.86 million barrels a day, near record highs.
Brent prices have been largely supported by the shutdown of the Forties pipeline, which carries 40% of North Sea crude oil, and is expected to remain out of operation for weeks. Ineos, operator of the Forties pipeline, said Tuesday that the timeframe for the fix remained two to four weeks starting from Dec. 11, the date of the shutdown."

American crude inventories tumbled by 6.5 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. That was more than double the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Exports surged by the most on record as West Texas Intermediate crude trades at an attractive discount to the global Brent benchmark.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) has asked its main regulator if it may buy platinum and lease it to a client in a test of a new rule meant to limit banks' exposure to volatile commodity markets, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) introduced the rule early this year to ensure that banks entrusted with customer deposits do not bet on price swings of metals.
Wells Fargo would do the deal on behalf of an energy company and charge a fee for the service, said three people familiar with the request who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.
A green light could help Wells Fargo grow a business catering to industrial clients even as the bank grapples with several scandals in its retail division.
Like other large lenders, the San Francisco-based company may already perform metal trades through a non-bank affiliate that does not rely on federally-backed deposits. The U.S. Federal Reserve oversees those entities.
Wells Fargo said such business already exists. ""Metals leasing is a common and effective financing approach for many companies that use precious metals in their products,"" said a company spokesman. 
However, Wells Fargo has asked whether some of that business could reside in the banking division, sources said. Doing so could be less costly because it is able to tap cheaper financing than the non-bank unit, and therefore may allow Wells to offer more competitive terms for clients.
Wells Fargo declined to comment about its request to the OCC.
The OCC rule strictly prohibits banks from speculating in metals markets but does allow banks to accept metals as collateral for ordinary loans. The OCC has said it would review loans on a case-by-case basis.
The regulator left room for exceptions and its guidance in this case could be an indication of how it plans to enforce the rule under its new chief, Joseph Otting.
The OCC is now reviewing Wells Fargo's request, the sources said.
Wells is a small player in physical commodities trading, and in precious metals in particular banks such as  HSBC Holdings  PLC (L:HSBA), UBS Group AG (S:UBSG), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of Nova Scotia (TO:BNS) have much greater presence.
However, Wells is trying to grow its services to corporations and financial institutions - known as 'wholesale banking' - to compete with rivals, such as JPMorgan,  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC).
Wells earned $6.5 billion from the wholesale banking business in the first three quarters of the year, up 8.4 percent from the same period in 2016. It represented 41 percent of its total net income.
As Wells Fargo awaits the regulator's response, it is also facing more scrutiny related to the long-running sales scandal, primarily in its consumer bank.
The bank reached a $190 million settlement with the OCC and other agencies in September 2016 after revelations that thousands of employees have opened phony accounts in customers' names without their permission. As many 3.5 million accounts may have been affected.
Since then, Wells has found troubles in other businesses including auto lending and mortgages, which the OCC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are examining for more possible penalties.
The transaction Wells inquired about involves buying platinum from a supplier and leasing it to a refiner that can use it to turn crude oil into high quality fuel, people familiar with the deal said. At the end of a refining process, the platinum is recovered and can be returned.
The bank could try to offset its exposure to platinum price swings while the metal is on its books through financial contracts that act as insurance, the sources said. There is no guarantee those hedges would be effective.
Elise Bean, a former Congressional investigator, said banks face enough risk lending to the commodity industry without adding actual commodities to their balance sheets.
""There is no reason for a bank to take on commodity price risk when they do this stuff,"" said Bean, who was chief counsel to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2017 05:44AM ET</span>",Offshore oil searches are coming back to fashion - just not in Asia,"By Henning Gloystein and Gavin Maguire
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Surveying the ocean floor for oil and natural gas reserves is gradually emerging from a multi-year slump, everywhere apart from Asia.
That's despite Asia being the world's biggest consumer of oil, having by far the strongest demand growth while seeing its production fall faster than anywhere else. 
The reasons for Asia's dearth in offshore exploration and production (E&P) include high costs in Australia's promising waters, declining reserves in production hotspots Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as territorial disputes in the oil- and gas-rich waters of the South China Sea. 
""We only have two 3D vessels in Asia-Pacific, since there are fewer opportunities and less activity in that region,"" said Bard Stenberg, vice president at Norwegian offshore survey company PGS (OL:PGS), adding that most of his company's vessels were in the Atlantic.
MISSING OUT
A 2017 and 2018 activity map by geophysical surveillance firm TGS (OL:TGS) shows the most activity in the North Atlantic.
A similar map by Bernstein Research showed the Asia-Pacific basin to have only four minor offshore developments of under 50,000 barrels per day (bpd). That compares to five major developments (above 50,000 bpd) and 11 minor ones in the Atlantic.
Asia's dearth comes despite the region's huge oil deficit, resulting from booming demand and declining output.
GRAPHIC: http://reut.rs/2AV1T8z
GRAPHIC: http://reut.rs/2AZUll2
GRAPHIC: http://reut.rs/2BI1bil
In one of the most promising regions, Australia, the main problem is cost, in part due to a requirement for rigs to pay for Australian crew once in Australian waters.
""Once any foreign-flagged vessel is in Australian waters, the ship operator has to pick up Australian workers... They work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week for 4 weeks, then get 4 weeks off,"" said Christy Cain of the Maritime Union of Australia.
When oil prices were high, this was not a big problem, drillers said. But in times of cheaper oil and low profit margins, the added cost deters explorers, several said.
In another promising area, the South China Sea, conflicting territorial claims, especially between China and Vietnam, have hindered E&P activity.
Meanwhile, in Asia's most established offshore oil and gas production basins of Malaysia and Indonesia, recoverable reserves are depleting.
Malaysia's state-owned Petronas, Southeast Asia's biggest oil producer, is increasingly focusing on downstream projects like the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in the southern state of Johor.
From 2019, PIC will refine crude oil into fuel and petrochemical products. Significant amounts of its crude will come from Saudi Arabia.
With little E&P activity, Asia's oil import bill - which has already more than doubled since 2000 to over $420 billion a year - will rise further, likely above $500 billion in 2017, leaving other regions to cash in on Asia's oil thirst.
COUNTING HELICOPTERS
Gauging the health of the secretive offshore industry is difficult. But dozens of mothballed rigs and support vessels sit idle in southern Malaysia's Johor river delta, waiting to be used or scrapped.
Yet cautious optimism is emerging.
""Activity to support new development projects may increase slightly (between 2018 and 2020), but is unlikely to approach historical high levels (2013/14),"" Petronas said in an outlook this month.
Douglas Westwood, which monitors helicopter activity to and from offshore vessels, has a similar view.
""The offshore helicopter market has finally started to recover following three years of decline,"" Westwood said, although it added that average annual growth between 2018 and 2022 will still only be 1 percent.
""Global utilization will average 59 percent over the forecast,"" it said, up from a paltry 54 percent in 2017.
At the root of the industry malaise lies rampant overproduction in the years running up to 2014, which crashed crude prices (LCOc1) from over $100 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 in 2016.
E&P companies were among the first to feel the bite of aggressive industry cost slashing.
Firms in the seismic oil surveillance sector, including Polarcus (OL:PLCS), PGS, and Electromagnetic Geoservices (OL:EMGS) have seen their share prices crash since 2015, in some cases by over 90 percent.
Only a production cut led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has stabilized Brent above $50 a barrel since mid-2017.
With oil demand healthy, the offshore industry hopes companies will start spending on future output again.
""We're hoping that it's going to pick up next year,"" said Cain of the Maritime Union of Australia.
In a sign that even in Asia-Pacific there may be some more activity, the geothermal surveillance ship Polarcus Naila left Singapore in early December for a seismic mission in the Bonaparte Basin, off Australia's northwest coast.

Speaking to Reuters during a visit to Singapore by the ship, one of the Naila's senior crew members said he hoped things would go from ""worst to bad.""

824,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2017 06:10PM ET</span>","Trump security plan boosts case for steel, aluminum curbs: official","By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's new security strategy bolsters the case for trade actions to protect U.S. economic interests on national security grounds, including possible import tariffs on steel and aluminum, a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday.
The strategy document released on Monday did not specifically mention the Commerce Department's ""Section 232"" investigations into whether rising steel and aluminum imports represent a threat to national security. With recommendations due in January, the probes could lead to broad tariffs or import quotas under a Cold War-era trade law.
The official said the document made clear that Trump considered economic strength to be an integral part of national security and ""formalizes"" the link between the two. 
The 232 probes on steel and aluminum ""are being discussed in the context of national security. The strategy highlights the importance of industrial strength, and that is also an element of the 232 analysis,"" the official said.
The official said other trade-related actions that fit with the strategy document included a ""Section 301"" investigation into China's intellectual property practices that also could lead to further China-focused trade enforcement cases similar to the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probe into Chinese-made aluminum sheet products recently initiated by the U.S. government.
""I think there will be enforcement actions by the U.S. that are related to the non-market challenge from China,"" the official said. ""The strategy recognizes that China is a rival and that puts into context that we need to take steps to protect American interests and American workers.""
The strategy document lumped together China and Russia as competitors seeking to challenge U.S. power and erode the country's security and prosperity.
Despite meetings between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping that showcased a warm personal relationship between them, trade relations between Washington and Beijing have cooled following economic dialogue talks in July that failed to produce any steps to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China.
The U.S. Treasury's top economic diplomat, Undersecretary for International Affairs David Malpass, told the Financial Times last month there were no plans to resume the dialogue talks with Beijing.
The United States also recently joined the European Union in opposing China's demands that the World Trade Organization recognize it as a ""market economy"" - a move that would severely weaken Western trade defenses against a flood of cheap Chinese goods.
In a thinly veiled warning to China, the Trump security document said: ""The United States will engage industrialized democracies and other like-minded states to defend against economic aggression, in all its forms, that threatens our common prosperity and security.""

Reacting to the document, China said Washington should accept its development and urged more cooperation, adding that confrontation would bring mutual losses. The Kremlin dismissed the document as ""imperialist.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil edged up towards $64 a barrel on Tuesday, helped by a North Sea pipeline outage, OPEC-led supply cuts and expectations that U.S. crude inventories had fallen for a fifth week.
But rising U.S. output has put a lid on gains. Shale production will rise to a record in January, according to a government forecast published on Monday, as higher prices encourage increased drilling.
Brent crude (LCOc1), the global benchmark, was up 13 cents or 0.2 percent to $63.54 a barrel at 11:45 a.m. (1645 GMT) U.S. crude (CLc1) gained 25 cents or 0.4 percent to $57.41.
The shutdown of the North Sea's Forties pipeline since last week has supported Brent, as Forties is the largest of the five crude grades underpinning the benchmark. On Dec. 12, Brent reached $65.83, its highest since mid-2015.
""You've had a little surge because the pipeline is still plaguing the North Sea,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, ""It's enough to sway some market sentiment but a lot of it is already priced in.""
Ineos, the operator of the Forties pipeline, said on Tuesday it was moving forward with a preferred repair option and the timeframe for the fix remained two to four weeks starting from Dec. 11, the date of the shutdown.
Oil ticked up after reports that a missile was fired at the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh from Yemen, but Saudi Arabia said it intercepted the missile and no casualties were reported.
Prices have also drawn support from a deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-member producers including Russia to cut crude output to curb a global glut. 
OPEC and its allies have extended the agreement until the end of 2018 and Russia's Rosneft (MM:ROSN) said on Monday it could be maintained beyond next year.
The cuts have trimmed global oil inventories, and the latest weekly supply reports are expected to show a further reduction.
U.S. crude oil inventories were forecast to have fallen for a fifth straight week along with a probable fall in distillate stocks last week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday.
The first of these reports, from the American Petroleum Institute, is due at 4:30 p.m. EST on Tuesday. [EIA/S]
Still, rising U.S. production is countering lower supply elsewhere. U.S. shale output in January is forecast to increase by 94,000 barrels per day to 6.41 million bpd, according to the EIA's monthly drilling productivity report published Monday.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude January contract was up 17 cents or about 0.30% at $57.38 a barrel by 09:50 a.m. ET (13:50 GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for February delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up 12 cents or about 0.19% at $63.52 a barrel.

But gains were limited after a government forecast published on Monday warned that shale production will rise to a record in January.
Fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies have been recently weighing on sentiment, according to market participants.
The producer group, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed last week to extend current oil output cuts for a further nine months until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday the first phase of its long-awaited nationwide carbon emission trading scheme (ETS) will focus on the power sector, as the government outlined details of what is expected to be the world's largest such program. 
The State Council approved the scheme last week and the National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC) outlined some details of how it will be implemented, marking its launch, NDRC vice chairman Zhang Yong said at a briefing. 
Trading will be based in Shanghai, involving 1,700 power companies and over 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, he said. 
He did not give a timeline for the start of trading or how permits will be allocated, but experts and analysts say it will take at least a year to put in place mechanisms.
That volume, accounting for a third of China's total carbon emissions, means the scheme will eclipse the European Union's, the world's largest, which is expected to cover about 1.4 billion tonnes of emissions this year.
Launching the scheme is a major step in the world's No. 2 economy's efforts to meet commitments to combat global warming.
China, the world's largest source of greenhouse gases, is aiming to raise the share of non-fossil fuels to 20 percent of its total energy mix by 2020 from 13 percent in 2016. As part of the Paris Agreement in December 2015 it pledged to cap carbon emissions at a peak by around 2030.
""The ETS will push industrial plants to eliminate outdated capacity and improve their production,"" said Jiang Zhaoli, vice director at the climate change department of the NDRC.
Nine regions and cities, including Jiangsu, Fujian and seven regions where pilot schemes have taken place, will coordinate to establish the ETS system, the NDRC said.
Details of the plan come a day after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration laid out a new national security strategy plan that removed a description of climate change as a U.S. national security threat.
Trump has vowed to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord unless changes are made to it.
'TIPPING POINT'
The news was welcomed by supporters of clean energy.
""With the top global polluter enacting policies to support the Paris Agreement and transition to a low carbon economy, it is clear that we're at a tipping point in the climate crisis,"" said former U.S. Vice President Al Gore.
Under original plans, eight sectors including iron and steel, chemicals and paper-making will eventually be included in the scheme.
The market-oriented ETS will help companies abate emissions and reduce carbon-intensified assets through the controlled allocation and trading of carbon emission allowances. 
""It is important that the world's largest emitter should lead on climate ... China has stepped up its climate leadership dramatically in recent years and is now increasingly seen as filling the leadership void left by the U.S.,"" said Fred Krupp, president at the U.S. Environmental Defense Fund.
China is not considering linking its ETS with other countries at this stage, said NDRC director Li Gao, adding it will also take time to have a national carbon price.

First mooted in 2016, the launch of carbon trading in China ran into delays as market designers struggled to handle problems like accuracy of emissions data.

Le Drian was in the American capital on Monday to meet U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster and U.S. President Donald Trump's special adviser Jared Kushner. 
Tensions between Iran and France have risen in recent months with both sides repeatedly trading barbs in public, including le Drian accusing Iran of ""hegemonic temptations"" in the region.
Iran on Sunday criticized President Emmanuel Macron over his tough stance toward Tehran and said Paris would soon lose its international credibility if it ""blindly follows"" U.S. President Donald Trump.
""They didn't like the word, but I stand by it,"" le Drian told reporters. ""Iran's hegemonic temptations in the region is a matter of urgency because it's within the framework of getting peace in Iraq and Syria that we will stop this process.""
Iranian officials have been particularly aggrieved by France's criticism of its ballistic missile tests and suggestions of possible new sanctions over the program, which Tehran calls solely defensive in nature.
Le Drian, who is due in Iran at the beginning of January, said he would tell them clearly of Paris' concerns. 
""We are fully determined to press very vigorously on Iran to stop the development of an increasingly significant ballistic capability"","" Le Drian said, reiterating that sanctions were possible.
Macron, unlike Trump, has reaffirmed his country's commitment to the deal Iran signed in 2015 with world powers under which it curbed its disputed nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of most international sanctions.

After talks with the U.S. officials, Le Drian said he believed that Washington was beginning to understand European messages on the need to maintain the accord.

""The nuclear deal will not collapse... Those who hope that Trump will cause its collapse, are wrong,"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on State TV. 
In October, Trump declined to certify that Iran was complying with the nuclear agreement reached among Tehran, the United States and other powers in 2015. His decision triggered a 60-day window for Congress to decide whether to bring back sanctions on Iran.
Congress passed the ball back to Trump by letting the deadline on reimposing sanctions on Iran pass last week. Trump must decide in mid-January if he wants to continue to waive energy sanctions on Iran.
Under the deal, nuclear-related sanctions imposed on Iran were lifted last year, in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.
Iran has said it will stick to the accord as long as the other signatories respect it, but will “shred” the deal if Washington pulls out.

Futures slipped 0.2 percent in New York, erasing gains from earlier in the session. Managerial workers in Africa’s second-largest crude-producing nation halted their strike and agreed to reopen talks next month. Meanwhile, the owner of the Forties Pipelines System in the North Sea, which helps set international oil prices, said repairs to a crack that halted shipments a week ago were on track.

A hairline crack which prompted Ineos Group to shut its Forties system on Dec. 11 “has not propagated,” the company said in an email. Repairs are expected to be complete within weeks.

I would tend to think there will be a slow unwinding of these positions in anticipation” of the line restarting soon.
Oil in New York is poised for about a 6 percent gain this year as production limits by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major suppliers erode a worldwide glut. The effort to curb excess output could be dashed by U.S. shale drillers, who are forecast to lift American oil production to a record next year.

Futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange surged 5.5 percent, the most in a month, while the most active SGX AsiaClear contract climbed 4.5 percent to a three-month high of $72.35 a metric ton in Singapore. The benchmark price for spot ore with 62 percent content delivered to Qingdao increased 3.7 percent to $74.15 a dry ton, the highest since September, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd.
The commodity has rebounded since the start of November. While China’s bid to curb pollution by cutting steel supply this winter is hurting overall consumption of ore, it’s supporting demand for higher-quality material because the variety is more efficient to use. Demand for ore could also expand next year as rising profits encourage steel mills to increase production and furnaces in the top supplier ramp up after the end of winter curbs. 
“Tighter supply of some material has bolstered prices in the short term,” Chinese brokerage Shanghai Cifco Futures Co. said in a note on Monday. “As traders’ bids to purchase the raw material have remained steady, some suppliers are seeing more bargaining power.”
Miners’ shares benefited from the rally. Top producer Vale SA was up as much as 2.4 percent in Sao Paulo after  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group’s stock rose 1.2 percent in Sydney and BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd. climbed 2 percent. Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., which tends to produce lower-quality ore, added 0.8 percent.

Thirty million was linked to steelmaker Ilva in a case in which Milan prosecutors had sought legal assistance while they probed the Riva family and others for embezzlement and other property offences, the Federal Office of Justice (FOJ) said.
The FOJ supported Italy in the probe by providing evidence and blocking assets in the Italian-speaking southern canton of Ticino. It transferred the frozen money last month based on a judicial confiscation order from Italy.
Other funds worth more than 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.01 billion) allegedly looted from Ilva had been frozen in the canton of Zurich, but Italy dropped a request for legal assistance blocking the money, allowing it to be returned to Italy in May for use in a settlement struck a year ago between the Riva family, Ilva, and others, the FOJ said.
Ilva was placed under court administration in 2013 after magistrates seized 8.1 billion euros of assets belonging to its former owners, the Riva family, amid allegations that toxic emissions were causing abnormally high rates of cancer.
An administrators' statement about the settlement in December 2016 said it was expected that Ilva would waive all claims against the Riva family, putting an end to the dispute. 
The other repatriation case centered on 10 million euros in assets frozen during the Italian investigation of accounting fraud, embezzlement and other offences linked to food group Parmalat. That money was sent back this month, the FOJ said.
More than 10 million euros in assets remain frozen in that case and might also be returned, it added.
Parmalat collapsed at the end of 2003 with a 14 billion euro hole in its accounts, following a scandal that forced management to seek bankruptcy protection and triggered a criminal fraud probe. A streamlined version of the dairy group relisted in 2005.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude January contract was up 5 cents or about 0.09% at $57.38 a barrel by 09:50 a.m. ET (13:50 GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for February delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up 17 cents or about 0.27% at $63.40 a barrel.
Ongoing supply disruptions from the Forties pipeline in the North Sea continued to lend support to the commodity.
In addition, a strike by Nigerian oil workers also sparked concerns over exports from Africa's largest crude producer.
Prices received an additional boost after energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday that U.S. energy companies cut rigs drilling for new production for the first time in six weeks, to 747, in the week ended December 15.
Fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies have been recently weighing on sentiment, according to market participants.
The producer group, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed last week to extend current oil output cuts for a further nine months until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.

Here's What Big Banks Say,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil is on course for a second annual gain after last month’s decision by OPEC and its allies to extend production curbs in a bid to shrink bloated inventories. While some banks raised their 2018 crude price forecasts, others were less bullish.
Among the most bullish is Goldman Sachs, which boosted its outlook for Brent crude by almost 7 percent to $62 a barrel, citing stronger-than-expected commitment from OPEC and partners. That compares with an average price of about $54 a barrel this year. Another bull, JPMorgan, says “solid fundamentals and tightening balances,” as well as OPEC’s willingness to balance markets, are reasons for its positive outlook.
On the other end of the spectrum is Citigroup, which says there’s a risk the current bullish supply and demand dynamic will run out of steam, and an upsurge in U.S. shale production could spook the market. For Barclays, crude’s rally will encourage the U.S. and other non-OPEC producers to boost output in 2018, helping tip the scales toward a gain in inventories once again.
Brent, the benchmark for more than half the world’s oil, is up about 12 percent higher this year after surging 52 percent last year. It traded at $63.65 a barrel at 3:52 p.m. Singapore time. Here are more details on the banks’ outlook for 2018:

845,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 03:34AM ET</span>","Oil prices rise on ongoing North Sea outage, Nigeria strike","By Henning Gloystein
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday amid an ongoing North Sea pipeline outage and because a strike by Nigerian oil workers threatened its crude exports.
Signs that booming U.S. crude output growth may be slowing also supported crude prices, although the 2018 outlook still points to ample supply despite production cuts led by OPEC.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1), the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $63.72 a barrel at 0821 GMT, up 49 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $57.70 a barrel, up 40 cents, or 0.7 percent.
The higher prices came on the back of a strike by Nigerian oil workers and the ongoing North Sea Forties pipeline system outage, which provides crude that underpins the Brent benchmark. 
North Sea operator Ineos declared force majeure on all oil and gas shipments through its Forties pipeline system last week after cracks were found.
""The force majeure ... is acting as a major prop for crude,"" said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of energy consultancy Trifecta.
In Nigeria, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, whose members mainly work in the upstream oil industry, started industrial action on Monday after talks with government agencies ended in deadlock, potentially hitting the country's production and exports. 
""Oil prices are getting a bounce... as the Nigerian oil union talks have hit an impasse and will begin strike action,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA.
In the United States, energy companies cut rigs drilling for new production for the first time in six weeks, to 747, in the week ended Dec. 15, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.
Despite the dip in drilling, activity is still well above this time last year, when the rig count was below 500, and actual U.S. production  has soared by 16 percent since mid-2016 to 9.8 million barrels per day (bpd).
This means U.S. output is fast approaching that of top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia, which are pumping 10 million bpd and 11 million bpd respectively.
The rising U.S. output also undermines efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which is de facto led by Saudi Arabia, and a group of non-OPEC producers including Russia to withhold production to tighten the market and prop up prices.
Largely because of rising shale output from the United States, the International Energy Agency said global oil markets would show a slight supply surplus of around 200,000 bpd during the first half of 2018.

Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a similar surplus for that period and still indicates a supply overhang of 167,000 bpd for all of 2018.

846,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 03:10AM ET</span>",Growth in global coal demand subdued over next five years: IEA,"By Nina Chestney
LONDON (Reuters) - Global coal demand will be subdued over the next five years, growing at just 0.5 percent a year, marginally higher than current levels, due to lower consumption in China, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Monday.
Coal consumption fell last year by 1.9 percent to 5.357 billion tonnes from a year earlier as lower gas prices, a surge in renewables and efficiency improvements dampened demand, the IEA said in its annual coal market report.
Global coal demand is expected to rise by an average rate of 0.5 percent a year to 5.534 billion tonnes by 2022, ""only marginally higher than current levels and meaning that coal use all but stagnates for around a decade,"" the agency said.
Coal use will decline in Europe, Canada, the United States and China - the world's largest coal consumer - but rise in southeast Asia, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. 
Over the period to 2022, India's consumption is seen growing the most at 3.3 percent a year to 605 million tonnes.
Having peaked in 2013, China's consumption is expected to decline by 0.1 percent a year to 2.787 billion tonnes in 2022 as coal use in the industrial and residential sectors falls due to efforts to improve air quality.
U.S. coal consumption will increase slightly next year then decline to 469 million tonnes by 2022, while EU consumption is expected to fall to 293 million tonnes by 2022.
On the supply side, total global coal supply is expected to increase by 0.8 percent a year to 5.534 billion tonnes in 2020, mainly driven by non-OECD countries.
Coal's share in the global energy mix is forecast to decline to 26 percent in 2022, compared to 27 percent in 2016, the report said.
After years of decline, coal prices continued to strengthen this year, driven by a sharp cut in Chinese coal output coupled with strong demand across the Asia-Pacific region and in Europe.
European API2 2018 coal futures  are currently trading around $90 a tonne due to higher demand in China and supply issues.
Despite high prices in 2016-17, coal project development has been slow. Sluggish demand and uncertain prospects for China and India as well as Korea and Japan have put a brake on investment, the IEA said.
As not much supply has been added over the past year, that in turn has led to price increases.
""Prices will continue to depend largely on China; as a consequence, the structural reform of the Chinese coal industry is key to the evolution in coal prices,"" the report said.

848,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>","Canada oil producers exhaust options as pipelines, railroads fill","By Nia Williams and Catherine Ngai
CALGARY, Alberta/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Canadian oil producers are running out of options to get crude to market as pipeline and rail capacity fills up, driving prices to four-year lows and increasing the risk of firms having to sell cheaply until at least late 2019.
This will drive down the profit margins for the oil sands industry, already struggling to compete with cheaper and abundant supplies from U.S. shale. A number of foreign oil majors have left Canada's oil sands to invest in more profitable U.S. shale plays, selling over $23 billion in Canadian assets this year alone.
Canada's oil sands output is still growing - but only as projects under construction are completed and smaller expansions come online. Oil firms are not commissioning large new projects because they cannot build them profitably with oil in the $50s a barrel.
The deeper discount on crude means next year could be just as tough for Canadian producers from a price perspective as 2017, even though international crude prices have strengthened.
""We have a build-up of supply and that's only going to get worse next year. We are adding more and more pressure into a constrained export system,"" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Mark Oberstoetter.
The volume of crude in storage has hit record levels in western Canada and heavy crude is trading near its widest discount to U.S. crude (CLc1) since December 2013, driven by increased supply and a leak on TransCanada Corp's (TO:TRP) Keystone export pipeline last month.
The discount on Canadian heavy crude blew out to as much as $28 a barrel below the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, pushing the outright price of Canadian barrels to less than $30.
Many traders and analysts expect the discount to be wider in 2018 than the negative $12 a barrel year-to-date average as oil supply rises.
Canada's oil sands output is forecast to climb by 315,000 barrels per day next year and 180,000 bpd in 2019 to 3.2 million bpd, according to RBC Capital Markets, which described the growth as ""unprecedented"" and said exports will materially exceed pipeline capacity in early 2018.
RBC downgraded its Western Canada Select discount by $3.50 in both 2018 and 2019 to $15.50 and $17.50 a barrel respectively.
WCS for 2018 is being priced at $20.45 per barrel below WTI, according to Shorcan Energy brokers.
""AT THE MERCY OF RAIL""
Producers in Alberta are clamoring to get their barrels to market via rail, but railroad companies are reluctant to invest in expanding capacity because of concern that demand for their services is short-term.
Rail firms lost money in the past when they invested in expanding capacity only to see demand from the industry fall when prices collapsed in 2014 or when new pipelines started operation.
Export pipelines are already running close to their limit and proposed new projects such as TransCanada's Keystone XL and  Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI) Canada's (TO:KML) Trans Mountain expansion have been beset by regulatory delays and fierce environmental opposition. No new export pipelines are expected to be built before late 2019 at the earliest when  Enbridge  Inc (TO:ENB) expects to finish its Line 3 replacement project.
""Canadian producers are now at the mercy of rail given that current pipes are near capacity and production continues to grow as legacy oil sands projects ramp up,"" said Michael Tran, director of energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets. 
""This pricing underscores how fragile the Canadian energy industry is due to lack of pipeline takeaway capacity.""
RELUCTANT RAILROADERS
Some of the largest oil sands producers such as Suncor and Imperial Oil (TO:IMO) own refineries, which help offset low crude prices with higher refining margins. Smaller producers including MEG Energy (TO:MEG) and Pengrowth Energy (TO:PGF) have taken out financial hedges to limit their exposure to widening WCS differentials.
 Cenovus Energy  (TO:CVE) owns the 77,000 bpd Bruderheim rail terminal near Edmonton, Alberta, and leases its own rail cars to make sure it has multiple options to ship crude.
""Having our own crude-by-rail loading facility also decreases the risk of having to compete for potentially expensive capacity during periods of pipeline constraint,"" said spokesman Reg Curren.
 Canadian Pacific Railway  (TO:CP) is asking shippers to lock into minimum one-year commitments to haul barrels, two industry sources said.
The sources added rail companies are either reluctant or showed no interest in monthly, spot deliveries.
A CP spokesman did not respond to requests for comment on contracts.
Traders and producers are wary of committing to long-term rail contracts, which are more expensive than pipeline. It costs around $10-$12 a barrel to ship Canadian crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast, two sources said, versus around $8 by pipe.
CP chief executive Keith Creel told an investors conference in November the company went through a ""very painful divorce"" with crude-by-rail after a previous fall in oil prices and he would not be making 30-year investment decisions based on two or three years of demand.
The country's other major railroad Canadian National Railway Co (TO:CNR) has told shippers it will not offer more rail capacity for oil until the second quarter of 2018, three sources said.
Canadian National is currently focused on moving grain for export, said spokesman Patrick Waldron.
John Zahary, CEO, of Altex Energy, which owns five rail terminals in Canada, said activity has doubled in the company yards in the past six months.

""Our phone is ringing off the hook,"" he said.

Meanwhile, February Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., dipped 8 cents, or roughly 0.1%, to settle at $63.23 a barrel by close of trade. For the week, Brent suffered a loss of about 0.3%.
Both WTI and Brent logged a third-straight week of declines amid concerns that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
U.S. crude oil production rose by 73,000 barrels per day (bpd) last week, according to government data. Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 16% since the most recent low in mid-2016 to a total of 9.78 million bpd, bringing output close to levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
The number of oil drilling rigs fell by four to 747 in the week to Dec. 15, data from  General Electric  (NYSE:NYSE:GE)'s Baker Hughes energy services unit showed, the first cut to drilling numbers in six weeks.

Tensions between Iran and France have risen in recent months after Macron said Tehran should be less aggressive in the Middle East, citing in particular its involvement in Syria's civil war.
Macron, unlike Trump, has reaffirmed his country's commitment to the deal Iran signed in 2015 with world powers under which it curbed its disputed nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of most international sanctions.
However, he has been critical of Iran's ballistic missile tests and wants to raise the possibility of new sanctions over the program, which Tehran calls solely defensive in nature.
""To sustain its international credibility, France should not blindly follow the Americans ... The French president is now acting as Trump's lapdog,"" Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency.
Velayati also criticized U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who last week presented pieces of what she said were parts of an Iranian missile supplied to the Tehran-aligned Houthi militia in Yemen. She described the objects as conclusive evidence that Tehran was violating U.N. resolutions.
""This claim shows she lacks basic scientific knowledge and decency. She is like her boss (Trump) as he also says baseless, ridiculous things. Iran has not supplied Yemen with any missile,"" Velayati said.
""FINGERPRINTS""?
Tasnim news agency quoted the spokesman for Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, Ramezan Sharif, as saying on Sunday that ""they show a cylinder and say Iran's fingerprints are all over it, while everyone knows that Yemen acquired some missile capabilities from the Soviet Union and North Korea in the past"".
France took a cautious stance on Haley's report. ""The United Nations secretariat has not, at this stage, drawn any conclusions. France continues to examine the information at its disposal,"" Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Alexandre Giorgini said on Friday.
Saudi Arabia, who has long accused Iran of smuggling missiles to the Houthis and has intervened against them in Yemen's war to try to restore its internationally recognized government, welcomed Haley's report.
Iran has one of the Middle East’s biggest missile programs and some of its precision-guided missiles have the range to strike its arch-regional enemy Israel.
Israel has also called for world powers to take punitive steps against Iran over its missile ambitions.
An Israeli cabinet minister said last month that Israel has had covert contacts with Saudi Arabia amid common concerns over Iran.
Velayati said on Sunday that reported meetings between Saudi and Israeli officials were no threat to Iran as both countries were ""weak and insignificant.""

Last month, the Revolutionary Guards warned Europe that if it threatens Tehran, the Guards will increase the range of missiles to above 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles).

State-controlled media on Sunday ran a photograph of Castro and Igor Sechin sitting with notebooks at a table with Economy Minister Ricardo Cabrisas, after the latter two had held what was termed in a brief caption ""a working meeting"".
Castro usually appears with visitors only in protocol photographs. There was no further information.
Castro and Sechin have known each other for decades.
Cuba struggled with blackouts and fuel shortages after the fall of its benefactor, the Soviet Union. The rise of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's late president, ended that crisis at the turn of the century, and Cuba came to rely on Venezuela for about 70 percent of its fuel needs.
But socialist Venezuela’s subsidized shipments have fallen by at least 40 percent since 2014. Cuba is looking for new suppliers to help mitigate electricity and fuel rationing to state companies.
Rosneft, Russia's state-run oil company, began shipping some fuel in May to Cuba even as the United States under Donald Trump began reversing a fragile detente begun by former U.S. President Barack Obama. They were the first significant Russian fuel deliveries since the early 1990s.
Rosneft, in October, said it was considering increasing oil shipments to Cuba and improving refining capacity on the island after Sechin met with Cuban Energy Minister Alfedo Lopez in Moscow.
According to Jorge Pinon, an oil expert at the University of Texas at Austin, the Cuba deal this year was equivalent to around 1,865,000 barrels and valued at $105 million at current prices.
In comparison, Russia reported it shipped oil products to Cuba from 2010 through 2015 valued at $11.3 million.

Cuba consumes 140,000 barrels per day of oil products.

854,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 17, 2017 04:58AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices - Weekly Outlook: December 18 - 22,"Investing.com - Oil settled on a mixed note on Friday, with prices notching their third-consecutive weekly loss amid concerns over rising production in the U.S.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for January delivery tacked on 30 cents, or around 0.5%, to end at $57.34 a barrel. It still posted a loss of roughly 0.1% for the week.
Meanwhile, February Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., dipped 8 cents, or roughly 0.1%, to settle at $63.23 a barrel by close of trade. For the week, Brent suffered a loss of about 0.3%.
Both WTI and Brent logged a third-straight week of declines amid concerns that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
U.S. crude oil production rose by 73,000 barrels per day (bpd) last week, according to government data. Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 16% since the most recent low in mid-2016 to a total of 9.78 million bpd, bringing output close to levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
The number of oil drilling rigs fell by four to 747 in the week to Dec. 15, data from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s Baker Hughes energy services unit showed, the first cut to drilling numbers in six weeks. However, the rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still much higher than a year ago when only 510 rigs were active.
The steady increase in U.S. production has taken some of the edge off an OPEC-led initiative to support the market by cutting production.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with some non-OPEC producers led by Russia, agreed last month to extend current oil output cuts for a further nine months until the end of 2018. The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
In other energy trading, gasoline futures lost 2.1 cents, or 1.3%, to end at $1.655 a gallon on Friday, for a weekly loss of about 3.6%.
Heating oil slipped 0.4 cents, or 0.2%, to $1.905 a gallon, notching a weekly loss of around 1.3%.
Meanwhile, natural gas futures sank 6.0 cents, or 2.3%, to $2.624 per million British thermal units, the lowest most-active contract settlement since February. It ended about 5.8% lower for the week.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.

With a vote on the biggest tax rewrite in three decades set for Tuesday, Republicans were working to ensure party members were holding the line in favor of the legislation against entrenched Democratic opposition.
The plan was finalized on Friday after Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Bob Corker pledged their support. Three Republican senators, enough to defeat the measure in a Senate that Trump's party controls with a slim 52-48 majority, remained uncommitted: Susan Collins, Jeff Flake and Mike Lee.
Passage in Congress would provide Republicans and Trump with their first major victory since he took office in January.
""It's going to be one of the great Christmas gifts to middle-income people,"" Trump told reporters at the White House before he boarded a helicopter for meetings at Camp David.
""The Democrats have their sound bite, the standard sound bite before they even know what the bill is all about,"" he added.
The proposed package would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent and cut taxes for wealthy Americans.
Under an agreement between the House of Representatives and the Senate, the corporate tax would be 1 percentage point higher than the 20 percent rate earlier proposed, but still far below the current headline rate of 35 percent, a deep tax reduction that corporations have sought for years.
Democrats have slammed the plan as a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit.
For months, Trump has touted the bill as a middle-class tax cut. Studies from independent analysts and non-partisan congressional researchers have projected that corporations and the rich would benefit disproportionately.
Trump repeated on Saturday that the tax overhaul would help bring in $4 trillion in foreign profits from U.S. companies. The tax plan proposes new rules for repatriating cash held overseas.

""This is going to bring money in. As an example, we think $4 trillion is going to be flowing back into the country,"" he said. ""That's money that's overseas that's stuck there for years and years.""

857,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 10:10PM ET</span>",Alaska oil companies settle dispute over Trans-Alaska Pipeline tariff charges,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - The state of Alaska will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in a settlement with oil companies over the value of North Slope crude oil shipped through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline (TAP), officials announced.
The settlement between Alaska and the companies that own the 800-mile oil artery concerns transportation tariffs charged by the pipeline owners between 2009 and 2015. 
Alaska claimed that the Alyeska owner companies, including  BP  (LON:BP), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Koch Industries and Unocal, overstated the tariffs and improperly devalued the oil delivered by the pipeline, thus reducing state income.
“This settlement is a great result for the State,” Alaska Attorney General Jahna Lindemuth said in statement. “It creates certainty going forward, avoids future litigation, and will provide additional taxes and royalties -- bringing needed money to the state treasury.”
The settlement was filed Friday with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA), said Chief Alaska Attorney General John Ptacin. It is subject to FERC and RCA approval, which state officials hope will happen by next spring, he said.
The settlement resolves multiple disputes over the time period. “There’s about 40 rate cases. We’re settling all of those cases in this settlement agreement,” Ptacin said.
The terms allow the state to retain $224 million in already collected revenues and grant the state an additional $165 million in oil revenues. 
Other terms require the companies to exclude from any tariff calculations approximately $625 million that the owner companies spent on “strategic reconfiguration” for TAPS operator Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. Terms also include a methodology for calculating transportation tariffs through 2021.
The settlement resolves complaints the oil companies filed in Washington, D.C. and Alaska courts that challenged past FERC and RCA rulings, Ptacin said.
Much of the disagreement stemmed from Alyeska’s strategic reconfiguration project, which was aimed at streamlining operations, increasing automation and reducing costs in a time when the pipeline is carrying reduced oil volumes. 
The state argued that the owner companies botched the project and added costs that should not be used to reduce the value of North Slope crude or the revenues derived from that crude. The state prevailed on that point, Ptacin said.
Disputes also concerned property taxes and how they would be treated in the tariff calculations, he said.
Also parties to the settlement are Anadarko, Tesoro, Flint Hills and Petro Star Inc., which shipped oil through the pipeline but held no ownership shares. Those companies generally sided with the state in the tariff disputes, Ptacin said.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 06:28PM ET</span>",NAFTA Washington talks said to leave major differences untouched,"By David Lawder and Lesley Wroughton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - NAFTA negotiatiors made some progress on less controversial issues this week but left untouched the thorniest subjects of autos, dispute settlement and an expiry clause to be tackled at pivotal talks in January in Montreal. 
Some participants said on Friday the Washington ""intersessional"" round of negotiations to modernize the North American Free Trade agreement focused on technical issues and areas like environmental standards, digital trade, energy, telecommunications and regulatory practices.
Canada and Mexico have not yet offered counterproposals to the Trump administration's automotive demands that half the content for North American-made vehicles come from the United States along with sharply higher regional content, a proposal that would dramatically reshape the industry.
Canada and Mexico rejected the U.S. proposal as unworkable last month in Mexico City, but some officials said they expected alternatives to emerge in Montreal. 
""There wasn’t much of a discussion on autos"" at the Washington talks this week, Mexican chief negotiator Ken Smith told reporters.
""So we’ll take that conversation up again in Montreal, and hopefully, what I told my U.S. counterparts, is that we should start a dialogue that takes into consideration the position of the industries of the three countries because we cannot operate in a vacuum.""
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has repeatedly expressed frustration that Canada and Mexico have not accepted his demands in autos and other areas to ""rebalance"" the trade agreement to shrink U.S. trade deficits.
""The United States continues to look for serious engagement and meaningful progress in these talks for a modernized and rebalanced NAFTA,"" USTR spokeswoman Amelia Breinig said in a statement on Friday as the talks wound down.
But she said the three countries did manage to substantively complete a sectoral annex on energy efficiency standards, marking the first time a NAFTA negotiating area or so-called chapter had closed since September.
""NO FIREWORKS""
Breinig said the meetings focused on narrowing remaining gaps in the chapters where previous progress had been made.
""I think the technical work is advancing pretty much as we expected it would,"" said Smith. ""No fireworks, but no major obstacles.""
However, even some minor chapters and annexes still had big differences as the talks closed. 
U.S. textiles producers have been pushing to end rules of origin exclusions that allow Canada and Mexico to ship large quantities of products made with Chinese yarn to the United States duty-free but the issue was left unresolved, said Auggie Tantillo, president of the National Coalition of Textiles Organizations. 
""I hate to say it, but bigger, more sensitive issues weren't discussed,"" Tantillo told Reuters. ""Montreal should be interesting.""
Mexico and Canada are unlikely to accept the Trump administration's demands on autos, a five-year sunset clause and a repeal of a trade dispute settlement system that largely shields them from U.S. anti-dumping duties, said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Without some concessions in Montreal, Hufbauer said President Donald Trump would be more tempted to issue a notice of withdrawal from NAFTA, as he has repeatedly threatened if U.S. terms cannot be met. Such a move would create massive uncertainty for companies and would likely draw legal challenges. 

""We have a frozen situation,"" Hufbauer added. ""Right now, I can't see the reconciliation but what I can see is a kind of zombie NAFTA in the year 2018.""

859,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 05:46PM ET</span>",Oil hovers below two-year highs with focus on U.S. output,"By Julia Simon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were mixed on Friday, lingering below two-year highs as the continuing outage of a North Sea pipeline gave support, while climbing U.S. output and weak gasoline demand kept a lid on gains.
Brent crude futures settled down 8 cents or 0.1 percent to $63.23 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled up 26 cents to $57.30 a barrel. WTI hit a two-year high of $59.05 on Nov. 24.
Brent ended the week down slightly with a 0.3 percent fall, while WTI was down 0.1 percent.
""There's definitely some pressure on crude,"" said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York. ""Demand for gasoline is lower which isn't normally the case in the holiday season and supplies are steadily rising. It's something to watch.""
Gasoline futures were down 3.5 percent on the week.
Hedge funds and other money managers pared their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to Dec. 12, cutting the holdings for a second week after hitting a record high, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday. 
The speculator group cut its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 7,542 contracts to 435,200 during the period. The cut was the second in a row.
The ongoing outage of the Forties pipeline, which carries North Sea oil to Britain, was a price support for Brent early in the session before the grade fell slightly, traders said.
The outage's main physical impact is the North Sea region, but it has global relevance as the crude is used to underpin the Brent price benchmark. Operator INEOS declared force majeure on Forties, the first such declaration in decades.
Force majeure is a legal designation that suspends a firm's contractual obligations due to situations beyond its control.
Still, U.S. oil production, which has soared 16 percent since mid-2016 to 9.78 million barrels per day (bpd), has undermined OPEC's output curbs.
U.S. supply, now close to matching levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia, will likely move oil markets into a supply surplus in the first half of 2018, the International Energy Agency said.
The number of oil drilling rigs fell by four to 747 this week, data from General Electric's Baker Hughes energy services unit showed, the first cut to drilling numbers in six weeks. 

The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still much higher than a year ago when only 510 rigs were active.

860,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 03:30PM ET</span>",Oil Rally Fizzles for Third Week With 2018 Outlook Still Cloudy,"(Bloomberg) -- Crude’s rally fizzled out for a third week, with prices stalled near $57 a barrel as concerns over excess supplies next year temper enthusiasm for OPEC’s extended production curbs.
Futures in New York closed Friday just about where they started on Monday, with small gains over the past two days merely offsetting losses in previous sessions. While the halt of the Forties pipeline in the North Sea sent prices surging and the International Energy Agency said Thursday that OPEC and its allies had managed to reduce global stockpiles to the lowest level in two years, the agency also cautioned that supply growth would outpace global demand in 2018. But for the quarter, prices are up 11 percent.
This week “you had some decent news to hold up the market, including the pipeline crack out of the North Sea,” Rob Haworth, who helps oversee $150 billion in assets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle, said by telephone. Markets should remain relatively quiet “with traders comfortable and confident in their positions as long as oil isn’t breaking down below $55.”
Crude has increased this year as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia limited production to reduce global inventories. The group of producers agreed last month to extend curbs through the end of next year. Hedge funds boosted their net-bullish Brent crude bets to a record, according to weekly ICE Futures Europe data.
West Texas Intermediate for January delivery gained 26 cents to settle at $57.30 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 19 percent below the 100-day average.
Brent for February settlement slipped 8 cents to $63.23 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $5.90 to February WTI.
See: The biggest voices in oil disagree on the outlook for 2018
The Forties halt forced Ineos Group Ltd., the operator of the pipeline, to declare force majeure, a contractual term that allows it to miss deliveries due to events beyond its control. That’s the first time in nearly 30 years that such a condition has been declared in the North Sea, according to Gary Ross, founder of PIRA Energy, now part of S&P Global Platts.
Meanwhile, the IEA report indicated that the market will be “closely balanced” next year.
“The IEA report wasn’t overwhelmingly negative” and the non-OPEC supply forecast “is not set in stone,” Ashley Petersen, lead oil analyst at Stratas Advisors in New York, said in a telephone interview. The Forties pipeline shutdown also “definitely helped support prices.”

Preparations for the shutdown began on Thursday evening, according to the source, and the shutdown comes slightly ahead of an original plan to take the unit offline early next week.
Ineos shut the 65,000 bpd CDU at the refinery on Wednesday but the unit restarted again on Thursday.
Ineos is looking at the option of bringing forward maintenance that was planned for the spring, but that option depends on finding the right crew, equipment and the length of the shutdown of Forties pipeline, the source added.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for January delivery added 26 cents to settle at $57.30 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent fell 5 cents to trade at $63.26 a barrel.
The number of oil rigs operating in the US for week ending Dec. 15, fell by four to 747, declining for the first time in six weeks, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes.
Crude prices eked out a weekly gain, snapping a three-week losing streak, despite data this week pointing to rising US output, dampening OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess crude supplies.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its monthly oil market report, published on Thursday, revised upward its projection for US oil production, warning that total supply growth could exceed demand growth in the months ahead.
Rising US oil production comes as OPEC compliance with the deal to curb production reached its highest this year, rising to 115%.
The ongoing Forties pipeline shutdown earlier this week was one of the catalysts driving oil prices higher, as market participants expect 40% of North Sea oil and gas flows to remain shut for weeks, tightening supplies."

Gold futures for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $0.40, or 0.04%, to $1,257.60 a troy ounce.
Optimism on tax reform grew following reports suggesting that Republicans secured enough votes for the bill passage, boosting the dollar, while limiting gains in the precious metal.
CNBC, citing two sources, said Marco Rubio will support the final Republican tax bill after the GOP made changes to win his vote. 
Rubio, earlier this week, had said he would not approve the GOP tax plan unless it raises the refundable portion of the child tax credit currently at $1,100. Tax-reform is widely viewed as inflationary, and expected to provide the economy with a fiscal lift. 
Gold prices were on track to snap a three-week losing streak after rising sharply following the Federal Reserve interest rate decision to raise rates, and maintain its outlook for additional monetary policy tightening. 
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. 
In other precious metal trade, silver futures rose 0.85% to $16.07 a troy ounce, while platinum futures gained 0.91% to $889.25.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude January contract was up 16 cents or about 0.26% at $57.19 a barrel by 09:50 a.m. ET (13:50 GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for February delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was little changed at $63.32 a barrel.
Ongoing supply disruptions from the Forties pipeline in the North Sea continued to lend support to the commodity on Friday.
The commodity also remained buoyed after OPEC revealed in its monthly report that production in November, fell by 133,000 bpd to 32.5 million bpd but revised upward its 2018 forecast for non-OPEC output.
Prices briefly weakened following news this week of a larger-than-expected surge in U.S. gasoline stockpiles outweighed a larger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude inventories.
Also weighing on crude prices was a rise in production to record highs as data showed weekly U.S. crude production jumped by 73,000 barrels a day to 9.78 million barrels per day (bpd), bringing output close to levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies have been recently weighing on sentiment, according to market participants.

The cash-strapped company has for months struggled to make timely payments on its heavily discounted bonds, in part because U.S. sanctions have made banks wary of being involved in any Venezuela-related operations. President Nicolas Maduro in November announced a restructuring of all foreign debt amid an economic crisis. Venezuela and PDVSA bonds continue to be serviced, albeit with delays.
""PDVSA calls on bondholders and investors to trust the logistical, productive and financial capacity of the industry, which has fulfilled all of its commitments,"" PDVSA said via Twitter. ""We ratify the solvency of our oil industry, which is fighting against illegal imperial sanctions."" PDVSA on Friday must complete a $135 million coupon payment on its 2026 bond. On Monday, it faces $404 million in interest on bonds maturing in 2021, 2024 and 2035. 
The four coupon payments were due in November, but PDVSA invoked a 30-day grace period.

The company's bonds have in the past slipped into default due to payment delays. Investors so far have avoided taking action against the company because most believe that Maduro's government will eventually make the payments.

866,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2017 03:02AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's CNPC weighs taking over Iran project if Total leaves - sources,"By Chen Aizhu and Ron Bousso
BEIJING/LONDON (Reuters) - China's top oil and gas company CNPC is considering taking over Total's (PA:TOTF) stake in a giant Iranian gas project if the French company leaves Iran to comply with any new U.S. sanctions, industry sources said.
 Total  signed the $1 billion deal to develop the South Pars gas field in July. The contract gave CNPC the option to take over Total's stake if it pulled out, according to sources involved in the talks.
The deal was the first major Western energy investment in the Islamic Republic since international sanctions, including most of those imposed by the United States, were lifted as part of a landmark agreement in 2015 over Iran's nuclear program.
But after U.S. President Donald Trump refused in October to certify that Tehran is complying with the deal, Congress will have to vote on whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran.
It was unclear when a vote would take place or what sanctions might be imposed, but they could bar companies working in Iran from also operating in the United States. 
Total has much larger operations in the United States and Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said it would leave if it were no longer able to operate in Iran.
Under the terms of the agreement to develop phase 11 of South Pars, the world's largest gas field, CNPC could take over Total's 50.1 percent stake and become operator of the project if Total is forced to withdraw from Iran, a senior Beijing-based source with knowledge of the joint-venture agreement said.
CNPC has a 30 percent stake, while the Iranian national oil company's subsidiary PetroPars holds the remaining 19.9 percent.
CNPC officials have held internal talks in recent weeks to discuss the implications of taking control, according to three industry sources briefed on the talks.
Spokespeople for CNPC, Total and Iran's National Oil Company (NIOC) declined to comment.
A senior official at Total said the company has ""some mechanism that permits us to exit the deal softly if forced to by international sanctions."" 
Any change would likely delay the project's timetable as Total is already in discussion with service companies and is expected to award contracts early next year, the sources said. 
SMALL LOSS
A change in ownership structure would mean that CNPC would shoulder 80 percent of the cost of the project, estimated at $2 billion for the first stage.
It would also have to bring in new technical teams to manage and operate the offshore project. This could mean involving its rival CNOOC (HK:0883), China's largest offshore operator.
""In the case of a Total withdrawal, CNPC may need to bring in CNOOC because CNPC has little experience offshore,"" a second senior Chinese industry official said.
Total might still be able to operate in Iran depending on how the U.S. sanctions are worded, and because the European Union, China and Russia are expected to stick to the nuclear deal, Pouyanne said in October. 
Pouyanne has also raised the possibility of France getting a waiver from the United States to operate in Iran, similar to one it had obtained in the late 1990s.
""If we can legally execute the contract, we will execute the contract,"" he said in a speech at the Oil & Money conference.
Total faces losses of several tens of millions of dollars if it pulls out of the project, but that is a relatively small sum for the 120 billion euro company, the Total source said.
The French company last month opened an office in Washington in a bid to strengthen relations with the U.S. administration as it prepares to invest billions in Iran.
The South Pars project will have a production capacity of 2 billion cubic feet per day, or 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day including condensate, Total has said. It would start supplying the Iranian domestic market starting in 2021.

Iran is the third largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the Total deal was a breakthrough in efforts to revive its economy following the removal of international sanctions.

Comex gold futures were up $1.80 or about 0.15% at $1,258.90 a troy ounce by 03:00 a.m. ET (07:00 GMT), just off a one-week high of $1,261.50 hit on Thursday.
The greenback came under pressure after two U.S. Republican senators on Thursday sought changes to the proposed U.S. tax reform bill.
The bill needs a simple majority to pass in the Senate, in which Republicans hold just 52 of the 100 seats.
On Wednesday, the Fed raised interest rates by 0.25 basis points to 1.50% at the conclusion of its policy meeting, in line with expectations.
However, the central bank did not change its projections for 2018, which include three more interest rate hikes in both 2018 and 2019, disappointing expectations for four rate hikes next year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.16% at 93.50.
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

CARACAS/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Decisions at some joint ventures with foreign firms are delayed. A growing number of oil tankers sit idle because no one authorizes payments. Employees struggle to get approval for routine expenses, from taxis to training. 
An alleged crackdown on graft in Venezuela, seen by critics as an effort by President Nicolas Maduro to consolidate power, has sown panic across the country's energy industry and all but paralyzed state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA, according to people at the company and across the sector. 
The ongoing purge, in which prosecutors have arrested at least 67 executives including two recently ousted oil ministers, now threatens to further harm operations for the OPEC country, which is already producing at near 30-year-lows and struggling to run PDVSA units including Citgo Petroleum, its U.S. refiner. 
Further trouble for the all-important industry could cause yet more economic chaos in the once-prosperous Andean country, which is currently grappling with a profound recession, soaring crime and violence, crippled public services and the world's steepest inflation rate. 
Many of those detained have not yet been replaced, as the once world-leading company, already struggling with a brain drain, wants for qualified personnel. Executives that remain, meanwhile, are so rattled by the arrests that they are loathe to act, scared they will later be accused of wrongdoing. 
""In PDVSA, nobody dares sign anything now, not even a Christmas card,"" said one executive at a joint venture between PDVSA and a foreign firm in the Orinoco oil belt, asking to remain anonymous. 
Interviews with around 20 current and former PDVSA employees, executives at foreign firms, traders and PDVSA clients say fear is compounding problems including the loss of talent, mounting debts, equipment shortages, rampant theft and chronic underinvestment. 
Venezuela's Oil Ministry and PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] did not respond to a request for comment. 
""WITCH HUNT"" 
Oil accounts for over 90 percent of Venezuela's export revenue and provides the hard currency for Maduro's socialist government. Yet the country, which sits on the world's largest crude reserves, is now producing under 2 million barrels per day (bpd). 
A political tool even before Maduro mentor Hugo Chavez became president in 1999, PDVSA has increasingly become an extension of Venezuela's beleaguered government, critics say, with lackeys and soldiers now filling posts, including the top job, that once required industry expertise. 
In what some executives call a ""witch hunt,"" some mid-level managers are now using the purge as an excuse to fire anti-government employees or even disliked colleagues. 
""You say anything against anyone right now, and they believe you,"" said one PDVSA employee, calling from a relative's phone to avoid potential eavesdropping. 
The purge comes years after industry analysts and opposition politicians began criticizing PDVSA management for widespread graft. A report by the opposition-led Congress last year said at least $11 billion went ""missing"" at PDVSA between 2004 and 2014. 
For years, the government decried such accusations as ""smear campaigns"" against socialism and in favor of a U.S.-backed coup. 
But Maduro, expected to run for reelection next year, recently changed tone. He now blames ""thieves"" and ""traitors"" for an economic crisis so severe that disease and malnutrition are spreading unchecked by a broken public health system. 
Arrests, including that of former oil ministers and PDVSA bosses Eulogio Del Pino and Nelson Martinez last month, have targeted officials once thought untouchable. Attorneys and opposition figures criticize prosecutors for providing little evidence of crimes. 
Maduro last month appointed a general to take the reins of PDVSA and the oil ministry. The new oil czar, former housing minister Major General Manuel Quevedo, has no experience in the energy sector. 
Quevedo has yet to produce a detailed business plan, but has vowed to boost production by 1 million bpd - roughly the volume lost in the last four years. 
""If we can build almost 2 million homes, we can recover production!"" he said in a recent speech to employees, urging them to name and shame ""squalid"" pro-opposition colleagues. 
Critics within the sector say Quevedo's words betray ignorance of what it would take to revive the foundering industry. They say there is no proof that the general even oversaw construction of that many houses. 
Already, Quevedo decreed that all contracts with PDVSA be reviewed in a ""clean up."" While it is unclear what the review will entail, it has already spooked clients and partners who fear for the integrity of existing contracts. 
DELAYS AND CONFUSION 
There is also growing concern about PDVSA's dwindling ability to finance payments and operations, especially with inexperienced executives now at the helm. 
Some PDVSA employees say boat shortages are so acute in western Lake Maracaibo that workers often cannot get to platforms. Late payments have led tanker operators to halt around 18 vessels needed to carry oil and refined products, two sources said. 
PDVSA's crown jewel, Texas-based Citgo, has not been spared. 
Most of its board was arrested in Caracas last month, and Asdrubal Chavez, a cousin of the late president, was appointed to replace his jailed predecessor. So far, Chavez is managing Citgo from Caracas, two sources said, causing delays and confusion. 
Citgo did not respond to a request for comment.
Even much of the day-to-day office work at PDVSA has ground to a halt. One PDVSA worker said simple expenses like taxis are now off the table.
""They've suspended training courses,"" said another employee.
Combined, the woes are prompting analysts to question just how low Venezuela's oil production will fall.
The International Energy Agency predicts output will fall at least 500,000 bpd to 1.5 million bpd in 2018. Analysis firm Medley Global Advisors forecasts a decline of as much as 550,000 bpd, citing risks including ""PDVSA's militarization and purge of what remains of its technical capacity.""
A steep drop would heighten chances that cash-strapped Venezuela defaults on some $60 billion in foreign debt. Maduro's government has sought to restructure the debt, but has continued to make payments, albeit with delays. 
Even if production rebounded, PDVSA does not stand to reap a windfall. A growing portion of exports are being used to repay loans from allies, like China and Russia, who have thrown vital lifelines to Maduro's government. 
Meanwhile, foreign companies in Venezuela, including U.S. oil major  Chevron  Corp. (N:CVX) and Russian energy giant Rosneft (MM:ROSN), are frustrated. They see little progress on longstanding demands, from more operational control at joint ventures with PDVSA to better security at isolated oil fields, according to people close to the firms. 
""We've lost hope of resolving our problems,"" said one executive. ""We're on hold.""

Gold futures for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange edged up 0.02% to $1,257.40 a troy ounce.
Overnight, gold prices traded close to session highs on Thursday, shrugging off a rebound in the dollar as the European Central Bank said it would continue its ultra-accommodative monetary policy measures.
The European Central Bank left its benchmark rate unchanged on Thursday, reiterating its commitment to running an asset-purchase stimulus programme until at least next September.
""Domestic price pressures remain muted overall and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend,” European Central bank president Mario Draghi said in a press conference on Thursday, adding that an “ample degree” of stimulus is still needed.
Gold prices reversed a two-day slide on Wednesday against the backdrop of a widely expected Federal Reserve rate hike, and an unchanged outlook on the path of monetary policy tightening with three rate hikes expected in 2018.
In a sign of confidence, the Federal Reserve revised upward its projection for economic growth in 2017 to 2.5%, while forecasting growth for 2018 at 2.5%.
Also supporting sentiment on gold prices were reports of renewed brexit uncertainty after UK Prime Minister Theresa May's government was defeated on Wednesday, when lawmakers forced through changes to its Brexit plan that ministers said could threaten Britain's departure from the European Union.

870,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 03:30PM ET</span>",Oil Peeks Above $57 a Barrel Amid Conflicting Signals on Glut,"(Bloomberg) -- Crude rose after one of the most-influential voices in world oil markets issued mixed signals about the direction of supply and demand.
Futures closed 0.8 percent higher in New York. The International Energy Agency increased its forecast for 2018 production by nations outside the OPEC cartel even as it expressed confidence the Saudi Arabia-led group will significantly curb a global oversupply. Traders were also confronted with swelling U.S. gasoline stockpiles amid a four-week slide in American crude inventories.
“You’ve got a mixed bag of data frankly,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. The U.S. supply tally “was pretty bullish for crude but you are seeing this really impressive build in gasoline.”
The U.S. benchmark has averaged more than $57 since the end of November, when the Organization of Petroleum Countries, along with Russia and other major suppliers, agreed to extend production curbs through the end of 2018. Crude inventories in developed nations, the cartel’s key metric for assessing oversupply, have fallen to their lowest level since July 2015, the IEA said. In the North Sea, an important source of crude, Ineos Group declared force majeure on its Forties Pipeline System after discovering a hairline crack that forced it to halt oil shipments.
The Paris-based IEA’s decision to lift its supply forecast means “near-term, markets look a little bit more bearish,” Michael Loewen, a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said by telephone. Yet, “longer term, 2018 looks much more compelling than even 2017 did in terms of balancing.”
West Texas Intermediate for January delivery rose 44 cents to settle at $57.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Brent for February settlement added 87 cents to end the session at $63.31 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $6.23 to February WTI.
Supply Forecast
“On our current outlook, 2018 may not necessarily be a happy New Year for those who would like to see a tighter market,” the IEA, which advises most major nations on energy policy, said in its report on Thursday. “Total supply growth could exceed demand growth.”
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). said big oil companies will find themselves with a surplus of cash in 2018, while the latest U.S. government data showed domestic weekly crude production at a record 9.78 million barrels a day. Gasoline stockpiles jumped by 5.66 million barrels last week to the highest level since September.

871,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 02:47PM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices Settle Higher Despite Bearish IEA Report ,"Investing.com – Crude oil prices settled higher on Thursday, shrugging off data forecasting a faster than expected rise in US shale oil production next year, while an ongoing pipeline shutdown supported Brent crude prices.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for January delivery rose 44 cents to settle at $57.04 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 87 cents to trade at $63.31 a barrel.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its monthly oil market report, published on Thursday, revised upward its projection for US oil production, warning that total supply growth could exceed demand growth in the months ahead.
The IEA raised US crude oil growth to 390,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year and 870,000 bpd for 2018. Non-OPEC output, led by the US, will rise by 630,000 bpd in 2017, followed by an increase of 1.6 million bpd during 2018.
That supports a similar view from OPEC, who said in its monthly report, published on Wednesday, that non-OPEC production would rise faster than expected by 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 990,000 bpd in 2018.
Rising non-OPEC output has weighed on the efforts of OPEC as the oil cartel attempts to rid the global market of excess oil supplies. OPEC compliance with the deal to curb output reached its highest this year, rising to 115%.
Sentiment on Brent crude oil prices, meanwhile, remained positive amid the ongoing Forties pipeline shutdown earlier this week. The Forties pipeline carries 40% of North Sea oil and gas, and repairs could take weeks.
Andrew Gardner, chief executive of the Ineos Forties Pipeline System said “We’re estimating just now between two and three weeks,” when asked how long the system was likely to be down."

873,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 10:06AM ET</span>",Rising U.S. output weighs on oil prices,"By Ahmad Ghaddar
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices came under pressure on Thursday after the International Energy Agency (IEA) increased its forecast for growth in U.S. oil output next year, raising the prospect of excess supply. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures fell 29 cents to $56.31 a barrel, down from a high of $56.93.
Brent crude futures were at virtually unchanged at $62.45 a barrel at 14.44 GMT, after hitting a session high of $63.14.
The Paris-based IEA said U.S. crude output next year would increase by 870,000 barrels per day (bpd), up from its November forecast of 790,000 bpd.
The change mirrors upward revisions issued by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the United States government.
""The IEA underlined the same take that the U.S. Energy Department had the day before yesterday and OPEC had yesterday,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst with SEB Bank, adding that further upward revisions might follow.
With cash pouring into the U.S. shale oil industry, the United States is on track to deliver up to 80 percent of the world's oil production gains through 2025, the IEA estimates. 
OPEC revised its estimate for U.S. oil output growth for 2018 to 1.05 million bpd, while the U.S. Energy Information Administration increased its growth forecast to 780,000 bpd.
The IEA expects the oil market to have a surplus of 200,000 bpd in the first half of next year before reverting to a deficit of about 200,000 bpd in the second half. That means 2018 overall should show ""a closely balanced market"". 
For now, Brent prices remain underpinned by an outage on the Forties crude pipeline that is expected to last several weeks.
Operator Ineos declared force majeure on crude oil, gas and condensate deliveries from the pipeline, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
A fall in U.S. crude inventories last week also lent some support. Stocks fell by 5.1 million barrels in the week to Dec. 8, the fourth consecutive week of decline, to 442.99 million barrels, the lowest since October 2015. [EIA/S]

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude January contract was down 11 cents or about 0.21% at $56.48 a barrel by 10:00 a.m. ET (14:00 GMT), the lowest since December 12.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for February delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up 16 cents or about 0.26% at $62.59 a barrel, the lowest since December 8.
Prices came under pressure after a larger-than-expected surge in U.S. gasoline stockpiles outweighed a larger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude inventories.
Also weighing on crude prices was a rise in production to record highs as data showed weekly U.S. crude production jumped by 73,000 barrels a day to 9.78 million barrels per day (bpd), bringing output close to levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Separately, the International Energy Agency on Thursday warned that there were signs the ongoing rise in U.S. crude oil production could continue into 2018.
The U.S. report came after OPEC revealed in its monthly report that production in November, fell by 133,000 bpd to 32.5 million bpd but revised upward its 2018 forecast for non-OPEC output.
Fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies have been recently weighing on sentiment, according to market participants.
The producer group, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed last week to extend current oil output cuts for a further nine months until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.

Data on Thursday showed that U.S. retail sales rose for the third-straight month in November, while a separate report showed that U.S. initial jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week.
In a widely expected move, the Fed raised interest rates by 0.25 basis points to 1.50% at the conclusion of its policy meeting on Wednesday.
However, the central bank did not change its projections for 2018, which include three more interest rate hikes in both 2018 and 2019, disappointing expectations for four rate hikes next year.

878,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2017 08:00AM ET</span>",Central Asia yet to adjust to cheaper oil: World Bank,"By Olzhas Auyezov
(Reuters) - Countries across energy-rich Central Asia are a long way from readjusting to lower oil prices and will need to carry out large-scale reforms to regain competitiveness, a senior World Bank economist told Reuters in an interview.
Failure to do so could undermine ruling elites and create serious political risks, said Hans Timmer, chief economist for the Europe and Central Asia region of the World Bank.
""Anxiety among the population... should be taken seriously. Remember the Arab Spring? Or populism in Europe and the United States? Something like that could happen in Central Asia if no adjustments are made,"" Timmer said by telephone from Astana.
Although only Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are energy exporters, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have also benefited from petrodollars, largely thanks to remittances from hundreds of thousands of their citizens working in Russia.
Following the plunge of global oil prices, all five Central Asian states have seen their currencies fall sharply against the dollar and their economic growth significantly slow.
""The main challenge (for Central Asian nations) is rebalancing their economies to adjust to the new economic reality of lower oil prices seen since 2014,"" Timmer said.
Other major issues faced by Central Asia's 70 million inhabitants are adjustments in the neighboring China's economy and global technological changes, he said.
Timmer compared the situation to the early 1990s when the former Soviet republics were plunged into poverty and chaos by the collapse of the Soviet Union and had to reform quickly and under pressure.
""I think this risk (of the events of the early 1990s repeating) is there, and everybody has to learn from that experience,"" he said. ""Not transforming is a huge risk.""
UBER FOR TRACTORS
Economies in the region lost their competitive edge during the oil-fueled boom, while a lot of investment went into sectors producing non-tradable goods such as the construction and property industry, Timmer said.
The primary concerns now are government finances - states across Central Asia are borrowing to finance spending - and financial sectors, which are riddled with bad debt.
But fundamentally, reforms need to focus on improving the business environment, he added.
""Ultimately, the goal should be creating an environment where new jobs are being created,"" Timmer said.
The region needed to take advantage of all opportunities, he said, for example developing horticulture in Uzbekistan, where farmers need access to credit, a level playing field and help with implementing new technology.
Uzbekistan could also benefit from ""an Uber-like system"" for renting tractors and other agricultural machines, he said.
China's evolution into an exporter of foreign direct investment and its ""Belt and Road"" infrastructure project was another opportunity for the region which, after currency devaluations, can offer cheaper labor than China itself.
FLEXIBILITY
China could also serve as a good example of policy flexibility for the region, which is dominated by autocratic governments where vested interests sometimes stand in the way of change, Timmer said.
Asked if deep structural economic reforms were possible without political ones, he said:
""It all depends on the extent to which the existing political powers see the urgency and the need to reform.""
Citing his experience of working with the Beijing government on its China 2030 programmer's, Timmer said he was surprised by ""how much they wanted to change their policies, sometimes going 180 degrees"".
""You need the same kind of attitude,"" he said.
He stressed the importance of avoiding moves such as bailing out businesses run by the elites and the need to make way for grass roots decision-making.
""All countries in the region except maybe for Kyrgyzstan have a tradition of top-down guidance of the economy. But the ultimate solution will at least partly come from a bottom-up approach,"" Timmer added.

U.S. Shale Output,"Investing.com – Oil prices showed mixed trade on Thursday after two-straight sessions of declines as market participants continued to weigh the battle between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) attempts to curb global supply while U.S. shale producers continued to ramp up output.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude January contract fell 5 cents, or 0.09%, to $56.55 a barrel by 5:37AM ET (10:37GMT) Friday.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for February delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London gained 11 cents, or 0.18%, to $62.55 a barrel.
Crude oil prices settled lower on Wednesday after a larger-than-expected surge in U.S. gasoline stockpiles outweighed a larger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude inventories.
Also weighing on crude prices was a rise in production to record highs as data showed weekly U.S. crude production jumped by 73,000 barrels a day to 9.78 million barrels per day (bpd), bringing output close to levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
The U.S. report came after OPEC revealed in its monthly report that production in November, fell by 133,000 bpd to 32.5 million bpd but revised upward its 2018 forecast for non-OPEC output.
Supporting bulls, reports out on Thursday pointed to the rumors that OPEC along with other non-OPEC producers led by Russia may be considering output cuts beyond the current timeframe which sees curbs until the end of 2018. The group agreed on the nine-month extension to the end of next year in a decision only just made in a gathering at the end of November.
However, concern remains that current prices will give U.S. shale companies sufficient reason to ramp up production to fill in the gaps, offsetting attempts to rebalance markets. OPEC’s monthly report highlighted that production outside the cartel is “associated with considerable uncertainties”. U.S. oil supply is now expected to grow by 1.1 million bpd in 2018, an upward revision of 180,000 barrels, according to the report.
In the same line of thinking the International Energy Agency warned Thursday that there were signs that the ongoing rise in U.S. crude oil production was likely to continue into 2018 and upset rivals who are cutting back.
""We see that 2018 might not be quite so happy for OPEC producers,"" the Paris-based organization said in its latest monthly report released on Thursday.
The IEA forecast that non-OPEC supply, which includes the U.S., was set to rise by 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, and 1.6 million bpd in 2018. It also noted that global oil supply rose 200,000 bpd in November to 97.8 million bpd, adding that this was ""the highest in a year, on the back of rising U.S. production.""
To also take into consideration for Thursday’s session, a weaker-than-expected reading on Chinese industrial production dampened sentiment overnight, although a strong refinery throughput helped keep hopes on the rise.
China's November crude runs reach 49.4 million metric tons, up 8.1% on year with January to November crude runs up 5.2% to 518.66 million metric tons even as domestic crude oil production fell 2.5% on year to 15.7 million metric tons with year-to-date output at 175.64 million metric tons, down 4.1%."

Comex gold futures rose 0.74% to $1,257.80 a troy ounce as of 4:57 AM ET (09:57 AM GMT).
The Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday raised rates for the third time in 2017 as expected, forecasting further rate hikes despite concerns over the slowing pace of inflation. Gold is sensitive to rising rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
Fed officials also hiked their projection for economic growth in 2017 to 2.5%, while growth in 2018 was expected to rise to 2.5%, a 0.4% increase from the Fed’s September projection.
Gold was also bolstered by comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he hopes to sign the tax reform bill “in a very short period of time."" The highly anticipated bill will cut corporate taxes from 20% from 35%, which investors believe would help companies invest more and boost the economy.
Meanwhile the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, inched forward 0.06% to 93.46.
Tepid inflation data has put pressure on the greenback, as investors lower their expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes next year.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price index rose 0.4% in November. However, year-over-year core inflation was below expectations, rising just 1.7%.

Overnight, crude oil prices settled lower on Wednesday after data showing crude stockpiles fell for the second straight week failed to offset a larger-than-expected build in gasoline supplies.
Crude oil prices came under pressure following an Energy Information Agency (EIA) inventory report showing crude stockpiles fell more-than-estimated, but gasoline inventories rose for the second week in a row.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 5.1 million barrels for the week ended Dec. 8, beating expectations of a draw of 3.8 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – rose by 5.7 million barrels, well above expectations for rise of 2.5 million barrels, while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – fell by about 1.4 million barrels, above expectations for a build of 902,000 barrels.
Also weighing on crude prices was a rise in production to record highs as data showed weekly U.S. crude production jumped by 73,000 barrels a day to 9.78 million barrels a day.

US oil supply is now expected to grow by 1.1 million bpd in 2018, an upward revision of 180,000 barrels, according to the report.
Rising non-OPEC production has added to fears that oil producers not part of the production-cut agreement would continue to ramp up output, slowing the rebalancing in markets.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped for a second straight day on Wednesday, as a slump in U.S. crude stockpiles was offset by a larger-than-forecast rise in gasoline inventories and as U.S. crude output continued to grow to record highs.
U.S. crude inventories last week dropped 5.1 million barrels, more than anticipated, and production hit another record high at 9.78 million barrels per day (bpd), government data showed.
The U.S. peak, when records were only kept on a monthly basis, is 10.04 million bpd, set in November 1970.
Gasoline stocks jumped 5.7 million barrels, more than double analysts' expectations for a 2.5 million-barrel gain.
""It's kind of a mixed bag across the board - a little bigger than expected draw on crude but gasoline demand was down slightly. Usually in this time of year you see a little bit more demand,"" said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude settled down 54 cents at $56.60 a barrel, a 1 percent decline. Brent crude ended down 1.4 percent, or 90 cents, at $62.44 a barrel.
The international benchmark lost 2.1 percent on Tuesday on a wave of profit-taking after an unplanned shutdown of the Forties North Sea pipeline early this week helped send the global benchmark above $65 for the first time since mid-2015.
While the Forties shutdown has provided a price floor, early gains quickly evaporated in a global market that is still oversupplied and with output rising in the United States.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration on Tuesday forecast that domestic crude oil output will rise by 780,000 bpd to a record high of 10.02 million bpd in 2018.
""The fact that the market sold off so much after the Forties outage shows that the market struggles to trend higher. Now, we're basically where we were a month ago,"" Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix consultancy said.
U.S. crude contracts that expire later next year experienced a more dramatic selloff than front-month January, pushing the curve further into ""backwardation,"" which encourages producers to drain inventories because it is more attractive to sell to get the higher price for the prompt contract. 
Brent has been underpinned by expectations for an extended shutdown of Britain's biggest pipeline from its North Sea oil and gas fields for repairs after a crack was found. Forties is the largest of the five crude oil streams that underpin the dated Brent benchmark. 
The operator of the pipeline, which carries about 450,000 bpd of Forties crude, roughly a quarter of the North Sea's total output, said it was still considering repair options and reiterated that any repairs would take several weeks.

A number of producers, including  BP  (LON:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), said they had closed down oil fields in response.

""I think investors should add commodities to their portfolios,"" said Gundlach on CNBC, pointing to the ""remarkable"" inverse relationship between the total return of the S&P 500 and the S&P Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Commodity Index.
""You go into these massive cycles,"" he said. ""The repetition of this is almost eerie. And so if you look at that chart the value in commodities is, historically, exactly where you want it to be a buy.""
Gundlach noted that commodities are just as cheap relative to stocks as they were at turning points in previous cycles that began in the 1970s and 1990s. The S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index is up 5 percent this year, versus the S&P 500's 19 percent gain.

Fundamentals are also at play in commodities, Gundlach said. He pointed out that global economic activity is increasing, a tax cut could boost growth and the European Central Bank is implementing ""absurd"" stimulative policies in the euro zone.

DAMMAM, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer, aims to regain its lost market share after the OPEC-led supply-cut pact ends and plans to push ahead with a downstream expansion strategy to be on par with Big Oil, its chief executive said on Wednesday. 
Amin Nasser, the CEO of the state oil giant, which is preparing for an IPO next year, told Reuters Aramco is moving ahead with its refining and petrochemicals expansion strategy and is in discussions with several potential partners in Asia, Europe and the United States. 
""We had to cut our allocations to certain markets based on the (OPEC) agreement ... hopefully we will regain these markets as soon as this deal ends,"" he said in an exclusive interview. 
""We have a very reliable customer base. I don't see (any)sort of problems in terms of gaining market share beyond the OPEC agreement,"" Nasser said, adding the company will continue to abide with the OPEC production targets. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia have agreed to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 to help lower global inventories and support prices. 
Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de-facto leader, has shouldered the bulk of the output reductions, slashing its production by some 500,000 barrels per day to around 10 million bpd. 
One country where Aramco is currently looking at is Russia, the world's top oil producer which is part of the cuts pact. 
Nasser said his company has held talks with Russian firms including Kremlin-controlled Rosneft (MM:ROSN) on possible joint investments. 
Saudi Arabia and Russia say they will remain in partnership long after the current output reduction deal expires. 
When oil prices collapsed in mid-2014, both economies were driven into deficit after years of high spending and are only now slowly recovering. 
Economically and politically, the unlikely partnership between Moscow and Riyadh has been born out of necessity. Neither country can afford another oil price shock. 
In October, Saudi King Salman held a visit to Russia, the first by a Saudi monarch, showing the high level of mutual trust between the world's two oil powers. During the trip, which Nasser was part of, Aramco signed several memoranda of understanding with Russian companies.
Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih to buy Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) in order to spare Saudi Arabia's oil, Interfax news agency reported. 
""We are engaging ... with the Russian companies to identify opportunities whether in Russia or globally in terms of joint investments in areas of interest to both sides,"" Nasser said. 
""We have discussions with Rosneft in different areas, in terms of creating JVs. Essar is one area that we were interested in. And still the discussions (with other partners) are on going."" 
Saudi Arabia is competing with Iraq to be India's top oil supplier. It has eyed a stake in Indian refiner Essar, but Rosneft (MM:ROSN) had managed to seal that deal. Nasser said Aramco has a huge interest to expand in India and is in talks with several partners for possible downstream ventures there. 
EXPANDING FOOTHOLD 
The Saudi government plans to sell up to 5 percent in Aramco next year in what could be the world's largest initial public offering. 
Aramco aims to become the world's largest integrated energy firm, with plans to expand its refining operations and petrochemical output. 
The company plans to raise its total refining capacity - both inside the kingdom and abroad - to 8 million-10 million bpd from around 5.4 million bpd now. 
""If you look at our peers, their refining capacity is either equal or much higher than their production capacities. So we are looking at our refining capacity to be in that range,"" Nasser said. 
Aramco's focus to expand and regain its market share will remain on Asia, Nasser said, adding that the United States and Europe are also two important markets for the company. 
""The U.S. is an important market and we are looking at expanding after having taken the full ownership of Motiva. We are looking at expanding our footprint in the U.S. for sure,"" he said. 
Last year, Shell (L:RDSa) and Aramco announced plans to break up U.S. Motiva Enterprises LLC after almost two decades, dividing its assets. 
China, the world's second biggest oil consumer, is one of the main markets where Aramco wants to expand its foothold, Nasser said. 
That would fit in with a push by Aramco to regain its dominance in supplying China, having lost the upper hand to Russia this year. 
The company is in talks with PetroChina, China's second-largest state-run refiner, to invest in its Yunnan refinery which started operations this year. 
Nasser said he expects to finalize the Yunnan joint venture agreement soon. 

Earlier this year Saudi Arabia pledged billions of dollars of investment in projects in Indonesia and Malaysia to ensure long-term oil supply deals.

Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

894,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 08:00AM ET</span>","OPEC Boosts Forecast for Rival Supply, Sees Balance in Late 2018","(Bloomberg) -- OPEC predicted that global oil markets won’t rebalance until late next year after boosting forecasts for supplies from the U.S. and other rivals.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ monthly report raised its outlook for non-OPEC supply in 2018 by 300,000 a barrels a day, as its projections for American output caught up with those of the U.S. government. As a result, an initiative by OPEC and Russia to clear a global oil glut by cutting output -- previously seen succeeding in the third quarter of 2018 -- will take effect more slowly.
Oil prices climbed to a two-year high above $65 a barrel in London this week, supported by a temporary pipeline halt in the U.K. and the Nov. 30 decision by OPEC and Russia to press on with supply curbs until the end of next year. While Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates said this week the group could consider winding down its efforts in mid-2018 if the market is back in balance, Wednesday’s report suggests they’ll need to persevere for longer.
“Continued efforts by OPEC and non-OPEC to support oil market stability” should “lead to a further reduction in excess global inventories, arriving at a balanced market by late 2018,” OPEC’s Vienna-based research department said in the report.
Blunted Impact
The cartel’s latest figures showed its strategy is paying off, having reduced the oil-inventory surplus in developed nations to about 137 million barrels as of October, compared with about 380 million before the cuts began. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo, speaking to Bloomberg television in Beijing on Wednesday, said stockpiles have since fallen further to about 130 million.
OPEC output fell by 133,500 barrels a day last month to 32.45 million, according to the report. Venezuela’s troubled industry suffered further production losses, the U.A.E. belatedly stepped up efforts to deliver its pledged cutbacks and Saudi Arabia cut deeper than required.
If OPEC were to maintain current output levels to the end of 2018, world inventories would shrink by a further about 274 million barrels, data in the report indicate.
Yet the stronger outlook for supplies elsewhere is blunting the impact of OPEC’s strategy. American shale explorers, who grew more efficient during the industry’s three-year downturn, are locking in future revenues as U.S. prices near $60 a barrel, potentially readying for a new surge in drilling.
OPEC increased estimates of its competitors’ output in 2018 for the first time since the forecast was introduced last summer. It now expects that rival supplies will increase by about 1 million barrels a day, or about 1.7 percent, in 2018. It bolstered forecasts for total U.S. oil production growth next year by 180,000 barrels a day to 1.1 million a day.
“The momentum seen this year is expected to continue in 2018 on the back of increased investment in U.S. tight oil and improved well efficiency,” OPEC said.

Comex gold futures were at $1,243.90 a troy ounce by 3:20AM ET (0820GMT), up $2.30, or about 0.2%, from the last session's closing price. Gold prices fell Tuesday for a third-straight session, after touching its lowest level since July 20 at $1,238.40.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise the fed funds target range by a quarter point at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting at 2:00PM ET (1900GMT) on Wednesday, which would put it in a range between 1.25%-1.50%.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen is to hold what will be a closely-watched press conference 30 minutes after the release of the Fed's statement, as investors look for fresh clues on the likely trajectory of monetary policy in the months ahead.
The U.S. central bank will also release its latest forecasts for economic growth and interest rates, known as the ""dot-plot"". The Fed has forecast three rate rises for next year, and it is expected to keep its outlook about the same even though the market has been skeptical it will hike as much as it expects.
Wednesday's meeting will be the last under the leadership of Janet Yellen, whose term ends in February, when she will be replaced by Fed Governor Jerome Powell
Besides the Fed, Wednesday's calendar also features top-tier U.S. data on inflation. The Commerce Department will publish inflation figures for November at 8:30AM ET (1330GMT). Market analysts expect consumer prices to inch up 0.4%, while core inflation is forecast to rise 0.2%.
Meanwhile, investors also took note of a special Senate election in Alabama, which Democrat Doug Jones has been projected to win. If confirmed, the development will take the Republican Party's slim majority in the Senate down to 51 seats and could be a potential stumbling block as the GOP attempts to pass a tax reform bill.
In other metals trading, silver futures ticked up 5.7 cents, or 0.4%, to $15.72 a troy ounce, after hitting the lowest since mid-July in the prior session.

898,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 13, 2017 02:01AM ET</span>",U.S. Fuels the World as Shale Boom Powers Record Oil Exports,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s largest oil consumer exported more hydrocarbons than ever before in 2017 and shows no signs of slowing down.
You name it -- crude oil, gasoline, diesel, propane and even liquefied natural gas -- all were shipped abroad at a record pace. While the surge comes many years after the shale boom started, it can be traced straight back to the growth of horizontal drilling and fracking. U.S. exports are poised to expand even further, as the fear of peak oil supply has all but vanished just as a new demand threat emerges in the form of electric vehicles.
Crude Oil
Americans are expected to end the year pumping oil out of the ground at rates unseen since the early 1970s. More and more of it is going overseas, giving OPEC a headache as the group restrains its own output.
Last year the U.S. tested the export waters after a nearly four-decade-old ban was removed. But this year, purchases of U.S. light, sweet crude have skyrocketed as pipeline and dock infrastructure was built out and the wider price spread between Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude coaxed more cargoes abroad.
Canada, once the only regular buyer of U.S. crude, finds itself competing with refiners in Europe and Asia. China’s appetite for American oil is voracious: in April, China bought more than Canada did for the first time.
“It’s pretty amazing, really,” said Matt Smith, ClipperData LLC’s director of commodity research. ""You learn to never say never in this market.""
Of all the emerging trade flows this year, crude deliveries into Europe and Asia are most surprising, according to Smith. Brent crude, the European benchmark, has maintained at least a $4 a barrel premium to WTI since mid-August, and was $6.31 more expensive Tuesday. If the price of European oil stays suspended into the New Year -- a good possibility after the Forties oil pipeline was shut to repair a crack -- U.S. exports will continue hold above 1 million barrels a day.
“The U.S. has fully integrated itself into the global market,” Smith said by phone. “You have U.S. crude going into Europe, and European crude heading elsewhere because the U.S. is selling crude into its own backyard.”
Fuel Bonanza
The growth of U.S. gasoline and diesel exports was more subtle this year, mostly filling the gaps left as refiners in Latin America weren’t up to the task of meeting the region’s growing thirst for fuel.
Refiners in the middle of the U.S. were pumping out fuel at a record pace, leaving a surplus of refined products along the Gulf Coast ready to be shipped to eager Latin American buyers, according to Mason Hamilton, an analyst with the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
“The Midwest is running at bonkers levels,” Hamilton said by phone from Washington. Weekly preliminary government data show total gasoline exports hit a record 1.21 million barrels a day in November.
July was a banner month for American refiners, who processed crude and exported distillate fuel at a record clip, according to monthly data. The strong demand from Latin America will continue into 2018, according to Hamilton.
NGL/LPG
Talk about alphabet soup. Exports of oft-confused natural gas liquids and liquefied natural gas exports chugged along to records as well. NGLs like propane and butane are in high demand around the world to feed plastics-making plants, heat homes and stoves. China and Japan emerged as the biggest propane buyers in 2017.
LNG shipments are just warming up. The sole export terminal in the U.S., operated by Cheniere Energy Inc., hit new highs this year after its capacity was expanded. Mexico, where demand for natural gas increased following energy sector reforms, led all countries in 2017, followed by South Korea and China. LNG is even reaching the Middle East, typically a top supplier of the fuel.
“It’s like selling ice to the Eskimos,” ClipperData’s Smith said.

902,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 04:30PM ET</span>",Copper Bears Beware as Strike Risks Rise in Top Producer Chile,"(Bloomberg) -- Copper forecasters are reassessing their projections as the top-producing country prepares for its busiest year ever for wage talks. 
Under a new labor code and with higher prices inflating workers’ pay expectations, Chilean mines will negotiate contracts with 32 unions next year. That represents about three-quarters of the country’s copper output, or about one-fifth of world production. Globally, labor negotiations could trigger disruptions at mines producing about 40 percent of supply, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, which this week raised its price estimate.
While prospects of slower Chinese demand growth have sent copper back below $7,000 a metric ton in the past few weeks, supply is also constrained after years of cutbacks spurred by low prices.
That means any disruptions resulting from strikes could quickly tighten up the market -- as happened this year with stoppages at Escondida in Chile and Grasberg in Indonesia. If that happens, prices could go back above $7,000 in the first half of the year, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). analysts said last week.
“It’s going to be pretty tough,” Andrew Cosgrove, senior energy and mining analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said by telephone. ""Copper price risks mainly come from the Chinese property sector, but the Chilean negotiations add a thicker layer of price support.""
He expects supply to increase by 200,000 to 300,000 tons next year, signaling a fairly balanced market. But a repeat of this year’s strike interruptions would easily wipe out that increase. “Given how many negotiations are on, it could be even worse.”
While workers in Southern Copper Corp. mines in Peru returned to work on Tuesday after a 20-day strike, one union at Teck Resources Ltd.’s Quebrada Blanca mine in Chile were preparing to go on strike in what would be the first stoppage under the country’s new labor code.
Most of Chile’s largest mines face wage talks next year, although much of the attention will be on BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd.’s Escondida. The longest mine strike in the country’s modern history ended in March with no accord and an extension of the old contract until June 2018. Tensions ran high during a stoppage in which workers set up camp at the mine entrance, displaying dummies hanging from ropes representing executives and recording videos burning company letters.
An announcement by BHP in November to cut 3 percent of Escondida’s workforce spurred a 24-hour strike and threats of further action, with unions calling the layoffs an act of intimidation ahead of next year’s wage talks.
""Under the labor reform that came in last April, there is no downside for the employees during the negotiations,"" said Cesar Perez-Novoa, an analyst at BTG Pactual in Santiago. ""Unions are empowered and this will influence negotiations. They are better prepared from a legal and economic point of view.""
“Workers have made sacrifices over the last two years,” said Gustavo Tapia, president of Chile’s Mining Federation, which represents more than 20 unions from the largest mines. “Everyone can see that prices and production are higher, so the talk of crisis is no longer relevant.”
At the highest point of the last commodities cycle, juicy end-of-conflict bonuses were at the center of the talks. Now, negotiations are more likely to focus on benefits, Tapia said. Unions won’t be making unreasonable demands, he said, but they will ask for what they deserve after years of cost cutting.
""We need to have this discussion in a responsible manner,"" Tapia said. ""If companies keep talking about crisis, the answer will be to strike. And if they don’t understand that, this could be a year of many stoppages.""
While copper prices are about 14 percent higher than a year ago, volatility over the last few months will mean companies will tread with caution, according to Diego Hernandez, president of Chile’s mining association, Sonami. On the other side, unions might have learned a lesson from the Escondida strike, which ended with no agreement, no end-of-conflict bonus for workers and a salary freeze that will only end when the new contract is signed.
""We are confident that workers will act realistically and with moderation in these negotiation processes,"" Hernandez said in written answers to questions. ""There is a need to act with caution, especially considering that investment hasn’t been strong enough to reverse the fall in employment that happened over the last few months.”
With higher copper prices and empowered unions, companies should try to sign early wage agreements with their workers, said Colin Hamilton, a managing director of commodities at BMO Capital Markets in London. ""Unions are willing to sit and wait because there’s no urgency on their side. They have a lot more leverage.""
Last month,  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc failed to reach an early agreement with workers at its Los Pelambres mine after five weeks of talks. Formal negotiations will start Jan. 2, when the union presents its contract proposal, making it the first negotiation of the year. The company, which has never had a strike at any of its mines, declined to comment on the talks and said they are a normal part of the collective-bargaining process.
Codelco avoided strikes in all of its wage negotiations this year. The state-owned company -- whose Chief Executive Officer Nelson Pizarro famously said it didn’t have ""a single f-----g peso"" -- signed contracts with no real wage increases and austere bonuses. On Tuesday, Pizarro reiterated that any wage increases would have to be tied to productivity improvements.
Strikes could affect about 4.2 percent of the world’s total copper production, Hamilton said. But that percentage could increase given the number of union contracts up for renegotiation next year.
""We are projecting a very tight copper market by mid-2019,"" Hamilton said. ""The focus is on the supply side of the equation and any problems there would mean that tightness could be pulled forward if we have significant disruption.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela said on Tuesday it would start a criminal investigation into powerful former oil czar Rafael Ramirez, in an escalation of a purge of alleged corruption that has resulted in the arrest of dozens of oil executives. 
President Nicolas Maduro and Ramirez have long been rivals in the OPEC nation's ruling Socialist Party. 
Insiders say tensions between the two politicians have spiked in recent weeks after Ramirez wrote articles criticizing the leftist leader's management of Venezuela's tanking economy and crumbling oil industry, home to the world's largest crude reserves. 
Maduro, who is seeking to consolidate power ahead of next year's presidential election, last month stripped Ramirez of his most recent job as Venezuela's representative at the United Nations in New York.
Ramirez, a former oil minister and head of state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], then left the United States for an undisclosed location last week. 
On Tuesday, state prosecutor Tarek Saab accused Ramirez of being involved in the ""brokering"" of oil sales together with his cousin Diego Salazar, who was arrested this month in Caracas.
""In one of the documents that was found, the citizen Diego Salazar, who is Rafael Ramirez' cousin, directly signals him, incriminates him directly as his direct partner,"" Saab told journalists. He did not provide evidence. 
It was unclear what Ramirez, who did not respond to a request for comment, would do next. He has denied involvement in corruption, and recently told Reuters that the government would make one of its ""worst political moves"" if investigators target him. 
Opposition critics say the recent spate of arrests is arbitrary and motivated by internal divisions in the government. They insist that Maduro has turned a blind eye to corruption when it was politically expedient to do so. 
Last year, the opposition-led Congress said $11 billion went missing at PDVSA between 2004 and 2014, when Ramirez was in charge of the company.
Prosecutor Saab has refuted accusations that investigations are politically motivated. He pointed to the arrests of some 67 oil managers, including two former executives who had both served as oil minister and PDVSA president, as proof of the seriousness of the probe. 

Last month, Maduro appointed a National Guard major general with no known significant experience of the oil industry to lead PDVSA, sparking fears by industry analysts that mismanagement would increase.

The meeting comes after the White House last week pressured Midwest lawmakers to take part in talks over possible tweaks to the Renewable Fuels Standard, a law that requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels, mainly corn-based ethanol, into the nation's fuel supply each year.
A handful of refiners say the law is threatening to put them out of business. But ethanol interests have said the refineries can pass along the costs at the pumps and have vehemently opposed any changes to the regulation.
The meeting on Wednesday will include staff from the offices of Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, both representing the oil-refining industry, according to the sources. 
On the corn side, staff will be present from the offices of Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, along with Deb Fischer of Nebraska, the sources said. Staff from the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture were also expected to attend.
A spokesman for Grassley confirmed that ""staff-level dialogue and meetings"" were under way but did not provide details. Officials for the other senators and the White House did not comment.
One source familiar with the matter said the meeting would likely focus on short-term fixes to help oil refiners on the U.S. East Coast who say they are struggling with the costs of meeting the RFS requirements.
Refining companies - like Philadelphia Energy Solutions  and Monroe Energy, both of Pennsylvania, along with Texas giant  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO) - that do not have adequate facilities to blend biofuels into their products are required to purchase blending credits called RINs from rivals that do.
RINs prices have surged this year. 
The source said talks on Wednesday could center on solutions like a price cap for RINs or waivers to certain refiners that are at risk of going bankrupt without relief. The governors of both Texas and Pennsylvania have already formally requested such waivers from the administration.
The industry has requested tweaks to the policy in the past that would cut the annual volume targets for biofuels, allow ethanol exports to be counted against those targets, or shift the blending burden to supply terminals from refiners. But the Trump administration has ruled in favor of Big Corn and against the refining industry in a series of decisions this year. 
Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency, the regulator which administers the RFS, slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for 2018.
The refining industry has also been seeking a longer-term overhaul of the RFS before it expires in 2022, but such a change would require an act of Congress and has met with stiff resistance from the corn lobby.

The RFS was introduced more than a decade ago by President George W. Bush as a way to boost U.S. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions, and it has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude January contract was down 19 cents or about 0.33% at $57.86 a barrel by 10:00 a.m. ET (14:00 GMT), off session highs of $58.55.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for February delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up still up 10 cents or about 0.14% at $64.80 a barrel, after climbing to a more than two-year peak of $65.83 earlier in the day.
Prices strengthened after the Forties pipeline, the UK's biggest North Sea oil pipeline which was scheduled to pump 406,000 barrels per day (bpd) in December, was shut down on Monday after cracks were found.
Meanwhile markets participants were looking ahead to the American Petroleum Institute's weekly inventory data due later Tuesday. It will be followed on Wednesday by official data from the Energy Information Administration.
Fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies have been recently weighing on sentiment, according to market participants.
The producer group, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed last week to extend current oil output cuts for a further nine months until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.

910,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 12, 2017 10:01AM ET</span>","Too Big to Grow, Exxon Star Dims Amid Struggles to Boost Oil","(Bloomberg) -- Big Oil’s gold standard is losing some of its luster.
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). basked in a premium stock valuation for two decades thanks to unparalleled financial discipline, management expertise and the ability to weather oil-price downturns that hobbled lesser rivals. Those days are over.
The world’s largest driller by market value is struggling to replace the crude it pumps each year with new findings, and has been an also-ran in the U.S. shale boom. If that weren’t enough, CEO Darren Woods is facing a raft of regulatory headwinds from global sanctions to climate change. The company yesterday said it will start to disclose climate change effects on its business, reversing earlier opposition amid investor pressure.
The challenges are weighing on Exxon’s stock. Valued on a price-to-book-value basis, the shares this year traded at a discount to other energy companies in the S&P 500 Index for the first time since 1997, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The discount first appeared briefly in January but has deepened in the last 10 weeks.
Exxon’s main problem is its long-running failure to consistently increase production, said Pavel Molchanov, a Houston-based analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc. who has the equivalent to a ‘sell’ rating on the stock.
“There are plenty of multinationals that have sustained or grown production,” Molchanov said. “That helps explain why a stock that used to garner a premium is no longer deserving of one.”
Output Drop
Exxon’s production has dropped in four of the last five full calendar years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. It produced 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first nine months of this year, 1 percent lower than in 2016. That compares with 4.51 million barrels per day in 2011.
Pitted against global peers, Exxon still trades at a higher price-to-book valuation than rivals but the premium has steadily declined, reaching the smallest in at least a decade last month, the data show.
An Exxon spokesman declined to comment.
Exxon’s sheer size makes it difficult to find enough crude to replace what it pumps each year, with much of the world’s reserves located in countries where foreign investment is restricted, such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Russia.
But the company was also slow to realize the potential for shale in its home country, shunning it for the first decade of this century as a niche that wasn’t big enough to add significant production. Its 2010 purchase of shale gas specialist XTO Energy was an admission by then-CEO Rex Tillerson that Exxon had missed the boat on a watershed that has upended global oil markets.
Poorly Timed
But it came at a steep cost: $35 billion. And the timing for acquiring a gas-centric driller was not ideal as U.S. prices for the furnace and factory fuel plunged from almost $5 per million British thermal units when the deal was finalized to $1.61 by early 2016. Natural gas traded at $2.80 per million British thermal units at 4:09 p.m. in New York Monday.
At the same time, Exxon has faced a steady stream of challenges to its handling of climate change issues. A shareholder vote in May urged the oil and gas giant to publish a detailed analysis of how curbs on emissions of carbon could affect the value of its fields, refineries and pipelines. While management opposed that non-binding resolution, Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said at the time that Exxon was still committed to the goals and methods laid out in the Paris climate accords.
‘Demand Sensitivities’
The board of directors has now reconsidered the proposal, Exxon said in a filing on Monday. The company said it will include “energy demand sensitivities, implications for two-degree Celsius scenarios and positioning for a lower-carbon future” and “seek to issue those disclosures in the near future.”
While Exxon has faced allegations by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman that it may have misled investors in public statements on climate change, it’s also taken steps to bolster involvement on the subject. Woods has advocated low-emission fuels, carbon capture and biofuels as tools for meeting the Paris goals.
The company joined the Climate Leadership Council, a group launched in February to promote cost-effective, equitable and politically-viable climate solutions.
Moving forward, Exxon could do well to follow the examples of rivals  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc by selling underperforming assets, according to Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis, who has a ‘hold’ rating on Exxon’s shares.
“Acquisitions have not worked for them in the past, not necessarily disasters but usually they haven’t played out,” he said. “Maybe Exxon needs to consider a little more broader strategic moves on the asset side.”
Downstream, Chemicals
Where Exxon can differentiate itself from its peers is through its huge downstream and chemicals operations, Youngberg said. Those divisions made $2.6 billion of earnings in the third quarter alone, dwarfing the $1.6 billion profit from oil and gas production.
Despite recent sluggishness, Exxon shares have rewarded investors well over the long-term. They’ve provided a total return of 1,654 percent over the past 30 years, more than 400 percentage points above the S&P 500 Energy Index.

U.S. natural gas futures tacked on 0.5 cents, or around 0.3%, to $2.829 per million British thermal units (btu) by 9:40AM ET (1440GMT).
It touched its worst level since early March 2 at $2.747 last Thursday amid forecasts for less heating demand through late December.
Natural gas futures have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early-winter heating demand.
Prices of the fuel typically rise ahead of the winter as colder weather sparks heating demand. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 57 and 69 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Dec. 8.
That compares with a gain of 2 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 147 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average decline of 78 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.695 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 264 bcf, or around 6.6%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 36 bcf, or roughly 1%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose above $65 a barrel for the first time since mid-2015 on Tuesday following a shutdown of the UK's biggest North Sea oil pipeline, which helps set the benchmark for global prices.
The Forties pipeline, which was scheduled to pump 406,000 barrels per day (bpd) in December, was shut down on Monday after cracks were found in what traders believe is the first unplanned outage for some years.
Brent crude (LCOc1), the global benchmark, was up by 99 cents at $65.68 at 1312 GMT, after breaking above $65 for the first time since June 2015 and trading as high as $65.83. U.S. crude (CLc1) rose 45 cents to $58.44.
""With no timeframe yet available as to when supplies through the Forties pipeline will resume, bulls are in control,"" said Ole Hansen of Saxo Bank.
Forties is important for the global oil market because the crude it carries normally sets the price of dated Brent, a benchmark used to price physical crude around the world and which underpins Brent futures.
""The disruption to Forties is not just about missing barrels, it is also about losing a key component for the main seaborne crude oil benchmark,"" said Olivier Jakob, analyst at Petromatrix.
Analysts and traders said the outage was likely to cause significant delays in the loading of Forties crude cargoes.
""There are going to be loads,"" a trade source said, adding that the number was hard to estimate until the pipeline's restart date is known.
Oil also gained support from expectations the latest reports on U.S. inventories will show a further tightening of supplies.
U.S. crude stocks are expected to fall by 3.8 million barrels, a fourth straight week of decline, according to analysts polled ahead of reports from industry group American Petroleum Institute and the government's Energy Information Administration. [EIA/S]
The API is scheduled to release its data for last week at 2130 GMT on Tuesday. The EIA follows on Wednesday.
Oil supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries this year have helped to whittle away an excess of inventories which built up following a supply glut that began to emerge in late 2014.
But U.S. crude has lagged the rally in Brent in part because of rising U.S. oil production .

As a result, Brent has jumped to a premium to U.S. crude of more than $7 , the highest in more than two years.

917,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2017 03:32PM ET</span>","Oil gains on Forties Pipeline shutdown, New York blast","By Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday, overcoming declines early in the session, after a North Sea pipeline shut for repairs and investors focused on commodities following an explosion in New York.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) settled up $1.29, or about 2 percent, at $64.69 a barrel. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) settled at $57.99 a barrel, 63 cents or 1 percent above their last settlement. 
The difference between the two benchmarks  was the greatest since late October, as Brent rallied after the shutdown of the pipeline that carries the biggest of the five North Sea crude oil streams that underpin the benchmark. 
The pipeline, which can carry 450,000 barrels per day of Forties crude from the North Sea to the Kinneil processing terminal in Scotland, has been operating at reduced capacity for about four days before the shutdown.
""It is a supply concern not only because the pipeline transports a significant portion of North Sea crude oil output, but also because it may take weeks before the issue is resolved,"" said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy's Global Gas Analytics in London.
The market had expected the pipeline to return to service quickly and was surprised by the extended shutdown, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. 
""It's a significant amount of crude oil in a market that has been the tightest for crude oil,"" Kilduff said. 
Earlier in the session, both benchmarks popped higher after an explosion rocked New York's Port Authority Bus Terminal, one of the city's busiest commuter hubs.
Investors tend to head for hard-asset commodity markets like gold and silver during high-risk events, and oil can also attract investment, Kilduff said. 
Brent and WTI have gained well over a third from 2017 lows, drawing support from a cut in production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of non-OPEC producers, including Russia, which has been in place since the start of the year.
During the weekend, Kuwait's oil minister suggested that an exit from the supply-cut agreement would be studied before June. 
The United Arab Emirates energy minister said on Monday that OPEC plans to announce in June an exit strategy from the cuts, though he added it did not mean the pact would end by then.
Gains from the cuts could also be undermined by rising output from the United States, which is not participating in the deal to withhold production.
The number of rigs drilling for new oil in the United States last week rose by two to 751, the highest since September, energy services company Baker Hughes said on Friday.
""The largest concern for investors currently remains the rise in the U.S. rig count,"" said Shane Chanel, equities and derivatives adviser at ASR Wealth Advisers.

A higher rig count points to a further rise in U.S. crude production , which is already up more than 15 percent since mid-2016 at 9.71 million barrels per day. That is the highest since the early 1970s, and close to the output levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.

The Forties Pipeline System, one of the most important oil conduits in the world, is to be fully halted after a crack was discovered, the link’s operator Ineos said. The announcement boosted pricing that had been largely muted over the last week following an OPEC-led agreement by major producers to extend output curbs through the end of 2018. The Brent rally pulled New York futures up near $58 a barrel.
At the same time, the U.A.E.’s energy minister said Monday the group may draft a strategy in June to end the curbs if the market is no longer oversupplied. Brent, the global benchmark, rose as high as $64.71 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate climbed to as high as $57.86 a barrel.
“Brent is ripping,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “You really don’t have a lot of spare barrels before the supply situation becomes a problem.”
In addition, the WTI-Brent spread will “widen and encourage U.S. exports,” he said.
The pipeline system feeds crude to the Hound Point export terminal near Edinburgh in Scotland. At over 400,000 barrels a day, the supplies that flow through the link are the single largest constituent part of the Dated Brent grade that helps to settle more than half the world’s physical oil prices.
Brent for February settlement gained 99 cents to $64.39 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $6.60 to February West Texas Intermediate, after touching $6.88.
OPEC may draft a strategy in June to end the curbs if the market is no longer oversupplied by then, the U.A.E.’s energy minister said Monday. Kuwait’s oil minister said Sunday that the group’s reduction-cuts may end earlier than 2019 if the market re-balances by June, signaling an optimistic outlook on market conditions next year.
There is the “expectation of tighter markets as 2018 unfolds,” Bart Melek, head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said by telephone. “Certainly at Vienna, they’ve implied that they will be flexible. If the market rebalances, then we would expect somewhat looser rules.”
WTI for January delivery rose 36 cents to $57.72 a barrel at 11:27 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 11 percent below the 100-day average. Prices received a boost earlier as news broke of an explosion in New York.

Russia is keen to end output cuts as early as possible, Issam Almarzooq, the Kuwaiti oil minister who was replaced on Monday, said in Kuwait City on Sunday. OPEC will study an exit strategy at its next meeting in June, and prices should remain near current levels in 2018, Almarzooq said.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago's iconic sandwiches - Italian beef heroes dripping with gravy, and hot dogs loaded with pickles and hot peppers - wouldn't be such culinary institutions without the bread.
But this fall, bakers faced a crisis getting the right kind of bread to delis and sandwich shops locally and across the United States.
Gonnella Baking Co - which supplies the buns to Major League Baseball's Wrigley Field - faced an unusual problem in October when flour from this year's U.S. wheat harvest arrived at their factories containing low levels of protein.
(For a graphic on dwindling wheat crops in the United States, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2zXkpR6)
That meant bakers couldn't produce bread with the airy texture customers demand, setting off two weeks of tinkering with temperatures and the mixing process, and the eventual purchase of gluten as an additive. By the time the alchemy was done, Gonnella had thrown away more than $20,000 worth of substandard bread and buns, said president Ron Lucchesi.
""That really was a headache,"" Lucchesi said.
The problem spans the $23 billion U.S. bread market and highlights a paradox in the global wheat trade. Despite a worldwide grains glut, high-protein hard wheat is scarce after two years of poor U.S. harvests. The shortage hurts bakers and millers who prize high-protein wheat, along with the farmers who grow it.
Wholesale bakers such as Grupo Bimbo, Flowers Foods Inc and Campbell Soup Co's Pepperidge Farms are feeling the squeeze on margins, said Stephen Nicholson, senior grains and oilseeds analyst with Rabobank. All three companies have seen their stock prices fall over the last two years, a period when the benchmark S&P 500 index gained more than 26 percent.
Millers such as Archer Daniels Midland Co, Ardent Mills,  General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS) have been able to pass on much of their higher wheat costs in sales of flour to bakers, he added. But bakers have not been able to pass those costs to grocers, who have been unwilling to pay higher prices because of increased competition and price deflation.
Global wheat inventories have risen to record-high levels due in part to heavy production from Russia. Meanwhile, U.S. per capita consumption of wheat flour in 2016 fell to its lowest level in nearly three decades, and U.S. farmers planted their smallest winter wheat crop in more than a century.
""It's a low-margin, pennies business, but now you've got even more disruption,"" said Robb MacKie, CEO of the American Bakers Association.
Ardent Mills - a joint venture of Cargill Inc, CHS Inc and ConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG) - is finding enough high-protein wheat but also incurring higher costs, said Buck VanNiejenhuis, Ardent's general manager in Canada. ADM faces a similar situation, said Aaron Brown, its manager for Canadian origination and exports.
Campbell Soup declined to comment, but the company said in August that it expected costs to rise by two to three percent in 2018. Representatives for General Mills and Grupo Bimbo's U.S. bakery division declined to comment. Flowers Foods did not respond to requests for comment.
SHRINKING PROFITS, FEWER ACRES
Two years of heavy spring rains in Kansas, the largest producer of hard winter wheat, have sapped the protein levels of a crop that thrives in arid conditions.
Hard winter wheat makes up about 40 percent of the $10 billion U.S. wheat crop, which peaked in value at $17.4 billion in 2012 amid higher prices and plantings.
Total wheat plantings in Kansas fell this year to 7.6 million acres. That's down from 9.4 million acres in 2012 and represents the second-smallest planting since the U.S. Department of Agriculture started keeping records in 1919.
Kansas farmers have seen their returns steadily diminish, with some incurring losses. Farmers received an average of $3.20 per bushel for the 2016 harvest, down from $6.07 two years before. Data for the 2017 harvest is not yet available. 
Further north, farmers have been selling high-protein spring wheat for a premium due to tight supply. Protein premiums in Manitoba, the Canadian province, have reached their highest levels in at least five years.
Farmer Dan Mazier, located near Justice, Manitoba, sold his high-protein wheat for delivery next spring to squeeze out the highest price.
""If you have high-protein wheat, you're in the driver's seat,"" he said.
Last spring, as the rains poured down in Kansas, that state's Stafford County Flour Mills stockpiled as much high-protein wheat as it could find in anticipation of a substandard wheat crop. The protein level of the latest wheat harvest was ""the lowest I've seen,"" said general manager Reuel Foote.
He said the company bought 600,000 bushels of high-protein wheat - more than a quarter of its total wheat purchases - at a premium of 75 cents to $1 a bushel.
GLUTEN FEE 
The additional gluten that some millers and bakers are using to compensate for the wheat's low protein content comes at a cost. Gonnella paid up to 20 percent more for gluten than usual because of the surge in demand, Lucchesi said.
But bakers can't necessarily charge retail outlets more to make up those costs. Bread lacks the consumer loyalty of other food staples, such as meat and fruit, and sales would likely slide if grocers raised prices, said Sylvain Charlebois, professor of food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Export markets are also affected. The limited amount of high-protein wheat available has caused the market to ration demand, maintaining shipments to countries willing to pay a premium, such as Japan, and sending less than usual to price-sensitive markets such as Mexico, said Rhyl Doyle, a wheat trader at Winnipeg-based Paterson Grain.
Some bakers are tapping a protein pipeline to farms. Warburton’s, the largest bakery in the United Kingdom, buys flour from mills that is made from wheat grown to the bakery’s specifications in a dedicated supply system. 
Others, though, are counting on a drier spring than the last two years. A third straight low-protein crop would leave millers hard-pressed to scrounge up enough supply to meet blending needs, said Foote, of Stafford County Flour Mills.

""If next year's crop is low like this, we'll have a problem,"" he said.

Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 57 and 69 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Dec. 8.
That compares with a gain of 2 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 147 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average decline of 78 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.695 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 264 bcf, or around 6.6%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 36 bcf, or roughly 1%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 11 cents or about 0.19% at $57.47 a barrel by 08:52 AM ET (13:52 GMT), from a low of $56.92.
Brent oil for February delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was trading at $63.60 a barrel, off an earlier low of $62.99.
Oil prices remained on the back foot after energy services firm Baker Hughes said Friday that the number of U.S. oil drilling rigs rose by two in the week to Dec.8, to 751, the highest level since September.
It was the third consecutive weekly increase. A higher rig count points to an increase in U.S. oil production.
An increase in U.S. output is threatening to derail efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of non-OPEC producers, including Russia, to rebalance the market by curbing output.
OPEC and other oil producers started cutting output in January 2017 and currently plan to continue doing so throughout 2018.

Gold futures for February delivery rose 0.30% to $1,252.20 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 5:23 AM ET (10:23 GMT).
Stagnant wage growth and inflation have increased concern over rate rises. Data on Friday showed that average hourly earnings were lower than expected, while the U.S. economy added 228,000 jobs in November. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%  for a second consecutive month.
Gold fell to a four-month low on Friday after the release of the data. A stronger dollar also weighed on the commodity. Gold is sensitive to rising rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
Gold prices have been falling since September amid expectations the Federal Reserve will continue on its gradual path of monetary policy tightening. The central bank is widely expected to hike rates at its upcoming meeting on Dec. 12-13.
While an interest rate hike has been priced in, hawkish signals from Fed policymakers could cause the precious metal to sink lower.
Meanwhile investors are also looking to news of the tax reform bill, which Republican leaders are rushing to pass before Christmas. The increasing likelihood of it passing has driven the U.S. dollar up slightly, which in turn drags down on gold.

US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for January delivery eased 0.51% to $57.07 a barrel. ICE Brent dropped 0.38% to $63.09 a barrel.
Oil traders this week will look at monthly reports from OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) to assess global oil supply and demand levels. The data will give traders a better picture of whether a global rebalancing is taking place in the oil market.
Last week, oil finished higher on Friday, boosted by signs of rising crude demand in China, but prices failed to avoid a weekly loss amid concerns over rising production in the U.S.
Meanwhile, February Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., jumped $1.20, or roughly 1.9%, to settle at $63.40 a barrel by close of trade. For the week, Brent suffered a loss of about 0.6%.
Crude futures were buoyed by data showing China\'s oil imports rose to 9.01 million barrels per day (bpd) last month, the second highest on record, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Friday. Booming demand will push China ahead of the United States as the world\'s biggest crude importer this year.
Threats of a strike later this month from a union in Nigeria, Africa\'s largest oil exporter, was also supportive.
However, fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies prevented prices from rising much further, according to market participants.
U.S. energy companies added two oil rigs in the week to Dec. 8, bringing the total count up to 751, the highest since September,  General Electric  (NYSE:NYSE:GE)\'s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.
Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 15% since the most recent low in mid-2016, and increasing drilling activity for new production means output is expected to grow further, as producers are attracted by climbing prices.
U.S. oil production rose to 9.71 million bpd last week, according to government data released during the week, the highest level since the early 1970s and close to the output of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with some non-OPEC producers led by Russia, agreed last month to extend current oil output cuts for a further nine months until the end of 2018. The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.

Relations between the three institutions have been fractious over the past two years due to stand-offs over public spending and funding for NOC. 
Ties have been tense between central bank Governor Sadiq al-Kabir Sadiq and Government of National Accord (GNA) head Fayez Seraj over monetary policy and fiscal reform, although the bank said last month an economic and financial plan had been agreed. 
""The meeting dealt with the necessary financial arrangements to provide funding to the National Oil Corporation so as to be able to raise production and carry out its tasks and responsibilities in ... production, exploration, refining and transport of crude oil and petroleum products,"" GNA said.
The GNA statement added that rising oil output would help ""reduce the deficit, and helps the Central Bank of Libya to take monetary policies to deal with the liquidity crisis and support the Libyan dinar and stimulate the national economy.""
Libya earns almost all its income from oil production, which has risen about fourfold over the past year-and-a-half to about 1 million barrels per day (bpd).
Despite the rise in production, Libya is still running a heavy deficit and the NOC has complained in the past that it has only received a fraction of its budget.
Citizens have struggled with inflation, which has risen to more than 30 percent as the Libyan dinar has steadily lost value on the parallel market. 

Economic policy has also been obstructed by divisions between rival factions based in Tripoli and eastern Libya. A separate government and branches of the NOC and central bank were set up in the east in 2014, but they have little real power.

The agreement signed by the two countries provides for Iran to deliver to Iraq's southern ports, on the Gulf, ""oil of the same characteristics and in the same quantities"" as those it would receive from Kirkuk, Luaibi said in a statement.
The deal in effect allows Iraq to resume sales of Kirkuk crude, which have been halted since Iraqi forces took back control of the fields from the Kurds in October. 
Between 30,000 and 60,000 bpd of Kirkuk crude will be delivered by tanker trucks to the border area of Kermanshah, where Iran has a refinery, Luaibi said.
The two countries are planning to build a pipeline to carry the oil from Kirkuk, so as to avoid trucking the crude, he said.
The pipeline could replace the existing export route from Kirkuk via Turkey and the Mediterranean by pipeline.
Kurdish forces took control of Kirkuk in 2014, when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic state, preventing the region's oilfields from falling into the hands of the militants.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new chairman of the U.S. office that regulates energy projects was granted more time on Friday to decide on Energy Secretary Rick Perry's directive to subsidize aging nuclear and coal-fired power plants.
Perry had directed Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in September to decide on a rule by Dec. 11 that would allow power plants that maintain at least 90 days of fuel supply on site to recover their full costs through regulated power pricing.
The secretary says coal and nuclear plants should be rewarded for keeping the power grid robust by diversifying sources of power. Low natural gas prices have pushed many coal and nuclear plants into retirement. 
Kevin McIntyre, a Republican lawyer who represented energy companies at law firm Jones Day, was sworn in to head FERC, an independent office of the Energy Department, on Thursday. 
McIntyre wrote to Perry later that day, proposing a 30-day extension of the deadline for a decision on the so-called Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule.
An extension would ""afford adequate time for the new commissioners to consider the voluminous record and engage fully in deliberations,"" McIntyre said in the letter. 
Shaylyn Hynes, an energy department spokeswoman, said late on Friday that Perry granted McIntyre's request for an extension because he ""understands and respects the reasons for the chairman's request."" Perry ""looks forward to swift action from the commission to promptly address grid security,"" she said. 
Perry's plan is in line with President Donald Trump's promises to save jobs in coal mining. Many of the more than 1,500 comments FERC has received on the plan were from groups representing natural gas drilling, wind and solar power, and consumers who slammed the plan. Grid operators also criticized it.
Murray Energy, a private coal company, has said that it and other coal producers and related industries are ""threatened with bankruptcy and significant economic harm"" if coal-fired power plants shut. 
FERC reached its full complement of five commissioners on Thursday with McIntyre's swearing in. Another commissioner, Richard Glick, a Democrat, was sworn in on Nov. 29.

934,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2017 05:10PM ET</span>",White House pressures Big Corn to meet on U.S. biofuels policy,"By Richard Valdmanis and Jarrett Renshaw
(Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration called two lawmakers from the U.S. corn belt to convince them to join talks about potential changes to biofuels policy to ease the burden on oil refineries, according to a spokesman for one of the lawmakers and a source briefed on the matter.
The effort is the clearest sign yet Trump is seeking to mediate the long-running dispute between the U.S. oil industry and corn growers over the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a law requiring refiners to blend increasing volumes of biofuels like corn-based ethanol every year into the nation's fuels.
Refiners say the law is putting them out of business, but ethanol interests have vehemently opposed any changes. 
White House Chief of Staff General John Kelly on Thursday called Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of corn-growing state Iowa - a leading supporter of the biofuels industry - to discuss the possibility of a meeting, Grassley's office told Reuters on Friday. 
And Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue called Republican Senator Joni Ernst, also of Iowa, on the issue, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters, asking not to be named.
Trump and senior cabinet officials met with nine Republican senators from states with oil refineries on Thursday, including Ted Cruz of Texas. Some of the senators said after the meeting that Trump was interested in having all sides on the issue work together toward a solution.
A spokesman for Grassley's office said that Grassley ""would of course meet with any senator who requests a meeting.""
The spokesman, Michael Zona, added that Kelly, in his call to Grassley, ""reiterated the president's unwavering commitment to ethanol, the RFS and Midwestern farmers."" 
Officials in Ernst's office and at the White House did not respond to a request for comment.
A new meeting could be scheduled as early as next week, according to the source briefed on the matter.
The talks could lay the groundwork for potential future legislation to overhaul the RFS program, but would require co-operation from representatives of the corn industry to pass Congress. 
The RFS was introduced more than a decade ago by President George W. Bush as a way to boost U.S. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions, and has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year.
Refiners oppose the RFS because they say it costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year in blending and regulatory expenses, while propping up demand for rival fuels. 
The industry has requested tweaks to the policy in the past that would cut the annual volume targets for biofuels, allow ethanol exports to be counted against those targets, or shift the blending burden to supply terminals from refiners. 
But the Trump administration has ruled in favor of Big Corn and against the refining industry in a series of decisions this year. 
Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency, the regulator which administers the RFS, slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for 2018.
Senators on both sides of the debate have used parliamentary procedures like holds on administrative appointments to punish rivals.

For example, Cruz has said he would block Iowa Agriculture Secretary Bill Northey's nomination to a key post at the U.S. Department of Agriculture until he gets a meeting about a biofuels compromise that includes all sides.

936,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 08, 2017 02:36PM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices Settle Higher But Fail to Avoid Weekly Loss,"Investing.com – Crude oil prices settled higher on Friday as stronger Chinese crude demand and fears over possible supply disruptions offset signs of rising US output.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for January delivery rose 1.2% to settle at $57.36 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 1.6% to trade at $63.19 a barrel.
Crude futures started the session on the front foot buoyed by data showing China's crude oil imports rose to 9.01 million barrels per day (bpd) raising expectations that solid global demand growth would continue to support rebalancing in markets.
That came ahead of the reports showing the number of oil rigs operating in the US rose for the third consecutive week, according to the oil field services company Baker Hughes.
This week's U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, ticked up by two oil rigs to a total of 751, oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported on Friday.
Signs of growing US output did little deter the current bullish sentiment on oil amid fears over supply disruption after One of Nigeria’s two main oil unions on Thursday threatened to launch a nationwide strike from Dec. 18.
Oil futures ended the week negative following a nearly 3% fall on Wednesday following the release of inventory data which pointed to possible demand weakness after gasoline inventories rose more than expected.
Morgan Stanley said, however, oil prices were entering a phase of “gradual recovery” as demand for petroleum based products continued to outpace its historical average growth ahead of the winter peak period.
Also supporting crude prices was ongoing investor expectations that OPEC compliance with the deal to curb output would remain firm, reducing oil supplies to OPEC’s five year-average."
937,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 08, 2017 02:30PM ET</span>",Oil Jumps as Resurgent Chinese Demand Brightens Global Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Crude edged higher as near-record Chinese orders for foreign crude signaled stronger demand in the world’s second-largest economy.
Futures climbed as much as 1.9 percent in New York. A rebound in China’s crude imports last month from a one-year low defused some of the pessimism among investors fanned by a U.S. government report earlier this week showing bearish increases in fuel inventories and domestic oil production.
“Everyone is talking about that big jump in imports of crude into China last month,” according to John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund. “It’s definitely a strong source of demand.”
This year’s watershed moment for global oil markets was last month’s agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and allied producers to extend production curbs through all of next year. Euphoria among bullish traders was short-lived though in the face of the American shale juggernaut.
Output from shale fields from the Great Plains to West Texas continued to surge, raising the specter for a renewed worldwide glut. This week,  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) announced plans to ramp up investment in the Permian Basin and other shale fields, extending the company’s multi-year shift toward a shale-heavy focus.
The oil market continues to feel pressure from the ongoing “ramp up in U.S. crude oil production,” Kilduff said by telephone. “A lot of credit and hopes were pinned on OPEC and the deal that was cut but there continues to be more and more oil and product coming to market.”
Drillers expanded the number of rigs searching for crude in two of the busiest U.S. shale fields this week, Baker Hughes reported on Friday. The rig tallies in the Permian and Eagle Ford regions rose by three each.
West Texas Intermediate for January delivery climbed 45 cents to $57.14 a barrel at 1:18 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 8 percent below the 100-day average.

China will “inevitably” become more reliant on crude imports due to falling output from some of its biggest fields, according to Fitch’s BMI Research.

Elsewhere, Brent oil for February delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up $1.06 or about 1.70% at $63.25 a barrel, after hitting a two-week trough of $61.13 on Wednesday.
Prices were boosted after the General Administration of Customs reported on Friday that China's crude oil imports rose to 37.04 9.01 million barrels per day (bpd) in November, the second highest on record.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices were stable on Friday as the weight of a strengthening U.S. dollar was countered by China's relentless thirst for crude and the OPEC-led supply cuts that have gradually tightened the market this year.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $56.70 a barrel at 0714 GMT, virtually unchanged from their last settlement.
Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were up 7 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $62.27 a barrel.
Traders said a stronger dollar, which has gained over 0.9 percent this month against a basket of other leading currencies, was weighing on prices.
A rising greenback attracts financial traders who switch investments between commodity futures and foreign exchange.
""A strong U.S. dollar could act as a headwind to commodities,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) (BoAML) said in its 2018 outlook.
Preventing prices from sliding further was booming oil demand from China, which will this year overtake the United States as the world's biggest crude importer.
China's crude oil imports rose to 37.04 million tonnes in November, or 9.01 million barrels per day (bpd), the second highest on record, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Friday.
""China's crude oil imports will continue to rise over the coming years, as output declines from several of its giant onshore fields ... This will inevitably see China become more reliant on crude oil imports over our forecast period, with import dependency set to increase from a record 68.0 percent in 2017 to nearly 80 percent by 2021,"" BMI Research said.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, said healthy global demand and tight supplies should see Brent crude oil rise to $70 per barrel by mid-year.
U.S. investment bank Jefferies said it expects 2018 global oil demand growth of 1.5 million bpd, driven by near 10 percent demand growth in China.
On the supply side, oil prices have been receiving support from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a group of non-OPEC producers, most importantly Russia, which has been withholding supplies to tighten the market.
Largely because of these voluntary production cuts, oil prices rose sharply between June and October, with Brent gaining around 40 percent in value.
Threatening to undermine OPEC's goal to tighten markets is U.S. oil production, which has risen by more than 15 percent since mid-2016 to 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd), the highest level since the early 1970s and close to the output of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
The EIA monthly data on US crude production published Nov. 30 was also somewhat bearish,

946,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2017 06:08PM ET</span>","Trump open to biofuel policy reform, senators say after meeting","By Susan Cornwell
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is open to reforming the country's biofuels policy if it can be done in a way that protects jobs in both the refining and agriculture industries, senators said on Thursday after a meeting with Trump on the issue.
Nine lawmakers had requested the meeting to argue that the Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS, a law requiring refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the fuel supply every year, was threatening to put refineries in their districts out of business.
The Trump administration had ruled in favor of Big Corn and against the refining industry in a series of decisions this year, with senators on both sides using parliamentary procedures like holds on administrative appointments to punish rivals.
Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who led the lawmaker delegation, said Trump was open to a ""win-win"" solution.
""The group as a whole agreed with the president to reconvene next week and to expand the group and work together to find a (solution) that is a win for blue-collar workers, a win for jobs, but also a win for farmers at the same time,” he told Fox News after the meeting.
Republican Senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and James Lankford of Oklahoma also said Trump expressed a desire to help refiners in a way that protected the interests of farmers, but that more discussions were needed.
""It was just a recognition that this is a more complicated problem and we’re going to have to get everybody together from all sides,"" Lankford told reporters.
The White House said the meeting was productive and that Trump remained committed to the RFS, farmers and energy workers.
""He understands there are differing views on this issue, and the Administration looks forward to working with all the stakeholders toward a mutually agreeable path forward,"" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement.
REFINERS SEEK CHANGES
The RFS was introduced more than a decade ago by President George W. Bush as a way to boost U.S. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions, and has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year.
Refiners oppose the RFS because they say it costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year in blending and regulatory expenses while propping up demand for rival fuels. Refiners that do not have the facilities to blend biofuels must purchase credits, called RINs, from those that do and hand them into the EPA once a year.
A refining lobbyist briefed on Thursday's meeting said one possible solution discussed was capping the RINs - an idea that is opposed by the Renewable Fuels Association, the largest biofuel trade group.
The refining industry has requested tweaks to the policy in the past that would cut the annual volume targets for biofuels, allow ethanol exports to be counted against those targets, or shift the blending burden to supply terminals. 
While the leadership of the EPA, which administers the RFS, had considered some of the changes, it ultimately rejected them under pressure from Midwestern lawmakers, and slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for 2018. 
The meeting with Trump could set the stage for negotiations over legislation, but any measure would likely require cooperation from representatives of the corn belt. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said this week he was not invited to the meeting and called it ""a waste of time.""
Biofuels industry representatives did not attend the meeting.

Cruz has said he would block Iowa Agriculture Secretary Bill Northey's nomination to a key post at the U.S. Department of Agriculture until he gets a meeting about biofuels that includes all sides on the issue.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 2 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Dec. 1, confounding forecasts for a withdrawal of 7 bcf.
That compared with a drop of 33 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 42 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average decline of 69 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.695 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 264 bcf, or around 6.6%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 36 bcf, or roughly 1%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group Co., based in Anhui province, is idling 20 to 30 percent of its smelting capacity, from an annual total of 800,000 metric tons, Wang Guojian, vice commercial director, said by phone Thursday. There’s no timetable for how long the cuts may last, he said.
While other producing regions such as Shandong and Jiangxi aren’t affected, if the environmental curbs spread it should support Chinese smelters in their annual negotiations over processing fees with overseas miners, Wang said. Those talks were suspended last week without resolution on what price miners will pay to get their copper refined in 2018. China is the biggest producer and consumer of refined copper and relies on some of the world’s biggest miners for its raw material.
“If the curbs are enacted in more regions, or nationwide, that will affect demand for copper concentrate,” said Wang, adding that the company has yet to resume the negotiations.
Intense Talks
Tongling’s willingness to halt capacity shows just how much pressure is generated by the negotiations, Ji Xianfei, an analyst with Guotai Junan Futures Ltd., said by phone from Shanghai, “It’s also really hard to say how much, and how long the cuts will last,” Ji said. “The battle is intense during the annual talks.”
Even before the deadlock, the negotiations were taking longer than in previous years, Ivan Arriagada, chief executive officer of Chilean miner  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc, said in an interview last week.
While miners contend that ore is in short supply, which should spur a drop in fees, China’s smelters say they are being forced to upgrade facilities to comply with environmental rules, and charges should reflect their higher costs.
Copper rose as much 1.1 percent to $6,620 a ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at $6,589 by 1:59 p.m. in London. The metal closed at a three-year high of $7,134.50 in October, but has since retreated due to worries over slowing growth in China.
Anhui province’s government issued its order asking polluting industries such as steel, cement, and nonferrous metals to cut capacity by more than 30 percent this winter, a local newspaper reported last month.

(Reuters) - Sinopec USA, a subsidiary of Chinese oil and gas conglomerate Sinopec, has sued Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA in a U.S. court, claiming it never received full payment for an order of steel rebar. 
The lawsuit asks for $23.7 million for breach of contract and conspiracy to defraud. The legal action signals a split with another of Venezuela's biggest backers as the cash-strapped country seeks to restructure some $60 billion in debt in a landscape of low oil prices and production.
The complaint suggests ""patience is getting really thin at this point,"" said Mark Weidemaier, law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and an expert on international debt disputes. ""This is a further sign of frostiness in the Chinese-Venezuelan relations.""
PDVSA declined to comment.
China, which has loaned Venezuela more than $50 billion over the past decade, recently has been reluctant to involve itself more deeply in the South American country's debt crisis. It has curtailed its credit to Venezuela in the last 22 months because of chronic payment delays, troubles with joint venture projects, and crime faced by Chinese firms operating in the country. 
In its lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Houston on Nov. 27, Sinopec said PDVSA paid half of a 2012 purchase order for 45,000 tons of steel rebar, which is used in oil rigs, by its fully owned subsidiary Bariven.
It accused the Venezuelan oil company of using Bariven ""as a sham to perpetrate fraud against Sinopec"", and called the PDVSA subsidiary an ""undercapitalized shell with the sole purpose of preventing Sinopec from having a remedy"".
China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing on Thursday that the legal action is a ""common commercial dispute"" that should not be over-interpreted.
""We are willing to continue exploring cooperation with Venezuela in various sectors following a principle of mutual benefit and shared development,"" he said.
Any solution to Venezuela's financial crisis will need the involvement of the Chinese and Russian governments, which are owed a substantial amount from the country. A Russian state-owned shipping company, Sovcomflot, also brought suit last year against PDVSA in connection with over $30 million in unpaid shipping fees. 
PDVSA is in talks with a handful of European companies to obtain credit for oil and gas projects in a bid to reverse a slump in output to an almost 30-year low, and has been seeking financing from China and Russia.
But kidnappings and thefts in Caracas have prompted some Chinese executives working in the country to move to Colombia to escape the problems, sources have said. Chinese-run infrastructure projects also have faced delays. 
    Car makers and small grocery stores that flourished under late president Hugo Chavez due to preferential currency exchange terms have either closed or downsized. Current president Nicolas Maduro no longer offers the same preferential terms for Chinese businesses to have access to cheap imports. 

    ""The Chinese don't have a whole lot to show for their loans,"" a Western diplomat in Caracas said.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures tacked on 17 cents, or about 0.3%, to $56.13 a barrel by 3:50AM ET (0850GMT), after plunging 2.9% a day earlier, its biggest daily decline in more than two months. Prices touched an intraday low of $55.82, their worst level since Nov. 20.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., were at $61.50 a barrel, up 28 cents, or around 0.5%, from their last close. The contract suffered a drop of 2.6% in the prior session after hitting its lowest since Nov. 17.
Oil prices sank on Wednesday after data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a big jump in U.S. fuel inventories while domestic production hit another weekly record.
The latest EIA weekly data showed U.S. gasoline stocks rose by 6.8 million barrels, much higher than expectations.
U.S. crude oil production rose by 25,000 barrels per day (bpd) last week to 9.71 million bpd, bringing output close to levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
The report also showed that U.S. crude oil inventories fell by 5.6 million barrels to 448.1 million, putting stocks below seasonal levels in 2015 and 2016.
Fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies are weighed on sentiment, according to market participants.
The producer group, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed last week to extend current oil output cuts for a further nine months until the end of 2018. The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
In other energy trading, gasoline futures tacked on 0.3 cents, or 0.2%, to $1.670 a gallon, after hitting its lowest since mid-October in the previous session, while heating oil added 0.7 cents to $1.868 a gallon.
Natural gas futures sank 5.3 cents, or 1.8%, to $2.869 per million British thermal units, as traders looked ahead to weekly storage data due later in the global day.

Comex gold futures were at $1,260.80 a troy ounce by 3:05AM ET (0805GMT), down $5.50, or about 0.4%, from the last session's closing price. It touched its lowest level since Aug. 8 at $1,258.10 earlier.
The yellow metal notched a minor gain of 0.1% on Wednesday, as investors continued to track progress made by U.S. lawmakers to pass a bill that will overhaul the American tax system.
The U.S. Senate voted on Wednesday to go to a conference committee with the House to negotiate a plan to reform the tax system, amid early signs that lawmakers could bridge their differences and agree on a final bill ahead of a self-imposed Dec. 22 deadline.
Some investors also believe the boost to the economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a faster pace.
Meanwhile, worries over a potential U.S. government shutdown eased after a bill advanced in the House of Representatives late on Wednesday to extend current federal funding through Dec. 22, with the chamber expected to take up the bill on Thursday.
Congress is facing a deadline of Friday at midnight to pass fresh spending legislation. If they cannot agree on the terms, parts of the federal government could shut down.
The dollar firmed as investors digested the developments on Capitol Hill. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, rose to its highest level in more than two weeks.
Besides politics, investors also looked ahead to key U.S. economic data due later in the session for fresh clues on the likely trajectory of monetary policy in the months ahead.
The highlight of Thursday's economic calendar will be the weekly jobless claims report at 8:30AM ET (1330GMT).
Investors are also looking ahead to Friday's nonfarm payrolls report, which would be the last employment report before the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting next week.
The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates following its meeting on Dec. 13. However, markets appeared doubtful over the central bank's ability to raise rates as much as it would like next year due to concern over the sluggish inflation outlook.
In other metals trading, silver futures declined 4.5 cents, or 0.3%, to $15.91 a troy ounce, the lowest since mid-July.
Meanwhile, copper futures held near a more than two-month low touched earlier this week, as concerns over demand in top consumer China continued to weigh.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices inched higher on Thursday after a data report showed a decrease in U.S. crude inventories, but rising gasoline stocks and crude production weighed on the market. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $56.18 a barrel at 0424 GMT, up 22 cents, or 0.4 percent from their last settlement.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1), the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $61.49 a barrel, up 27 cents, or 0.44 percent.

The slightly higher prices also came after a big sell-off in late U.S. trading. 
""WTI prices cratered (on Wednesday) despite a drop in weekly crude inventories ... Traders were more concerned about the steep rise in gasoline inventories,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. 
Gasoline stocks  rose 6.8 million barrels, to 220.9 million barrels, according to the report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), much more than analyst expectations in a Reuters poll for a gain of 1.7 million barrels. 
""This suggests that refiners may not need to process as much crude in the future,"" ANZ said in a note on Thursday. 
""The EIA report also showed that U.S. production increased again,"" the bank said. 
U.S. crude production  climbed by 25,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.71 million bpd, the highest since monthly figures showing the United States produced more than 10 million bpd in the early 1970s. 
Soaring U.S. output threatens to undermine efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to bring production and demand into balance following years of oversupply. 
Sukrit Vijayakar, managing director of energy consultancy Trifecta warned there were ""darker shadows over the pace of rebalancing, if at all any is taking place.""

Expectations for Congress to pass a funding bill stoked sentiment on the greenback as it remained close to session highs, pressuring gold to give up early session gains.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, thus reduces demand for precious metal.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for January delivery rose 0.39% to $56.18 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent edged up 0.36% to $61.48 a barrel.
Overnight, crude oil prices settled sharply lower on Wednesday after data showing crude stockpiles fell for the third straight week failed to offset a larger-than-expected build in gasoline supplies.
Crude oil prices came under pressure after a mostly bearish Energy Information Agency (EIA) inventory report showed crude stockpiles fell more-than-estimated, but inventories of both gasoline and distillates rose more-than-expected.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 5.6 million barrels for the week ended Dec. 2, beating expectations of a draw of 3.4 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – rose by 6.8 million barrels, well above expectations for rise of 1.7 million barrels, while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – rose by about 1.7 million barrels, above expectations for a draw of 967,000 barrels.
Market participants noted that while it was not uncommon for gasoline stockpiles to expand in the December period, the massive build in supplies pointed to possible weakness in gasoline demand.
The unexpected rise in product inventories comes against the backdrop of bullish sentiment on oil prices following OPEC's decision last week to extend the output agreement through 2018.

964,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 06, 2017 03:30PM ET</span>",OPEC's Surprise Oil-Output Deal With Libya Seen as Empty Gesture,"(Bloomberg) -- OPEC appeared to score a diplomatic coup last week by persuading Libya, its most troubled member, to accept production limits. In reality, the agreement probably means little for the oil market.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners agreed on Nov. 30 to persevere with supply curbs until the end of next year, in a bid to drain oversupplied world markets. In a surprise addition, an output cap was imposed on members Libya and Nigeria, which had previously been spared any obligations while they struggled to recover barrels lost to armed conflict and sabotage.
The pact seemed to be a reversal for Libya, whose top oil official, Mustafa Sanalla, had outlined the country’s aspirations to revive exports and its need for leniency while nation rebuilding took place.
Yet in practice, the production cap of about 1 million barrels a day imposes little constraint on Tripoli, which is barely able to push output any higher, consultants Eurasia Group and Wood Mackenzie say. Libya plans to abide by the target next year, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the information isn’t public.
“The OPEC quota doesn’t matter,” said Riccardo Fabiani, an analyst at Eurasia Group. “Moving beyond 1 million barrels a day in 2018 is going to be very difficult anyway.”
With a fragile political accord barely holding the country together, Libya faces an array of challenges preventing its return to the output levels of about 1.6 million barrels a day pumped before the 2011 uprising against Muammar Qaddafi.
Potential Threats
Pipelines and other facilities are targeted by armed factions and tribal groups jostling for political control and a share of oil revenues.
“It would be an achievement in itself if Libya was able to maintain current rates of production,” said Martijn Murphy, research manager for North African upstream at Wood Mackenzie. “There’s still no central unity government, and so the potential for violence to flare is acute, and the threat of militias and tribes shutting down oil pipelines, valves or ports is ongoing.”
One of the biggest constraints for Libya is financial as National Oil Corp. struggles to pay suppliers and engineers and conduct necessary maintenance, Fabiani said. NOC chairman Sanalla said in London in October that the company was receiving only 25 percent of its stipulated investment budget.
Russia, which set aside decades of rivalry with OPEC to join the production deal, had pressed the organization to impose caps on Libya and Nigeria. While the two countries were exempt from the accord hammered out last winter, the recovery in their output this year undermined the efforts of fellow producers to eliminate a global oil glut.
Output Pledge
Details on the terms were scarce even as OPEC’s meeting concluded in Vienna, with no reference to the cap made in the cartel’s closing statement or a notice issued afterward by Libya’s NOC. There is a confidential document that commits Nigeria and Libya to limit their production to the highest level reached this year, without citing any figures, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because that pledge will be kept private.
Libya and Nigeria are to restrict their combined production to no more than 2.8 million barrels a day, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said after last week’s meeting in Vienna.
Despite the challenges the country faces, Libya might be able to pump slightly more next year, Wood Mackenzie’s Murphy said. Still, that would require rehabilitation of its main export terminals, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, and the development of oil fields in the west and south of the country, he said.
Both Wood Mackenzie and Eurasia said they expect that, if Libya can increase production next year, it will do so, regardless of the agreement with OPEC. Other members of the organization, particularly Iraq and the United Arab Emirates, have flouted the production limits they submitted to.
Libya “can cheat and exceed the quota and nobody will say anything,” said Eurasia’s Fabiani. “It’s basically a nominal, or a paper, target that really doesn’t mean much to OPEC.”"

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Petrochemicals company Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SE:2010) is considering several possible investments in the United States, while state oil giant Saudi Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] is looking at gas prospects abroad, Saudi energy minister said on Wednesday.
However, Saudi Aramco's interest in gas investments is closer to home, probably in Africa or the Mediterranean, Khalid al-Falih told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference in Abu Dhabi.
""SABIC ... is looking at multiple investments in the U.S., taking advantage of this plentiful gas supply, especially ethane, to crack it and create petrochemical products not only for the U.S. but for exports out of the U.S. to grow its markets around the world,"" Falih said.
Last month SABIC's chief executive, Yousef al-Benyan, told Reuters the world's fourth-biggest petrochemicals company planned to make a decision by the end of next year on an investment in a cracker plant in Texas with an affiliate of  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM).
""The U.S. gas (market) is already saturated, there are plenty of investors. I don’t think the U.S. needs further investments from Saudi Aramco ... Aramco's interest in international gas is probably elsewhere, closer to home perhaps in Africa or the Mediterranean,"" Falih said on Wednesday.
Falih, who is also Aramco's chairman, said last year that Aramco was interested in investing in international upstream ventures, particularly gas, and could invest in importing gas into the kingdom.
U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Wednesday that he has held discussions with Saudi Arabian officials on possible imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States.
Perry was speaking at the same industry conference in Abu Dhabi in the course of his first official visit to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar this week.
The U.S. energy chief has met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman and Falih and visited Saudi Aramco during his trip.
Aramco is preparing for a share listing next year, aimed at getting a valuation of up to $2 trillion for the company in what could be the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO).

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that gasoline inventories increased by 6.8 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 1., much higher than expectations for a gain of 1.7 million barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a gain of 1.7 million barrels.
The report also showed that crude oil inventories fell by 5.6 million barrels last week. That compared with analysts' expectations for a decline of 3.4 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply-drop of around 5.5 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 2.75 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 448.1 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be in the middle of the average range for this time of year.
U.S. crude oil imports averaged 7.2 million barrels per day last week, down by 127,000 barrels per day from the previous week.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 82 cents, or about 1.4%, to $56.80 a barrel by 10:35AM ET (1535GMT). Prices were at around $56.84 prior to the release of the inventory data.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., were at $62.18 a barrel, down 66 cents, or 1.1%, from their last close.
Oil prices notched a slight gain in a rangebound session Tuesday, supported by OPEC’s agreement to extend production cuts through next year.

The greenback found support after data showed that the U.S. private sector added 190,000 jobs in November.

Natural gas futures have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early-winter heating demand.
Prices of the fuel typically rise ahead of the winter as colder weather sparks heating demand. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, investors looked ahead to weekly data from the U.S. on gas supplies in storage. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release its official weekly natural gas storage report for the week ended Dec. 1 at 10:30AM ET (1530GMT) Thursday, amid expectations for a withdrawal in a range between 3 and 12 billion cubic feet (bcf).
That compares with a drop of 33 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 42 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average decline of 69 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.693 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 309 bcf, or around 7.7%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 107 bcf, or roughly 2.8%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

972,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2017 08:24AM ET</span>",Oil falls as rise in U.S. fuel stocks suggests easing demand,"By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell on Wednesday after a surprise rise in U.S. inventories of refined products that suggested demand may be flagging.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were down 79 cents at $62.07 a barrel by 1253 GMT, after reaching a session high of $62.93, while U.S. crude futures (CLc1) dropped 81 cents to $56.81.
With global equities under pressure from sliding technology stocks and the U.S. bond market suggesting investors are cautious about the economic outlook, industrial commodities such as crude and copper are feeling the pinch. 
Supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers that were extended at a meeting last week for the rest of 2018 have helped lift Brent prices by more than 40 percent since June.
But the price has slipped from November's peak at around $65 a barrel, the highest since mid-2015. 
""The turn-down in risk sentiment is a nice justification for why you might want to pare down some of the long positions taken going into the OPEC meeting,"" London Capital Group's head of research Jasper Lawler said.
""If you are looking across the asset spectrum and looking to sell things that have done well, then oil fits into that category,"" he said.
Traders said prices fell after an American Petroleum Institute (API) report on Tuesday that showed a 9.2 million barrel rise in gasoline stocks in the week ended Dec. 1, and an increase of 4.3 million barrels in distillate inventories, which include motor diesel and heating oil.
PVM Oil Associates strategist Stephen Brennock said the increase appeared to be seasonal. ""This bears all the hallmarks of a year-end lull in U.S. fuel demand which in turn should help safeguard the current bout of range-bound trading,"" he said.
Another factor weighing on prices has been a rise in U.S. oil production , which has climbed by 15 percent since mid-2016 to 9.68 million barrels per day, close to levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Georgi Slavov, head of research at commodity broker Marex Spectron, said a weaker economic performance and a decline in refinery capacity utilization in the first quarter could be a further drag on demand for crude and prices.
For now, he said demand remained firm, which he said was keeping Brent above $60 a barrel. But he added: ""This is likely to change as we approach 2018.""

""We are starting to pick up weakness in the macro performance of key oil consuming regions. We are also starting to take note of the forthcoming January–February decline in refinery capacity utilization,"" he said.

973,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 06, 2017 07:31AM ET</span>",Copper Is Flashing Red as Stockpiles and Spreads Point Bearish,"(Bloomberg) -- Copper is coming off the biggest one-day slump in two years and the mood in the market is souring. Even though prices are still up dramatically this year, here are four reasons traders are cautious for the future.
Supply Swell
Copper inventories held in global exchanges remain stubbornly high, even after heavy disruptions to supply from mines in Chile and Indonesia at the start of the year. A large inflow on to the London Metal Exchange was a catalyst in Tuesday’s rout, as it sent a reminder that the market isn’t short of metal.
Loose Spreads
The forward price curve also signals that loose supply conditions may persist in the coming months. Benchmark three-month copper prices are trading at a discount to forward contracts expiring at later dates, a condition known as a contango that’s common in oversupplied markets. That contrasts with zinc, where buyers are paying significant premiums for nearby contracts amid prospects of a supply squeeze.
China Flatlines
Synchronized global growth has been a key driver for industrial metals this year, but concerns are mounting that China’s crackdown on its property market will be a headwind going forward. Physical delivery premiums covering the cost of shipping copper to top user China have been subdued this year, suggesting that the country’s buying needs aren’t placing a strain on supply.
Shanghai Reversal
Copper’s recent selloff has also been partly driven by concerns about a large long position that accumulated in Shanghai Futures Exchange contracts in recent months, Nicholas Snowdon, a metals analyst at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc, said by phone from London. 
Investors are questioning how and when the position will be unwound and have grown cautious about putting on their own bullish bets. The sharp swings in prices seen during SHFE trading sessions on Tuesday suggests that the position is now being unwound, Snowdon said, adding that that could add to short-term pressure on prices.
Copper slumped as much as 4.7 percent on the LME on Tuesday to the lowest in two months. The metal is still up 19 percent this year, the most since 2010, at $6,570.50 a metric ton.
“There could still be a further $200-300 downside from here, but if people see that that position has been scaled back sharply, that could take a lot of the negative pressure off the price,” Snowdon said.

974,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2017 06:10AM ET</span>",Oil analysts grow more bullish after OPEC extends output deal: Reuters poll,"By Koustav Samanta and Swati Verma
(Reuters) - Oil analysts have raised their forecasts for the crude price next year after major producers agreed to extend output cuts, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
Political tensions in Saudi Arabia, production disruptions in Libya and Nigeria and economic depression in Venezuela that has cut crude output will also support oil prices, the analysts said.
Benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 are now forecast to average $58.84 in 2018, up more than $3 from $55.71 estimated in the previous poll at the end of October.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, last week extended their deal to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of 2018 to end persistent oversupply. 
The group signaled it may stage an early exit from the deal if the market overheats and triggers too much of a price rise.
""The OPEC cut extension is expected to send a positive signal regarding faster rebalancing in the oil markets... Strong compliance is expected from OPEC as the OPEC economies are still heavily dependent on oil revenues to meet their fiscal budget deficits and hence they need higher oil prices,"" said Rahul Prithiani, director at CRISIL Research.
Some analysts, however, expressed doubts over compliance from non-OPEC countries, especially Russia, which has plans to expand production from its newer oilfields. 
""The main positive surprise involved Libya and Nigeria, previously exempted (from the deal), which will now be subject to a cumulative production cap,"" said Daniela Corsini, commodity market economist at  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) in Milan.
Oil prices have rallied strongly in the second half of this year, on a growing belief that the OPEC-led output cuts, coupled with strong consumption, were bringing the market back into balance. Brent crude was trading above $62 a barrel on Tuesday.
The North Sea benchmark, which has recovered about 25 percent since the deal was announced last year, is expected to average $54.19 per barrel in 2017.
OPEC AND ASIA
OPEC oil output fell in November by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) to its lowest since May, while compliance with pledged supply curbs rose to 112 percent. 
The survey of 30 economists and analysts forecast U.S. crude futures CLc1 would average $54.78 per barrel in 2018, up from a previous forecast of $52.50. WTI was expected to average $50.65 a barrel this year.
Asia will be a key driver of global demand growth, helping to tighten the balance between supply and consumption, analysts said.
""Non-OECD demand could rise by up to 1.3 million barrels per day in 2018, largely driven by China and India,"" said Giorgos Beleris, analyst at Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts.
The biggest increase in exports to Asia has been coming from the United States, partly stimulated by a reduction in export volumes from the Middle East. 
Rising U.S. shale production has increased the discount of U.S. crude futures to Brent to around $5 per barrel, meaning it is cheaper for Asian buyers.

975,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 06, 2017 03:36AM ET</span>",U.S. Oil Prices Dip Ahead of EIA Weekly Supply Report,"Investing.com - Crude prices were a bit lower in early dealings on Wednesday, amid speculation weekly supply data due later in the day will show a sizable gain in U.S. gasoline and fuel supplies.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended Dec. 1 at 10:30AM ET (1530GMT).
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories dropped by nearly 5.5 million barrels last week. That compared with analysts' expectations for a decline of around 3.4 million barrels.
However, the API report also showed a whopping gain of around 9.2 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks, which include motor diesel and heating oil, increased by about 4.3 million barrels.
There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 10 cents, or about 0.2%, to $57.52 a barrel by 3:35AM ET (0835GMT), after inching up 0.3% a day earlier.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., were at $62.91 a barrel, up 6 cents, or 0.1%, from their last close. The contract enjoyed a gain of 0.6% in the prior session.
Oil prices notched a slight gain in a range-bound session Tuesday, supported by OPEC’s agreement to extend production cuts through next year.
The producer group, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed last week to extend current oil output cuts for a further nine months until the end of 2018. The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
The OPEC-led production cuts have been one of the key catalyst supporting the recent rally in oil prices amid expectations that rebalancing in crude markets are well underway.
However, fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies are prevented prices from rising much further, according to market participants.
Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 15% since the most recent low in mid-2016, and increasing drilling activity for new production means output is expected to grow further, as producers are attracted by climbing prices.
In other energy trading, gasoline futures tacked on 0.8 cents, or 0.5%, to $1.710 a gallon, while heating oil lost 0.4 cents to $1.910 a gallon.
Natural gas futures jumped 2.2 cents, or 0.8%, to $2.936 per million British thermal units.

Besides politics, investors also looked ahead to key U.S. economic data due later in the session for fresh clues on the likely trajectory of monetary policy in the months ahead.
The highlight of Wednesday's economic calendar will be the ADP jobs report at 8:15AM ET (1315GMT), which is often seen as a warmup act for the big Friday government nonfarm payrolls report, which would be the last employment report before the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting next week.
The U.S. central bank is scheduled to hold its final policy meeting of the year on Dec. 12-13, with interest rate futures pricing in a 100% chance of a rate hike at that meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. However, markets appeared doubtful over the central bank's ability to raise rates as much as it would like next year due to concern over the sluggish inflation outlook.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
In other metals trading, silver futures tacked on 8.0 cents, or 0.5%, to $16.15 a troy ounce, after hitting its lowest since mid-July in the previous session.
Platinum was down 0.2% at $915.55, while palladium inched up 0.4% at $981.05 an ounce.
Meanwhile, copper futures rose 1.6 cents, or 0.5%, to $2.962 a pound. Futures plunged 4.6% to their weakest level since Oct. 3 in the last session as concerns over demand in top consumer China pushed investors to sell the red metal.

There was little immediate reaction to reports that  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) received a subpoena from US special counsel Robert Mueller related to his Russia election meddling investigation and the bank's business with President Trump.
Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's personal lawyers, said Deutsche Bank has not received any subpoena for financial records relating to the president as part of Mueller's probe.
""We have confirmed that the news reports that the Special Counsel had subpoenaed financial records relating to the president are false,” Sekulow said. “No subpoena has been issued or received. We have confirmed this with the bank and other sources.""
Overnight, gold prices fell to six-week lows on Tuesday as dollar strength continued on the back of recent investor optimism surrounding tax reform.
Gold prices fell as bullish sentiment in risk markets continued amid growing investor expectations that the Senate and House of Representatives will reconciled their respective bills, ensuring that the final bill will reach President Donald Trump for approval before year-end.
Also weighing on the dollar was ongoing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for third time this year at the conclusion of its next meeting on Dec.13.
According to investing.com’s fed rate monitor 100% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates in December.

986,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 05, 2017 10:01AM ET</span>","Oil to Open '18 Stuck Between Thirst to Grow, Wary Investors","(Bloomberg) -- Investor exhaustion with poor returns from the oil and gas industry may mean less financing to expand the U.S. shale boom next year, and less of a drive for consolidation.
After nearing a record in 2016, equity issues from U.S. oil and gas companies are on pace for an eight-year low this year, amid doubts about the stability of the rally in global crude prices. Mergers and acquisitions and initial public offerings got off to a strong start but petered out as the year wore on.
While explorers including Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC). and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) have preached the need for fiscal discipline, investors remain skeptical, said Bobby Tudor, chairman of Houston-based investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. That’s tightened the flow of new money into the industry, and it’s likely to chill deal-making as buyers and sellers alike wait for stock prices to rebound.
“You’ve had a decoupling, where the companies have not followed oil prices higher, and the investor apathy has been stunning,"" Tudor said in a telephone interview. “What investors are saying is that as soon as oil peaks its nose above the parapet of $60 a barrel, the switch will go on and all those drilling rigs will go back to work.""
West Texas Intermediate crude futures steadied just above $57 a barrel Tuesday, up almost 7 percent for the year, as traders digested last week’s decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers to extend supply curbs through 2018. Still, as prices rise, so do investor fears that shale drillers -- companies used to emphasizing growth above all else -- will refocus on boosting production.
The S&P 500 Energy Index is down 7.5 percent for 2017. It’s a sign of the skepticism that has rippled through capital markets all year.
U.S. energy stock issues topped $41 billion last year, as explorers including Anadarko,  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN). and Concho Resources Inc. looked to shore up finances amid weak oil prices or to fund expansion into new shale plays. This year, offerings are down by half, at $19.9 billion as of Monday. The number of issues is down as well, from 110 last year to 63 so far in 2017.
The industry has turned instead to debt financing, with high-yield energy bond issues almost doubling this year to more than $50 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bond numbers were inflated somewhat by a series of refinancing deals by top drillers, as well as a bevy of issues by pipeline companies.
Initial public offerings by U.S. oil and gas companies climbed in 2017, dominated by spinoffs of pipeline and infrastructure divisions by the likes of  Hess Corp  (NYSE:HES). and  BP  (LON:BP) Plc. Still, IPOs trailed off in the second half of the year, with only one new issue so far in the fourth quarter -- by Houston-based oilfield water-management business AQTWM Inc.
M&A followed the same pattern, surging early on as explorers shelled out billions for acreage in shale plays like the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico. Activity tailed off as pessimism spread among investors. Would-be buyers found their stock prices no longer an attractive currency to finance deals, and sellers were unhappy with the offers they received, although private equity-backed transactions picked up some of the slack.
That’s unlikely to change any time soon, said Tudor. With equity markets now focused on share buybacks, dividends and other returns, there’s less appetite for acquisitions that simply grow a company’s inventory of wells to drill, he said. Investors will need to see two to three quarters of fiscal discipline and growing cash flows before the climate shifts, he predicted.
“The equity window is closed,"" Tudor said. “The market is basically saying, ‘No, I’d rather you grow less and actually give me back some money.""

987,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 05, 2017 09:52AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices Mixed on OPEC Hopes Vs. Output Worries,"Investing.com - Crude oil prices were mixed on Tuesday, as the decision last week by global oil producers to continuu limiting production lent support to the commodity, while sustained worries over U.S. production levels weighed.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude January contract was little changed at $57.44 a barrel by 09:50 a.m. ET (13:50 GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for February delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up 12 cents or about 0.19% at $62.56 a barrel.
Prices were pressured lower by worries rising U.S. shale output could dampen the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
Recent data showed that U.S. energy companies added two oil rigs in the week to Dec. 1, bringing the total count up to 749, the highest since September.
Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 15% since the most recent low in mid-2016, and increasing drilling activity for new production means output is expected to grow further, as producers are attracted by climbing prices.
Market participants were looking ahead to the American Petroleum Institute's weekly report due later Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. ET (21:30 GMT).
Crude had climbed after OPEC, along with some non-OPEC producers led by Russia, agreed last week to extend current oil output cuts for a further nine months until the end of 2018. They also signaled a possible early exit from the deal should the market overheat and prices rise too far.

U.S. natural gas futures sank 5.5 cents, or around 1.8%, to $2.930 per million British thermal units by 8:15AM ET (1315GMT), after plunging 7.6 cents, or 2.5%, a day earlier.
Monday's plunge came as weather models predicted mild weather across most parts of the continental United States starting from Dec. 15. Initial forecasts called for much colder weather during the period.
Natural gas futures have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early-winter heating demand.
Prices of the fuel typically rise ahead of the winter as colder weather sparks heating demand. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 3 and 12 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Dec. 1.
That compares with a drop of 33 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 42 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average decline of 69 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.693 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 309 bcf, or around 7.7%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 107 bcf, or roughly 2.8%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil steadied above $62 a barrel on Tuesday as expectations of a drop in U.S. crude inventories and prolonged supply curbs by OPEC and other producers countered rising output in the United States.
An OPEC-led producer group last week extended a supply-cutting deal through 2018, but the resulting support for prices could bolster U.S. output which climbed to nearly 9.5 million barrels per day in September.
Brent crude , the global benchmark, was down 11 cents at $62.34 a barrel by 0950 GMT. U.S. crude, known as West Texas Intermediate, was down 20 cents at $57.27.
""U.S. output will play the most significant role on the supply front in 2018,"" said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM.
""A jump above $60 in WTI could easily push U.S. production over the 10 million bpd mark, increasing the non-OPEC forecast and capping further attempts to push prices higher.""
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other non-OPEC producers last week extended their deal to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of 2018. 
OPEC and its allies are trying to get rid of excess oil in storage. They have made progress in this task and the latest U.S. inventory reports are likely to show a third straight weekly drop in crude stocks. [EIA/S]
Analysts expect the reports from industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) and the government's Energy Information Administration (EIA) to show crude stocks fell by 3.5 million barrels.
The API report is out at 2130 GMT on Tuesday, followed by the government supply report on Wednesday.
OPEC has shown strong compliance with the supply cut pledge and in November output fell by 300,000 bpd to its lowest since May, according to a Reuters survey. 

However, rising U.S. oil production presents a headwind for OPEC's efforts and data last week showed U.S. crude output rose to nearly 9.5 million bpd in September, approaching the high of 9.63 million bpd seen in 2015.

Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (2130GMT) Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 3.5 million barrels, which would mark the third-straight fall.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 24 cents, or about 0.4%, to $57.23 a barrel by 3:20AM ET (0820GMT), after slumping 1.5% a day earlier.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., were at $62.22 a barrel, down 23 cents, or 0.4%, from their last close. The contract suffered a loss of 2% in the prior session.
Oil prices settled lower Monday amid worries that rising U.S. shale output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
Recent data showed that U.S. energy companies added two oil rigs in the week to Dec. 1, bringing the total count up to 749, the highest since September.
Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 15% since the most recent low in mid-2016, and increasing drilling activity for new production means output is expected to grow further, as producers are attracted by climbing prices.
Losses were limited thanks to OPEC’s decision to extend its output cuts to the end of next year. The producer group, along with some non-OPEC members led by Russia, agreed last week to extend current oil output cuts for a further nine months until the end of 2018.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.

The highlight of Tuesday's economic calendar will be the ISM non-manufacturing survey for November due at 10AM ET (1500GMT). There is also international trade data at 8:30AM ET (1330GMT).
Investors are also looking ahead to the upcoming U.S. nonfarm payrolls report later this week, which would be the last employment report before the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting next week.
The U.S. central bank is scheduled to hold its final policy meeting of the year on Dec. 12-13, with interest rate futures pricing in a 100% chance of a rate hike at that meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. However, markets appeared doubtful over the central bank's ability to raise rates as much as it would like next year due to concern over the sluggish inflation outlook.

The comment is the strongest sign yet that the central government is increasingly worried, just two weeks into the winter heating season, about the unintended consequences of its experiment to switch the northern part of the country to cleaner burning natural gas from coal.
China made the switch to eliminate the smog that blankets the north during the winter and is caused by emissions from power plants fired by coal, the country's primary fuel source.
Prices of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have soared over the past month, hitting record highs this week, as 28 cities have turned on their heating systems and factories have converted to the fuel for the first time.
Last week, two major consuming provinces, Hebei and Shandong, warned of shortages and were forced to cut gas supplies to factories in a dramatic step that highlighted the country's insufficient infrastructure and domestic supplies.
The paper made the warning amid reports that insufficient gas supplies have left some residents without any heating, the paper said.
""Any measures to run after a 'blue sky', including the 'gas-replacing-coal' campaign some local governments have launched, should fully consider residents' needs and be tailored to local conditions,"" said the editorial.
""They should not be advanced using a one-size-fits-all approach.""
The local authorities have ""good intentions"" by implementing the central government's policy, but it should not be at the cost of some people's well-being and at the risk of their health, it said.
State-owned gas producers are trying to address public concerns about a potential heating crisis a day after the state planner ordered eight regions to ""regulate"" the gas market.
PetroChina has started up the third phase of the West-East gas transmission project, the government said on Tuesday. The new line can carry 30 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas from fields in Central Asia and the western region of Xinjiang to consumers in the east.
Separately, China National Offshore Oil Co (CNOOC) [SASACY.UL] (HK:0883), the country's largest LNG importer, said it has hired two LNG tankers for emergency storage for the first time to ensure adequate supplies and prevent skyrocketing prices.

CNOOC has said it aims to have 20 bcm of natural gas on hand this winter. China's winter gas demand will hit a record 23 bcm this year, energy consultants Wood Mackenzie estimate.

LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC oil output fell in November by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) to its lowest since May, a Reuters survey found, pressured by a drop in Angolan and Iraqi exports, strong compliance with a supply cut deal and involunary declines.
OPEC's adherence to pledged supply curbs rose to 112 percent from October's 92 percent, the survey found. Top exporter Saudi Arabia pumped below its OPEC target, as did all other members except Ecuador, Gabon and the United Arab Emirates.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is reducing output by about 1.2 million bpd as part of a deal with Russia and other non-member producers, which have also committed to production cuts.
Oil (LCOc1) is trading near a two-year high supported by falling inventories, strong demand and high compliance with the promised curbs. The producers at a Nov. 30 meeting extended the deal until the end of 2018, as expected.
""Based on the recent past we can start the New Year with relative optimism as far as conformity is concerned,"" said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM. ""The outcome of last Thursday's meeting looks constructive.""
The biggest drop in output in November, of 100,000 bpd, came from Angola where exports fell to a 13-month low. Angolan exports have been curbed in recent months by field maintenance.
The second-largest came from Iraq. Output and exports in northern Iraq fell in mid-October when Iraqi forces retook control of oilfields from Kurdish fighters who had been there since 2014, and declined further last month. 
A boost in exports from Iraq's south, the outlet for most of the country's crude, to 3.50 million bpd in November has not quite offset the decline from the north, the survey found.
The decline means Iraq, a laggard on compliance compared to OPEC peers like Saudi Arabia earlier this year, has delivered its highest adherence yet, according to Reuters surveys.
Production in Venezuela, where the oil industry is starved of funds due to the country's economic depression, declined further below its OPEC target, the survey found. Both exports and refinery operations were lower in November.
Algerian output declined for a second month because of planned oilfield maintenance.
Nigeria and Libya, the two producers exempt from the cut whose extra barrels helped OPEC output reach a 2017 high in July, both pumped less in November according to the survey.
Nigerian output slipped by 40,000 bpd. The country's largest crude stream, Qua Iboe, was scheduled in November to export five cargoes, as much as half the rate normally seen.
Libyan output slipped by 30,000 bpd as protests impacted output at a Wintershall field. Libyan production remains volatile and, on average, below levels seen earlier this year.
OPEC agreed to cap Nigerian and Libyan output for 2018 at last week's meeting.
Saudi Arabia trimmed output by 30,000 bpd, according to sources in the survey, further below its OPEC target.
OPEC last year announced a production target of 32.50 million bpd. The target includes Indonesia, which has since left OPEC, and does not include Equatorial Guinea, the latest country to join.
According to the survey, output in November has averaged 32.35 million bpd, about 600,000 bpd above the target adjusted to remove Indonesia and not including Equatorial Guinea.
With Equatorial Guinea, OPEC production in November totaled 32.48 million bpd, down 300,000 bpd from October and the lowest since 32.44 million bpd in May according to Reuters surveys.

The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data, and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 15% since the most recent low in mid-2016, and increasing drilling activity for new production means output is expected to grow further, as producers are attracted by climbing prices.
Prices had climbed after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with some non-OPEC producers led by Russia, agreed last week to extend current oil output cuts for a further nine months until the end of 2018. They also signaled a possible early exit from the deal should the market overheat and prices rise too far.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
The OPEC-led production cuts have been one of the key catalyst supporting the recent rally in oil prices amid expectations that rebalancing in crude markets are well underway.

The commodity surged 8.8% last week, marking the largest weekly percentage gain since Dec. 2016, as bullish speculators placed bets that cold winter weather will boost demand for the heating fuel.
Natural gas futures have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early-winter heating demand.

Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 3 and 12 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Dec. 1.
That compares with a drop of 33 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 42 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average decline of 69 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.693 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 309 bcf, or around 7.7%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 107 bcf, or roughly 2.8%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

The greenback strengthened after the U.S. Senate approved a tax overhaul late Friday, marking President Donald Trump first major political victory.
The Trump administration has said its tax cuts will generate growth and spark inflation, which investors hope will prompt a faster pace of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.27% at 93.06.
Gold is sensitive to moves in the dollar. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency.
However, fresh political turmoil in the U.S. was expected to weigh after former national security adviser Michael Flynn said he is prepared to cooperate in the special counsel probe into alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia during last year’s election.
Flynn pleaded guilty Friday morning to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his communications with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. in December 2016.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures were up 0.10% at $16.41 a troy ounce."

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell on Monday after U.S. shale drillers added more rigs last week, but prices still held close to their highest since mid-2015, supported by an extension to output cuts agreed last week by OPEC and other producers. 
Drillers in the United States added two oil rigs in the week to Dec. 1, bringing the total count to 749, the highest since September, energy services company Baker Hughes said in its closely followed report late on Friday. 
February Brent crude futures were down 54 cents at $63.19 a barrel by 1003 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate was down 61 cents at $57.75. 
The Brent price hit a two-year high of $64.65 a month ago and has since attracted record investment by fund managers.[O/ICE] 
The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, has risen sharply from 477 active rigs a year ago after energy companies boosted spending plans for 2017. [RIG/U] 
Drillers were encouraged during 2017 to increase activity as crude prices started recovering from a multi-year price slump after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC producers, including Russia, agreed to production cuts a year ago. 
Last week the producers agreed to extend those cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of next year. 
""Market reaction has been positive so far. There are only two worrying aspects ... one is that Iraq’s indiscipline has not been discussed, at least not publicly,"" PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said, referring to Iraq's poor compliance with the deal. [OPEC/c]
""The second is OPEC’s own forecast for next year. They are by far the most bullish on 2018, with the annual call on their oil at 33.42 million bpd. This compares with the EIA estimate of 32.70 million bpd and IEA prediction of 32.38 million bpd.""
The latest agreement allows for producers to exit the deal early if the market overheats. Russian officials had expressed concern that extending the cuts might encourage U.S. shale oil companies, which have been a thorn in OPEC's side, to pump more crude. 

U.S. output rose in September to 9.5 million bpd, the highest monthly output since 9.6 million bpd in April 2015, government data shows. On an annual basis, U.S. output peaked at 9.6 million bpd in 1970.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 48 cents, or about 0.8%, to $57.88 a barrel by 5:50AM ET (1050GMT). Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., were at $63.35 a barrel, down 38 cents, or 0.6%, from their last close.
Brent marked a climb of about 0.4%, while WTI lost 1% last week.
U.S. energy companies added two oil rigs in the week to Dec. 1, bringing the total count up to 749, the highest since September,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE)'s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.
Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 15% since the most recent low in mid-2016, and increasing drilling activity for new production means output is expected to grow further, as producers are attracted by climbing prices.
Prices remained supported after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with some non-OPEC producers led by Russia, agreed last week to extend current oil output cuts for a further nine months until the end of 2018. They also signaled a possible early exit from the deal should the market overheat and prices rise too far.
The deal to cut oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) was adopted last winter by OPEC, Russia and nine other global producers. The agreement was due to end in March 2018, having already been extended once.
The OPEC-led production cuts have been one of the key catalyst supporting the recent rally in oil prices amid expectations that rebalancing in crude markets are well underway.
However, fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies are prevented prices from rising much further, according to market participants.
In other energy trading, gasoline futures dipped 0.6 cents, or 0.4%, to $1.731 a gallon, while heating oil lost 1.3 cents to $1.928 a gallon.
Natural gas futures rallied 5.0 cents, or 1.6%, to $3.110 per million British thermal units.

Talks on reconciling the Senate version with a separate version already passed by the House of Representatives were due to begin later in the week so a final bill can be sent to President Donald Trump to sign into law. Republicans hope to reach a deal by Christmas.
The Trump administration has said its tax cuts will generate growth and spark inflation, which investors hope will prompt a faster pace of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
The Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold its final policy meeting of the year on Dec. 12-13, with interest rate futures pricing in a 100% chance of a rate hike at that meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. However, markets appeared doubtful over the central bank's ability to raise rates as much as it would like next year due to concern over the sluggish inflation outlook.
Comex gold futures were at $1,276.50 a troy ounce by 5:35AM ET (1035GMT), down about $6.00, or 0.5%, from Friday's close. The yellow metal lost about 0.7% last week, the second-straight weekly decline.
Meanwhile, market players were on the lookout for more headlines about the Russia probe, now that Michael Flynn, former national security advisor, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and agreed to cooperate with investigators.
Markets were spooked by an ABC News report on Friday that said Flynn would testify that he was directed to make contact with Russian officials during the presidential campaign in 2016 at Donald Trump's behest.
However, ABC later corrected the report to say that Trump's instructions occurred after the election, initially as a way to work together to fight ISIS in Syria.
In other metals trading, silver futures dipped 2.0 cents, or 0.1%, to $16.36 a troy ounce, platinum fell 0.7% to $934.60, while palladium shed 0.5% at $1,011.38 an ounce.

1007,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2017 07:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Exxon eyes Egypt's offshore oil and gas - sources,"By Ron Bousso and Ernest Scheyder
LONDON/VIENNA (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) is considering a foray into Egypt offshore oil and gas, seeking to replicate rivals' success in the country and boost its reserves, officials and industry sources said.
Officials from the world's largest listed oil producer recently held talks with Egypt's petroleum ministry to discuss investments in oil and gas production, known as upstream operations, Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla told Reuters. 
""We have been discussing with them, visiting them. They've visited us... We are exploring all opportunities for having more and further upstreamers in Egypt,"" Molla said on the sidelines of an OPEC meeting in Vienna.
""I would be happy to have them with us,"" he said, adding that no decision has been made yet. 
Exxon declined to comment. The Irving, Texas-based company currently has no upstream operations in Egypt, according to its website.
The company is looking at exploring the eastern Mediterranean offshore basin, according to industry sources.
Italy's Eni (MI:ENI) this month is set to begin producing gas from the Zohr field in the Mediterranean, among the biggest discoveries of the past decade.
""After Zohr there was a reassessment of the portfolio profitability in Egypt"" by Exxon, one source said, adding that Exxon was looking for ""tier one assets"" with significant potential.
Exxon is also considering opportunities in the Red Sea, where Cairo is preparing to tender exploration blocks, industry sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.
Egypt in 2016 had reserves of 3.5 billion barrels of oil and 1.8 trillion cubic meters of gas, according to BP's Statistical Review of World Energy.
RESERVES
Egypt has recently ramped up efforts to attract foreign investment in its oil sector to boost its struggling economy. 
Along with Eni,  BP  (L:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) also have significant operations in Egypt in offshore gas production, which is consumed domestically although Cairo aims to become a gas exporter.
Exxon like many rivals has curbed spending to ride out a sharp fall in oil prices in mid-2014.
With its reserves slipping, Exxon CEO Darren Woods, who took over at the beginning of the year, has gone shopping. 
Woods has spent or authorized more than $10 billion in investment in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield, and in offshore Guyana.
In November, Exxon and Japan's Inpex Corp (T:1605) signed an agreement with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) to boost the capacity of the Upper Zakum offshore oilfield, the world's fourth largest.
Exxon is also close to signing a deal to explore for oil and gas off Mauritania, its oil, energy and mines director said on Wednesday.
In 2016, Exxon's stockpile of total proved oil reserves fell 4 percent to 7.75 billion barrels. In addition, the oil in its portfolio is in hard-to-reach or expensive places, including Russia and Canada.
By comparison, rival  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) has been able to boost its proved oil reserves by about 1 percent since 2014 by expanding in the Permian Basin and Kazakhstan.
Exxon's oil production up to the end of the third quarter stood at 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, down about 6 percent from the end of 2016.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2017 07:12PM ET</span>",Venezuela Maduro gains control over oil contracts amid purge,"By Alexandra Ulmer and Deisy Buitrago
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro on Sunday gained more powers over the OPEC member's oil contracts, as a deepening purge looks set to strengthen the leftist leader's control of the key energy sector amid a debilitating recession. 
A months-long crackdown on alleged graft in Venezuela's oil industry has led to the arrest of some 65 former executives, including two prominent officials who used to lead both the oil ministry and state oil company PDVSA. 
Corruption has long plagued Venezuela, home to the world's biggest crude reserves, but the socialist government usually said ""smear campaigns"" were behind accusations of widespread graft. 
Maduro has recently changed his tack, blaming ""thieves"" and ""traitors"" for the country's imploding economy.
PDVSA's new boss, former housing minister Major General Manuel Quevedo, said on Sunday that all oil service contracts and executive positions would be reviewed by Maduro as of Monday. 
""There aren't going to be any more contracts backed by the board to keep pillaging, as has happened in some instances,"" said Quevedo during a visit to the ailing Paraguana Refining Center. 
Further details were not immediately available. PDVSA did not respond to a request for information. 
Maduro said former energy minister Ali Rodriguez had been appointed honorary president of PDVSA and had met with Quevedo for six hours over the weekend.
ART, WINE, GOLD CHESS SET 
The most recent high-profile sweep saw Diego Salazar, a relative of former oil czar Rafael Ramirez, detained on Friday on charges of helping launder some around 1.35 billion euros to Andorra.
During his Sunday television program, Maduro flashed a painting by Venezuelan painter Armando Reveron and pictures of luxury goods, including bottles from an alleged 300,000-euro wine cellar and a gold chess set, he said belonged to Salazar. 
""Thieves!"" said Maduro, banging his fist on the table, during the near five-hour broadcast. ""All your assets must be expropriated,"" he added, stressing that the money should go to state coffers. 
Reuters was not able to confirm Maduro's accusations or contact a representative for Salazar. 
His detention has spurred speculation that authorities are after Ramirez, who was the powerful head of PDVSA and the oil ministry for a decade before Maduro demoted him as an envoy to the United Nations in 2014.
A protracted rivalry between Maduro and Ramirez has increased in recent weeks, insiders say, especially after Ramirez wrote online opinion articles criticizing Maduro's handling of Venezuela's economy. 
Maduro fired Ramirez last week and summoned him back to Caracas, according to people familiar with the clash.

When asked by Reuters on Whatsapp whether Ramirez was being investigated, chief state prosecutor Tarek Saab on Sunday replied there were ""no exceptions"" in the investigation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled up slightly on Friday, but came off session highs as financial markets reeled from an ABC News report that added to concerns about President Donald Trump's exposure to a probe into Russian meddling in last year's campaign.
Brent crude rose as high as $64.32 a barrel, the day after OPEC and other crude producers agreed to extend output cuts until the end of 2018 to tighten global supplies and support prices. 
But oil pared gains as Wall Street stocks slid following an ABC report that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was prepared to tell investigators that prior to taking office, Trump directed him to make contact with Russians. (N) 
Reuters has not verified the ABC News report, which cited a Flynn confidant. Flynn also pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI.
""Oil prices have pared earlier gains in tandem with losses seen in the equity market partly because (of) news regarding Michael Flynn,"" said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.
Brent futures settled at $63.73 a barrel, putting the new front month February contract up 16 cents from where January expired on Thursday. The February futures contract was up about 1.8 percent from where it closed in the previous session.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude gained 96 cents, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $58.36 per barrel. WTI's January contract does not expire till Dec. 19.
Both benchmarks declined for the week, with Brent down less than 1 percent and U.S. down about 1 percent.
Before the Flynn news spooked Wall Street, crude prices were approaching their highest levels since the summer of 2015. On Thurdsay, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC producers led by Russia agreed to extend the output cuts.
The output cuts were due to expire next March. Producers have reduced output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). The latest agreement allows for producers to exit the deal early if the market overheats.
Russian officials had expressed concern that extending the output cuts might encourage rival U.S. shale firms to pump more crude.
""It leaves a question mark about the second half (of 2018) and about the commitment of Russian oil companies, which will be price dependent,"" Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said.
The chief executive of Russia's top private producer Lukoil told Reuters he would like to see the price of oil stable at current levels, trading in the $60-65 per barrel range.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for January delivery rose 1.7% to settle at $58.36 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent rose 1.68% to trade at $63.68 a barrel.
OPEC and some non-OPEC producers who met on Thursday in Vienna, Austria, said they would continue to cut supply by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of 2018, raising expectations for a continued drawdown of inventories as rebalancing in markets gets underway.
The production-agreement has rein in excess supplies, but further cuts are needed as Khalid Al-Falih said a draw of about 150 million barrels were required to bring global crude inventories back to the five-year average.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Commodity Research said that it expects the duration of the OPEC extension would help to reduce the risk of a sharp increase in production but noted that the cuts would not target high prices amid fears over a ramp up in US shale output. 
""We take away from these [OPEC] comments a strong commitment to normalizing inventories and also to remain data dependent, which reduces the risk of both unexpected supply surprises and excess stock draws,"" Goldman said. 
In the U.S., investors mulled over a report from Baker Hughes showing the number of oil rigs operating in the US rose by 2 to 749, further adding to fears that increased output from US producers would dampened OPEC efforts to rein in excess supplies.
The uptick in rig counts come as data this week showed U.S. domestic output rose 15% to 9.66 million barrels per day (bpd)."

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $6.70, or 0.34%, to $1277.54 a troy ounce.
Flynn is prepared to testify that President Donald Trump directed him to make contact with Russians when he was a presidential candidate, ABC News reported.
That sparked a flight to safety, pressuring treasury yields, while supported an uptick in demand for safe haven gold, which rose as much as 1% before pairing gains on signs that tax reform was gathering momentum.
Senator Mitch McConnel, said on Friday morning that Republicans had the 50 votes they need to pass the tax bill.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Also weighing on gold were a pair of mixed economic reports on inflation, and construction spending.

1016,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 01, 2017 11:00AM ET</span>","U.S. Vastly Overstates Oil Output Forecasts, MIT Study Suggests","(Bloomberg) -- Turns out, America’s decade-long shale boom might just end up being a little too good to be true.
There’s no denying that fracking has turned the U.S. into a force in the global oil and gas markets, which has more than a few people abuzz about the prospect of energy independence.
But now, researchers at MIT have uncovered one potentially game-changing detail: a flaw in the Energy Department’s official forecast, which may vastly overstate oil and gas production in the years to come.
The culprit, they say, lies in the Energy Information Administration’s premise that better technology has been behind nearly all the recent output gains, and will continue to boost production for the foreseeable future. That’s not quite right. Instead, the research suggests increases have been largely due to something more mundane: low energy prices, which led drillers to focus on sweet spots where oil and gas are easiest to extract.
“The EIA is assuming that productivity of individual wells will continue to rise as a result of improvements in technology,” said Justin B. Montgomery, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and one of the study’s authors. “This compounds year after year, like interest, so the further out in the future the wells are drilled, the more that they are being overestimated.”
‘Same Dynamic’
Extrapolating from field studies Montgomery and his colleague Francis O’Sullivan conducted in North Dakota’s Bakken shale deposit, the research suggests that total U.S. oil and natural-gas production from new wells could undershoot the EIA estimate by more than 10 percent in 2020. Things would get progressively worse each year after that as wells in various sweet spots are exhausted and technology fails to close the gap.
“The same forecasting methods are used in other plays in the U.S., and the same dynamic is likely to be present,” Montgomery added.
Margaret Coleman, the EIA’s leader of oil, gas and biofuels exploration and production analysis, said in an email “the study raises valid points” and the administration is looking at ways to give its estimates a tighter focus. She added that many shale fields lack the detailed well data that informed the MIT study, which means EIA forecasters have to use known geologic information and assumptions about prices and technology to come up with estimates.
OPEC’s Epic Battle Against Shale -- A QuickTake
There’s little doubt the technologies used to extract oil and natural gas trapped within rock formations thousands of feet below the Earth’s surface -- like drill heads, mapping software, fracking techniques and so on -- have gotten better. And intuitively, it makes a lot of sense that better methods have boosted U.S. shale output and helped lead to new finds.
“It’s really hard to bet against the ability of the industry to improve and get more out of the rock,” said Manuj Nikhanj, co-chief executive officer of RS Energy Group.
Undisputed Leader?
Just last month, International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol said shale production will make the U.S. the “undisputed leader of global oil and gas markets for decades to come.”
But if the MIT researchers are ultimately right, the implications could be significant.
In the past three years, oil prices have been stuck around $50 a barrel on the back of rising shale output in the U.S., while natural gas has been selling for an average of less than $3 per million British thermal units. (As recently as 2014, prices for both were twice as high.)
Not only could a slowdown in production mean higher energy prices, but it also might just mark the end of the U.S. shale industry’s role as the one swing producer able to counter OPEC’s might. The shale boom has repeatedly frustrated the Saudi-led cartel’s attempts to control oil prices.
As recently as 2015, OPEC tried to pump its U.S. rivals out of business, only to blink after shale drillers adapted by reducing costs. On Thursday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies agreed to maintain oil-output cuts through 2018, extending a campaign to wrest back the global market from America’s shale industry.
Power Struggle
President Donald Trump himself has talked up “energy dominance” as a key policy, with U.S. oil and gas helping supply the world’s power needs.
Of course, the MIT researchers aren’t the first to question the projected growth of U.S. shale. Analysts have long debated varying methods used to predict output. And unsurprisingly, the Saudis have cast doubt on how long the shale boom can last. Even billionaire oilman Harold Hamm recently slammed what he considered EIA’s “exaggerated” forecasts, saying they’re depressing U.S. oil prices. (After all, higher prices are better for the bottom line.)
Yet MIT’s findings stand out by providing some evidence that backs those assertions. The problem with the EIA’s numbers, the researchers say, is that they give drillers too much credit for coming up with ways to improve fracking.
While the EIA’s model assumes that technical advances -- such as well length and the amounts of water and sand used in fracking -- increase output at new wells by roughly 10 percent each year, MIT findings from the Bakken region suggest it’s closer to 6.5 percent, according to Montgomery.
Increasing productivity of each new well matters because it’s the only way to boost output. Typically, production drops precipitously soon after a well is tapped. The EIA recently estimated about half of U.S. oil output came from wells two or fewer years old.
Field of Dreams
So even though output in the Bakken more than tripled from 2012 to mid-2015 on a per-well basis, MIT’s research suggests the main reason is that shale companies abandoned iffier fields to drill in the best acreage following the slump in energy prices. The trend is evident in local North Dakota statistics. Output in still-booming McKenzie County has held steady while neighboring Williams and Mountrail counties have experienced declines.
“There certainly could be some validity to getting a rosier forecast because right now, the industry is working sweet spots,” said Dave Yoxtheimer, a hydrogeologist at Penn State University’s Marcellus Center for Outreach and Research. “When that’s all played out, they’re going to have to go to the tier-two acreage, which isn’t going to be as productive.”
Indeed, some signs of a slowdown have started to emerge. Gas output in the Marcellus basin has fallen 10 percent on a per-rig basis since reaching a high in September 2016. In the Permian, per-rig oil production has decreased almost 20 percent over a similar span.
Richard Bereschik knows firsthand that shale isn’t a sure thing.
The bearded, burly superintendent of schools in Wellsville, Ohio -- a small, Rust Belt community located along the western bank of the Ohio River -- recalls the rush he and other townsfolk experienced when Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK). came through some six years ago, leasing out huge tracts of property for development.
Wellsville sits atop the Marcellus and Utica shale formations and is only 20 miles from a concentration of sweet spots, but Bereschik says Chesapeake stopped renewing leases after the bottom fell out in prices.
“Everyone thought we’d found a goose that laid the golden egg,” Bereschik said. But ultimately, “it’s not the boom we all expected.”

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2017 09:43AM ET</span>",Sale of the century? $300-billion Saudi state sell-off moves slowly,"By Tom Arnold, Saeed Azhar and Katie Paul
DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's $300-billion privatization program was billed as the sale of the century when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman unveiled his plan to great fanfare. Nineteen months later, it is moving at a snail's pace, bankers, investors and analysts familiar with the process say.
The main problems they cite are heavy bureaucracy, an inadequate legal framework, frequent changes of priority in government departments and fatigue among investors. (Graphic - Saudi economy: http://tmsnrt.rs/2AspssP)
Some also blame a wait-and-see approach among many investors due to uncertainty about the fallout from an anti-corruption campaign in which dozens of royal family members, ministers and senior officials were rounded up in early November.
The centerpiece listing of state oil company Saudi Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] - expected alone to raise up to $100 billion - is on track to go ahead next year, Prince Mohammed told Reuters in October. However, Riyadh has yet to select any exchange abroad that will handle - along with the Saudi market - what would be the biggest share flotation in history.
Sectors where the privatization process has been slow include grains, the postal service and healthcare.
""It's going to take longer (than many expected),"" a Saudi banker who has worked on transactions told Reuters. ""There are headwinds from the shifting of priorities in government and at a micro-level as these are old institutions that have often never kept books and are not up to the rigors of privatization.""
The sell-off is a cornerstone of Prince Mohammed's Vision 2030 plan to bring in fresh revenue and diversify the economy - which is recession and blighted by high unemployment - away from energy exports in an era of low oil prices.
But the bankers, investors and analysts are expressing concerns including over the lack of a regulatory framework to assure would-be shareholders about how much control foreign companies could gain as a result of the stake sales, including the right to lay off staff. 
Vice Minister for Economy and Planning Mohammed al-Tuwaijri told Reuters in April that, excluding Aramco, the government aimed to make $200 billion by putting large parts of the Saudi economy in private hands. 
The Ministry of Economy and Planning did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.
FACTBOX - Saudi Arabia's privatization plans 
PATCHY PROGRESS
The selloff, including five percent of Aramco, is intended to improve state finances. The government posted a $79 billion deficit last year.
However, the record is patchy in the four sectors that Tuwaijri had highlighted as priorities for this year: grain silos, sports, electricity generation and water provision.
Banks recently submitted bids to advise on the privatization of Saline Water Conversion Corporation's $7.2 billion Ras Al Khair desalination and power plant. But there has been less progress in the other three sectors.
Saudi Arabia's deputy electricity minister said in October he aimed for progress in privations the power sector in 2018, after ""some developments required us to wait"".
Prospective bidders for the kingdom's state-owned grain mills have complained of an unwieldy sale process and onerous ownership rules.
Elsewhere, the Ministry of Health has put on hold its tender seeking financial advisers for the privatization of 55 primary healthcare units in Riyadh, after receiving their bids in April, a financial source familiar with the matter said.
It then issued a new tender to seek a technical adviser on the expected costs and demand linked to the privatization, the source said.
The Ministry of Health did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.
""Compared with many of its neighbors, Saudi Arabia has only limited experience in terms of privatizations, and still lacks an adequate regulatory framework,"" said Raphaele Auberty, a BMI Research risk analyst for the Middle East and Africa.
Shortcomings include the absence of a framework for large-scale public-private partnership projects and a bankruptcy law, said Karen Young, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.
Saudi Post Corp's privatization, which had at one stage been earmarked to begin early this year, has been shelved for the time being.
Abdullah Alswaha, Minister of Communications and Information Technology, told Reuters last month that Saudi Post would enter a five-year ""corporatisation phase"". This would turn it into a state-run company with a profit and loss responsibility before a sale to the private sector.
""It makes sense to focus more on putting that corporate DNA, leadership and resources, then think about a complete privatization,"" said Alswaha.
Uncertainty has surrounded a plan to privatize soccer clubs. Earlier this year Jadwa Investment was appointed to advise on the sale of up to five soccer clubs in the Saudi Professional League, sources told Reuters in February.
The General Sports Authority did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
""At one stage it was looking like the bidding process could start as early as 2018 but recent indications perhaps suggest 2019-20 is more likely,"" said Steven Bainbridge, head of sports law and events management at Al Tamimi & Company, who has been fielding interest from potential clients on the process.
Confusion has been created about an airport privatization process after some local media reported that the government intended to privatize 27 of them by the middle of 2018, a target analysts said was unrealistic.
But in an emailed reply to questions from Reuters, Faisal Hamad al-Sugair, Chairman of Saudi Civil Aviation Holding Company, said the goal was for the airports to be ""corporatised"", or turned into private companies, by that date. Privatization would follow later. 
""Various challenges have arisen and have been resolved. The deadline of mid-2018 is reachable,"" he said.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude January contract was up 46 cents or about 0.80% at $57.84 a barrel by 07:05 a.m. ET (11:05 GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for February delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up 62 cents or about 0.99% at $63.25 a barrel.
Prices increased after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC members led by Russia followed market expectations and agreed on Thursday to extend their supply cuts from March 2018 through to the end of next year.
In November last year, OPEC and 11 other non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January 1 and June 30.
The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Oil has risen around 17% since the last time producers gathered for an official meeting back in late May with major oil producers not scheduled for another round of negotiations until June.
Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said inventories were expected to decline to the desired targets in the second half of 2018, although he admitted that production from other areas, such as U.S. shale output, remained an unknown.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian refiners are losing no time reacting to a decision by OPEC and Russia to extend their agreed production cuts to all of 2018, ordering more oil from the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in a move that will result in lost OPEC and Russian market share. 
Output cuts aimed at tightening the market to prop up prices have been in place since January and were to expire in March 2018, but the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), together with non-OPEC producers including Russia, extended those cuts on Thursday, to cover all of 2018. 
Despite this, oil supplies remain ample. Even before the official announcement on Thursday to extend the cuts, refiners in Asia, the world's biggest consumer region, had already put in enquiries for oil shipments from the Gulf of Mexico and the wider Caribbean, particularly from the United States, Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, tanker operators said. 
""There have been many enquiries from Asia for oil tanker shipments from the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. Now that we know OPEC's cuts will be extended, these enquiries are being turned into orders,"" said a broker who specializes in long-haul crude oil shipments, declining to be named as he was not authorized to talk to media about ongoing negotiations. 
'CHRISTMAS COMES EARLY'
OPEC's and Russia's biggest problem with cutting output has been that it has led to higher U.S. production and market share. 
In a note to clients titled ""Christmas comes early,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) bank said on Friday: ""U.S. crude oil exports to China could easily double next year as U.S. production and export capacity expands ... (and) OPEC countries will see their market shares in Asia decline further."" 
Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows oil shipments from the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean to Asia's consumer hubs of China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore have already soared from around half a million barrels per day (bpd) in January, when the OPEC-led cuts were implemented, to over 1.2 million bpd in November and December. 
The biggest increase in exports to Asia have been coming from the United States, where output is soaring thanks to shale oil drillers. 
U.S. oil production  hit a record 9.68 million bpd last week, according to government data. [EIA/S] 
""The real winners (of the cuts) will be the U.S. producers,"" said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker for Freight Investor Services in Dubai. 
Consultancy Rystad Energy expects U.S. output to reach 9.9 million bpd this year, bringing it close to levels of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. 
Stronger North American oil supplies to Asia benefit shippers as this is one of the world's longest trade routes, meaning chartered tankers spend more time at sea. 
The U.S.-Asia route is at least twice as long as that from the Middle East to the main Asian trading hubs in China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. 
""We believe the 'new trades' (from North America to Asia) will develop further, which is long-term positive for shipping,"" said Robert Hvide Macleod, chief executive of Frontline Management, a major tanker owner. 
The ripple effects of ongoing OPEC cuts will also affect refinery output. U.S. crude oil tends to be relatively light and sweet in quality, as opposed to the heavier and sourer grades that many Middle East producers export. 

Mike Petrut, a petroleum researcher at Industrial Info Resources Oceania in Perth, Australia, said an increase in supplies of light U.S. crude at the cost of heavy crudes from OPEC would mean higher gasoline output by Asian refiners, and a lower yield of heavier products like fuel oil.

Comex gold futures was up $1.75 or about 0.14% at $1,274.96 a troy ounce by 03:00 a.m. ET (07:00 GMT), just off the previous session's two-week low of $1,269.80.
Sentiment on the greenback remained vulnerable after the U.S. Senate on Thursday evening delayed a vote on the tax reform bill until Friday as a key element of the bill still needed to be debated.
However, the bill was seen like more likely to pass following an endorsement by Senator John McCain.

1021,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 01, 2017 12:30AM ET</span>",Goldman Says Oil Market's Too Jittery When There's No Need to Be,"(Bloomberg) -- Don’t worry about long-term oil supply, according to Goldman Sachs.
While OPEC and its allies including Russia didn’t finalize details on how they would wind down output curbs that’ll continue until the end of 2018, they pledged to be “agile and responsive” and review their progress on shrinking inventories at a meeting in June, the bank said in a report. That indicates a reduced risk of both unexpected increases in supply as well as excess draws in stockpiles, according to Goldman.
“This leads us to reiterate our view that long-dated implied volatility remains too rich,” analysts including Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in the Nov. 30 report, referring to a measure of investor anxiety.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and partner nations outside the group agreed in Vienna on Thursday to prolong their deal to limit production beyond its previous expiry date of March 31. The pact was even beefed up through the inclusion of Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC members originally exempted from the curbs.
The duration of the extension helps defuse the risk of a sharp increase in production from currently high and rising available spare capacity, according to Goldman. While Nigeria and Libya have committed to keep their production below their 2017 highs of a combined 2.8 million barrels a day, the bank wasn’t expecting either of the countries to exceed those level next year.
Oil producers are aiming to return stockpiles to their five-year average by keeping 1.8 million barrels a day of cuts in place for a further nine months. Since the pact started about a year ago, global inventories have fallen and prices have jumped. Still, the group faces the risk of a new flood of oil coming from U.S. shale fields as crude strengthens.
While the inventory target level remains more aggressive than Goldman currently assumes in its balances, the bank sees OPEC’s assessment of the medium-term supply response to higher prices as too conservative, with forward prices above the industry’s marginal cost, it said in the report.
“Combined, these point to potentially even greater backwardation than we currently project through 2018 although with lower deferred prices,” the analysts said, referring to a market structure where near-term futures are costlier than later contracts."

Overnight, gold prices fell sharply as upbeat inflation data lifted treasury yields higher sparking a recovery in the dollar, while signs of progress on tax reform weighed on sentiment.
The Core Price Consumer Expenditure (PCE) Index – the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – rose 1.4% in October year-on-year, compared to a 1.3% rise in the previous month, while September inflation was revised upward to 1.4% from 1.3%.
The upbeat inflation report, fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would adopt a more aggressive stance on monetary policy, lifting yields and the dollar higher, which pressured gold prices to a nearly two-week low.

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2017 05:46PM ET</span>",U.S. formally opposes China market economy status at WTO,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has formally told the World Trade Organization (WTO) that it opposes granting China market economy status, a position that if upheld would allow Washington to maintain high anti-dumping duties on Chinese goods.
The statement of opposition, made public on Thursday, was submitted as a third-party brief in support of the European Union in a dispute with China that could have major repercussions for the trade body's future.
China is fighting the EU for recognition as a market economy, a designation that would lead to dramatically lower anti-dumping duties on Chinese goods by prohibiting the use of third-country price comparisons. 
The U.S. and EU argue that the state's pervasive role in the Chinese economy, including rampant granting of subsidies, mean that domestic prices are deeply distorted and not market-determined.
A victory for China before the WTO would weaken many countries' trade defenses against a flood of cheap Chinese goods, putting the viability of more western industries at risk.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told Congress in June that the case was ""the most serious litigation we have at the WTO right now"" and a decision in China's favor ""would be cataclysmic for the WTO.""
Lighthizer has repeatedly expressed frustration with the WTO's dispute settlement body and has called for major changes at the organization.
The USTR brief, which follows a Commerce Department finding in October that China fails the tests for a market economy, argues that China should not automatically be granted market economy by virtue of the expiration of its 2001 accession protocol last year.
""The evidence is overwhelming that WTO members have not surrendered their longstanding rights ... to reject prices or costs that are not determined under market economy conditions in determining price comparability for purposes of anti-dumping comparisons,"" the brief concludes.
The move comes as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing are increasing as the Trump administration prepares several possible major trade actions, including broad tariffs or quotas on steel and aluminum and an investigation into Chinese intellectual property misappropriation.
The Commerce Department on Tuesday launched the first government-initiated anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations in decades on Chinese aluminum sheet imports.
U.S. officials say that 16 years of WTO membership has failed to end China's market-distorting state practices. 
""We are concerned that China's economic liberalization seems to have slowed or reversed, with the role of the state increasing"" David Malpass, U.S. Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, told an event in New York on Thursday. 
""State-owned enterprises have not faced hard budget constraints and China's industrial policy has become more and more problematic for foreign firms. Huge exports credits are flowing in non-economic ways that distort markets,"" Malpass said.
The brief submitted to the WTO also argues that China should be treated the same way as communist eastern European countries, including Poland, Romania and Hungary were when they joined the WTO's predecessor organization, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

A senior U.S. official said those countries eventually earned market economy status as evidence of state subsidies and state distortions waned. He added that going forward, WTO members wishing to use third-country price comparisons against Chinese imports would need to keep presenting evidence of economic distortions.

The company is also raising C$1.5 billion by selling new shares to pay down debt, and identified C$22 billion worth of projects it intends to complete through 2020.
The Calgary, Alberta-based company is realigning its focus as it looks beyond the $28 billion acquisition of  Spectra Energy  Corp (F:SEP) that closed this year.
The takeover, the most significant energy deal since commodity prices crashed in mid-2014, highlighted how pipeline companies were under pressure to merge as they grappled with overcapacity and sliding tariffs that have slowed dividend growth and unnerved investors.
Enbridge's shares had fallen by about a third to C$41.09 after the crash and have yet to fully recover, in line with the Canadian energy index. 
They rose as much as 8.1 percent on Thursday before closing at C$48.65, valuing the company at $62 billion. The energy index rose 2.2 percent.
The company's announcement addressed much of the uncertainty of the last earnings conference call, when executives had been vague on capital allocation and distribution policy, said Manash Goswami, senior vice president and portfolio manager at First Asset ETFs, which holds Enbridge shares.
""I think it's pretty credible,"" he said of the asset sales. ""They've basically kind of addressed all the concerns that the market's been hung up on."" 
Among Enbridge's future projects is its $6.5 billion Line 3 replacement program, its biggest yet, which seeks to upgrade an oil pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, to Superior, Wisconsin.
The company said late on Wednesday it has also identified another C$7 billion in non-core assets to divest including unregulated gas gathering and processing businesses and onshore renewables in the United States and Canada.
Enbridge is speeding up debt reduction to help strengthen the balance sheet and increase its dividend by 10 percent.
Analysts broadly viewed the move as positive, even as some called the share issuance ""unexpected"" and lowered their price targets.
Chief Executive Al Monaco said Enbridge would concentrate on its three ""crown jewel"" businesses: liquids pipelines and terminals, natural gas transmission and storage and natural gas utilities.
""The acquisition of Spectra Energy has significantly diversified our asset base and opportunity set, and repositioned Enbridge for the future,"" he said in a statement.

1026,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 30, 2017 04:00PM ET</span>",Oil Gains for Third Straight Month as OPEC Extends Supply Curbs,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil posted its longest streak of monthly gains since early 2016 after an OPEC-led coalition of major crude producers followed through on a much-anticipated extension of supply cuts.
Futures closed little changed for the day in New York and ended November up 5.6 percent. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries reached a deal with non-OPEC allies such as Russia on Thursday to extend production curbs through the end of next year. A bullish addition to the deal: the cooperation from two previously exempt producers, Libya and Nigeria.
“The market is not too surprised at the OPEC announcement,” Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts, said by telephone. “Most of the noise coming out beforehand was pretty moderate and suggested nobody was going in ready for battle.”
Oil has risen about 17 percent since the last time producers gathered for an official meeting back in late May. Russia and Saudi Arabia are aligned in a long-term oil strategy and will oversee compliance monitoring, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said at a press briefing in Vienna. Including Libya and Nigeria in the deal means there will be no surprises from the two producers next year, he said.
“We weren’t expecting fireworks from this meeting,” Chris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at Macro Risk Advisors LLC, said by telephone. “The Saudis in combination with the Russians are trying to deliver a very curated message to suppress volatility in the oil market to attract investment.”

West Texas Intermediate for January delivery added 10 cents to settle at $57.40 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures rallied as high as $57.98 and dipped as low as $56.82 a barrel during the session.
Brent for January settlement, which expired Thursday, rose 46 cents to end the session at $63.57 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. Brent traded at a premium of $6.17 to January WTI. The more-active February contract advanced 10 cents to settle at $62.63.
OPEC will meet again in June to review the status of the accord, not to map out an exit strategy, Nigeria Oil Minister Emmanuel Kachikwu said at the Vienna meeting. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak also said the June meeting will provide the chance to assess what needs to be done.
“The market is getting most of what it expected,” Rob Haworth, who helps oversee $150 billion in assets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle, said by telephone. “Even though they are extending, they are doing it cautiously.”

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2017 03:10PM ET</span>","Argentina to defend agricultural exports, boost Latin America with G20 presidency","By Luc Cohen
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina will use its role as the first South American country to chair the G20 group of major economies to combat protectionism, as the agricultural-exporting region seeks to secure market access for its goods, officials said on Thursday.
Both Argentina and Brazil, the only other G20 member on the continent, have transitioned to market-friendly governments in recent years. President Mauricio Macri cast Argentina's presidency as a chance to mark the country's rise as an ""important place"" in the world, and boost Latin America's profile.
""We are going to put at the center of the G20 the aspirations and concerns of the developing region, which is keen for new opportunities,"" Macri said at an event in capital Buenos Aires formally inaugurating Argentina's G20 presidency.
The full-throated defense of globalization comes at a time when Donald Trump's presidency in the United States and Britain's pending exit from the European Union (EU) have raised questions about major economies' commitment to free trade. 
Protectionist measures in more developed countries could threaten the success of pro-trade agendas in South American countries whose economies depend on agricultural exports. 
The trade bloc Mercosur, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, is encountering resistance from European farmers as it seeks to boost beef exports as part of a trade deal with the EU it hopes to close by the end of the year.
Earlier this year, the United States slapped tariffs on imports of Argentine biodiesel, one of its major agricultural product exports.
""The G20 is an ideal place to continue reaffirming the benefits of greater trade ties, especially for countries like Argentina that want to export their agricultural products,"" Treasury Minister Nicolas Dujovne said in a press conference following Macri's speech.
Argentina will host more than a dozen events related to the G20 over the next year, culminating in a leaders' summit in late November 2018.
Since the 2008 global financial crisis, the G20 has been the leading forum for world leaders to co-ordinate economic policy. The last presidency was held by Germany.
G20 summits often attract protests, and can be a target for attacks. Cabinet Chief Marcos Pena said Argentina had been preparing security plans for several months, with other countries' co-operation.

""Argentina is in a condition to guarantee safety,"" Pena said.

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2017 03:07PM ET</span>","OPEC, Russia agree oil cut extension to end of 2018","By Alex Lawler, Rania El Gamal and Shadia Nasralla
VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC producers led by Russia agreed on Thursday to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 as they try to finish clearing a global glut of crude while signaling a possible early exit from the deal if the market overheats.
Russia, which this year reduced production significantly with OPEC for the first time, has been pushing for a clear message on how to exit the cuts so the market doesn't flip into a deficit too soon, prices don't rally too fast and rival U.S. 
shale firms don't boost output further.
Russia needs much lower oil prices to balance its budget than OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia, which is preparing a stock market listing for national energy champion Aramco next year and would hence benefit from pricier crude.
The producers' current deal, under which they are cutting supply by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in an effort to boost oil prices, expires in March.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC allies had agreed to extend the cuts by nine months until the end of 2018, as largely anticipated by the market. 
OPEC also decided to cap the combined output of Nigeria and Libya at 2017 levels below 2.8 million bpd. Both countries have been exempt from cuts due to unrest and lower-than-normal production.
Falih said it was premature to talk about exiting the cuts at least for a couple of quarters as the world was entering a season of low winter demand. He added that OPEC would examine progress at its next regular meeting in June.
""When we get to an exit, we are going to do it very gradually ... to make sure we don’t shock the market,"" he said.
OPEC and Russia together produce over 40 percent of global oil. Moscow's first real cooperation with OPEC, put together with the help of President Vladimir Putin, has been crucial in roughly halving an excess of global oil stocks since January.
With oil prices rising above $60, Russia has expressed concerns that an extension for the whole of 2018 could prompt a spike in crude production in the United States, which is not participating in the deal.
A joint OPEC and non-OPEC communique said the next meeting in June 2018 would present an opportunity to adjust the agreement based on market conditions.
The Iraqi, Iranian and Angolan oil ministers also said before Thursday's meetings that a review of the deal was possible in June in case the market became too tight. 
International benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) rose around 0.5 percent on Thursday to trade above $63 per barrel.
GLUT OR SHORTAGE?
Just as OPEC gathered in Vienna, U.S. government data showed that U.S. oil production rose 3 percent in September to 9.48 million bpd. But Falih said OPEC ""won't be quick on the trigger"" to react to short-term U.S. output spikes.
U.S. shale oil producers, which effectively triggered the global oil glut of recent years, have been adjusting their message over the past year, switching away from combative language with regard to OPEC actions.
""If producers in the U.S. increase their rig count over the next few months due to higher prices then I expect another price collapse by the end of 2018,"" said Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co (N:PXD), one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield.
""I hope that all U.S. shale companies will maintain their current rig counts and use all excess cash flow to increase dividends back to their shareholders,"" he told Reuters.
Gary Ross, a veteran OPEC watcher and founder of Pira consultancy, said the market could surprise on the upside with Brent rising to $70 if there were a major supply disruption.
""Everywhere you look there is an ever-present risk to supply,"" Ross said.
""In Iraq's Kurdistan there is a major risk to oil exports because of tensions with Baghdad, in Libya militias are still fighting, in Nigeria the risks of disruptions are significant, Venezuela is on the verge of default, Iran could again face U.S. financial sanctions and even in Saudi Arabia political risk is on the rise,"" Ross added.
The production cuts have been in place since the start of 2017 and helped halve an excess of global oil stocks although those remain at 140 million barrels above the five-year average, according to OPEC.

Russia has signaled it wants to understand better how producers will exit from the cuts as it needs to provide guidance to its private and state energy companies. On Thursday, Novak said all companies were on board with the latest limits.

The announcement of a nine-month extension had a muted impact on oil prices as the extension was said to be mostly priced in, but reports that both Nigeria and Libya decided to cap production added a positive slant on the outcome of the meeting.
Market looked ahead to news conference due late Thursday for confirmation on whether the deal will include a review in June 2018 to reassess the cuts, or possibly end them.
The production-agreement has rein in excess supplies, but further cuts are needed as Khalid Al-Falih said a draw of about 150 million barrels were required to bring global crude inventories back to the five-year average.
The deal comes as concerns mount over rising output from non-participating countries, including the U.S., where producers have ramped up crude oil production more than 15% to 9.66 million barrels per day (bpd) since mid-2016, not far from top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.

1031,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 30, 2017 12:50PM ET</span>",Gold Prices Fall Sharply as Bond Yields Rise on Improved Inflation Outlook,"Investing.com – Gold prices fell sharply as upbeat inflation data lifted treasury yields higher sparking a recovery in the dollar, while signs of progress on tax reform weighed on sentiment.
Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $10.44, or 0.80%, to $1271.85 a troy ounce.
The Core Price Consumer Expenditure (PCE) Index – the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – rose 1.4% in October year-on-year, compared to a 1.3% rise in the previous month, while September inflation was revised upward to 1.4% from 1.3%.
The upbeat inflation report, fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would adopt a more aggressive stance on monetary policy, lifting yields and the dollar higher, which pressured gold prices to a nearly two-week low.
Chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities Stephen Stanley said the “tentative evidence” of a turnaround in the trend of slowing inflation could “soothe” concerns of subdued inflation among “all but the most dovish” policy makers.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Also weighing on gold was easing uncertainty over tax reform after Sen. John McCain announced his support of the Senate's tax bill, greatly increasing its chances of passage through the congressional body.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures fell 0.84% to $16.32 a troy ounce, while platinum futures gained 0.22% to $943.45.

U.S. natural gas futures sank 10.8 cents, or around 3.4%, to $3.071 per million British thermal units by 10:45AM ET (1545GMT). Futures were at around $3.078 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. fell by 33 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Nov. 24, compared to forecasts for a withdrawal of 37 bcf.
That compared with a drop of 46 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 50 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average decline of 47 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.693 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 309 bcf, or around 7.7%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 107 bcf, or roughly 2.8%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.
Natural gas prices rallied for the third-straight session on Wednesday, reaching their best level since Nov. 13 at $3.218, as bullish speculators placed bets that a return to cold winter weather will boost demand for the heating fuel.
Natural gas futures have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early-winter heating demand.
Prices of the fuel typically rise ahead of the winter as colder weather sparks heating demand.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan authorities have detained two once-powerful officials who had both run the oil ministry and state oil company PDVSA as a part of a deepening anti-corruption purge, three people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
It was not immediately clear why Eulogio Del Pino and Nelson Martinez, who have held both posts at different times recently, were in custody.
One source in PDVSA said it appeared they were taken for questioning, while another company official said they were ""implicated"" in the graft investigation.
Their detention is the biggest development to date in a months-old probe at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries member.
Venezuela's Information Ministry, PDVSA, and the Oil Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
State prosecutor Tarek Saab was due to hold a news conference to announce new arrests later on Thursday.
Sources within the industry say President Nicolas Maduro is using the graft purge to sideline political rivals and consolidate his grip on a sector that brings in more than 90 percent of the cash-strapped country's export income.
The two men, both widely seen as capable executives, had been removed from their posts on Sunday and replaced by a major general, giving the already powerful military further clout, albeit in a sector reeling from under-investment and sliding output.

Attention is also on Rafael Ramirez, who was Venezuela's oil czar for a decade and under whom both Del Pino and Martinez ascended. Maduro fired him from his job as representative to the United Nations on Tuesday, according to sources with knowledge of the information, and summoned him back to Caracas.

The digital currency climbed to an all-time peak of $11,441 on Wednesday, before collapsing by more than 20% to a low of $8,801 on the U.S.-based Bitfinex exchange.
The drop was triggered in part by intermittent outages at leading cryptocurrency exchanges and amid growing fears of an asset bubble.
Bitcoin, which started 2017 at about $1,000 and broke through $5,000 in October has risen almost 1,000% so far this year.
At current prices, bitcoin has a total market capitalization of around $160 billion.
The price has been boosted by last month’s decision by CME Group (NASDAQ:CME), the world's largest derivative exchange operator, to launch bitcoin futures by the end of the year in response to demand from some of its largest users.
The move has helped give the cryptocurrency legitimacy in the eyes of some traders, but analysts have warned that an asset bubble is building.
The question on everybody's mind is when will the bubble finally pop.

Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producing countries will meet in Vienna Thursday morning to decide whether to extend their current production agreement beyond a March 2018 deadline.
Most market analysts expect the oil cartel to extend output cuts for a further nine months until the end of 2018, but the terms were so far unclear, as Russia has sent mixed signals about whether it will back the move.

Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures inched up 17 cents, or about 0.3%, to $57.45 a barrel. It ended down 1.2% a day earlier.
Oil prices extended their decline into a third session on Wednesday as growing uncertainty over the outcome of a closely watched OPEC meeting and evidence of rising U.S. output dampened sentiment.

Comex gold futures hit an overnight low of $1,280.90 a troy ounce, their worst level since Nov. 22, before rebounding slightly to $1,282.21 by 3:00AM ET (0800GMT), little changed from the prior session's close.
Gold prices lost 1% on Wednesday, pressured by upbeat U.S. growth data for the third quarter and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's bullish view of the economy.
The U.S. economy has picked up steam this year, growing at an annualized rate of more than 3% each of the past two quarters. The Commerce Department released its second read on third-quarter U.S. GDP, which showed the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 3.3%, the quickest pace in three years.
Shortly after the release of the data, outgoing Fed chair Janet Yellen told Congressional leaders in her final scheduled testimony on Capitol Hill, that the U.S. economy has gathered steam this year and will warrant continued interest rate increases amid a strengthened global recovery.
The U.S. central bank is scheduled to hold its final policy meeting of the year on Dec. 12-13, with interest rate futures pricing in a 100% chance of a rate hike at that meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
However, markets appeared doubtful over the central bank's ability to raise rates as much as it would like next year due to concern over the sluggish inflation outlook.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
Looking ahead, Thursday's calendar features data on personal income and consumer spending for October, which include the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation data, the Fed's preferred metric for inflation, at 8:30AM ET (1330GMT).
The consensus forecast is that the report will show that the core PCE price index inched up 0.2% last month. On an annualized basis, core PCE prices are expected to rise 1.4%.
The Fed uses core PCE as a tool to help determine whether to raise or lower interest rates, with the aim of keeping inflation at a rate of 2% or below.
Meanwhile, U.S. tax reform stayed in focus. Congressional Republicans scrambled on Wednesday to reformulate their tax bill to satisfy lawmakers worried about how much it would expand the federal deficit, as the measure moved toward a U.S. Senate floor vote later this week.
A lack of clear drivers has kept gold between $1,265 and $1,300 an ounce throughout November, its narrowest monthly range in 12 years. Still, bullion is heading for its first monthly gain since August, having risen 1% in November.
In other metals trading, silver futures inched up 2.0 cents, or 0.1%, to $16.47 a troy ounce, platinum added 0.5% to $946.20, while palladium inched up 0.4% at $1,012.77 an ounce.
Meanwhile, copper futures slipped 0.3 cents, or 0.1%, to $3.065 a pound, as concerns over demand in top consumer China pushed investors to sell the red metal.

OPEC and key ally Russia will extend output curbs for nine months, but likely review the deal in June of 2018 depending on market conditions, according to reports.
Six ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers including Saudi Arabia and Russia met in Vienna on Wednesday and decided to extends the oil output curbs of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to the end of 2018 - and discussed other related matters without detailing them.

Overnight, crude oil prices settled lower on Wednesday after data showing crude stockpiles fell for the second straight week failed to offset an unexpected build in product inventories ahead of the OPEC meeting.
Crude oil prices came under pressure after a mostly bearish Energy Information Agency (EIA) inventory report showed crude stockpiles fell more-than-estimated, but both gasoline and distillates supplies unexpectedly rose.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 3.4 million barrels for the week ended Nov. 24, beating expectations of a draw of 2.3 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – rose by 3.6 million barrels, well above expectations for rise of 1.2 million barrels, while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – unexpectedly rose by about 2.8 barrels, missing expectations for a draw of 230,000 barrels.
U.S. crude oil production has risen more than 15% to 9.66 million bpd since mid-2016, not far from top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.17% to $1,284.27 a troy ounce.
Elsewhere, China's manufacturing PMI rose to 51.8 in November, a faster pace than expected 51.4 level expected while non-manufacturing also gained to 54.8 from 54.3 in October, official data released Thursday showed.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below that signals contraction.
""The latest official PMI readings suggest that growth momentum held up well this month,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note following the data release.
The release of a private PMI survey may paint a better picture of the economic situation in China. The Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI is expected to be published on Friday, with the services PMI reading coming next Tuesday.
The private surveys tend to focus on small and mid-sized firms.
Earlier, Japan reported provisional industrial production for October up 0.5%, compared with a provisional gain of 1.9% expected on month. Australia reported building approvals for October rose 0.9%, compared with a 1.8% fall expected and private sector credit hit a 0.4% gain seen on month.
Overnight, gold prices came under pressure on Wednesday as Treasury yields rose on hawkish comments from Fed chair Janet Yellen and upbeat economic data.
Federal chair Janet Yellen testified on the economic outlook before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee on Wednesday, reaffirming that the Fed would continue to hike rates amid concerns of the economy overheating. Market participants took Yellen’s comments to be somewhat hawkish, prompting a surge in U.S. Treasury yields, lifting the dollar higher while pressuring gold prices to lows.
""We are not seeing undue inflationary pressure in the labor market, so our policy remains accommodative,"" Yellen said. ""But we do think it's important to gradually move our policy rate toward what I'll call a neutral level, which would be consistent with sustainably strong labor market conditions,"" she said.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Also weighing on gold prices was data indicating underlying strength in the U.S. economy as third quarter economic growth remained solid. Gross domestic product increased at a 3.3% annual rate in the July-September period, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of GDP on Wednesday, beating a previous estimate of 3%.

1042,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 29, 2017 04:01PM ET</span>",Oil Pulled Lower as `Done Deal' Proves Elusive on Supply Cuts,"(Bloomberg) -- Indecision about supply cuts among the world’s biggest oil exporters pushed crude prices to the lowest level in a week.
Futures declined 1.2 percent in New York as conflicting headlines muddled perceptions of what may emerge from a crucial OPEC-led meeting in Vienna on Thursday. Although an important committee advising the group has reached a consensus, details about the timing or implementation of any extension of supply caps have yet to be disclosed.
“The market’s expecting OPEC to extend their cuts nine months,” Joseph Bozoyan, a portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management LLC in Boston, said by telephone. “It’s not a done deal yet. If the cuts aren’t extended, then you’ll probably see a decent decline in oil prices.”
Investors also analyzed data from the Energy Information Administration showing a bigger-than-expected drop in U.S. crude stockpiles even as supplies of the primary fuels produced by oil refiners registered surprisingly large increases.
The U.S. crude stock draw “was positive, but the gasoline and distillate inventories really increased at a pretty significant rate,” Bozoyan said.
Oil has declined this week amid lingering uncertainty about the likelihood of an extension of cuts beyond their March expiration at Thursday’s meeting. Iraq’s Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi told reporters that most members support a nine-month extension. Yet at the same time, Libya’s OPEC governor said the nation was not officially asked to cap output.
Downside Price Risk
West Texas Intermediate for January delivery dropped 69 cents to settle at $57.30 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest since Nov. 21.
Brent for January settlement, which expires Thursday, edged lower by 50 cents to end the session at $63.11 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $5.81 to WTI. The more-active February contract fell 71 cents to settle at $62.53.
Saudi Arabia Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said he was not worried about the market reaction Wednesday, when asked about falling crude prices in Vienna.
See: Oil Options Show Price-Drop Bets Surging Before OPEC Meeting
The OPEC and non-OPEC committee recommended an extension of the cuts agreement with several options for duration, Kuwait’s Oil Minister Issam Almarzooq told reporters in Vienna. Options for both six and nine months were discussed.
An extension of six months or less may lead to downside risk for prices in the medium-term, Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
U.S. crude inventories decreased by 3.43 million barrels last week, larger than the 2.95 million-barrel-draw analysts were expecting, and supplies at the key Cushing, Oklahoma, pipeline hub slipped by 2.91 million barrels, the biggest draw since Sept. 2009, government data showed.
Meanwhile, gasoline supplies rose by 3.63 million barrels, the biggest build since January, and distillate stockpiles posted a 2.75 million-barrel build. Crude production rose to a fresh record.
“The crude draw was a little bit better than consensus,” Brian Kessens, who helps manage $16 billion in energy assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC, said by telephone. Yet, “it’s offset a bit by the refined product side, where distillates and gasoline had a build.”

VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC and Russia look set to prolong oil supply cuts until the end of 2018 this week while signaling that they may review the deal when they meet again in June if the market overheats.
With oil prices (LCOc1) rallying above $60 per barrel, Russia has questioned the wisdom of extending existing cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of next year as such a move could prompt a spike in U.S. production.
Russia needs much lower oil prices to balance its budget than OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia, which is preparing a stock market listing for national energy champion Aramco next year and would hence benefit from pricier crude.
Six ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers including Saudi Arabia and Russia met in Vienna on Wednesday - one day ahead of a full OPEC gathering - and recommended extending the cuts to the end of 2018. At present, the cuts expire in March.
""That's one of the recommendations,"" Kuwait's Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq told reporters when asked whether the committee had agreed on a nine-month extension, among other matters.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak was, however, less certain about the duration.
""The market has not been fully balanced yet. Joint efforts are needed after April 1. Everybody has recommended that the agreement could be extended and tomorrow such concrete details will be discussed,"" Novak said.
Several sources familiar with the talks have said Russia had suggested an option of reviewing the deal at the next OPEC meeting in June in case the oil market overheats.
""In reality it would be only a three-month true extension with the review in June,"" said Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix consultancy. 
Benchmark Brent and U.S. crude prices fell for a third consecutive session on Wednesday but Brent still traded above $63 per barrel. [O/R]
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told the monitoring meeting on Wednesday that cuts needed to be extended as the rebalancing of oil markets was not yet complete.
Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh, who fought Falih on many previous occasions, said he would agree with extending cuts by either six or nine months to help the market rebalance. 
DEBATE ON NIGERIA, LIBYA
Novak told reporters after meeting Falih: ""We understand that we need to take further steps to rebalance the market ... We have a common understanding (with Falih).""
Amrita Sen from consultancy Energy Aspects said she believed the debate between Saudi Arabia and Russia was about timings rather than substance. 
""Saudi Arabia believes it is too early to discuss an exit strategy as the market rebalancing job hasn't been done yet. Russia would like to do it sooner ... OPEC has surprised on the upside during its past three meetings and delivered more than the market had expected,"" she said.
Two sources familiar with OPEC talks said the group may debate capping Nigerian and Libyan output at 1.8 million bpd and 1 million bpd respectively, having exempted the two countries so far due to unrest and lower-than-normal production volumes.
The production cuts have been in place since the start of 2017 and helped halve an excess of global oil stocks although those remain at 140 million barrels above the five-year average, according to OPEC.
Russia has signaled it wants to understand better how producers will exit from the cuts as it needs to provide guidance to its private and state energy companies. 
""It is important ... to work out a strategy which we will follow from April 2018,"" Novak told the monitoring committee.
Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said there had been little discussion so far on any exit strategy.
Some Russian producers including Rosneft, run by an ally of President Vladimir Putin, Igor Sechin, have questioned the rationale of prolonging the cuts, saying it will lead to a loss of market share to U.S. firms, which are not reducing output.
OPEC, which comprises 14 countries, has traditionally been much less worried about exit strategies as its members have been known for reducing compliance and cheating on their quotas toward the expiry of such deals.

""Russia seems to be pushing OPEC to have a concrete plan to phase out the cuts when appropriate ... compared to the typical undisciplined OPEC strategy,"" U.S. bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, which is active in the shale industry, said.

The unexpected rise in product inventories comes a day ahead of the OPEC meeting at which the oil-cartel is expected to extend the production-cut agreement through 2018 March.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $57.87 a barrel, down 12 cents, or about 0.2%, by 10:35AM ET (1535GMT). Prices were at around $57.78 prior to the release of the inventory data.

Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 453.7 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be at the upper half of the average range for this time of year.
U.S. crude oil imports averaged 7.3 million barrels per day last week, down by 544,000 barrels per day from the previous week.

The OPEC-led production cuts have been one of the key catalyst supporting the recent rally in oil prices amid expectations that rebalancing in oil markets are well underway.

U.S. natural gas futures surged 6.0 cents, or around 2%, to $3.189 per million British thermal units by 7:25AM ET (1225GMT). It climbed to its best level since Nov. 13 at $3.206 earlier.
Natural gas prices rallied 11.1 cents, or 3.7%, on Tuesday, the biggest daily gain since Nov. 6.
Futures are up around 9% so far this week as weather models predicted much colder weather across most parts of the continental United States starting from Dec. 6, along with areas of rain and snow. Initial forecasts called for mild weather during the period.
Natural gas futures have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early-winter heating demand.
Prices of the fuel typically rise ahead of the winter as colder weather sparks heating demand.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, investors looked ahead to weekly data from the U.S. on supplies in storage to gauge demand for the fuel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release its official weekly natural gas storage report for the week ended Nov. 24 at 10:30AM ET (1530GMT), amid expectations for a withdrawal of 37 billion cubic feet (bcf).
That compares with a drop of 46 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 50 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average decline of 47 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.726 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 319 bcf, or around 7.9%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 121 bcf, or roughly 3.2%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

Comex gold futures were at $1,295.71 a troy ounce by 3:15AM ET (0815GMT), little changed from the prior session's close. It touched its best level since Oct. 16 at $1,299.00 at the start of this week.
Gold prices notched a minor gain on Tuesday as investors found little in Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell’s Senate Banking Committee confirmation hearing to sway expectations for U.S. interest-rate policy.
North Korea on Wednesday local time launched a likely intercontinental ballistic missile that landed in the Sea of Japan, according to the Pentagon.
The launch, Pyongyang's first since Sept. 15, came after the U.S. classified North Korea as a country that supported terrorism on Nov. 20. The hermit state later boasted through local media that its new ICBM was capable of reaching the U.S.
Despite that, most markets shrugged off the news, with gold failing to draw safe-haven support.
Looking ahead, outgoing Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen is slated to testify on the economic outlook before the Congressional Joint Economic Committee later in the day, which could provide market participants with an insight into the progress of the economy.
Investors are expected to closely parse Yellen’s remarks after she warned that the trend of low inflation limits the potential of further rate hikes.
The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a report that includes anecdotal evidence on the health of the economy from 12 regions, will offer additional clues on the path of U.S. interest rate hikes and the progress of the economy.
On the data front, Wednesday's calendar features the second estimate of GDP growth for the third quarter, expected to show a small upward revision from 3.0% to 3.2%. A report on pending home sales is also on the agenda.
The U.S. central bank is scheduled to hold its final policy meeting of the year on Dec. 12-13, with interest rate futures pricing in a 100% chance of a rate hike at that meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
However, markets appeared doubtful over the central bank's ability to raise rates as much as it would like next year due to concern over the sluggish inflation outlook.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
Meanwhile, U.S. tax reform stayed in focus after the Senate Budget Committee approved the Republican tax bill, a crucial step toward a vote in the full chamber later this week.

President Nicolas Maduro on Sunday tapped Major General Manuel Quevedo to lead both PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] and the Oil Ministry, giving the already powerful military control of the OPEC nation's dominant industry. 
In comments during a two-hour broadcast by Maduro, Quevedo said he would go after ""saboteurs"" and defeat a ""corrupt bureaucracy,"" while offering only a brief nod to boosting oil production and improving refinery operations.
""We're going to clean up public finances so that those thieves in PDVSA will finally leave,"" said Quevedo. ""The government's actions have captured many people who had infiltrated the industry. Those who are left should be worried.""
Investors are closely watching Quevedo for clues as to whether he will seek to halt payment on PDVSA's bonds, or maintain Maduro's strategy of continuing to service debt despite the country's crippling economic crisis. 
Quevedo made no mention of foreign debt on Tuesday. Maduro said this month he would restructure and refinance all future debt payments and that the country would never default on its debt.
Quevedo's predecessors, Oil Minister Eulogio del Pino and PDVSA President Nelson Martinez, were both seen as a industry veterans with significant technical expertise who favored continuing to make debt payments. 
Sources in the sector said Quevedo's appointment could quicken a white-collar exodus from PDVSA and worsen operational problems at a time when production has already tumbled to near 30-year lows of under 2 million barrels a day.
Maduro said on Tuesday he was naming Ysmel Serrano, the head of the trade and supply division, as vice president of PDVSA, which oversees the world's largest crude reserves. He said he would seek to name the country’s former energy minister, Ali Rodriguez, as ""honorary president"" of PDVSA.

More military officers are set to be named to senior management posts as part of a shake-up the government says is aimed at fighting corruption, two company sources told Reuters on Monday.

Overnight, crude oil prices settled lower on Tuesday amid ongoing investor uncertainty concerning the outcome of the OPEC meeting this week amid reports suggesting Russia is reluctant to join in extending output curbs beyond March.
Crude oil added to losses from Monday, as investors continued to fret over outcome of the OPEC meeting slated for Thursday at which the oil-cartel is expected to extend the production-cut agreement beyond March.
Market talk is that an OPEC and non-OPEC technical committee is fine with an initial six-month extension beyond March 2018 of oil output curbs with an option to go another three months depending on market conditions - but are concerned about the market reaction.
Russian oil firms reportedly want the six-month period - though politically - Saudi Arabia holds important sway with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and President Vladimir Putin.
The Saudi oil minister Khalid al Falih hinted that companies and countries are not always aligned - a reference to the fight for market share - particularly in Asia between state-owned producers and private firms.
However, sources say that Russia may reluctantly go for nine months to assure Saudi interests that IPO plans for Aramco and massive economic restructuring do not face new headwinds.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Commodity research, however, expect OPEC to extend output cuts by nine months and warned of downside risks to oil prices should OPEC fail to deliver the extension. The bank said Brent oil prices reflected a $2.5/bbl “nine month extension” premium.
In May, OPEC producers agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.2 million bpd agreed in November last year.

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2017 03:28PM ET</span>",OPEC heading for oil cut extension with a caveat,"By Alex Lawler, Vladimir Soldatkin and Ahmad Ghaddar
VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC and Russia are heading towards prolonging their oil supply cuts for the whole of 2018 but with an option to review the deal in June, OPEC sources said on Tuesday after Moscow expressed concerns the market could overheat.
The recommendation was made by a joint committee of OPEC and non-OPEC delegates including Russia but has yet to be approved by the ministers from the committee on Wednesday and then by a full OPEC meeting on Thursday, two OPEC sources said.
Oil prices deepened their two-day decline on the news, which the market could perceive as an extension of production cuts by just three months until June 2018 rather than a full year.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and nine other producers are cutting crude output by about 1.8 million barrels per day until March 2018, and on Thursday their oil ministers will discuss extending the deal.
""It will not be an easy meeting and we always look at various scenarios,"" United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui said on Tuesday in Dubai. Upon arrival in Vienna, he said cutting output through the whole of 2018 was still the main scenario but not the only one.
The market had largely expected OPEC to prolong the cuts until the end of 2018 to prop up prices and clear an excess of global stocks, but doubts have emerged in the last few days.
OPEC's leader, Saudi Arabia, has signalled that it wants oil to trade at about $60 a barrel as the kingdom prepares to list shares in national oil champion Aramco and fights a large fiscal deficit. 
The Russian government also wants high oil prices ahead of a presidential election in March 2018. But officials in Moscow have voiced worries about pricier oil boosting the rouble, which could undermine the competitiveness of Russia's economy. 
U.S. producers aggressively hedged their future production as oil recently rallied (LCOc1), raising fears of another spike in shale output in the United States, which is not participating in the global production curbs.
""Russia is on board for the extension,"" one of the OPEC sources said following the committee meeting.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), one of the most active banks in commodity trading and oil producer hedging, said on Tuesday in a note the outcome of the OPEC meeting was uncertain as Brent oil had risen above $63 per barrel.
""The push for a nine-month extension, four months before the cuts end and given an accelerating rebalancing further stands in the face of prior comments that the cuts should remain data-dependent to assess their effectiveness,"" the U.S. bank said.
Citi, one of Goldman's main rivals, said it expected major producers to end production cuts sooner rather than later.
""OPEC and Russia will both realise they are losing market share and they will be better off going back to a more competitive environment,"" the head of commodity research at Citi, Ed Morse, told Reuters.
GRADUAL OUTPUT BOOST 
Goldman said oil might fall further this week as the market had priced in a nine-month extension.
""We continue to expect a gradual ramp up in OPEC and Russian production from April onward,"" Goldman said, adding ""as a result, the announcement of an only six-month extension would still initially appear bullish relative to our expectation"".
On Friday, Russia said it was ready to support extending the output-cutting deal but had still to decide on the duration.
On Monday, Reuters reported that a major Russian production project led by  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) was preparing to ramp up output by a quarter from next year.
The project is not subject to the global output-cutting deal but the development would signal an obstacle to Russia's efforts on production curtailment. 
The Exxon project involves Rosneft, the Kremlin-owned state producer whose boss Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has long been a critic of Moscow's deal with the 14-country OPEC.
Sources close to talks between OPEC and Russia told Reuters Moscow wanted to fine-tune the language of the deal to include an option to review the agreement if global stocks fell steeply.

The supply pact is aimed at reducing oil stocks in industrialised countries to their five-year average. The latest figures suggest OPEC is more than halfway there, with OPEC sources saying the target could be reached after June 2018.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Tuesday, weighed down by uncertainty over the outcome of an OPEC meeting this week at which an extension to its price-supporting oil output cuts will be discussed.
Prices also briefly came under pressure after a fire broke out at  Exxon Mobil  Corp's (N:XOM) 362,300 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery. Firefighters have since put out the blaze but the small crude unit is shut, sources said. 
Brent crude oil (LCOc1) ended the session down 23 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $63.61 a barrel. U.S. crude (CLc1) settled 12 cents, or 0.2 percent lower at $57.99, after falling 1.4 percent in the previous session.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is heading for tougher-than-expected policy talks on Thursday. Its leader Saudi Arabia is pushing to extend output cuts by nine months while non-member Russia is hesitating due to worries that the market could overheat.
Oil output from Russia's Far Eastern Sakhalin-1 project is set to rise by about a quarter from January, sources with knowledge of the plan told Reuters, signaling Moscow may find it hard to comply with output cuts in tandem with OPEC for the whole of next year. 
A joint OPEC and non-OPEC technical committee recommended extending the deal until the end of next year, with an option to review the deal in June, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Iraq's oil minister said he supports an extension of the oil cuts while his counterpart from Kuwait said the group had not agreed on the duration of a possible extension yet.
""We believe that the outcome of this meeting is much more uncertain than usual,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said.
""We view risks to oil prices as skewed to the downside this week as we believe that current prices, time spreads and positioning already reflect a high probability of a nine-month extension,"" the Goldman analysts said.
The market had expected OPEC to extend the cuts of 1.8 million bpd beyond March until the end of 2018 to clear the overhang in global supplies, but this is now less certain.
Citigroup's head of commodity research expects OPEC to extend the deal until the middle of next year, rather than the end. But anything less than an extension until the end of next year will cause a sell-off in the price, Citi's Ed Morse added.
 Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) echoed that sentiment, saying anything beyond a plain vanilla rollover is likely to confuse the oil market.
""We think that the oil market has already almost fully priced in an extension of the OPEC and non-OPEC output deal to the end of 2018 ... We think OPEC should err in the direction of over-tightening the oil market, and pull back later if needed.""
Consultancy Wood Mackenzie projected that if the production cut agreement ends in March 2018, there would be an estimated 2.4 million bpd year-on-year increase in world oil supply for 2018.
U.S. crude touched $59.05 on Friday, its highest since mid-2015, fueled by the outage of the Keystone pipeline, one of Canada's main crude export routes to the United States. 
But  TransCanada Corp  (TO:TRP) said on Tuesday it restarted operations on the 590,000-bpd pipeline at reduced pressure. The company has no timeline on when U.S. regulators will allow it to return to full capacity, a TransCanada spokesman said.
Traders said they expect reduced flows from Keystone into the U.S. futures trading hub of Cushing, Oklahoma to keep seasonal inventory builds in check. 

Analysts polled ahead of an inventory report from industry group American Petroleum Institute (API), due later on Tuesday, estimated, on average, that crude stocks likely fell 2.3 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 24.

Futures fell as much as 1.2 percent in New York after rising above $59 a barrel last week. While all OPEC members support extending production cuts until the end of 2018, Russia hasn’t yet committed to the proposal, according to people familiar with the matter. If the outcome of OPEC’s meeting in Vienna on Thursday doesn’t meet expectations, prices could quickly drop further, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). 
“The Russian angle is working its way into the conversation,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York, in a telephone interview. If the extension is less than nine months, “the market’s not going to be very happy.”
While oil surged earlier this month on signals the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners will extend supply curbs, doubts are now hanging over the market. Saudi Arabia Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Tuesday that it’s too early to talk about the duration of a potential extension.
“Optimism has driven prices up quite a bit and now we’re seeing some cautiousness being priced in ahead of OPEC,” said Hans Van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro. “Although it’s pretty certain that the agreement will be extended, it’s more about the details and we know that Russia would prefer to wait a bit longer.”

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude January contract was down 22 cents or about 0.38% at $57.89 a barrel by 09:50 a.m. ET (13:50 GMT), off Friday's two-year highs of $59.05.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for February delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was down 33 cents or about 0.52% at $63.05 a barrel.
Traders grew more cautious as oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producing countries were set to meet in Vienna on Thursday to decide whether to extend their current production agreement beyond a March 2018 deadline.
Most market analysts expect the oil cartel to extend output cuts for a further nine months until the end of next year, but the terms were so far unclear, as Russia has sent mixed signals about whether it will back the move.
In November last year, OPEC and 11 other non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January 1 and June 30. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
The OPEC-led production cuts have been one of the key catalyst supporting the recent rally in oil prices amid expectations that rebalancing in oil markets are well underway.
However, fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies are prevented prices from rising much further, according to market participants.
Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 15% since the most recent low in mid-2016, and increasing drilling activity for new production means output is expected to grow further, as producers are attracted by climbing prices.
In other news, TransCanada Corp said that it received approval from U.S. regulators to restart the Keystone pipeline at reduced pressure on Tuesday.
The decision followed the recent outage of the 590,000 barrel-per-day pipeline, one of Canada's main crude export routes to the U.S., which had initially pushed oil prices higher.

U.S. natural gas futures jumped 5.5 cents, or around 1.8%, to $3.072 per million British thermal units by 8:45AM ET (1345GMT).
It surged 10.1 cents, or 3.5%, on Monday, the biggest daily gain since Nov. 6.
Monday's rally came as weather models predicted much colder weather across most parts of the continental United States starting from Dec. 6, along with areas of rain and snow. Initial forecasts called for mild weather during the period.
Natural gas futures have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on early-winter heating demand.
Prices of the fuel typically rise ahead of the winter as colder weather sparks heating demand.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 40 and 52 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Nov. 24.
That compares with a drop of 46 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 50 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average decline of 47 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.726 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 319 bcf, or around 7.9%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 121 bcf, or roughly 3.2%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

1067,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 28, 2017 08:32AM ET</span>",OPEC Said to Await Russia's Backing for Deal: OPEC Reality Check,"(Bloomberg) -- While OPEC is said to have reached a consensus on the need to extend oil-supply cuts to the end of 2018 when producers meet in Vienna on Thursday, Russia, its chief ally, is so far dragging its feet.
Almost a year into the historic supply agreement, the deal is working. Oil in New York is trading near a two-year high after the curbs helped drain a global glut that has weighed on prices for three years. 
Russia and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are said to have crafted the outline of a deal to continue their curbs for nine months beyond the current end-March expiry. But Moscow is concerned that supporting oil prices above $60 a barrel will only abet the resurgent U.S. shale rivals most to blame for the glut.
The market has already factored in a renewal, and anything short of an extension through 2018 “would likely be notably bearish,” RBC Capital Markets has said.
Following are the latest positions of most OPEC members, plus Russia and Kazakhstan. The respective shares of supply are based on October levels. Estimates for the price each member needs to balance its 2017 budget are from the International Monetary Fund unless stated otherwise. The compliance rate with each nation’s pledged production cut is the average through October, as compiled by Bloomberg.
Algeria
Political instability wrought by the oil-price collapse has been exacerbated by a decline in production to the lowest in more than a decade. The country is still counting on the supply pact to succeed and an extension is “desirable and probable,” state oil company chief Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour told the Wall Street Journal last month.
Angola
Angola has been one of the most dedicated participants, reducing more than it pledged in each month since the curbs took effect. Prior to her ouster this month, Isabel Dos Santos, the chairwoman of the state oil company, said the country would favor an extension if everyone else is on board.
Ecuador
OPEC’s recalcitrant minnow set a dangerous example in July when it publicly announced it would boost production -- effectively quitting the deal. Later it pleaded for an exemption instead, arguing it needed money to plug a budget deficit. Recently, Ecuador changed its tune, promising to meet its target and support whatever the majority decides at the meeting.
Iran
Since international sanctions were eased in January 2016, production has risen close to the 3.797 million-barrel-a-day cap Iran agreed on with OPEC as part of the accord. U.S. President Donald Trump later threatened to ditch the nuclear agreement that lifted the trade restrictions. Iran said last month that Trump’s “chest-beating” won’t disrupt its output plans. It supports an extension of the supply deal until the end of next year.
Iraq
Iraq consistently exceeded its quota until clashes with the semi-autonomous Kurdish region disrupted oil fields in the disputed Kirkuk province last month. Oil Minister Jabbar Al-Luaibi has backed a nine-month extension, saying his country is committed to meeting its quota, but the recent production decline may mask the long-term ambition of a country that, from the outset, resisted the imposition of curbs.
Kazakhstan
The former Soviet republic actually increased production since the agreement with OPEC and will seek an exemption for output at its new Kashagan field if the cuts are extended. Production from the giant project is likely to rise to 250,000 barrels a day by year-end, Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev told Interfax this month, trimming an earlier forecast.
Kuwait
The fifth-largest OPEC producer and a member of the committee that oversees the accord believes the decision to extend should be made closer to expiry, people familiar with the matter said this month.
Libya
The OPEC nation with Africa’s largest crude reserves has been exempted from the curbs as it struggles to restore output crippled by war. Libya is now pumping almost 1 million barrels a day, but it’s “very difficult” to say when it could increase to 1.25 million barrels, National Oil Corp. Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said last month. That’s a target Libya gave to fellow producers at a meeting in July.
Nigeria
Nigeria was exempted from the cuts as it restores production lost to rebel attacks. Together with Libya, its rising output has undermined other members’ efforts. The country promised to join the curbs after six months of calm, a prospect made more remote after Niger Delta militants ended a cease-fire this month. The country supports an extension, Minister of State for Petroleum Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu said last month. 
Russia
While Russia is said to have worked out the outline of a plan for a nine-month renewal with OPEC, the world’s biggest energy exporter is still concerned about the impact of higher prices on U.S. shale production. It previously wavered on the length of any extension to oil cuts and favored deferring any decision until closer to the expiry of the current accord. Still, an agreement is likely, according to Bloomberg oil strategist Julian Lee, since producers risk falling prices if cracks appear in their resolve, while President Vladimir Putin won’t want to risk the political gains he’s made in the Middle East since joining the pact.
Qatar
So far, a diplomatic rift between Qatar and OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates doesn’t seem to have shaken its support for the production deal. Qatar has the second-highest rate of compliance in the bloc after Saudi Arabia, and has said it will support an extension if other producers agree.
Saudi Arabia
OPEC’s strong compliance has often been attributable to the Saudis cutting more than they promised, making up for laggards like Iraq and the U.A.E. While bearing the heaviest burden, the Kingdom has still gained from the deal. Oil revenue grew 33 percent in the first nine months of the year, allowing the government to soothe potential discontent by reinstating the perks and bonuses to citizens that it controversially withdrew last year. Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih told Bloomberg Television this month the group should announce an extension in Vienna because surplus inventories won’t be eliminated by March.
United Arab Emirates
The Saudi ally has exceeded its quota in each month of the deal, but it promised in July to lift its game after Saudi Arabia rebuked OPEC members for failing to meet their commitments. Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei has said his country supports an extension, but deeper cuts aren’t under consideration.
Venezuela
Venezuela will be represented at the Vienna summit by new Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo, a military leader who was named to the post at the weekend, replacing Eulogio Del Pino. Perhaps more than any other OPEC nation, Venezuela needs the OPEC deal to work. The Latin American country gets almost all its export revenue from oil, and the price collapse left its economy reeling and its industry in decline. Production in the country, which has larger reserves than Saudi Arabia, is set to reach the lowest in almost three decades -- just when it needs petrodollars most to service its debt. Quevedo will also head the national oil company, whose former president, Nelson Martinez, said he supported the proposal to extend cuts for nine more months."

1069,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 28, 2017 08:09AM ET</span>",Gold Prices Hold Steady Near 6-Week Highs,"Investing.com - Gold prices held steady near six-week highs on Tuesday, as sentiment on the greenback remained vulnerable amid ongoing concerns over the pace of future U.S. rate hikes and uncertainty regarding a potential U.S. tax overhaul.
Comex gold futures little changed at $1,295.10 a troy ounce by 08:05 a.m. ET (12:05 GMT), just off the previous session's six-week peak of $1,299.00.
Sentiment on the greenback remained vulnerable after last week's minutes of the Federal Reserve’s November meeting showed that some officials were concerned inflation would stay below the bank's 2% target for longer than expected.
Investors were also eyeing a confirmation hearing on Tuesday for Fed chair nominee Jerome Powell, with hopes he may give some clues on future policy decisions.
In remarks prepared for the hearing released on Monday, Powell said: ""We expect interest rates to rise somewhat further and the size of our balance sheet to gradually shrink"".
Market participants also continued to focus on a potential U.S. tax reform plan. President Donald Trump was set to meet Senate Republicans on Tuesday to discuss the party's efforts to pass tax reform legislation.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.15% at 92.99, still close to Monday's nine-week lows of 92.43.
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures were up 0.29% at $17.07 a troy ounce."
1070,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2017 06:01AM ET</span>","Pressured for profit, oil majors bet big on shale technology","By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shale oil engineer Oscar Portillo spends his days drilling as many as five wells at once - without ever setting foot on a rig.
Part of a team working to cut the cost of drilling a new shale well by a third, Portillo works from a Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) office in suburban Houston, his eyes darting among 13 monitors flashing data on speed, temperature and other metrics as he helps control rigs more than 500 miles (805 km) away in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield.
For the last decade, smaller oil companies have led the way in shale technology, slashing costs by as much as half with breakthroughs such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking that turned the United States into the world's fastest-growing energy exporter.
(For a graphic detailing the decline in drilling costs, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2zCXvxE) 
Now, oil majors that were slow to seize on shale are seeking further efficiencies by adapting technologies for highly automated offshore operations to shale and pursuing advances in digitalization that have reshaped industries from auto manufacturing to retail.
If they are successful, the U.S. oil industry's ability to bring more wells to production at lower cost could amp up future output and company profits. The firms could also frustrate the ongoing effort by The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) effort to drain a global oil glut.
""We're bringing science into the art of drilling wells,"" Portillo said.
The technological push comes amid worries that U.S. shale gains are slowing as investors press for higher financial returns. Many investors want producers to restrain spending and focus on generating higher returns, not volume, prompting some to pull back on drilling.
Production at a majority of publicly traded shale producers rose just 1.3 percent over the first three quarters this year, according to  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS). 
But many U.S. shale producers vowed during third quarter earnings disclosures to deliver higher returns through technology, with many forecasting aggressive output hikes into 2018.
 Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) is using drones equipped with thermal imaging to detect leaks in oil tanks and pipelines across its shale fields, avoiding traditional ground inspections and lengthy shutdowns.
Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips (N:COP) - the largest U.S. independent oil and gas producer - sees ample opportunity to boost both profits and output. Conoco also oversees remote drilling operations in a similar way to Shell.
""The people that don't have shale in their portfolios don't understand it, frankly,"" Lance said in an interview. ""They think it's going to go away quickly because of the high [production] decline rates, or that the resource is not nearly that substantial. They're wrong on both counts.""
Shell, in an initiative called ""iShale,"" has marshaled technology from a dozen oilfield suppliers, including devices from subsea specialist TechnipFMC Plc (N:FTI) that separate fracking sand from oil and well-control software from Emerson Electric Co (N:EMR), to bring more automation and data analysis to shale operations.
One idea borrowed from deepwater projects is using sensors to automatically adjust well flows and control separators that divvy natural gas, oil and water. Today, these subsea systems are expensive because they are built to operate at the extreme pressures and temperatures found miles under the ocean's surface. 
Shell's initiative aims to create cheaper versions for onshore production by incorporating low-cost sensors similar to those in Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) Watch, eliminating the need for workers to visit thousands of shale drilling rigs to read gauges and manually adjust valves. Shell envisions shale wells that predict when parts are near mechanical failure and schedule repairs automatically.
By next year, the producer wants to begin remote fracking of wells, putting workers in one place to oversee several projects. It also would add solar panels and more powerful batteries to well sites to reduce electricity and diesel costs. 
Oil firms currently spend about $5.9 million to drill a new shale well, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. Shell expects to chop that cost to less than $4 million apiece by the end of the decade.
""There is still very little automation,"" said Amir Gerges, head of Shell's Permian operations. ""We haven't scratched the surface.""
TECHNOLOGY AND GEOLOGY
Much of the new technology is focused on where rather than how to drill. 
""There is no amount of technology that can improve bad geology,"" said Mark Papa, CEO of shale producer Centennial Resource Development Inc (O:CDEV) 
Anadarko Petroleum (N:APC),  Statoil  (OL:STL) and others are using DNA sequencing to pinpoint high potential areas, collecting DNA from microbes in oil to search for the same DNA in rock samples. ConocoPhillip's MRI techniques also borrow from medical advances.
ConocoPhillips next year will start using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to analyze Permian rock samples and find the best drilling locations, a technique the company first developed for its Alaskan offshore operations.
EOG Resources Inc (N:EOG) last year began using a detailed analysis of the oil quality of its fields. The analysis, designed by Houston start-up Premier Oilfield Laboratories, helps to speed decisions on fracking locations and avoid less productive sites. 
Premier has reduced the time needed to analyze seismic data to find oil reserves from days or weeks to seconds. Such efficiencies serve two purposes, said Nathan Ganser, Premier's director of geochemical services.

""It's not only removing costs that are superfluous,"" he said. ""It's boosting production.""

1071,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 28, 2017 03:50AM ET</span>","Oil Prices Continue Lower Ahead of U.S. Supply Data, OPEC Meeting","Investing.com - Crude prices were on the backfoot on Tuesday, extending losses from the prior session as expectations of higher supply in the U.S. combined with uncertainty over a possible extension of output cuts by major crude producers dampened sentiment.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 45 cents, or about 0.8%, to $57.66 a barrel by 3:50AM ET (0850GMT). It lost 1.4% a day earlier.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., shed 19 cents, or 0.3%, to $63.19 a barrel.
Oil prices settled lower for the first time in four sessions Monday as doubts over an extension to a production-cut deal at the OPEC meeting later this week started to creep in.
Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producing countries will meet in Vienna on Thursday to decide whether to extend their current production agreement beyond a March 2018 deadline.
Most market analysts expect the oil cartel to extend output cuts for a further nine months until the end of next year, but the terms were so far unclear, as Russia has sent mixed signals about whether it will back the move.
In November last year, OPEC and 11 other non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January 1 and June 30. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
The OPEC-led production cuts have been one of the key catalyst supporting the recent rally in oil prices amid expectations that rebalancing in oil markets are well underway.
However, fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies are prevented prices from rising much further, according to market participants.
Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 15% since the most recent low in mid-2016, and increasing drilling activity for new production means output is expected to grow further, as producers are attracted by climbing prices.
Meanwhile, investors looked ahead to weekly data from the U.S. on stockpiles of crude and refined products to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest energy consumer.
Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (2130GMT) Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 3.1 million barrels.
In other energy trading, gasoline futures dipped 1.0 cent, or 0.6%, to $1.778 a gallon, while heating oil declined 0.4 cents to $1.945 a gallon.
Natural gas futures rallied 5.0 cents, or 1.7%, to $3.067 per million British thermal units.

Jerome Powell, selected by President Donald Trump as the next Fed chair, appears before the Senate Banking Committee at 9:45AM ET (1445GMT) Tuesday for his confirmation hearing, which should provide some insight into how he plans to lead the Fed.
Powell is widely expected to sound close to outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen on monetary policy, but perhaps looser when it comes to banking regulation.
The U.S. central bank is scheduled to hold its final policy meeting of the year on Dec. 12-13, with interest rate futures pricing in a 100% chance of a rate hike at that meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
However, markets appeared doubtful over the central bank's ability to raise rates as much as it would like next year due to concern over the sluggish inflation outlook.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.

""The absence of such a consensus is due to the uncertainty on the progress of the oil market rebalancing as well as Brent oil prices trading at $63 per barrel,"" the bank said in a research note.
""The push for a nine month extension, four months before the cuts end and given an accelerating rebalancing further stands in the face of prior comments that the cuts should remain data dependent to assess their effectiveness.""
U.S. oil prices fell more than 1 percent on Monday, easing from two-year highs on prospects of higher supply from a planned restart of the Keystone crude pipeline and uncertainty about Russia's resolve to join in extending output cuts ahead of this week's Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting.
On Friday, Russia said it was ready to support extending an output cut deal. Still, Russia has not given a timeline, and on Monday there were signs Russia may find it hard to comply.
Goldman Sachs said despite a less clear outcome, it viewed risks to oil prices as skewed to the downside this week as current prices, timespreads and positioning already reflect the high probability of a nine-month extension.

""We continue to expect a gradual ramp up in OPEC and Russian production from April onward,"" Goldman said, adding ""as a result, the announcement of an only six month extension would still initially appear bullish relative to our expectation.""

Analysts see crude oil stocks down 3.150 million barrels art the end of last week. Distillate stocks are seen down by 125,000 barrels. Gasoline inventories are seen up by 1.170 million barrels.
Overnight, crude oil prices settled lower on Monday as uncertainty concerning Russia’s willingness to extend output curbs beyond March ahead of the OPEC meeting this week weighed on sentiment.
Despite expectations that OPEC will agree to extend its production cut agreement beyond March at its Nov. 30 meeting, investor doubts grew over whether Russia would agree to join in extending output curbs amid fears that major oil producers, particularly U.S. shale producers, who are not part of the pact will ramp up output to gain market share.
U.S. crude oil production has risen by 15% to 9.66 million barrels per day (bpd) since mid-2016, not far from top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia, while recent data showing a rise in drilling activity indicated an ongoing increase in US production.
Baker Hughes reported last week that the number of U.S. oil rigs rose by 9 to 747. US rig counts are on track for a monthly gain for the first time since July.
Uncertainty over continued Russia participation in the supply-cut agreements beyond March comes days after Bloomberg reported that Moscow and Riyadh had agreed they should announce an additional period of cuts at the Nov. 30 meeting.

1076,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 27, 2017 06:00PM ET</span>","Buy Rumor, Sell News Is Hedge-Fund Tack Before OPEC Meeting","(Bloomberg) -- The OPEC buzz has once again sent oil surging, but hedge funds are playing it cool.
They reduced their bullish stance on crude for a second week as they brace for OPEC’s market swings -- where prices rally too much before a high-profile meeting of the group, only to slump on an announcement that fails to surprise. 
“There has been a considerable run-up in prices already,” said Tamar Essner, an energy analyst at Nasdaq Inc. “Even if OPEC does exactly what they say they’re going to do, the market wants more shock and awe.”
Both the West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude benchmarks are trading near their highest in two years as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30, are expected to prolong their output curbs. The group and Russia have crafted the outline of a deal to extend the cuts to the end of next year, although both sides are still hammering out crucial details, according to people involved in the conversations.
Money managers are taking a lesson from the May OPEC meeting. In the weeks leading up to that gathering, futures climbed 10 percent on speculation that the group would extend cuts. But once OPEC did that, and nothing else, oil slipped back. That’s giving hedge funds a bit of deja vu.
“Hopes went so high last time that, when OPEC did what they said they were going to do, people were disappointed,” said Ashley Petersen, lead oil-market analyst at Stratas Advisors in New York. “Now it’s a little bit of wait-and-see until the OPEC meeting.”
Hedge funds cut their Brent net-long position -- the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a drop -- by 2.1 percent to 526,240 contracts in the week ended Nov. 21, according to data from ICE Futures Europe. Shorts fell 4.2 percent, while longs declined 2.3 percent.
Bullish bets on WTI, the U.S. benchmark, were also reduced. Money managers lowered their net-long position on WTI by 1.7 percent to 343,840 contracts over the same period, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Traders who are not money managers, a category called “other reportables” by the CFTC that has boosted its net-bullish position on WTI by almost 40 percent this year, pared it by 0.7 percent to 270,137 contracts.
WTI closed at $58.95 a barrel on Friday, its highest since June 2015, while Brent closed at a two-year high of $64.27 on Nov. 6. Both crudes fell on Monday as it remains uncertain how much of the curbs will be extended by OPEC and its allies, as well as what their exit strategy will be. WTI closed 1.4 percent lower at $58.11, and Brent fell less than 1 percent to $63.84.
As for fuels, money managers’ the net-longs on benchmark U.S. gasoline fell 6.9 percent, while the position on diesel was unchanged.
Still, optimism is growing that Thursday’s meeting will yield a continuation of output cuts aimed at trimming the global supply glut. Whether that persuades money managers to bet on rising prices is another matter.
“What I want to see more of is what the exit strategy is,” said Nasdaq’s Essner. “Do we just go back to a free-for-all?”

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2017 04:52PM ET</span>",TransCanada to restart Keystone pipeline on Tuesday,"By Nia Williams
CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The Keystone crude oil pipeline will restart at reduced pressure on Tuesday,  TransCanada Corp  (TO:TRP) said, nearly two weeks after closing the line after it leaked 5,000 barrels of crude in rural South Dakota.
Calgary-based TransCanada shut down the 590,000 barrel-per-day pipeline, one of Canada's main crude export routes linking Alberta's oil fields to U.S. refineries, on Nov. 16. The company is still cleaning up the spill and investigating the cause.
TransCanada said on Monday the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) reviewed its repair and restart plans. It said it will start operating the pipeline at reduced pressure, and gradually boost the volume of crude moving through.
TransCanada did not specify what the reduced pressure would be or when the pipeline would return to full capacity. PHMSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""We are communicating plans to our customers and will continue working closely with them as we begin to return to normal operating conditions,"" TransCanada said in a statement.
In its most recent update, TransCanada said it has so far cleaned up 1,065 barrels of oil.
The cleanup ""is going as fast as we would hope, they are working 24 hours a day,"" said Brian Walsh, environmental scientist manager with the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
Keystone has leaked substantially more oil, and more often, in the United States than the company indicated to regulators in risk assessments before operations began in 2010, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.
The Keystone outage roiled crude oil prices on both sides of the border as market players anticipated a glut of crude building up in Alberta while inventories fell in the U.S. futures trading hub of Cushing, Oklahoma.
The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prompt spread widened to a session low of negative 10 cents on news of the pipeline returning to service. Traders see the spread as an indicator for supply at Cushing.
The discount on Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for December delivery in Hardisty, Alberta, narrowed in thin trade to $17.90 a barrel below U.S. crude, according to Shorcan Energy brokers. On Friday December WCS settled at $21.50 a barrel under the U.S. benchmark.
The Keystone spill in South Dakota came days before neighboring Nebraska approved a route for TransCanada's planned Keystone XL pipeline, but the approved route differed from the company's preferred path. TransCanada has asked the state to reconsider, according to a filing posted on the Nebraska Public Service Commission website on Monday.
A company spokesman said TransCanada is seeking a ""clarification"" on the Nov. 20 decision, but did not provide further details.
On Saturday, landowners opposed to the pipeline responded to TransCanada's request with their own motion seeking oral arguments on the issue.

A PSC spokesperson said the body has 60 days to respond to TransCanada’s motion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices fell more than 1 percent on Monday, easing from two-year highs on prospects of higher supply from a planned restart of the Keystone crude pipeline and uncertainty about Russia's resolve to join in extending output cuts ahead of this week's OPEC meeting.
 TransCanada Corp  (TO:TRP) said it will restart its Keystone crude oil pipeline at reduced pressure on Tuesday after getting approval from U.S. regulators.
Calgary-based TransCanada shut down the 590,000 barrel-per-day pipeline, one of Canada's main crude export routes to the United States, on Nov. 16 after 5,000 barrels of oil leaked in South Dakota. Keystone carries crude from Alberta's oil sands to U.S. refineries. 
Brent futures (LCOc1) ended down just 2 cents at $63.84 a barrel while U.S. crude (CLc1) settled 84 cents, or 1.4 percent, lower at $58.11 a barrel. 
On Friday, U.S. crude touched $59.05 a barrel, its strongest since mid-2015, following the spill.
In post-settlement trading the front month spread for U.S. crude spread hit a session low of negative 10 cents a barrel, after Transcanada's restart announcement.
Oil prices have surged in recent months due to output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers. However, higher prices have encouraged greater output among U.S. producers.
OPEC and its allies cut production by 1.8 million bpd in January and have agreed to hold down output until March. OPEC meets on Thursday to discuss policy and most analysts expect a deal to extend the cuts.
On Friday, Russia said it was ready to support extending an output cut deal. Still, Russia has not given a timeline, and on Monday there were signs Russia may find it hard to comply. 
Oil output from Russia's Sakhalin-1 project is set to rise by about a quarter to 250,000-260,000 barrels per day (bpd) from January, sources with knowledge of the plan said.
""It's the OPEC parlor game that we're all playing,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York, ""The Russians being quiet about their intentions about the OPEC deal is a little unsettling.""
Oil markets will rebalance after June 2018 at the earliest, an OPEC working panel concluded last week, OPEC sources said on Monday, signaling the need to extend existing production cuts well into next year.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) expect OPEC to keep output limits for another six or nine months. However, they said this was widely expected, so prices still might fall after the OPEC meeting.
Harry Tchilinguirian, head of oil strategy at French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), also saw ""plenty of room for disappointment.""

""Should the outcome of the next OPEC meeting fall short of expectations, the large net-long speculative position on oil futures can unwind, sending prices lower and volatility higher.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp has asked the Nebraska Public Service Commission to reconsider its order approving an alternate route for the Canada-U.S. Keystone XL pipeline, according to a filing posted on the commission's website on Monday.
The Canadian pipeline company is seeking a ""clarification"" on the PSC's Nov. 20 decision, a TransCanada spokesman said. 
The approved line was not TransCanada's preferred route for the Keystone XL pipeline, but for a more costly alternative that would add 5 miles (8 km) of pipeline.
""Keystone requests the Commission reconsider its order dated November 20, 2017, in accordance with this motion,"" said the order, which was submitted on Friday.
The PSC voted 3-2 to approve a route for TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline through Nebraska, removing a big regulatory obstacle for the long-delayed project backed by President Donald Trump, but leaving its future shrouded in legal and market uncertainty.
In addition to the alternate route for the pipeline, the commission’s approval covered an additional pumping station and related transmission lines. State and federal officials said it was unclear if the route required any permits in addition to those already secured for the preferred route.

TransCanada Chief Executive Officer Russ Girling said in a statement last week that the company would review the commission’s decision to assess the impact on the project’s cost and schedule.

CARACAS (Reuters) - A general appointed at the weekend to run Venezuela's energy sector will name more military officers to senior management posts at state oil company PDVSA as part of a shakeup the government says is aimed at fighting corruption, two company sources told Reuters on Monday. 
In a surprise move, unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro on Sunday tapped Major General Manuel Quevedo to lead PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] and the Oil Ministry, giving the already powerful military control of the OPEC nation's dominant industry. 
Besides the corruption scandals, Quevedo will have to tackle an attempted debt restructuring, within the context of a deep recession and debilitating U.S. sanctions.
Sources in the sector said Quevedo's appointment could quicken a white-collar exodus from PDVSA and worsen operational problems at a time when production has already tumbled to near 30-year lows of under 2 million barrels per day.
About 50 officials at state oil company PDVSA have been arrested since August in what the state prosecutor says is a ""crusade"" against corruption.
Sources within PDVSA and the oil industry said Maduro's administration was using corruption allegations to sideline rivals and deepen its control of the industry, which accounts for over 90 percent of export revenue. 
""The order given is to militarize PDVSA in key areas,"" said a PDVSA employee, asking to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media. 
A second source said he was told military officials would take over key production divisions in Venezuela's east and west.
Venezuela's president, a former bus driver and union leader whose popularity has plummeted during the economic crisis, has gradually handed the military more power in his cabinet and in key sectors such as mining.
Unlike his popular predecessor Hugo Chavez, Maduro does not hail from the military. The opposition says he has been forced to buy the loyalty of the army, historically a power broker in Venezuela, giving them top posts and juicy business contracts while turning a blind eye to corruption. 
PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but an internal company message seen by Reuters called on workers to come to Caracas on Tuesday for Quevedo's swearing in.
""Let's all go to Caracas to consolidate the deepening of socialism and the total, absolute transformation of PDVSA,"" the message read. 
INCREASING MILITARY SWAY
Quevedo, a former housing minister with no known energy experience, is not a heavyweight in Venezuela's political scene, although two sources close to the military told Reuters he was a Maduro ally. 
Opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado predicted the appointment would worsen PDVSA's operations. 
""They're getting rid of the old executives, who although socialist and working under catastrophic management, at least knew about oil,"" he said. ""Now we're going to have totally inexperienced hands."" 
Although military appointees had been on the rise within the oil industry too, Quevedo's appointment is the first time in a decade and a half that a military official has taken the helm of the oil industry. 
PDVSA so far had been led by chemist Nelson Martinez and the Oil Ministry by engineer Eulogio Del Pino, both of whom rose in the ranks under previous PDVSA president and Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez. 
Later demoted to become Venezuela's representative at the United Nations in New York, Ramirez recently criticized Maduro for not reforming Venezuela's flailing economy, in what insiders say is a power struggle between the two rivals. 
OIL COMPANIES WORRY
The opposition has also accused Quevedo of violating human rights during the National Guard's handling of anti-Maduro protests, in which stone-throwing hooded youths regularly clashed with tear gas-firing soldiers. 
U.S. Senator Marco Rubio included Quevedo on a 2014 list of Venezuelan officials whom he said should be named in U.S. sanctions, although Quevedo does not appear in the list released by the U.S. Treasury Department.
Venezuela's government denies abuses, saying protesters were in fact part of a U.S.-promoted ""armed insurrection"" designed to sabotage socialism in Latin America. 
Quevedo's appointment has worried foreign oil companies in Venezuela, including U.S. major  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and Russian state oil giant Rosneft, according to industry sources.
Venezuela is also trying to pull off a complex restructuring of foreign debt, including $60 billion in bonds, about half of which have been issued by PDVSA. Bondholders were invited to Caracas for a meeting with the government two weeks ago, but market sources say there has been no concrete progress or proposals since. 
PDVSA said on Friday it was making last-minute payments on two bonds close to default, including one backed by shares in U.S.-based Citgo, a Venezuelan-owned refiner and marketer of oil and petrochemical products, due on Monday, and called for ""trust"" as it seeks to maintain debt service amid the crisis.

Quevedo's position on the debt issue is not publicly known.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $7.64, or 0.34%, to $1295.12 a troy ounce.
A Japanese diplomat warned on Monday that radio signals detected from the North Korea indicated another North Korean missile test was close, fuelling demand for safe-haven gold. 
“There is a possibility of missiles launches in the next few days,” a Japanese government official said on Monday, according to Japan's Kyodo news agency. The potential of fresh missile launches from the Kim Jong-un led nation is believed to be part of the North Korea army’s winter training regime.
Also supporting the uptick in gold prices was ongoing flattening in the yield curve as the yield spread between long-term and short-term bonds continued to narrow. A flattering yield curve usually indicates uncertainty over long-term economic growth. Investor concerns over flattening in the yield curve comes as markets await Jerome Powell’s appearance before Congress on Tuesday. 
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

Futures slid as much as 2.4 percent in New York after rising 1.6 percent Friday to the most since June 2015. OPEC and Russia, partners in the oil-cuts deal, have crafted the outline of an agreement to extend curbs to the end of next year, according to people involved in the discussions. But doubts remain over the size of the reductions after the current accord expires in March, as well as which exit strategy the group will adopt. Meanwhile, drillers targeting crude in the U.S. added nine rigs last week.
""What we’re seeing is cold feet heading into the OPEC meeting,"" said Ashley Petersen, lead oil market analyst at Stratas Advisors in New York.
Oil has advanced about 23 percent since the start of September on speculation the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will prolong output reductions to drain a global glut. OPEC and Russia are still hammering out crucial details for an extension, the people involved in the conversations said last week. Russia wants the deal to include new language that would link the size of the curbs to the health of the oil market, they said.

Bullion rose for the third time in four days as a gauge of the dollar traded close to the lowest since September. A report later this week is forecast to show the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation slowed in October, after Chair Janet Yellen cautioned last week that raising rates too quickly risks stranding inflation below the central bank’s target.
Bullion is up almost 13 percent since Dec. 31, on course for the best year since 2010, as geopolitical uncertainty underpins demand for the metal as a haven and divisions among U.S. central bankers persist over the path of rate policy. Low rates boost the appeal of non-interest-bearing assets such as gold. Meeting minutes published last week showed several Fed policy makers were concerned about low expectations for consumer-price gains.
“A weaker dollar underpinned gold and traders are covering shorts,” George Gero, a New York-based managing director at RBC Wealth Management, said in an email. Asset allocators “are closely watching” the $1,300 level, he wrote.
Bullion futures for February delivery climbed 0.7 percent to $1,300.30 an ounce at 11:50 a.m. on the Comex in New York. A most-active contract hasn’t traded above $1,300 since Oct. 16.

1086,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 27, 2017 11:31AM ET</span>",OPEC Clash With U.S. for Oil Supremacy Near Day of Reckoning,"(Bloomberg) -- The clash between OPEC and America’s oil industry is reaching a day of reckoning.
The U.S. shale revolution is on course to be the greatest oil and gas boom in history, turning a nation once at the mercy of foreign imports into a global player. That seismic shift shattered the dominance of Saudi Arabia and the OPEC cartel, forcing them into an alliance with long-time rival Russia to keep a grip on world markets.
So far, it’s worked -- global oil stockpiles are draining and prices are near two-year highs. But as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia prepare to meet in Vienna this week to extend production cuts, ministers have little idea how U.S. shale production will respond in 2018.
“The production cuts are effective -- it was absolutely the right decision, and the fact of striking a deal with Russia was crucial,” said Paolo Scaroni, vice-chairman of NM Rothschild & Sons and former chief executive officer of Italian oil giant Eni SpA. Nonetheless, “OPEC has not the same power. The U.S. becoming the biggest producer of oil in the world is a dramatic change.”
For OPEC members, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is embarking on a radical economic transformation of the kingdom, including a partial sale of its state oil company that could be the largest public offering in history. Venezuela, reeling from years of recession and a crushing debt burden, is on the brink of political implosion.
Eroding Surplus
The producers’ efforts to clear the oil surplus are starting to pay off. They’ve drained excess inventories in developed nations this year by 183 million barrels, or more than half of the glut, which now stands at about 140 million barrels, according to OPEC data. That has revived London-traded crude futures, which sank below $45 a barrel this summer, to a two-year high of $64.65 on Nov. 7.
That success goes some way to countering accusations that OPEC had lapsed from the dominant market force of the 1970s and 1980s into irrelevance. Although its 14 members still pump 40 percent of the world’s oil, their share has dwindled from the days when OPEC held the global economy in thrall.
“People may have thought that OPEC was dead, but Saudi Minister Khalid Al-Falih has succeeded in building agreements and alliances within OPEC and non-OPEC, such as Russia, to restrain production,” said Luis Giusti, an adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and former CEO of state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA.
Losing Momentum
There are even signs that OPEC’s opponents, the dozens of drillers tapping shale-oil deposits in Texas and North Dakota, are losing momentum. Companies may have already squeezed costs and maximized productivity as much as possible, and their investors are finally insisting profits are returned to them rather than re-invested in more drilling.
Mark Papa, CEO of Centennial Resource Development Inc. and considered one of the industry’s founders, said in September that shale “is not nearly the Big Bad Wolf that everybody thinks.”
A year-long ramp-up in drilling by American operators appeared to hit a plateau in July, data from Baker Hughes show, and companies such as Pioneer Natural Resources Co. have lowered their output targets.
The outlook for shale is so clouded that when OPEC officials invited industry experts to brief them on the topic last week, they were disturbed by the diversity of opinions. Veteran crude trader Andy Hall, whose decision to close his main hedge fund this year was partly driven by shale’s unpredictability, told the organization that 2018 growth estimates vary from 500,000 barrels a day to 1.7 million a day.
Yet, the basic paradox confronting OPEC is that the more it succeeds in bolstering prices, the more it emboldens shale explorers and other competitors, said Mike Wittner, head of oil market research at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA in New York.
Increases in U.S. oil production next year will be big enough to cancel much of the sacrifices made by OPEC and Russia, leaving the surplus more or less intact, forecasts from the International Energy Agency show. The recent rebound in prices could energize shale even further.
Instead of being able to declare victory next year and restore the production they’ve halted, OPEC may find itself trapped in an open-ended struggle, Wittner said.
Catch-22
“Now that they’re in it, I don’t see how they get out of it,” said Wittner. “They need to continue supply management for the foreseeable future.”
The need to cooperate indefinitely could strain the Saudi-Russia partnership.
While the Saudi-Russia alliance has allowed them to call a “truce in the battle for market share,” they may end up fighting over customers again when faced with a relentless tide of crude exports from the U.S., said Ed Morse, head of commodities research at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). in New York.
With U.S. crude exports climbing from close to zero three years ago to now exceeding the combined shipments of OPEC’s smallest members, it increasingly looks as if the face-off between the cartel and what was formerly its biggest customer “has an endgame,” Morse said.
“And the endgame is there’s an awful lot of shale in the world.”

1087,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 27, 2017 09:50AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices Mixed With OPEC Meeting in Focus,"Investing.com - Crude oil prices were mixed on Monday, as markets were jittery ahead of a highly-anticipated meeting of global oil producers scheduled on Thursday.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude January contract was down 76 cents or about 1.29% at $58.19 a barrel by 09:50 a.m. ET (13:50 GMT), off Friday's two-year highs of $59.05.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for February delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up 18 cents or about 0.28% at $63.65 a barrel.
Investors remained cautious as oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producing countries were set to meet in Vienna on Thursday to decide whether to extend their current production agreement beyond a March 2018 deadline.
Russia said on Friday that it is ready to support extending the deal, but made no mention of how long it should last beyond its March expiry.
Under the original terms of the deal, OPEC and 11 other non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day for the first six months of 2017. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
The OPEC-led production cuts have been one of the key catalyst supporting the recent rally in oil prices amid expectations that rebalancing in crude markets are well underway.
However, fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies are prevented prices from rising much further, according to market participants.
Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 15% since the most recent low in mid-2016, and increasing drilling activity for new production means output is expected to grow further, as producers are attracted by climbing prices.

1088,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 27, 2017 09:21AM ET</span>",Natural Gas Futures Rally 3% To Start the Week,"Investing.com - Natural gas futures started the week off with sharp gains on Monday, as traders returned to the market to seek cheap valuations after prices fell by the most since late February in the last session.
U.S. natural gas futures surged 8.6 cents, or around 3%, to $3.002 per million British thermal units by 9:20AM ET (1420GMT). It plunged 15.5 cents, or 5.2%, on Friday, the biggest daily drop since Feb. 21.
The commodity lost 9.2% last week, marking the largest weekly percentage decline since the period ended Feb. 3., as forecasts for a warm start to December raised the specter of a third straight mild winter.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in late October and early November, when mild weather weakens demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 40 and 52 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Nov. 24.
That compares with a drop of 46 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 50 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average decline of 47 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.726 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 319 bcf, or around 7.9%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 121 bcf, or roughly 3.2%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

Comex gold futures were up $7.05 or about 0.55% at $1,294.29 a troy ounce by 08:05 a.m. ET (12:05 GMT).
Sentiment on the greenback remained vulnerable after last Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s November meeting showed that some officials were concerned inflation would stay below the bank's 2% target for longer than expected.
The minutes echoed comments by Fed Chair Janet Yellen earlier in the week that she was uncertain about the inflation outlook.
While a rate hike in December is still almost fully priced in, investors pared back expectations for further rate hikes in 2018.
Market participants also continued to focus on a potential U.S. tax reform plan. President Donald Trump was set to meet Senate Republicans on Tuesday to discuss the party's efforts to pass tax reform legislation.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.17% at 92.55, the lowest since September 26.

(Reuters) - TransCanada Corp's (TO:TRP) existing Keystone pipeline has leaked substantially more oil, and more often, in the United States than indicated in risk assessments the company provided to regulators before the project began operating in 2010, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.
The Canadian company is now seeking to expand the pipeline system linking Alberta's oil fields to U.S. refineries with its proposed Keystone XL project, which has U.S. President Donald Trump's backing.
The existing 2,147-mile (3,455 km) Keystone system from Hardisty, Alberta, to the Texas coast has had three significant leaks in the United States since it began operating in 2010, including a 5,000-barrel spill this month in rural South Dakota, and two others, each about 400 barrels, in South Dakota in 2016 and North Dakota in 2011.
Before constructing the pipeline, TransCanada provided a spill risk assessment to regulators that estimated the chance of a leak of more than 50 barrels to be ""not more than once every seven to 11 years over the entire length of the pipeline in the United States,"" according to its South Dakota operating permit.
For South Dakota alone, where the line has leaked twice, the estimate was for a ""spill no more than once every 41 years.""
The spill risk analysis was conducted by global risk management company DNV GL. A spokesman for DNV did not respond to a request for comment.
Members of South Dakota's Public Utilities Commission told Reuters last week they could revoke TransCanada's operating permit if an initial probe of last week's spill shows it violated the terms of the license.
Those terms include requirements for standards for construction, regular inspections of pipeline infrastructure, and other environmental safeguards.
""They testified that this is going to be a state-of-the-art pipeline,"" said one of the commissioners, Gary Hanson. ""We want to know the pipeline is going to operate in a fashion that is safe and reliable. So far it's not going well."" 
TransCanada shut a section of the line while it cleans up the leak, which occurred near the town of Aberdeen on Nov. 16. An official did not respond to a request for comment.
The spill took place days before regulators in neighboring Nebraska approved a route for TransCanada's proposed Keystone XL pipeline through the state, lifting the last major regulatory hurdle for the expansion that has been delayed for years by environmental opposition.
Trump handed TransCanada a presidential permit for Keystone XL in March, reversing former President Barack Obama's decision to reject the line on economic and environmental grounds, saying that it would create jobs and boost national security. 

TransCanada's spill analysis for Keystone XL, which would cross Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska, estimates 2.2 leaks per decade with half of those at volumes of 3 barrels or less. It estimated that spills exceeding 1,000 barrels would occur at a rate of once per century.

It rose to $59.05 on Friday, its best level since July 2015, partly driven higher by the closure of the 590,000 barrel-per-day Keystone pipeline connecting Canada's oil sand fields with the United States following a spill, driving down inventories at the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., were little changed from their prior close at $63.53 a barrel.
WTI gained about 4.2% last week, while Brent marked a climb of about 1.8%.

Comex gold futures inched up $4.70, or about 0.4%, to $1,292.02 a troy ounce by 3:05AM ET (0805GMT).
Gold futures finished modestly lower in an abbreviated session on Friday to notch a roughly 0.7% weekly decline, its first weekly fall of the past three.
The changing of the guard at the Federal Reserve will be a big focus for investors this week, as both the current chair and next head of the U.S. central bank are scheduled to speak.
Fed governor Jerome Powell, selected by President Donald Trump as the next Fed chair, appears before the Senate Banking Committee at 9:45AM ET (1445GMT) Tuesday for his confirmation hearing.
The following day, Fed Chair Janet Yellen testifies on the economy at 10AM ET (1500GMT) on Capitol Hill, before the Joint Economic Committee.
Powell is widely expected to sound close to Yellen on monetary policy, but perhaps looser when it comes to banking regulation.
Besides Powell and Yellen, there are a number of other Fed speakers this week, including New York Fed President William Dudley, who also is expected to exit his role next year.
The U.S. central bank is scheduled to hold its final policy meeting of the year on Dec. 12-13, with interest rate futures pricing in a 100% chance of a rate hike at that meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
However, markets appeared doubtful over the central bank's ability to raise rates as much as it would like next year due to concern over the sluggish inflation outlook.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
Staying in the U.S., a report on personal income and spending, which includes the personal consumption expenditures inflation data, the Fed's preferred metric for inflation, will be the highlight of the week.
This week's calendar also features the second estimate of GDP growth for the third quarter on Wednesday, expected to show a small upward revision from 3.0% to 3.2%.
Reports on ISM manufacturing sector growth, CB consumer confidence, new home sales, pending home sales and monthly auto sales will also be on the agenda.
On the political front, tax reform will likely stay at the forefront, as markets look for any new developments on the Trump Administration's tax bill.

1093,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2017 09:11PM ET</span>",Maduro taps major general to lead Venezuela's deteriorating oil industry,"By Alexandra Ulmer and Deisy Buitrago
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Sunday tapped a National Guard major general to lead state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] and the Oil Ministry as the OPEC member labors under near 30-year lows in oil production. 
Industry analysts and sources said the surprise appointment of Manuel Quevedo, a former housing minister with no known energy experience, was a bad omen for the country’s already deteriorated oil industry. 
Quevedo takes over from two industry veterans to become one of the most powerful players in the country, which is home to the world’s largest crude reserves. He will have to tackle corruption scandals and an attempted debt restructuring, within the context of a deep recession and debilitating U.S. sanctions. 
“The time for a new oil revolution has come,” leftist Maduro said in his televised Sunday address, urging Quevedo to purge PDVSA of corruption. Last week, six executives from U.S.-based Citgo Petroleum Corp, or Citgo, a Venezuelan-owned refiner and marketer of oil and petrochemical products, were arrested in Caracas on graft allegations. 
About 50 officials at state oil company PDVSA have been arrested since August in what the state prosecutor says is a “crusade” against corruption. 
Sources within PDVSA and the oil industry said Maduro’s administration was using corruption allegations to sideline rivals and deepen its control of the industry, which accounts for over 90 percent of export revenue.
'SACRED TEMPLE OF THE PEOPLE' 
Quevedo, whom two sources close to the military identified as a Maduro ally, will take over his new roles on Monday before he is officially sworn in on Tuesday. He vowed on Sunday to bring PDVSA closer to the ideals of late leftist leader Hugo Chavez. 
”We’re going to turn PDVSA into the sacred temple of the people!“ tweeted Quevedo, who Maduro said would still dedicate 20 percent of his time to the “Grand Housing Mission,” a Chavez-era project. 
It was unclear how Quevedo planned to increase oil production, or what position he would have in Venezuela’s complex attempt to restructure its debt, although his appointment is likely to worry bondholders. 
A half dozen current and former PDVSA sources, who were taken aback by Quevedo’s appointment, said his arrival would likely deepen a brain drain and could complicate everything from daily operations to negotiations with bondholders. 
One PDVSA source, who asked not to be named, said a PDVSA board reshuffle was due in the next few days.
MILITARY MOVES IN 
Quevedo’s rise also highlighted the increasing power of the Venezuelan military, which has gained clout in Maduro's Cabinet and in key industries like mining and food distribution. 
While military appointments had also been increasing in the oil industry, PDVSA so far had been led by chemist Nelson Martinez and the Oil Ministry by engineer Eulogio Del Pino. 
“The military has achieved its aim of controlling PDVSA. The forecast is somber,” said Francisco Monaldi, a fellow in Latin American energy policy at the Baker Institute in Houston, echoing much of the mood in the local oil industry. 
Quevedo also faces accusations from the opposition of violating human rights during the National Guard's handling of anti-Maduro protests.
U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a vocal critic of Maduro, had included Quevedo on a 2014 list of Venezuelan officials who should be named in U.S. sanctions, although Quevedo does not appear in the list released by the U.S. Treasury Department. 
”This is a game changer for international oil companies. If political and reputational risk could get any higher for oil companies, this is it,” said Raul Gallegos, an analyst with the consultancy Control Risks. 

PDVSA is closely allied with Russian state oil giant Rosneft (MM:ROSN) and state-owned oil major China National Petroleum Corp [CNPET.UL], although Western oil companies like U.S. major  Chevron  (N:CVX) and France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) also operate in Venezuela.

1094,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 26, 2017 06:42AM ET</span>",Gold / Silver / Copper Prices - Weekly Outlook: Nov. 27 - Dec. 1,"Investing.com - Gold prices slid lower on Friday as some investors took profits at the end of the week, but losses were held in check by the weaker dollar.
Gold futures for December delivery settled down 0.32% at $1,288.04 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. For the week, gold prices ended down 0.71%.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.34% to 92.72 in late trade. For the week, the index was down 0.93%, its third consecutive weekly decline.
A weaker dollar typically tends to support gold, which is denominated in the U.S. currency and becomes more affordable to foreign buyers when the dollar declines.
The dollar remained on the back foot after Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s November meeting showed that some officials were concerned inflation would stay below the bank's 2% target for longer than expected.
The minutes echoed comments by Fed Chair Janet Yellen earlier in the week that she was uncertain about the inflation outlook.
While a rate hike in December is still almost fully priced in, investors pared back expectations for further rate hikes in 2018, sending the dollar lower.
Elsewhere in precious metals trading, silver followed gold lower and was down 0.61% at $17.00 a troy ounce late Friday, while platinum settled at $945.05, up 0.46% for the day.
Silver lost 1.69% for the week, its first weekly decline in three weeks. Platinum lost 0.93% for the week, its first weekly fall in four.
Among base metals, copper prices rose to their highest in nearly a month on Friday, supported by the weaker dollar.
Copper for December delivery was up 1.21% at $3.175 in late trade, its highest settlement since October 26.
A weaker dollar and a pickup in global growth have pushed copper prices up almost 27% this year.
In the week ahead, the changing of the guard at the Federal Reserve will be a big focus for investors, with investors awaiting comments from a number of Fed speakers, including both the current chair and next head of the U.S. central bank.
U.S data on personal income and spending, which includes the personal consumption expenditures inflation data, the Fed's preferred metric for inflation, will also be closely watched.

1095,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 26, 2017 05:31AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices - Weekly Outlook: Nov. 27 - Dec. 1,"Investing.com - Crude oil prices finished higher in an abbreviated session on Friday, with the U.S. benchmark surging to its best level since July 2015, as the shutdown at North America's Keystone pipeline continued to cut deliveries to storage facilities.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 93 cents, or around 1.6%, to end at $58.95 a barrel by close of trade, levels not seen since the summer of 2015.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., tacked on 31 cents, or roughly 0.5%, to settle at $63.86 a barrel.
Trading in crude futures settled an hour earlier on Friday, at 1:30PM ET, following the observance of Thanksgiving in the U.S. on Thursday.
For the week, WTI gained about 4.2%, while Brent marked a climb of about 1.8%.
The disruption to the Keystone pipeline connecting Canada’s Alberta oil sands to U.S. refineries has reduced the usual 590,000 barrel-per-day flow to U.S. refineries, driving down inventories at the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma
Flow from the pipeline, which was shut on Nov. 16 following a 5,000-barrel spill in South Dakota, was expected to be reduced by 85% through the end of November, according to line operator TransCanada.
Crude prices were further supported by growing signals that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies will agree to prolong supply curbs when producers meet in Vienna at the end of the month.
Russia said on Friday it is ready to support extending a deal among oil producers on cutting output, but made no mention of how long this should last beyond its March expiry.
Under the original terms of the deal, OPEC and 11 other non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day for the first six months of 2017. The agreement was then extended back in May of this year for a period of nine more months until March 2018.
The OPEC-led production cuts have been one of the key catalyst supporting the recent rally in oil prices amid expectations that rebalancing in crude markets are well underway.
In other energy trading, gasoline futures tacked on 2.0 cents, or 1.1%, to end at $1.788 on Friday. It closed around 2.5% higher for the week.
Heating oil advanced 2.0 cents, or 1.1%, to $1.952 a gallon, marking a 0.3% weekly gain and booking its seventh weekly climb in a row.
Meanwhile, natural gas futures plunged 15.5 cents, or 5.2%, to settle at $2.813 per million British thermal units. For the week, futures lost 9.2%, marking the largest weekly percentage drop since the period ended Feb. 3., amid forecasts for less heating demand through early December.
In the week ahead, market participants will focus on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries highly-anticipated meeting on Thursday to see whether major producers plan to extend their current production-cut agreement.
Most market analysts expect the oil cartel to extend output cuts for a further nine months until the end of next year in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Energy traders will also eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.
Tuesday

The company had shut down its 590,000 barrel-per-day Keystone pipeline, which links Alberta's oil sands to U.S. refineries, on Nov. 16 after a 5,000-barrel spill. It has not yet set an expected restart date for the pipeline, which is one of Canada's main crude export pipelines.
Additional excavation will be conducted beyond Sunday for soil remediation purposes, the Calgary-based company said, adding, it has about 170 personnel round-the-clock on the site engaged in clean-up activities. 
Preliminary inspections of the damaged section will be completed on site by both TransCanada and U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) staff, then sent to Washington, D.C., for an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board's Metallurgical Laboratory, the company said.

1097,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 24, 2017 04:00PM ET</span>",Myopic Gold CEOs Get a Tongue-Lashing From Randgold's Bristow,"(Bloomberg) -- A gold industry obsessed with containing costs and minimizing risks will find itself at the edge of a cliff by 2020 as supply tightens, according to one of the most profitable producers.
Despite prices recovering from 2015 lows, the industry has been slow to reinvest in exploration or sustaining capital,  Randgold Resources  (LON:RRS) Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said. Half of the gold coming out of the ground isn’t profitable to mine based on the true extraction costs, he said.
“The one thing this industry does very well is mine gold at a loss,” Bristow told analysts at a breakfast meeting in Toronto on Friday.
The weakening outlook is being masked by a focus on all-in-sustaining costs rather than cash costs, he said. While companies can lower AISC and boost earnings by reducing spending to sustain operations or tightening exploration budgets, the tactic erodes asset quality in the long run, the CEO said.
Similarly, severe damage has been done by high-grading, which shortens the life of a mine by focusing on the best quality ore. Since 2007, grades have dropped from an average of 2.5 grams a ton to about 1 gram, Bristow said.
It’s not the first time Bristow has warned the industry is effectively producing at a loss. Two years ago, as prices hit a five-year low, he told analysts that half the metal coming out of the ground wasn’t profitable. That hasn’t changed despite a 20 percent-plus improvement in prices because it was accompanied by a drop in grades, he said in an interview following the analyst meeting.
In addition, large producers have re-focused on the developed world to minimize risks at the expense of asset quality, he said: “If you want to find elephants, go to elephant country.”
Meanwhile, Bristow blamed the widespread use of proxies by fund managers for the failure of executives and boards to be held accountable. He’s not the first to call for a reckoning within the industry. In September, billionaire John Paulson’s firm called for the creation of a coalition of gold investors to curb years of value destruction.
Paulson’s presentation cited $85 billion in lost value in the gold industry since 2010, but listed Randgold as offering the best shareholder total returns. The Jersey, Channel Islands-based company has the highest profit margin among large producers after Polyus PJSC, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
But Bristow said Paulson’s Shareholder’s Gold Council isn’t the best way to clean up the industry.
“Management can’t be overly reckless with capital if it’s not allowed to be,” he said. “What’s missing there is a recognition that fund managers have been equally, or more reckless. I’m not sure that creating another club is the right approach.”
Large funds need to become much more active in working to appoint and remove board members rather than relying on proxy managers, Bristow said.
Survival Deals
Meanwhile, “survival mergers” are needed because the industry has too many junior miners with single short-lived assets, he said.
The industry is headed for a dramatic supply shortage from 2020 if gold prices stay between $1,000 and $1,400 an ounce, he said.
Input costs probably will rise as “you’ve got a complete over-inflation of value in just about every asset class and industry in the world, with burgeoning central bank balance sheets.”
The result will be higher gold prices -- but history has proven that’s not necessarily what’s best for the industry, he said.
“It would have just been very nice for the gold price to stay at $1,040 for another six months so it would clean the industry up,” Bristow said . “It just was too short-lived, that low gold price.”"

Gold prices struggled to pare losses sustained earlier the week snapping a two-week winning streak on Friday amid falling geopolitical uncertainty and profit taking. 
The uncertainty surrounding the future leadership position of German chancellor Angela Markel eased after Germany’s Social Democrats said it would consider talks with Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic party to form a government.

1100,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2017 12:01PM ET</span>",Russia ready to support oil output deal as OPEC meeting looms,"By Vladimir Soldatkin
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Friday it is ready to support extending a deal among oil producers on cutting output, less than a week before OPEC meets in Vienna to discuss policy, although it has yet to say how long it should be for.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that Russia would discuss the details of an extension of the global deal on Nov. 30, but made no mention of how long this should last beyond its March expiry.
""We see that 50 percent of oil stockpiles have been removed, the oil price has reached its balance,"" Novak told RBC TV.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and several other major producers have cut their combined output by about 1.8 million barrels per day since January to reduce bloated inventories and boost oil prices.
""However, the targets on rebalancing the market have not been reached. Everyone supports the extension, so that the targets are finally reached,"" Novak said, adding that ""different options are under consideration"".
Saudi Arabia has been pushing for an extension for nine months until the end of 2018, a position President Vladimir Putin had suggested in October that Russia backed.
Russia, heavily reliant on oil revenues but wary that any sharp rise in prices may be followed by another punishing collapse, has since sent mixed signals about timing.
Russia's TASS news agency reported earlier this week that oil producers and the Russian Energy Ministry had discussed a six-month extension..
Then on Thursday, Russia's Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin said Russian economic growth had been hurt by the deal because it dampened investment - the first clearly negative assessment of the pact by a senior Russian official.
Novak's comments on Friday were made in Bolivia where he is at a Gas Exporting Countries Forum of leading gas producers.
The Russian minister had met the Qatari and Venezuelan oil ministers in Bolivia, as well as an official from the United Arab Emirates, Russian news agencies reported.
DOG FIGHT IN PROSPECT 
One of the stumbling blocks for extending the OPEC-led deal is a boom in U.S. oil production , which has jumped by 15 percent since mid-2016 to a record 9.66 million bpd.
U.S. producers, which scaled back output with the price slump after mid-2014, have ramped up production as oil prices climbed (LCOc1). Higher U.S. output undermines the impact of output cuts and erodes market share for others, like Russia.
""Make no mistake, expect the dog fight for the global markets once the deal expires,"" a source at a Russian oil major said about scenarios once the deal on curbing output expires.
A key task of the agreement, lifting prices, has been achieved. Benchmark Brent crude, which tumbled from well above $100 a barrel in 2014 to about $27 in 2016, is back above $60.
Russia's budget is based on an oil price of $40 per barrel, suggesting there is a good cushion against a sudden price slide.
Novak said on Friday he expected the oil price to remain between $50 and $60 a barrel this and next year.
But Moscow has had to deal with economic and social fallout caused by price falls in 2008-09 and since 2014, said Chris Weafer at Moscow-based Macro-Advisory.

""The damage from a third collapse would likely greatly outweigh the financial gains to be made from higher oil in the meantime,"" he wrote.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices hit their highest levels in more than two years on Friday as the shutdown at North America's Keystone pipeline continued to cut deliveries to storage facilities.
U.S. light crude (CLc1) hit $58.92 a barrel, a more than two-year high, before easing to trade up 68 cents on the day at $58.70 by 1424 GMT.
Trading activity was expected to be low on Friday due to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.
Benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) was trading flat at $63.55 a barrel.
The spill on Nov. 16 at the Keystone system linking Alberta's oil sands with U.S. refineries has reduced the usual 590,000 barrel-per-day flow to U.S. refineries, driving down inventories at the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, traders said.
PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said the spill was helping U.S. crude, flipping prices into backwardation, when front-month prices rise above those for future months, indicating an undersupplied market.
""January is now 4 cents more expensive than February, and I think we have not seen that for three years,"" he said.
Markets have also tightened globally due to output cuts since January by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and several other producers.
OPEC meets on Nov. 30 and is expected to extend the pact to curb supplies beyond its expiry in March, although Russia has sent mixed signals about its support for an extension.
""With the majority of OPEC members endorsing an extension, Russian support is the key risk,"" Jon Rigby, head of oil research at UBS, wrote in a note.
President Vladimir Putin indicated in October that Russia backed extending the deal to the end of 2018, but comments by officials and in the Russian media have created uncertainty since then, he said.
J.P. Morgan said a decision on any extension could be delayed until next year if Brent stayed above $60.
However, rising U.S. oil production  has curbed crude price gains, as it fills some of the gap left by OPEC and its allies. U.S. output has jumped by 15 percent since mid-2016 to a record 9.66 million bpd, thanks largely to shale drilling.

The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and several non-OPEC nations led by Russia will meet next week in Vienna to discuss prolonging their output curbs. The Kremlin had been hesitating over the need for an extension because the current deal doesn’t expire until the end of March.
After days of talks, Moscow and Riyadh now agree they should announce an additional period of cuts at the Nov. 30 meeting, the people said, asking not to be named because the conversations are private. Russia wants the extension deal to include new language that would link the size of the curbs to the health of the oil market, they said.
“The goal to re-balance the market hasn’t been met in full yet, so everyone is in favor of extensions to reach final goals, Russia also supports these proposals,” Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in an interview with RBC television on Friday. “Different options are considered now, we will discuss details at the Nov. 30 meeting.”
The deal isn’t finalized as Russia and Saudi Arabia haven’t yet agreed on the new language, the people said. Oil ministers are due to start arriving in Vienna for the talks early next week.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, extended gains to the highest level since July 2015. Futures for January delivery rose as much as 1.6 percent to $58.92 a barrel in New York.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries are discussing several formulas to accommodate the Russian demands, including linking the cuts to the supply-demand balance on the global oil market, or the level of fuel inventories in industrialized countries, the people said. Another option is making a clear reference to the fact that the deal could be reviewed again early next year, including the possibility of calling another meeting.

1105,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 24, 2017 06:10AM ET</span>",IMF credit to Chad delayed over Glencore oil debt,"By Julia Payne and Madjiasra Nako
LONDON/N'DJAMENA (Reuters) - Chad's stalled talks with  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) on restructuring more than $1 billion in debt due to the trading firm has delayed the release of IMF funds for the struggling central African country until at least early next year, sources familiar with the matter said.
The International Monetary Fund has said Chad's external commercial debt, most of which is to Glencore, was unsustainable as it eats up most of the country's oil revenues. 
The fund approved just over $300 million in credit for Chad at the end of June. The IMF initially released $48.8 million to Chad but said the release of further funds would depend on progress reports at subsequent meetings.
Negotiations are likely to be further delayed after President Idriss Deby sacked his Finance Minister Christian Georges Diguimbaye and the deputy.
A Chadian government source said a mid-November deadline for Chad to report progress on commercial debt talks to the IMF was missed and IMF funds would not be released until early 2018.
""Chad's case was to be discussed by an IMF council on Nov. 15 but a commercial agreement with Glencore was needed for this to be valid. As this did not occur, the case will be submitted in December for a fund release in January or February,"" the source said.
A second Chadian government source also said the next disbursement from the IMF had been delayed.
The IMF said at the end of June that the ""remaining amount will be phased over the duration of the program, subject to semi-annual reviews."" The program lasts three years.
An IMF spokesman did not respond to requests for comment by phone and email. A spokesman for Glencore declined to comment.
Negotiations to amend the loan terms for a second time since the 2014 oil price crash became fraught last month after Chad cut part of the oil Glencore had been due to receive in favor of ExxonMobil (N:XOM), starting from January.
A series of meetings in Paris this month ended without a deal. After the meetings, commodities trader and miner Glencore wrote a letter copied to the IMF reiterating its offer.
A spokesman for Chad's state-run oil firm Societe des Hydrocarbures du Tchad (SHT) said the firm was seeking an overall reduction on the interest rate from ""about 9 percent to a maximum of 5 percent, including Libor.""
Glencore said in its letter it had offered a temporary interest rate reduction to Libor plus 4 percent along with a grace period on principal until the last quarter of 2019, down from 6.75 percent. 
Two banking sources said that the proposal was still being evaluated by Chad.
At the moment, Chad still owes about $1.3 billion from the original $1.45 billion that Glencore and a consortium of lenders loaned the country in 2014 in exchange for crude. 
SHT used those funds to buy a 25 percent stake in the major oil producing Doba Consortium from  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX).
Despite being one of the world's poorest nations, its army played a major role in reclaiming territory back from Boko Haram, an Islamist militant group that took over large swathes of Nigeria's northeast in 2014 including key border towns. 

Chad continues to help regional security initiatives, including a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali.

Comex gold futures were little changed at $1,291.23 a troy ounce by 03:00 a.m. ET (07:00 GMT).
Trade volumes were expected to remain light with an abbreviated session for Comex floor trading on Friday, after U.S. markets remained closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving.
The greenback came under broad selling pressure after the minutes of the Fed's most recent meeting showed that some policymakers remain concerned over persistently low inflation.
The report also showed that the Fed expects to raise interest rates in the ""near term"", adding to expectations for a December rate hike.
However, the central bank added that economic data will determine the timing of future rate hikes, which could mean a slower pace than expected for 2018.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.10% at 93.13, off the previous session's one-month low of 93.00.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2017 10:39AM ET</span>",OPEC chatroom dead as Qatar crisis hurts Gulf oil cooperation,"By Rania El Gamal and Dmitry Zhdannikov
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC's most powerful internal alliance, bringing together the oil producer group's Gulf members, is disintegrating fast.
As a six-month-old spat between Saudi Arabia and Qatar deepens, the organization's Gulf ministers will have to scrap their tradition of meeting behind closed doors to agree policy before OPEC holds its twice-yearly talks, OPEC sources say.
""We used to have a WhatsApp group for all ministers and delegates from the Gulf. It used to be a very busy chatroom. Now it's dead,"" said a senior source in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
Four other sources said there had been no official contact on oil policy between the Gulf Arab nations, in a grouping known as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
The GCC includes OPEC members Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar and non-OPEC Oman and Bahrain. OPEC meets on Nov. 30 in Vienna to decide whether to extend global output cuts beyond March.
OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and the UAE cut ties with Doha in June, saying Qatar backed terrorism and was cozying up to rival Iran. Qatar rejected the accusation.
""The ministers can't meet,"" another OPEC source said. ""They may relay the message through the Kuwaiti or the Omani oil ministers, but Saudi and the UAE cannot meet publicly with the Qataris.""
Kuwait and Oman have refrained from taking sides in the dispute, over which Kuwait’s Emir Sheikh Sabah has led regional mediation.
SHI'ITE OPEC ALLIANCE
To be sure, OPEC has survived worse crises and operated under even greater strain, including the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and proxy wars fought by Saudi Arabia and Iran over the past decade.
None of the OPEC sources suggested the Qatar crisis would derail a widely expected decision by OPEC to extend price-boosting output cuts until the end of 2018, as almost all producers agree on the need to maintain policy.
But dialogue within OPEC is likely to be complicated as the stand-off strikes at the heart of OPEC's efforts to form a united front to stabilize a fragile oil market. It may also weaken the group's Sunni faction at a time when predominantly Shi'ite Iran and Iraq are raising their game.
As OPEC president in 2016, Qatar was instrumental in bringing together oil producers - including non-OPEC Russia - to agree the supply-reduction deal.
""If the GCC is dead politically, then it will certainly have implications for OPEC policies. Not that it will necessarily
disrupt decision-making, but it is making it more challenging and complicated,"" the senior OPEC source said.
""Qatar is not talking to the Saudis or the UAE, so OPEC's Sunni wing is weaker. On the other hand you have the rapprochement between Iran and Iraq, a Shi'ite alliance long in the making,"" the senior source added. 
With the world's fourth- and fifth-largest oil reserves, Iraq and Iran are seen as the OPEC countries with the largest output growth potential and hence together can be the biggest challengers to the leading role Riyadh has played for decades.
Iraq has resisted calls from the United States to lessen its reliance on Tehran after Iran effectively helped Baghdad stifle a Kurdish independence referendum. Iran also plans to import significant volumes of Iraqi oil.
""The Saudis perfectly understand that challenge and are doing their utmost to lessen Iran's influence on Iraq,"" a third OPEC source said.
Relations between Riyadh and Baghdad have been improving in recent months, with the two states joining hands to coordinate their fight against Islamic State and on rebuilding Iraq.
With a thaw in relations, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih visited Iraq in October to call for increased economic

and energy cooperation, the first Saudi official to make a public speech in Baghdad in decades.

1114,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 23, 2017 08:32AM ET</span>",OPEC Is Said to Get Few Answers on Shale Before Deciding on Cuts,"(Bloomberg) -- OPEC will have to decide whether to extend global oil cuts without knowing whether they’re triggering a new flood of rival supply from U.S. shale producers. 
Analysts gave differing outlooks for U.S. shale output in a briefing to officials from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, stoking concern ahead of OPEC’s planned meeting on Nov. 30, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The analysts included Andy Hall, the veteran crude trader who closed his hedge fund this year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the briefing was private.
The duration of any extension in output limits will depend partly on estimates of future supplies of U.S. shale and other competing crudes. OPEC and allied producers including Russia are to gather next week in Vienna to assess oil markets and decide whether to extend their historic cuts beyond March. Several OPEC ministers, including Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih, have expressed support for longer cuts, which took effect in January.
Some OPEC officials are uneasy that no one seems to have a clear view of just how much shale oil will be hitting the market, the people said. 
Forecasts of 2018 growth in shale output range from 500,000 barrels a day to as much as 1.7 million barrels a day, complicating any forecasts, Hall said at the briefing, according to the people with knowledge of his comments. Hall, once known in the oil industry as “God” for his lucrative trades, said the U.S. Energy Information Administration is underestimating this year’s growth in shale oil by about 300,000 barrels a day, according to the people.
Wide Range
Other participants in the briefing included Per Magnus Nysveen, head of analysis at Rystad Energy AS; Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd.; and analysts from  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), according to the people with knowledge of the discussions on Wednesday in the Austrian capital.
Rystad’s Nysveen said shale output will gain on average by about 1.2 million barrels a day each year through 2020, due largely to producers’ more efficient use of capital, according to the people. Rapid expansion in shale output will remain a U.S. phenomenon, as other regions of the world lack such promising prospects, said Marianne Kah, the former chief economist for ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), according to the people.
Cuts by OPEC and other suppliers to clear a glut have helped lift oil from lows of less than $30 a barrel last year. With West Texas Intermediate crude trading at more than $55 a barrel, producers in the U.S. are drilling more wells to boost production.
The U.S. is set to pump about 9.2 million barrels a day on average this year, before raising output to a record 9.9 million in 2018, the EIA said in the short-term energy outlook it issued this month. U.S. crude production climbed to a record 9.66 million last week, the EIA said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil slipped on Thursday on concerns that rising U.S. output would hamper OPEC's attempts to tighten supplies, outweighing worries about the shutdown of a major U.S. pipeline.
Brent crude (LCOc1) traded at $62.92 per barrel at 1216 GMT, or 40 cents below its last close.
U.S. light crude (CLc1) was down 16 cents on the day at $57.86, easing back from a two-year high of $58.15 hit on Wednesday following news that TransCanada Corp's (TO:TRP) Keystone pipeline was shut due to an oil spill.
The pipeline carries 590,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Canada to the United States. It is expected to stay shut for several weeks.
The boost to prices was short-lived as rising output in the United States has renewed concerns about global oversupply.
U.S. output  has risen by 15 percent since mid-2016 to a record 9.66 million bpd, helping turn the United States from the world's biggest importer to a major exporter.
""The U.S. will, without question of doubt, be the biggest oil producer in the world in the next five years. They are producing... at half the cost than they were just two years ago,"" said Matt Stanley, fuel broker at Freight Investor Services in Dubai.
Climbing U.S. output threatens efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and some other non-OPEC producers to reduce global supplies by limiting their production. 
""Whatever OPEC will be discussing and ... agreeing upon can be made redundant by the actions of U.S. suppliers, which are likely to hike up production in a similar order,"" said Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
He said another rise of 800,000 to 1 million bpd in U.S. output in 2018 would mean ""attempts by OPEC to tighten the market may not be successful.""
OPEC meets on Nov. 30 to discuss policy, with Saudi Arabia lobbying for extending cuts that are due to expire in March.
Nevertheless, prices continue to find some support from a drawdown in commercial fuel inventories in the United States.
U.S. stocks  fell 1.9 million barrels in the week to Nov. 17, to 457.14 million barrels. Stocks have dropped 15 percent from record highs in March to below 2016 levels.
""Lower supplies into the U.S. from the north and robust exports from the south are likely to support a further reduction in U.S. inventories,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.

1117,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2017 07:30AM ET</span>",How 'princess' of Angola lost her oil crown,"By Stephen Eisenhammer, Libby George and Dmitry Zhdannikov
LUANDA/LONDON (Reuters) - On Oct. 6, with the dust still settling on Angola's first change of power in 38 years, new President João Lourenço sat down with international oil majors at the presidential palace in Luanda.
The top executives in Angola of  Chevron  (N:CVX),  Total  (PA:TOTF),  BP  (L:BP), Eni (MI:ENI) and Exxon (N:XOM) said the oil sector was being devastated by delays in project approvals at Sonangol and a backlog of payments owed by the state oil company, according to four oil industry sources with knowledge of the meeting.
They warned Lourenço that Angola's production would decline from 2019 unless swift action was taken to tackle problems at the firm, which was headed by Isabel dos Santos, daughter of his presidential predecessor, the sources said. They declined to be named because the discussions were confidential.
Six weeks later the president fired dos Santos, Africa's richest woman who is nicknamed the ""princess"" in Angola.
The oil majors all declined to comment on the meeting. Lourenço's office and Sonangol did not respond to requests for comment.
It was a highly unusual gathering; foreign oil firms operate nearly all of Angola's production and hold huge sway, but meeting the president as a united group was almost unheard of. 
The nature of the discussions has not been previously reported. The talks, and subsequent events leading up to dos Santos' dismissal, shed light on the reasons behind her ouster - a decision never officially explained. 
They offer new insight into the current state of the most important company in Angola, which relies on oil for a third of its economic output and over 95 percent of exports, and the big challenges facing the new management of the debt-laden firm.
The dismissal also points to the waning power of the dos Santos family, which has dominated Angolan politics and business for decades. Isabel dos Santos' father José Eduardo had ruled the country since 1979, amassing wealth for his relatives who own companies in almost every part of the economy. 
'NEAR PARALYSIS' 
Billionaire dos Santos, who had been Sonangol chair since June 2016, has said she was in the process of restructuring to root out waste and corruption at a company that was struggling even before oil prices plunged in mid-2014.
Her representatives declined to comment for this story, and instead pointed Reuters to two statements, issued in the days after her exit, when she outlined her achievements including reducing debt to $7 billion from $13 billion, raising annual revenue to $15.6 billion from $14.8 billion and cutting costs. 
In her departing speech to staff, she said the company had been ""nearly bankrupt"" when she took over, devastated by the oil-price collapse. ""Memories are short,"" she added.
However, according to interviews with 10 sources, including the four oil industry sources as well as officials from Sonangol and the government, Lourenço was frustrated with the slow pace of change at the company.
On Oct. 13, a week after meeting the oil majors and 17 days after taking office, the president ordered government ministers, Sonangol and international oil companies to form a 30-day working group to review the state of the industry.
The group's meetings, many of them led by new Secretary of State for Oil Carlos Saturnino, were tense, the sources said. Saturnino, an oil industry veteran, had been fired by dos Santos from his role as head of production and exploration at Sonangol last year when she accused him of gross mismanagement.
Even though dos Santos had launched a turnaround plan, huge hold-ups in the approval of projects were strangling the oil sector, according to the sources. Her board had implemented a system for checking projects submitted by foreign oil companies which in practice exacerbated the problem, they said.
She had also created a gulf between her board and the rest of the company by surrounding herself with foreign consultants, said the people, who declined to be named due to the confidential nature of the industry review and related discussions.
The working group concluded there was ""a near paralysis"" at Sonangol, according to a government source. 
CHINA DEBTS
As the group assessed the state of the industry, Lourenço met with Sonangol's biggest lenders - including the Bank of China, Standard Bank and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) - to understand Sonangol's financial situation and secure lower lending rates, according to a source familiar with the talks.
""Lourenço realised Sonangol needs money fast,"" said the source, adding that the company had been seeking to restructure some payments. 
Standard Bank declined to comment, citing client confidentiality, while Standard Chartered and Bank of China did not respond to requests for comment.
Sonangol's direct debt to Chinese banks and lending consortia including Chinese banks stood at $3.8 billion at the end of 2016, according to the company's annual report. 
Oil industry sources told Reuters this debt now stood at about $3 billion, plus another $3 billion to majors, contractors and traders. Of that, nearly $1 billion is owed to trading firms Trafigura and Vitol under loans guaranteed by oil or product exports, according to a source close to Sonangol. 
The government itself also last year took out a further $6.9 billion loan from the China Development Bank that it lent to Sonangol, $3.8 billion of which the firm used to refinance debt, according to an International Monetary Fund report.
Supporters of dos Santos, who are familiar with her work at Sonangol, said the debts dated back to before her tenure. They said the company was now in better financial state. The slow pace of restructuring, they say, was due to the scale of the job and restraints imposed by the state on selling assets.
Her dismissal, according to them, was purely political and part of a campaign by the president against her family. 
'GOLDEN GOOSE'
With consensus in government building fast against dos Santos, she responded with a charm offensive. 
In London, she met CEOs of major oil companies at an industry conference. On Oct. 18, she did a rare live interview at the Reuters office in the city's Canary Wharf financial district.
In the Reuters interview, she described her relationship with the new president as one of ""full alignment"". But she gave a hint that her days at Sonangol may be numbered, when asked if she would stay to see through the transformation of the firm.
""Once the foundations have been laid and are right, it doesn't matter who steps in as long as the plan is good,"" said dos Santos, who has stakes in businesses from telecoms to diamonds.
The charm offensive was too little, too late. 
On Nov. 15, dos Santos and most of her board were sacked. She was replaced by the man that had become her nemesis: Saturnino.
Foundations notwithstanding, the new management faces the tasks of getting projects moving again, repaying billions of dollars owed to oil majors, contractors and traders, and servicing billions more dollars of debt owed to Chinese banks. 
An executive at Sonangol said a massive round of lay-offs had been delayed until after the election and the task would also now most likely fall to the new team.
Lourenço, however, appeared confident of Sonangol's potential when he attended the board's inauguration on Oct. 16, describing the company as a ""golden goose"".

""Take good care of her,"" he said.

The yellow metal rose 0.8% on Wednesday as the U.S. dollar fell to a four-week low after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s November meeting hinted that the central bank may not be as aggressive in raising interest rates next year as expected due to concern over the sluggish inflation outlook.
That raises the question of whether the Fed will stick to three planned rate increases in 2018.
The U.S. central bank is scheduled to hold its final policy meeting of the year on Dec. 12-13, with interest rate futures pricing in a 100% chance of a rate hike at that meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

The fund started buying in April with a mandate to allocate as much as 5 percent to cryptocurrencies, according to its manager, Ned Naylor-Leyland. The idea is to take profits from bitcoin as it advances to reinvest in gold and silver assets, he said in an interview on Nov. 16.
“Bitcoin was explicitly designed to be digital gold,” said Naylor-Leyland. “So if you’re going to have a small proportion of a fund in bitcoin, it should be in a gold fund, because that’s exactly the point. It’s about bringing the ownership of disciplined money into the modern world. Bitcoin is paving the way for the reintroduction of gold as global money.”
Bitcoin’s up more than eight times this year to top $8,000 as entrepreneurs in the field say its value lies in proof of concept for a new kind of payment system not reliant on third parties like governments, big banks or credit-card companies. By contrast, gold’s held in a tight range since February, with a short break upward in September as U.S. and North Korea tensions spiraled.

But  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). last month said gold wins out over cryptocurrencies when assessed on most of the key characteristics of money.
Bitcoin and blockchain resolve gold’s problems of divisibility, ownership and speed of transmission, said Naylor-Leyland, who’s investing through a Swedish-listed exchange-traded fund. “We’re going to revert to sound money,” he said. “If you imagine sound money and blockchain together, there’s quite an exciting potential outcome.” His fund has about 80 percent in gold and silver equities and most of the rest in physical metal.
Bitcoin traded at about $8,240 as of 10:55 a.m. in Singapore on Thursday, some $130 short of its record on Tuesday. Spot gold was at $1,290 an ounce.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 0.18% to $1,289.91 a troy ounce.
Federal Reserve officials expressed largely optimistic views of economic growth at their most recent meeting but also started to worry that market prices are getting out of hand and posing a danger to the economy.
Minutes from the November Federal Open Market Committee meeting indicated solid views on growth – the labor market, consumer spending and manufacturing all were showing solid gains. While there were disagreements on the pace of inflation, sentiment otherwise was largely positive.
“In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in September indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions,” the minutes stated.
However, when it came to evaluating market conditions, the talk took a more cautious tone.
“In light of elevated asset valuations and low financial market volatility, several participants expressed concerns about a potential buildup of financial imbalances,” the minutes stated. “They worried that a sharp reversal in asset prices could have damaging effects on the economy.”
Overnight, gold prices rose on Wednesday after a slump in Treasury yields pressured the dollar.
Rising fears that the treasury curve is edging closer to inversion – the yields on bonds with a shorter duration are higher than the yields on bonds that have a longer duration – sparked concerns over the long-term growth of the economy, raising demand for safe-haven gold.
The ongoing yield curve flattening comes as data showed durable goods orders for October fell short of expectations, denting expectations somewhat that the U.S. economy is on track for a bullish final quarter of the year.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 0.5% last month after an upwardly revised 2.1% increase in September.
Gold is sensitive to moves lower in the U.S. dollar – A weaker dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency, which increases demand for the precious metal.

1123,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 22, 2017 04:00PM ET</span>",Oil Jumps in New York as U.S. Supply Drop Adds to OPEC Optimism,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil settled at a two-year high as a drop in U.S. crude stockpiles added optimism to a rally underpinned by hopes for an OPEC deal extension.
Futures in New York surged 2.1 percent to close above $58 a barrel for the first time since mid-2015. Crude inventories fell by 1.86 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Prices briefly dipped after the report as the draw came in smaller than the 6.36 million decline posted by the American Petroleum Institute. Meanwhile, an outage on TransCanada Corp.’s Keystone pipeline has led inventories to contract in the Cushing, Oklahoma distribution hub.
“There is a fundamental under-supply right now in the global oil market, which is by definition bullish,” Pavel Molchanov, an energy research analyst at Raymond James in Houston, said by telephone. There’s a “growing recognition in the market-place that global inventories are coming down and by a substantial amount.” 
The U.S. benchmark has jumped more than 6 percent this month amid signals that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies may agree to prolong supply curbs beyond March when producers meet in Vienna next week.
OPEC will extend its deal through the end of 2018 when the group meets on Nov. 30, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts and traders. The cartel is said to have invited another 20 non-members to its meeting in an effort to rebalance world oil markets, according to a person familiar with the matter.
“There is an expectation that they will extend,” Molchanov, said. “If they confirm that the cuts will be extended for a considerable length of time, let’s say nine more months, and everybody will continue to be covered who has been covered before, that may spur some additional uplift in oil.”
West Texas Intermediate for January delivery advanced $1.19 to settle at $58.02 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level since June 30. Total volume traded was about 52 percent above the 100-day average.
Keystone Outage
The front-month contract for WTI traded at a premium to all the other longer-dated futures during the session, before closing at parity with the second-month one. This market structure, known as backwardation, typically indicates strong demand and tight supplies. The last time the WTI futures curve consistently displayed this pattern was in 2014.
TransCanada plans to deliver about 15 percent of crude it hasn’t yet injected on its Keystone pipeline in November to at least one customer, according to a person familiar with the matter. The line shut last week after a leak in South Dakota. The closure has led to a tightening of crude in the U.S.
“You’re going to have a bit of a distortion with Keystone being down,” Craig Bethune, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management, says. Yet the backwardation “indicates the market’s in relatively good health, where near-term demand is fairly strong”
Brent for January settlement climbed 75 cents to end the session at $63.32 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $5.30 to WTI, the smallest since early October.
Nationwide crude stockpiles declined for the first time in three weeks to about 457.1 million barrels, according to the EIA. Crude stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI and the biggest oil-storage hub, slid by 1.83 million barrels, the biggest draw since July. Yet, U.S. output surged for a fifth week to 9.66 million barrels a day.

NEW YORK/CALGARY (Reuters) - The clean-up of an oil spill from TransCanada Corp's Keystone pipeline may last several weeks, South Dakota's environmental regulator said on Wednesday, but it is still unclear when the key artery will restart.
Last week, the Keystone system linking Alberta's oil sands with U.S. refineries spilled 5,000 barrels in rural northeastern South Dakota, four days before neighboring Nebraska voted to remove a big regulatory obstacle for the company's Keystone XL project.
""We expect it to take several weeks. Our focus is making sure they do that clean-up in accordance with our regulations,"" said Brian Walsh, environmental scientist manager for the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
TransCanda has so far recovered 571 barrels of oil, a spokesman said. ""Repair plans will be confirmed once we are able to safely expose the impacted section of pipe,"" he said, adding that the company is working with the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) on a return to service date for the 590,000 barrel per day pipeline.
Refiner Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), which sources some of its crude from the line, told staff that the pipeline could be shut for as long as four weeks after preliminary indications, according to Energy News Today.
U.S. crude prices remained near a two-year high at $58 after sources said the Keystone pipeline will cut deliveries by 85 percent or more through the end of November. That would effectively reduce shipments by around 7 million barrels of crude, traders say. 
The U.S. imports more than 3 million barrels of oil a day from Canada, more than any other country.

U.S. pipeline regulatory officials said on Wednesday they will remain at the site until the pipeline is restarted and a PHMSA spokesman said its personnel will monitor the excavation and packaging of the damaged pipe section for testing.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $57.55 a barrel, up 72 cents, or about 1.2%, by 10:35AM ET (1535GMT). Prices were at around $57.70 prior to the release of the inventory data. It touched its highest level since July 2015 at $58.05 earlier in the session.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., rose 24 cents, or around 0.4%, to $62.83 a barrel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 1.9 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 17. That compared with analysts' expectations for a decline of 1.5 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply-drop of 6.4 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 1.8 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 457.1 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be at the upper half of the average range for this time of year.
U.S. crude oil imports averaged 7.9 million barrels per day last week, down by 25,000 barrels per day from the previous week.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories remained largely unchanged, compared to expectations for a gain of 0.8 million barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a gain of 0.3 million barrels.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 22, 2017 08:45AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Iraq looks to Kuwait gas pipeline to pay off reparations,"By Rania El Gamal, Osamu Tsukimori and Dmitry Zhdannikov
DUBAI/TOKYO/LONDON (Reuters) - Iraq has hired Japan's Toyo Engineering (T:6330) to help build a gas pipeline to Kuwait and a related petrochemical plant as Baghdad looks to reduce flaring and finish paying reparations owed for its 1990 invasion of its neighbor.
The project, details of which have not been reported before, would allow Kuwait to diversify its gas imports in the wake a political crisis between Gulf states and major supplier Qatar.
It would also deal a blow to Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), which aimed to be the dominant gas player in Iraq before relations with Baghdad soured following Shell's exit from large oil projects.
""Iraq needs to urgently reduce gas flaring as it trails behind all targets it has promised the World Bank,"" said a senior industry source working on the project but not allowed to discuss it publicly.
""The Kuwaiti gas project is a quick fix and an easy way to monetize gas resources.""
The World Bank, which has repeatedly made reducing gas flaring a condition of lending to Baghdad, did not respond to a request for immediate comment.
Toyo is proposing to construct a gas pipeline and start deliveries after 2019, industry sources said.
Toyo's chief financial officer, Kensuke Waki, told Reuters that talks about a pipeline and a petrochemical plant were ongoing but a final investment decision had not yet been made.
Kuwait is very keen on the project and has offered a sovereign guarantee for up to 80 percent of the costs, industry sources said. No total cost has been announced.
Kuwait's oil ministry did not respond to a request for immediate comment. Oil minister Issam Al-Marzouq said last month that talks between Kuwait and Iraq were focused on a proposal to use gas to help pay Baghdad's final $4.6 billion in war compensation payments.
Iraqi oil ministry spokesman Asim Jihad said talks were focusing on price and confirmed that supplies could be used to help pay off reparations.
DIFFERENCES OVER PRICE, PLANT
Industry sources told Reuters the talks have faltered over price, however.
They said Kuwait is pushing for a price of less than $3 per mbtu (million British thermal unit), in line with U.S. Henry Hub prices. But that is less than half what Iraq pays in the north when importing gas from neighboring Iran.
""The price of gas remains the key sticking point for now,"" one of the sources said.
He also said both Iraq and Kuwait were pushing to have the petrochemical plant built on their territory to further capitalize on gas deliveries.
Discussions with Iraq are ongoing, a senior Kuwaiti oil industry source with knowledge of the project said, adding that it was not yet clear if gas would come from West Qurna 2 operated by Russia's Lukoil (MM:LKOH) or from Rumaila, operated by  BP  (L:BP).
Iraq used to supply Kuwait with gas from Rumaila. Volumes reached as much as 400 mcf per day but stopped shortly after the 1990 invasion.
More than a million claimants in Kuwait have been paid as part of Baghdad's $52.4 billion reparations bill for the invasion. But Iraq, hurt by the 2014 fall in oil prices and its war with Islamic State militants, requested a delay on the last and largest tranche, which is due this year.
CHALLENGE TO SHELL
Kuwait, although one of OPEC's leading oil producers, has struggled to meet growing domestic gas demand. The shortfall has been estimated at 500 million cubic feet per day and is being covered mainly by LNG imports, including from Qatar.
A decade ago Kuwait tried to build a pipeline from Qatar, but the move was blocked by Saudi Arabia. With relations between Riyadh and Doha worsening this year, Kuwait is looking to diversify its gas imports.
Last year, Kuwait said it would be ready to buy up to 200 mcf/day of gas from Baghdad. 
Iraqi oil ministry spokesman Jihad said volumes could start at 50 mcf/d rising gradually to 200 mcf/d.
Iraq's gas reserves of 3.7 trillion cubic meters rank as 12th largest in the world but represent only a tenth of those of Iran, the world's largest. 
It extracts large quantities of gas together with oil, however, and that gas is currently being flared.
Iraq’s gas development plans have long focused on the Basra gas company, a $17 billion, 25-year project in which Iraq has 51 percent, Shell owns 44 percent and Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp (T:8058) 5 percent.
The project was designed to aggregate gas from fields in the south including West Qurna 1 operated by  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), Zubair operated by Italy's  ENI  (MI:ENI) and BP's Rumaila.
""Shell's main aim was always to develop an LNG terminal and ultimately a petchem complex in Iraq,"" said a Shell insider who worked on the gas project.
With Iraq refusing to agree on a gas price with Shell, the project has hit a major impasse, industry sources said. Talks have also been complicated by Shell pulling out of the Majnoon oil fields earlier this year.
""Iraq is furious at Shell and prospects don't look that great for the Basra gas company,"" one Iraqi industry source said.

Asked about the negotiations, both Shell and the Iraqi oil ministry said discussions were ongoing and both sides remained committed to the project.

Meanwhile, market participants were eyeing the minutes of the Fed's most recent policy meeting, due later Wednesday, as the report could offer clues on the pace of potential interest rate hikes.
In a speech late Tuesday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank is ""reasonably close"" to its goals and should keep gradually raising interest rates to avoid the risk of letting inflation slip below target for too long and of pushing unemployment down too far.

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Top crude exporter Saudi Arabia is lobbying oil ministers to agree next week on a nine-month extension to OPEC-led supply cuts, sources familiar with the matter said, as Riyadh seeks to ensure a price-sapping glut is eradicated.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, non-member Russia and nine other producers are cutting oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day until March 2018, and will discuss extending the deal at a Nov. 30 meeting in Vienna.
Oil (LCOc1) prices have risen to almost $65 a barrel, the highest since 2015, supported by lower inventories. However, OPEC is wary prices could fall again since excess supply persists, while a flare-up in Middle Eastern political tensions has also played a part in the rally.
""The Saudis are lobbying to have a decision in November for nine months,"" said a senior oil industry source with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified.
Indications of support for a nine-month extension have come from the very top in Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader, and Russia, the largest non-OPEC producer involved in the agreement.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman signaled he was supportive of extending the agreement further into 2018, following remarks by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Oct. 4 that the deal could be stretched to the end of next year. [nL8N1N13YC]
""The Saudi and Russian leaders have indicated it's on the cards,"" an OPEC source said, referring to the chances of a nine-month extension. ""Why would I disagree with them?""
OTHER OPTIONS
To be sure, the OPEC-led group is also weighing other options.
Reuters reported last month, citing OPEC sources, that the producers were leaning towards extending for nine months but could postpone a decision until early next year, given the recent rise in prices.
Despite Putin's comments on a nine-month extension, Russia has been reluctant to give a position publicly. Oil producers and the energy ministry have discussed a six-month prolongation, TASS news agency reported. [nL8N1NR5QU]
Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday that Russia would determine its position later in November.
While there is a chance that a shorter timeframe of six or even three months could be agreed, and that producers may defer a decision, OPEC sources consider this less likely.
""There is a 90 percent chance it will be announced in November,"" a second OPEC source said. ""Yes, for nine months."" 
Two other OPEC sources also said nine months was the most likely period. 
The supply pact is aimed at reducing oil stocks in industrialized countries to their five-year average, and the latest figures suggest OPEC is more than halfway there.
A fifth OPEC source said a nine-month extension was likely, since part of the recent price rally was driven by factors such as the anti-corruption crackdown in Saudi Arabia and Lebanese tensions, rather than a further tightening of supply. 

""If the price hike stemming from recent geopolitical developments in the Middle East eases, the likelihood of an extension of the existing agreement for a longer period will increase,"" the source said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil extended gains on Wednesday, with U.S. crude hitting $58 a barrel for the first time since July 2015 as a major pipeline cut Canadian crude flows to the United States, where inventories are expected to have fallen further.
The Keystone pipeline will cut deliveries by 85 percent or more through the end of November, sources said. A report from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed a big drop in U.S. crude stocks, ahead of Wednesday's official inventory data.
""There is a shortage of crude oil into the United States. Hence the rally in the prices,"" PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said.
U.S. crude rose to $58.05 a barrel, the highest since July 2015, before easing to $57.78, up 95 cents, by 1216 GMT. Brent crude, the global benchmark, was up 57 cents at $63.14.
Keystone, which carries 590,000 barrels per day of crude from Alberta's oil sands to markets in the United States, was shut last week after a 5,000-barrel spill in South Dakota. 
This adds to a picture of tighter U.S. supplies. The API said on Tuesday that crude stocks dropped by 6.4 million barrels in the week to Nov. 17, far above analysts' expectations.
The latest official U.S. production and inventory data is due on Wednesday at 1530 GMT. 
""If we see the U.S. Energy Information Administration ... confirming the big draw in crude oil stocks reported by the API last night, I think we will see the market going higher,"" Varga said.
Oil has also been supported by an effort led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to end a global supply overhang by restraining output.
The deal to curb production expires in March, but is widely expected to be extended at a Nov. 30 meeting.
""There is growing consensus that OPEC will extend their production cut deal at the end of the month. This confidence along with the current geopolitical environment has kept ICE Brent trading firmly above $60 per barrel,"" Dutch bank ING said.

""However, an outcome at the OPEC meeting which falls short of market expectations, will likely lead to a selloff, and given the large speculative long in Brent, this could be fairly severe,"" it added.

The report comes out one day ahead of its normal release time due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S. on Thursday.
U.S. natural gas futures declined 2.4 cents, or around 0.8%, to $2.994 per million British thermal units by 7:20AM ET (1220GMT). It reached its worst level since Nov. 3 at $2.993 earlier in the session.
Prices lost 3.0 cents, or about 1%, on Tuesday, as traders reacted to forecasts calling for less heating demand through the end of this month.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in late October and early November, when mild weather weakens demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release its official weekly natural gas storage report for the week ended Nov. 17 at 12:00PM ET (1700GMT), amid expectations for a withdrawal of 51 billion cubic feet (bcf).
That compares with a drop of 18 bcf in the preceding week, a fall of 2 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average decline of 26 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.772 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the EIA. That figure is 271 bcf, or around 6.7%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 101 bcf, or roughly 2.6%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report for the week ended Nov. 17 at 10:30AM ET (1530GMT).
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories fell by 6.4 million barrels last week. That compared with analysts' expectations for a decline of around 2.1 million barrels.
The API report also showed a gain of 869,000 barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks fell by 1.7 million barrels.
There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures jumped $1.08, or about 1.9%, to $57.88 a barrel by 3:20AM ET (0820GMT). It touched its highest level since July 2015 at $57.98 earlier in the session. Trading was thinning out ahead of Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., according to market participants.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., rose 64 cents, or around 1.1%, to $63.21 a barrel.
Oil prices ended higher on Tuesday amid expectations that oil producing countries will agree to extend an output cut at their meeting at the end of this month.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), together with a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia, has been restraining output since the start of this year in a bid to end a global supply overhang and prop up prices.

Comex gold futures were up about $2.00, or around 0.2%, to $1,283.53 a troy ounce by 3:00AM ET (0800GMT). Trading was thinning out ahead of Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., according to market participants.

The Fed will release minutes of its most recent policy meeting at 2:00PM ET (1900GMT). The U.S. central bank left interest rates unchanged following its meeting on Nov. 1 and signaled it still intended to raise rates in December, as officials noted “solid” economic growth and a tightening labor market.
Outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen said Tuesday that the Fed is ""reasonably close"" to its goals and should keep gradually raising interest rates to avoid the dual pitfalls of letting inflation drift below target for too long, and of driving unemployment down too far.
The Fed is scheduled to hold its final policy meeting of the year on Dec. 12-13, with interest rate futures pricing in a 100% chance of a rate hike at that meeting, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. For 2018, the U.S. central bank is currently forecasting three interest rate hikes, but the markets expect two at most.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.

U.S. markets will be closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and Friday will be a half-session day.
Meanwhile, on the political front, tax reform will likely stay at the forefront, as markets look for any new developments on the Trump Administration's tax bill. Last week, the House voted to pass a tax bill that would lower corporate taxes and cut individual taxes for most households in 2018, in a step towards the biggest U.S. tax code overhaul since the 1980s.
But the legislation may face a tougher fight in the Senate amid resistance within Republican ranks. Senate lawmakers are expected to vote on their version of the bill after this week’s Thanksgiving holiday.
More than two Republican defections would likely kill the bill. Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson has already publicly stated he opposes the bill in its current form.

1141,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 21, 2017 09:30PM ET</span>","One Country, Two Systems Roils China's Mills as Curbs Bite","(Bloomberg) -- One country, two systems has come to the world’s largest steel industry. As China’s great environmental cleanup takes effect during the winter months, the stringent curbs being implemented across the north are hurting mills’ output, while giving free rein to producers in the south.
“Southern steel mills unaffected by the output restrictions are generally running at full speed,” brokerage Nanhua Futures Co. said in a note. “They’re seeing better demand for their products as order volumes spike. Inventories are rapidly shrinking.”
Mills, miners and investors have been tracking China’s bid to rein in pollution this winter by imposing restrictions on steel supply, in addition to curbs on other industrial activity such as construction. The policy makers’ efforts are targeted at mills in the colder north, zeroing in on the so-called 2+26 cities, which refers to Beijing and Tianjin plus other centers. As well as skewing production, the drive is impacting raw materials, especially iron ore.
“You could say it is one country, two systems,” said Hong Hao, chief China strategist at Bocom International Holdings Co. in Hong Kong, using the phrase applied to China after the former British colony of Hong Kong was returned to mainland rule in 1997, yet was allowed to retain its autonomy.
Largest Buyers
There’s been stronger demand for iron ore “from the southern Chinese steel mills, offset by weaker demand from the northern mills due to environmental restrictions,” RBC Capital Markets said in a Nov. 15 report. The country’s mills are the largest buyers of seaborne ore, taking cargoes from miners including Brazil’s Vale SA and Australia’s BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd. and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group.
The green push in China comes toward the end of a year when steel prices have rallied, with gains sustained by better-than-expected demand as well as efforts by the government to tackle overcapacity. Spot reinforcement bar rose to 4,391 yuan ($662) a ton on Tuesday, near the high of 4,396 yuan on Sept. 4, which was the most since 2011. That’s sent profits soaring at Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. and Hesteel Co., the listed units of the country’s top mills.
Wood Mackenzie Ltd. charted the policy’s uneven impact. The curbs will probably cut so-called hot-metal supplies by about 34 million tons this winter, with a reduction of 14.2 million tons this quarter and 20.2 million tons in the first three months of 2018. Still, “the loss will be partly offset by production hikes from capacity outside the 2+26 region,” it said in a note this month. The net decline this quarter may be just 4 million tons, it said.
Nationwide production has started to slow, official figures show. In August, China mills churned out a record 74.6 million tons. The next month it dropped to 71.8 million, and the total was little changed in October at 72.4 million.
‘Already Declining’
“Output in the north is already declining, demand for iron ore will be affected,” said Bocom’s Hong, who estimated steel production may drop by 30 million to 50 million tons. “The south tends not to have restrictions normally due to weather conditions and less concentration of production.”
In a sign of that trend, inventories of iron ore at ports in northern China climbed to a record 100.1 million tons this month, according to Shanghai Steelhome E-Commerce Co. At the same time, stockpiles in the south are near a one-year low after bottoming at 8.6 million tons in October.
The industry and investors are also tracking nationwide holdings of steel, including rebar, a basic product used in construction. These have shrunk for five of the past six weeks to 3.61 million tons, the lowest level since November 2016, according to Steelhome figures. Steel inventories won’t rise meaningfully until the end of winter cuts in March, buoying prices in the meantime,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). said in a report received Wednesday.
“This year, especially in the northern part, there are strict controls,” said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., noting steel demand and prices have been strong, while supply’s limited. “Producers who don’t face restrictions, they’ll definitely want to produce more.”

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2017 11:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Venezuela leans on foreign partners for oil to feed its refineries - sources,"By Alexandra Ulmer and Marianna Parraga
CARACAS/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela's state-run PDVSA is siphoning oil from its cash-paying joint ventures with foreign firms to feed its domestic refineries, two sources close to the matter told Reuters, at a time when late debt payments have triggered defaults. 
PDVSA asked its Petropiar joint venture with  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) to turn over as much as 45 percent of the oil it planned to export in November with no immediate reimbursement, one of the sources said this month.
PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. Chevron declined to comment. 
The joint ventures export upgraded crude to buyers around the globe and the diversion cuts into the main source of the government's revenue. One likely reason for the shift: to deal with intermittent fuel shortages because of the poor condition of its refineries, which in some cases are working at a third of capacity. 
The lack of these exports add to the nation's cash crunch as President Nicolas Maduro tries to restructure some $60 billion in debt to bondholders. Some of Venezuela's oil exports are under oil-for-loan agreements with Russia and China. Investors say the country has defaulted on bonds issued by PDVSA and the government and two ratings agencies declared a selective default.
In addition to the Petropiar joint venture with Chevron, PDVSA has this year taken oil for its domestic refineries from its Petrocedeno project with  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) and  Statoil  (OL:STL). 
PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. Its joint venture partners declined to comment.
""PDVSA started requesting some cargoes from Petrocedeno for the Paraguana Refining Center (CRP). Now it is asking Petropiar to relinquish almost half of its crude production,"" the source said.
From August through October, PDVSA took at least 1 million barrels per month of heavy crude from Petropiar after acquiring Zuata Sweet crude from Petrocedeno earlier this year. It is seeking 2 million barrels, or 45 percent of Petropiar's total production for November, the source added.
The diversions are adding new strains to its ventures' cash flow. Foreign partners in several joint ventures also have been required since last year to pay for imported naphtha used to dilute the Orinoco Belt's oil when upgraders are not operating or working at reduced capacity, further hurting their earnings.
The joint ventures are expected to be compensated for the diverted oil through dividends paid to the partners. However, some foreign oil firms operating in Venezuela have been unable to repatriate such payments to their parent companies.
PDVSA's finances are so weak it is struggling to find the funds to drill wells, maintain oilfields and keep pipelines and ports working. Venezuela's overall crude output declined in October to its lowest since 1989, according to numbers reported by the country to OPEC. 
Sanctions imposed by the United States on Venezuela and its state-run company PDVSA have also contributed to weaker exports this year.
Maduro's government has increasingly turned to ally Russia for the cash and credit it needs to survive as China has not extended any more credit to Venezuela amid delays in oil shipments, according to a Reuters special report published in August.
Reduced exports of Petropiar's crude is mainly having an impact on customers in the United States, according to one of the sources and Thomson Reuters trade flows data. 
U.S. imports of that venture's Hamaca crude grew from 106,000 bpd in August to 134,000 bpd in October, but only one cargo representing 34,000 bpd has discharged through mid-November, the data show.
PDVSA's U.S. refining unit, Citgo Petroleum, in July started boosting its imports of Venezuelan upgraded crude from the joint ventures as a way of offsetting declining purchases from its parent company, which is struggling to cover oil-for-loan agreements to Russian and Chinese companies amid falling output.
Citgo has struggled to buy crude supplies directly from non-Venezuelan producers because of U.S. sanctions levied this year, according to trade sources. U.S. banks have been avoiding extending even short-term credit to PDVSA and its subsidiaries, which have affected Citgo's oil purchases. Citgo has said it is not facing credit issues.

But Citgo's effort to compensate for PDVSA's export problems might not last, one of the sources said, as the growing supply of the joint ventures' crude to Venezuelan refineries is undermining its ability to purchase upgraded oil.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2017 10:47AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Selling Saudi Arabia's grain mills proves a grind for investors,"By Maha El Dahan and Tom Arnold
DUBAI (Reuters) - An unwieldy sale process and onerous ownership rules are discouraging some potential investors from bidding for Saudi Arabia's state-owned grain mills, sources close to the firms say, in a potential snag for the kingdom's economic reforms.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants to modernize Saudi Arabia and reduce its dependence on oil. The kingdom is selling assets worth about $300 billion to fund the plan and potential foreign investors and bankers are watching the sales closely. 
The grain mills on sale come under the kingdom's monopoly state grain buyer the Saudi Grains Organisation (SAGO), one of the world's largest wheat and barley buyers.
Archer Daniels Midland Company (N:ADM) and  Bunge  Limited (N:BG) - two of the world's four biggest agribusiness firms - are among several international companies that have previously expressed interest in bidding for SAGO's assets. 
But one agribusiness giant which previously expressed an interest is now hesitating following the publication last week of preliminary sale guidelines which stipulate that the mills must remain majority Saudi-owned.
""If that is the deal, then the answer will clearly be a 'no',"" a source close to one of the large agribusiness firms potentially interested in bidding told Reuters.
ADM and Bunge declined comment. 
The document with the guidelines, described as indicative criteria for investors, was posted on SAGO's website.
Another Middle East-based grain trader said after reading the document: ""It can't really be a whole-hearted privatization if the Saudi partner remains in control."" 
Prospective foreign bidders were made aware from the start of the process by bank HSBC (L:HSBA), SAGO's financial adviser for the sale, that they would require Saudi involvement to bid. 
As a result, ADM partnered with Saudi Arabia's Almarai (SE:2280), while Bunge teamed up with Arasco, Reuters reported this year. 
Italian wheat supplier Casillo Group and a partnership of Turkey's TAV, a construction and airports conglomerate, and Saudi Arabia's Al Rajhi Holding Group, a local real estate business, were also interested, Reuters previously reported.
But the source close to one of the large agribusinesses said the company had understood there would be room for negotiation on the level of Saudi ownership. 
HSBC declined to comment on the sale process and whether the majority ownership rule was flexible.
An adviser to a consortium potentially interested in SAGO said the document suggested there was less room for negotiation than previously understood, even though it had been clear from the start the kingdom wanted to retain control of food security.
The document was designed to elicit market feedback as part of a consultative approach to the privatization, a source close to the sale process said.
IMPORT DEPENDENT
Large grain market players' interest in SAGO's mills comes as Saudi Arabia grows increasingly dependent on grain imports. The kingdom has become a major importer of wheat and barley since abandoning plans in 2008 to become self-sufficient - as farming in the desert was draining scarce water supplies.
SAGO imports Saudi Arabia's entire wheat supply of about 3.5 million tonnes a year. It has said that demand for wheat is expected to grow at an annual rate of 3.2 percent to reach 4.5 million tonnes by 2025, largely due to population growth. 
Despite the opportunities for growth, some of the initial enthusiasm in the SAGO sale has cooled over concerns about the majority Saudi ownership rule, as well as other aspects of the sale structure.
SAGO has previously said it would sell its milling operations by placing them in four specially formed corporate entities, while retaining other functions. The entities would each hold grain silos, feed factories and flour mills.
Two of the sources close to potential bidders said a final decision on the process was still to be made, but they believed SAGO was leaning towards a sale of the entities one by one, rather than together, and this did not sit well with investors. 
""The rules of engagement are still not clear. Will they make it all one sale or will they divide it in phases? We don't know yet,"" one of those sources said.
After HSBC asked for feedback from potential bidders on the sequential sale, at least three groups voiced opposition to the plan, according to an adviser to one potential bidder. 
The two sources close to potential bidders said the first sale would probably set a level of pricing for the other three, which could be unfair on those bidding further down the line. 
No price indications for the milling operations have been given and investors say it is hard to put a precise figure on the value of the assets as SAGO has never been run for profit.
The source close to the sale process said sequential sales would make the bidding process more competitive, benefiting the kingdom.
'PAINFULLY SLOW'
Investors were also seeking clarity on how long grain subsidies would remain in place and details on non-compete clauses, one of the sources close to a potential bidder said, adding that both needed to be clarified in the sale rules.
HSBC has not publicly disclosed a timetable for the privatization. The source close to the sale process said the schedule for the sale would be disclosed at the ""right stage"".
But potential investors said the process had been painfully slow so far. One said that even though no deadline had been set, they had expected the request for qualifications, which kick-starts the process, to have started earlier.
In a statement to Reuters, SAGO said it was continuing its efforts to be ""on track without jeopardizing the quality of preparation and readiness"" for the privatization, adding that the document with the indicative criteria for investors had been released earlier than originally planned.
SAGO did not comment on the proposed sale terms.
In addition to the big names, some regional investors have also expressed an interest in the sale.

Dubai-based Al Ghurair, and a partnership between Abu Dhabi-based  Agthia Group  (AD:AGTH) and local conglomerate Olayan Group are among others eyeing the privatization, sources told Reuters, although SAGO is said to be more interested in large global firms that have more experience and market clout.

Oil prices have been under pressure in recent sessions, amid concerns rising U.S. production would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
Market players said they were avoiding taking on large new positions ahead of an OPEC meeting at the end of the month, when the producer club is expected to decide whether to continue output cuts aimed at propping up prices.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, together with a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia, has been restraining output since the start of this year in a bid to end a global supply overhang and prop up prices.
The deal to curb output is due to expire in March 2018, but OPEC will meet on Nov. 30 to discuss the outlook for the policy.
Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30 p.m. ET (21:30 GMT) Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 2.1 million barrels.

Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.772 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 271 bcf, or around 6.7%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 101 bcf, or roughly 2.6%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Tuesday as the impact from expectations of an extended OPEC-led production cut was canceled out by rising output in the United States.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1), the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $62.20 per barrel at 0301 GMT, 8 cents above their last close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $56.50 a barrel, also up 8 cent from their last settlement.
Traders said they were avoiding taking on large new positions due to uncertainty in markets.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), together with a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia, has been restraining output since the start of this year in a bid to end a global supply overhang and buoy prices.
The deal to curb output is due to expire in March 2018, but OPEC will meet on Nov. 30 to discuss the outlook for the policy.
OPEC is expected to agree to extend cuts as storage levels remain high despite recent drawdowns, although there are doubts about the willingness of some participants to continue to restrict their production.
""If the OPEC/non-OPEC cuts continue, the stocks surplus will reduce to just some 50 million barrels above the 5-year average in 3Q 2018 (down from 140 million barrels above that average now) and prices will hit $65-70 per barrel,"" energy consultancy FGE said on Tuesday.
Outside the group of producers voluntarily withholding output, the biggest headaches for OPEC has been rising U.S. drilling activity, led by shale oil producers.
Energy consultancy Westwood Global Energy Group said U.S. output would climb even faster than implied by the rising rig count, which has jumped from 316 rigs in mid-2016 to 738 last week, as producers get more productive per well.
""Westwood Global Energy forecasts an 18 percent increase in active rigs in 2018, but more rapid demand growth in certain service areas as operators focus on efficiency and delivering more for less,"" the consultancy said.
For 2018, FGE warned potential supply disruptions during an already tighter market could trigger oil price spikes, but it added that the market could slump again towards 2019 as U.S. output continues to soar and OPEC and its allies at some point will stop withholding output.
""We see another big rush with (U.S.) production growth of some 1-1.5 million bpd in 2018 and 2019,"" FGE said. It added that OPEC also ""has some 1.5 million bpd of spare capacity (while) Russia and Kazakhstan could also add another 500,000 bpd"".

Futures slipped 0.8 percent, reversing course after a 2.6 percent gain Friday. In Germany, the breakdown of talks to form a new government coalition raised questions about the future of Europe’s biggest economy. That led the U.S. dollar to rally, reducing the appeal of commodities. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meanwhile, will be briefed this week by oil-service provider Schlumberger Ltd. as well as  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). as the cartel debates whether to extend output cuts at a summit in Vienna Nov. 30.
The political turmoil in Germany helped strengthen the dollar, which tends to depress oil prices, said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. Data released Friday showed wagers on lower Brent prices rose by the most in five months through the week ended Nov. 14 as doubts persist about whether the Saudi Arabia-led cuts will be extended.
“Politically, around the world, there are just a lot of plates spinning,"" O’Grady said in a telephone interview Monday. “There’s potentially a lot of supply out there and the only thing keeping it off the market right now is OPEC discipline.""
Traders may also be closing out some bullish bets on crude ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., when light volumes could make it harder to adjust to any bearish news, O’Grady said. “What you’re seeing is a lot of position squaring,"" he said.
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery, which expires Monday, slipped 46 cents to $56.09 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after declining 0.3 percent last week. Total volume traded was about 20 percent below the 100-day average. The more-active January contract dropped 29 cents to $56.42.

Brent for January settlement lost 50 cents to $62.22 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, after dropping 1.3 percent last week. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $5.79 to January WTI.
Saudi Arabia has had extensive consultations with Russia, Saudi energy minister Khalid Al-Falih said on Thursday. OPEC will ensure that its exit strategy from the current accord will be a gradual adjustment that prevents the return of any glut, he said. Oil inventories are unlikely to drain to average levels by the time the OPEC agreement expires at the end of March, the minister added.
The U.S. drilling-rig count was unchanged at 738 on Friday, data from Baker Hughes showed.
Oil dipped slightly last week on a weaker demand outlook while Russia cast doubts on the timing of a decision to extend supply cuts. An extension still remains likely, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd.
“It is widely believed that OPEC, together with 10 non-OPEC countries, will roll over their production for the whole of 2018,” said Tamas Varga, an analyst at PVM in London.

1161,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2017 01:15PM ET</span>","In win for Trump, Nebraska approves Keystone XL pipeline route","By Kevin O'Hanlon and Ethan Lou
LINCOLN, Nebraska/CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Nebraska regulators approved a route for TransCanada Corp's (TO:TRP) Keystone XL pipeline through the state on Monday, lifting the last big regulatory obstacle for the long-delayed project that U.S. President Donald Trump wants built.
The 3-2 vote by the Nebraska Public Service Commission helps clear the way for the pipeline linking Canada's Alberta oil sands to refineries in the United States, but is likely to be tied up for years in court challenges by opponents who say the project is an environmental risk.
""We are going to fight like hell to make sure this pipeline never gets built,"" said Jane Kleeb, the head of anti-pipeline Bold Nebraska, a political advocacy group. 
The commission's approval was not for TransCanada's preferred route, but for a more costly alternative that would add five miles of pipeline along with an additional pumping station and transmission lines.
TransCanada Chief Executive Officer Russ Girling said in a statement that the company will review the commission's decision and assess how it will affect the cost and schedule of the project. The company's stock rose 1.3 percent after the vote to C$63.35.
The proposed line has been a lightning rod of controversy since it was first advocated nearly a decade ago with environmentalists making the project a symbol of their broader fight against fossil fuels and global warming. Business groups and Trump, a Republican, said it could boost the economy.
Alberta province Premier Rachel Notley cheered the commission's decision, saying the pipeline ""will mean greater energy security for all North Americans.""
The administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, considered the project for years before rejecting it in 2015 on environmental grounds.
But Trump swiftly reversed that decision after coming into office this year, handing TransCanada a federal permit for the pipeline in March and arguing the project will lower fuel prices, boost national security, and create employment. Trump has said Keystone XL would create 28,000 jobs nationwide. But a 2014 State Department study predicted just 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs. 
Trump's decision placed the pipeline's fate into the hands of the obscure regulatory body in Nebraska, the only state that had yet to approve the pipeline’s route. Permits along Keystone XL's path have already been approved in Canada, Montana and South Dakota.
UNCERTAIN MARKET
Opposition to the line in Nebraska has been driven mainly by a group of around 90 landowners whose farms lie along the proposed route. They have said they are worried spills could pollute water critical for grazing cattle, and that tax revenue will be short-lived and jobs will be temporary.
Rancher Randy Thompson stood in the hearing room after the decision and shook his head. ""Common sense has gone out the window on this project,"" he said.
Just days ago, TransCanada's existing Keystone system spilled 5,000 barrels in South Dakota and pipeline opponents said the spill highlighted the risks posed by the proposed XL expansion.
The company said last week's spill was contained and being cleaned up.
The project could be a boon for Canada, which has struggled to bring its vast oil reserves to market. But there are questions about demand for the pipeline after a surge in drilling activity in the United States.
""Considering the growth of oil output in the U.S. ... the economics of importing the heavy crude from Canada is not fully justified,"" said Chirag Rathi, director at business consultancy Frost and Sullivan in Texas. 
TransCanada has said it has received adequate support to make the pipeline viable. But it has yet to announce results of its open season to gauge interest among shippers, which closed at the end of October.
Zachary Rogers, refining and oil markets research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said if the line is built the biggest winners will likely be Alberta's oil companies, which have been struggling for years to expand their markets.

""Assuming Keystone XL gets built, the biggest winners will likely be West Canadian producers,"" he said.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) [ADNOC.UL] has embarked on a major shake-up plan to privatize its services businesses, venture into oil trading and expand partnerships with strategic investors, its chief executive said on Monday.
The partial privatization plan marks a major shift by the state energy company that was founded in 1971. It aims to make ADNOC more competitive and commercially focused, operating in way that is more akin to other state-owned controlled peers.
The state firm plans to sell at least 10 percent of its fuel retail unit, ADNOC Distribution, in an initial public offering (IPO) this year and could float up to 30 percent in the unit in future, CEO Sultan al-Jaber told Reuters in an interview.
Other Gulf states, such as Saudi Arabia and Oman, have also embarked on selling energy assets with the slide in oil prices. Saudi Arabia's state-run oil giant Saudi Aramco plans to list about 5 percent next year.
Although ADNOC has no plans to list the holding company, it might look at selling stakes in other service companies and would explore new ways to manage its assets, al-Jaber said.
""ADNOC as the holding company will continue to be wholly owned by one shareholder that is Abu Dhabi government,"" he said.
""But anything that is currently owned by ADNOC especially companies in the service sector are actually candidates for us to explore where we can unlock and maximize value.""
He said ADNOC aimed to sell at least 10 percent of ADNOC Distribution, which runs a chain of fuel stations across the United Arab Emirates, and could sell up to 30 percent in future.
""We have not in any way considered anything more than a potential 30 percent in the future,"" he said. ""We will always continue to own a significant majority.""
Sources told Reuters in September that ADNOC could float more businesses, such as National Drilling Company, or energy infrastructure, if the distribution unit IPO was successful.
Al-Jaber did not identify any units earmarked for stake sales but said ""not necessarily all are going to go for an IPO.""
""Some will be where we attract a strategic partner or a strategic investor, where we jointly operate and manage this company for some time, and then potentially think of another means of maximizing value either through privatization or through an IPO,"" he said.
ADNOC - dubbed ""a sleeping energy giant"" - has embarked on major changes since al-Jaber's appointment as CEO last year, part of an economic reform drive led by Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
""Our objective here is for us to turn this company into an agile, resilient, forward-thinking, progressive organization... with efficiency and top high performance and profitability set in the core of our business,"" al-Jaber said.
ADNOC wants to set up its own oil trading unit, possibly together with an oil major or a big trading house.
""Non-speculative, asset-backed trading is going to be central to our overall trading and value maximization effort,"" al-Jaber said, although no decision had been taken yet on a structure.
""I don’t see us finalizing this whole exercise or deciding on the way forward before the end of 2018, early 2019,"" he said.
ADNOC said in August it would split its offshore oil concession, due to expire in March 2018, into more than one area with new terms to boost opportunities for partnerships.

Al-Jaber said he expected a decision on the new offshore concessions by early 2018. He said more than 14 foreign oil companies were interested in the concessions.

Elsewhere, Brent oil for January delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was down 80 cents or about 1.28% at $61.92 a barrel.
Oil prices remained under pressure amid concerns rising U.S. production would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 15% since the most recent low in mid-2016, casting doubts over the past few months' narrative of tightening energy markets.
Growing concerns that Russia was reluctant to support an extension of an existing OPEC-led production cut agreement also weighed on the commodity.
Under the original terms of the deal, OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine more months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Discussions are continuing in the run-up to the Nov. 30 meeting, which oil ministers from OPEC and the participating non-OPEC countries will attend.
In the week ahead, trade volumes are expected to remain light around Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday and Friday's shortened trading session.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil eased on Monday, as traders were reluctant to take on big new positions ahead of an OPEC meeting next week, when the exporter group is expected to decide whether to continue output cuts aimed at propping up prices.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $62.37 per barrel by 1002 GMT, down 35 cents on the day, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 7 cents at $56.48 a barrel.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), together with a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia, has been restraining output since the start of this year in a bid to end a global supply overhang and prop up prices.
The deal to curb output is due to expire in March 2018, and OPEC meets on Nov. 30 to discuss the outlook for the policy. The expectation is for the agreement to be extended to cover the whole of next year.
""It is widely believed that OPEC together with 10 non-OPEC countries will roll-over their production for the whole of 2018 although Russia is holding its cards close to its chest,"" PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said.
OPEC last week forecast demand for its own crude to rise by 460,000 bpd to 33.42 million bpd next year, in contrast with a forecast from the International Energy Agency for a drop of 320,000 bpd to 32.38 million bpd. 
""Such a rollover (in the deal) would be bullish if you believe OPEC’s numbers but will not reduce global or OECD stocks if the IEA estimate is closer to reality. Judging by the weekly losses more credit was given to the IEA prediction,"" Varga added.
Greg McKenna of futures brokerage AxiTrader said it was ""worth noting data showed more longs added by the speculative community"", indicating expectations of rising prices.
This is certainly the case in U.S. crude futures and options, where money managers raised their net long holdings by 28,297 lots to 409,963 contacts, equivalent to nearly 410 million barrels of oil. 
In the Brent market, fund managers added 4,793 lots in short positions - more than at any time since late June <3ICELCOMSHT> - but that still leaves the overall net managed money long position at 537,557, within a whisker of the previous week's record high of 543,069 lots.
In the United States, the number of rigs drilling for new oil production remained unchanged in the week to Nov. 17, at 738, data from oil services firm Baker Hughes showed on Friday.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries together with a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia has reduced output since January 1 under an agreement set to run until next March.
Producers are curbing their output in hopes of supporting prices and reducing inventories.
OPEC will meet at the end of the month to discuss the policy.
""The majority of members support the extension of the plan, but the final decision should be taken at the next OPEC meeting,"" Iran's Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying by the ISNA news agency.
OPEC allowed Iran to increase output slightly to help it recover market share lost while under Western sanctions. OPEC members Libya and Nigeria have also been exempt from supply curbs as their oil industries recover from years of unrest. 
""If the production cut is extended, the exemption for Iran will also be extended,"" Zanganeh was quoted as saying by SHANA, the Iranian oil ministry's news agency.

1168,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2017 04:11AM ET</span>","As Venezuela pumps below OPEC target, oil rivals begin filling gap","By Marianna Parraga and Rania El Gamal
HOUSTON/DUBAI (Reuters) - As Venezuela's dilapidated energy sector struggles to pump enough crude oil to meet the country's OPEC output target, rival producers within the exporters group have started to plug the gap, OPEC and industry sources said.
The South American country's oil output hit a 28-year low in October as state-owned oil giant PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] struggled to find the funds to drill wells, maintain oilfields and keep pipelines and ports working.
Venezuela's oil production, which has been falling by about 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) per month since last year, is on track to fall by at least 250,000 bpd in 2017 according to numbers reported to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), as U.S. sanctions and a lack of capital hobble operations. [For a graphic on Venezuelan and Iraqi oil shipments to the United States and India, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2A9EKCH]
Some OPEC members expect the fall to accelerate in 2018, reaching at least 300,000 bpd, OPEC sources said. At a recent internal OPEC meeting, Venezuelan officials were asked to give a clearer picture of the country's declining output.
""A lot of questions have been raised by Saudis and others to the Venezuelans to present a real picture on the production status and decline,"" one of the sources said. The topic could come up later this month at the group's next meeting. 
Saudi Arabia will not raise its output to compensate for this decline as OPEC's de facto leader is focused on reducing global oil stocks, one OPEC source familiar with Saudi oil policy told Reuters this month.
But heavy oil from OPEC member Iraq and non-OPEC producers Canada and Brazil are already replacing Venezuelan barrels to key customers the United States and India, according to the sources and Thomson Reuters data. 
Iraq has increased shipments of crude and condensate to India by 80,000 bpd this year as Venezuelan deliveries fell by 84,000 bpd. The second largest OPEC producer also has exported 201,000 bpd more oil to the United States this year through October as Venezuelan shipments dropped about 90,000 bpd, according to the Reuters data.
Venezuela's weaker output ""could be good for market rebalance and we could see price stay at $60 for a slightly longer time,"" one OPEC source said. ""That doesn't mean there will be no free riders,"" the source added. 
PLUGGING THE GAP 
Venezuela pumped 1.863 million bpd in October, undershooting its OPEC target by 109,000 bpd, according to an assessment that OPEC uses to monitor members' output. Venezuela said it had pumped 1.955 million bpd, still below its output target of 1.972 million bpd.
There often are discrepancies between the assessment and official figures reported by the OPEC members. 
When member countries have suffered supply disruptions in the past, other OPEC members have covered the gap, often without changing official production quotas. 
Saudi Arabia boosted its output in 2003 to offset Iraq's falling exports after the U.S. invasion, but the agreement was never formally disclosed.
OPEC discussions of Venezuela's quota is not new. Proposals to change the country's quota have been raised and batted down several times in OPEC meetings since the South American country's production started declining in 2012, a Venezuelan government source said.
Venezuela has argued in the past, when faced with questions about falling output, that it was working to reverse declines from its sizeable proven oil reserves.
But it could be difficult for Venezuelan officials to convince OPEC that an upturn is likely in the near future as the country seeks to restructure $60 billion in debt. Dependent on oil revenues, Venezuela has seen its economy contract sharply in the three years since crude prices collapsed from over $100 a barrel.
Reviews of quotas and reallocation of market share can be contentious, and the group may prefer to allow market forces to fill the supply gap left by Venezuela's decline rather than make an official share revision and reallocation to other members, one senior OPEC source said. A formal change would be opening a ""can of worms"" that OPEC would not want to do, the source added. 
OPEC's oil ministers will meet in Vienna later this month to discuss supply policy. The group is expected to extend beyond March an agreement under which its members and rival producers, including Russia, have reduced joint output by about 1.8 million bpd. 
""We want a successful meeting on Nov. 30, re-discussing quotas will not be accepted by Venezuela and talking about it at the meeting will just open the door for others to do the same,"" the senior OPEC source said.

Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures slipped 4 cents, or about 0.1%, to $56.66 a barrel.
Oil prices jumped more than 2% on Friday, but failed to offset their first weekly loss in six weeks, amid ongoing investor fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
Domestic U.S. output has rebounded by almost 15% since the most recent low in mid-2016, casting doubts over the past few months' narrative of tightening energy markets.
Meanwhile, growing concern that Russia was reluctant to support an extension of an existing OPEC-led production cut agreement further weighed.
Under the original terms of the deal, OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine more months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Discussions are continuing in the run-up to the Nov. 30 meeting, which oil ministers from OPEC and the participating non-OPEC countries will attend.

CALGARY, Alberta/LINCOLN, Neb. (Reuters) - A major oil spill on the Keystone pipeline in South Dakota helped push U.S. crude prices higher on Friday, while fueling opposition to another pipeline project by owner TransCanada Corp that faces a crunch decision in Nebraska next week.
The climb in U.S crude futures and slide in Canadian heavy crude prices, as well as TransCanada Corp shares, came the day after the 5,000 barrel spill, tied for this year's largest pipeline leak in the United States. 
No date has been set for reopening Keystone, TransCanada said, adding that a media report that had identified a restart date was incorrect.
The spill gave further ammunition to environmental groups and other U.S. opponents of another pipeline the company has proposed, the long-delayed Keystone XL.
Keystone carries 590,000 barrels per day of crude from Alberta's oil sands to markets in the United States. The state of Nebraska was set to decide on Monday whether to approve Keystone XL. 
On Thursday, Calgary, Alberta-based TransCanada said it had contained the leak in the town of Amherst, South Dakota, and was investigating the cause. It said the pipeline will be shut until it gets approval to restart from the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA).
""It’s not a tiny spill by any means,"" said Kim McIntosh, environmental scientist manager at the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources. McIntosh said it may take longer than usual for the company to determine the extent of contamination, a process that usually takes days. 
The last Keystone pipeline spill recorded was about 400 barrels of oil in Hutchinson County, South Dakota, in April 2016. ""The 2016 release took around 10 months to clean up; this will take longer,"" said McIntosh. ""I can’t predict whether it will take 20 months or 12 months.""
In Nebraska, Keystone XL opponents seized on the spill as an example of its environmental risks.
""Pipelines are basically plumbing; and plumbing leaks. It comes as no surprise,"" said Tom Genung, who lives near the proposed Keystone XL route in Holt County, Nebraska. 
The Nebraska Public Service Commission, or PSC, is scheduled to announce a decision on Monday on Keystone XL. Its decision focuses narrowly on whether the pipeline is in the public interest, and not on environmental issues, which it is not allowed to consider.
Art Tanderup's family farm in Neligh, Nebraska, lies in the path of the 830,000 bpd Keystone XL project. He said the proposed XL pipeline would be built over huge swaths of porous, sand-like soil atop the Ogallala aquifer, putting farmers and ranchers at risk of water contamination if a spill occurs.
""We would have so much crud and chemicals in the Ogallala aquifer that we could never clean up,” he said.
TransCanada shares closed down 0.9 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$62.54.
The South Dakota spill ties with January’s spill from the Seaway pipeline near Trenton, Texas, for the largest U.S. crude oil pipeline spill in 2017, U.S. data showed. 
TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said the company is assisting with the storage of crude in Hardisty, where Keystone originates, and that it regrets the impact caused to customers. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude ended up $1.41, or 2.6 percent, at $56.55 a barrel. Traders said the shut-in would add to bullish sentiment due to fewer barrels going into Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point of the WTI contract. The WTI prompt spread (CLc1-CLc2) narrowed by as much as 8 cents.
If the pipeline is shut for a week, it would affect at least 2 million barrels of crude going into Cushing, according to estimates by traders. The pipeline also brings oil into Patoka, Illinois.
Export pipeline shutdowns also pressure the price of Canadian crude because barrels get bottle-necked in Alberta.

The discount for Western Canada Select for January delivery in Hardisty, Alberta, widened to $16.00 per barrel below the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy brokers. On Thursday, January barrels settled at $15.50 per barrel below U.S. crude.

Venezuela's overall crude output declined in October to its lowest since 1989, according to numbers reported by the country to OPEC. Sanctions imposed by the United States on Venezuela and its state-run company PDVSA have contributed to weaker exports this year.
The largest recipient of Venezuelan crude in the United States last month was  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO). PDVSA's refining unit, Citgo Petroleum, which recently has struggled to import oil from its parent company because of sanctions and crude availability, was the second largest recipient.
Other importers of Venezuelan oil in the United States, including Phillips 66 (N:PSX) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX), received smaller supplies than their contracted volumes and typical purchases. Refiner PBF Energy Inc (N:PBF) did not buy any cargo directly from PDVSA.
New York-based derivatives group International Swaps and Derivatives Association on Thursday ruled that Venezuela defaulted on sovereign debt and bonds issued by PDVSA after failing to make timely payments. The association plans to reconvene on Monday to determine the amount owed buyers of credit default swap protection on the debts.

Futures rose 2.6 percent in New York on Friday after Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said OPEC should announce an extension of the cuts when it meets on Nov. 30. But that wasn’t enough to completely erase losses from the past few days, when uncertainty over a deal and surging U.S. production set the tone. Prices were 0.3 percent lower for the week, snapping the longest streak of weekly gains in a year.
""Ahead of the OPEC meeting, we’re going to see a little bit of volatility,"" Gene McGillian, a market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, said by phone. ""Going forward, the market needs to keep seeing that the fundamental picture is continuing to tighten.""
Oil’s rally to the highest in more than two years last week faltered as Russia is said to be hesitant to commit to a decision on the cuts so soon, suggesting OPEC wait until closer to the deal’s expiration at the end of March. U.S. crude output gained this week to the highest in more than three decades, according to government data. Adding to the tension, the International Energy Agency said milder-than-normal winter weather is putting a brake on demand growth. 
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery settled $1.41 higher at $56.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Brent for January settlement closed 2.2 percent higher at $62.72 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Prices are down 1.3 percent this week, the first weekly drop since the start of October. The global benchmark was at a premium of $6.01 to January WTI.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is unlikely to reduce excess oil inventories to average levels by the time the current supply deal expires, Al-Falih said Thursday. The kingdom has had extensive consultations with Russia and the minister said he feels “fully convinced” the country will be “fully on board” when a resolution is made.Oil-market news:

LONDON (Reuters) - The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund's proposal to ditch its oil and gas shares, though hugely symbolic in the battle against climate change, is unlikely to cause a rush to the exit by major investors in the sector in the short term.
The move by the $1 trillion fund, the world's largest, rattled stock markets, exposing what is seen as one of the biggest threats to companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  BP  (LON:BP) as the world shifts towards renewable energy such as wind and solar.
But in the meantime, expectations of growing global demand for oil and gas for decades to come mean reliance on these companies is likely to continue.
And although the Norwegian initiative will encourage those seeking to hasten the move to a low-carbon economy, the degree to which other investors can follow the fund's example, at least in the short term, is less clear.
The European oil and gas index fell on Friday to its lowest since late September, extending declines following the Norwegian fund's announcement. 
For some, it was seen as an opening shot in the decline of the 150-year-old sector in the battle to slow global warming and reduce carbon emissions, reminiscent of the demise of coal.
""The investor exit from oil and gas as a fuel source will be slower than coal, but the emissions reduction maths is clear and so this inevitable transition has started,"" said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group that represents asset managers with holdings of over $60 trillion.
But other investors do not draw the same parallels.
""I do not see this as the start of a broader trend among major investors,"" said Rohan Murphy, energy analyst at Allianz (DE:ALVG), which holds shares in several oil majors.
""Coal is a more obvious SRI (sustainable responsible investment) sell compared to oil and gas – coal is dirtier."" 
""Gas, which is a big part of all the big oil businesses today, is the answer for the medium-term energy transition to gas from coal for power generation,"" Murphy said.
Petroleum companies see natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal for power generation in the effort to wean the world off fossil fuels by the end of the century.
""Many wish for a quick and revolutionary role reversal between the oil and gas industry, and the renewable and new electric industry. But undue haste and an overly ideological approach could bring great economic and social damage,"" Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in a speech last month.
Also, demand for oil in transportation and plastics is not expected to decline significantly until 2050, according to many forecasts.
The Norwegian announcement came as more than 195 nations met in Bonn, Germany, to decide how to comply with climate targets agreed in Paris in 2015 to limit a rise in global temperatures.
SCALE
But beyond our dependence on oil and gas, the size of the world's top oil companies would make mass divestment a huge challenge. The top five publicly traded companies - Exxon,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), Shell, BP and Total - together have a market value of over $1 trillion. 
Coal companies, on the other hand, have always been smaller.
For now, there is no viable alternative to oil and gas to meet the world's demand, several investors said.
""My guess is that after the initial market adjustment ... the move may not damage the sector's long-term performance significantly,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management. 
The Norwegian wealth fund's move, echoing Saudi Arabia's plan to list part of its national oil company, was aimed at making Norway less exposed to volatile oil prices and less reliant on revenue from fossil fuels. 
If approved, it would most likely take years for the Norwegian fund to unwind its large investments in the sector and find new homes for the money. 
And while there is also growing demand from retail investors to invest in 'responsible' or 'sustainable' funds, oil and gas companies are not commonly excluded and any change here would be gradual. 
Dropping oil and gas companies would also mean missing out on a rich source of dividend income, a prized asset at a time of low bond yields. 
Three – Shell, Exxon and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) - were among the top-10 dividend payers globally in the third quarter. 
In absolute terms, the number of oil and gas companies in leading stock indices varies, with 14 in the STOXX 600 index of leading European companies, or 2.3 percent; and 26 in the S&P 500, or 5.2 percent. 
The size of some of the largest can have a disproportionate impact on returns relative to their index peers. While there are just two companies in Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index, for example, they make up 14 percent of the index's value. 
While the Norwegian fund has long been a trend-setter for issues around socially responsible investing, particularly in Scandinavia, the reason for this decision is relatively unique. 
Its desire to make treasury receipts less dependent on the oil price is not a challenge faced by most pension funds, which make up a large slice of the money invested globally. 

Any decision to ditch oil and gas would arguably leave them less diversified, not more, said investors, although charitable endowments may have more flexibility to do so.

Despite rising sharply on Friday, crude oil futures failed to pare losses earlier week amid ongoing investor fears that rising U.S. output would dampen OPEC’s efforts to rid the market of excess supplies.
Preliminary U.S. production figures this week, showed weekly output rose by 25,000 to an all-time high of 9.65 million barrels per day, while crude oil stockpiles rose for second week in a row.
The International Energy Agency said on Thursday that the U.S. would account for 80% of the global increase in oil production over the next decade.
Also adding to fears of an increase in global crude supplies was a report on Thursday indicating Iraq and Turkey were considering resuming Kirkuk oil export from the Ceyhan pipeline. The Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline exports about 600,000 barrels of oil, but current crude flows are flowing at a rate below 100,000 barrels, following political unrest in the region.
In the U.S.,meanwhile, Baker Hughes released its count of oil rigs operating in the US remained unchanged from a week ago at 738.
The uptick in oil prices is expected to remain limited amid fears that OPEC may opt against extending its production-cut agreement beyond March as concerns grew that Russia was reluctant to support an extension of the deal at the upcoming OPEC meeting on Nov. 30.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $14.77, or 1.15%, to $1292.88 a troy ounce.
“As long as there is continuous hostile policy against my country [North Korea] by the U.S. and as long as there are continued war games at our doorstep, then there will not be negotiations,” North Korea’s US ambassador Han Tae Song said.
That fuelled geopolitical uncertainty, raising demand for safe-haven gold as market participants feared that North Korea could retaliate should Washington respond with new sanctions on the isolated nation. 
In the U.S., political uncertainty weighed on treasury yields and the dollar, underpinning a move higher in gold prices after reports surfaced that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was set to issue fresh subpoenas for the Trump campaign as part of investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
Gold is sensitive to moves lower in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A weaker dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency while a drop in U.S. rates, reduces the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 2 percent on Friday, capping five sessions of losses, on expectations of an OPEC deal to extend curbs on production and the shutting of a major U.S. crude pipeline. 
Prices were still on track for their first weekly loss in six as rising U.S. output data was compounded by doubts that Russia would support an OPEC deal.
Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was $1.07 higher at $62.43 a barrel by 11:20 a.m. EST (1620 GMT) while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) (CLc1) rose $1.25 to $56.39 a barrel. 
Prices trended higher after Saudi Arabia's energy minister on Thursday signaled a willingness to extend output cuts when OPEC meets on Nov. 30 on whether to extend caps well into 2018.
""Obviously, the comments gave us guarantee that the extension is going to happen and was a driving story overnight,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.
""Globally, we're coming against the backdrop of tightness in distillate inventories and strong global refinery demand. Those catalysts will continue to drive us higher."" 
TransCanada Corp's (TO:TRP) 590,000 barrel per day (bpd) Keystone pipeline remained shut after a leak in South Dakota on Thursday. Traders said the shut-in would add to bullish sentiment due to fewer barrels going into Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point of the WTI contract. 
But prices were still on track to fall nearly 2 percent this week, as fears of oversupply in the United States weighed after government data showed output  hit a record 9.65 million bpd last week. 
The International Energy Agency said on Thursday that the United States would account for 80 percent of the global increase in oil production over the next decade. 
""Let's assume that U.S. oil production continues its upward trajectory. They could very well be at 10 million bpd by the end of 2017,"" said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services in Dubai.
Last week, U.S. energy companies added the most oil drilling rigs in week since June. This week's U.S. oil rig count data, an early indicator of future output, is due at 1 p.m.. 
Signs of rising U.S. output have dampened the impact of the deal restricting output agreed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and several other producers.
The agreement expires in March and was expected to be extended at OPEC's next meeting on Nov. 30. But signs that Russian support for the deal may be wavering have injected uncertainty and undermined the recent rally.

Earlier this week, Russia's Rosneft said that an exit from the supply curb deal was a serious challenge, though added that it was committed to a deal.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude December contract was up 70 cents or about 1.27% at $55.84 a barrel by 09:50 a.m. ET (13:50 GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for January delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up 47 cents or about 0.77% at $61.85 a barrel, off a two-week low of $61.09 hit overnight.
Prices had come under pressure after the EIA reported on Wednesday that crude oil inventories rose by 1.9 million barrels last week, marking the second-straight increase and compared with analysts' expectations for a decline of 2.2 million barrels.
The report also showed that domestic production rose by 25,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a record 9.645 million. Output has now risen by almost 15% since the most recent low in mid-2016, casting doubts over the past few months' narrative of tightening energy markets.
But oil prices recovered amid sustained optimism that oil producing countries will agree to extend an output cut at their meeting at the end of this month.
Under the original terms of the deal, OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine more months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Discussions are continuing in the run-up to the Nov. 30 meeting, which oil ministers from OPEC and the participating non-OPEC countries will attend.

If he can equal the manufacturing prowess of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s current Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, he might just clobber the oil industry too.
That’s a big if, given Tesla’s current inability to meet manufacturing targets on the mass-market Model 3 electric car. But if the company really can deliver a battery-powered big rig with a 500-mile range and lower lifetime costs than diesel vehicles, then a big chunk of future oil demand growth is in peril.
Road freight accounts for about a fifth of world oil consumption, mostly diesel, according to the annual World Energy Outlook published by the International Energy Agency this week. Trucks are responsible for about 60 percent of the increase in global diesel demand since 2000, the report shows.
Freight will be even more important to the oil market in the future. The IEA expects gasoline demand to start falling before 2040 -- in part because of the big increase in electric cars -- but it says road freight and aviation will have no choice but to keep using oil. Buses and trucks will drive a 2 million barrel-a-day increase in diesel demand from 2016 to 2040, and overall oil demand will keep growing, it said.
Musk said his new truck “can transform into a robot, fight aliens and make one hell of a latte.” Showmanship aside, if the truck is a success, the IEA’s forecasts may prove wildly optimistic."
1187,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 17, 2017 07:30AM ET</span>",How Morgan Stanley Outdid Goldman in Old Commodities Rivalry,"(Bloomberg) -- For nearly three decades,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). outdid  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in commodities, year after year. In 2017, Morgan Stanley is pulling ahead in a reversal of fortunes for the two banks known as the ""Wall Street refiners."" 
The battle for the crown as the top U.S. commodities bank is being fought far away from the white-shoe world of Manhattan bankers: from obscure markets for gas in Pennsylvania to electricity grids in Texas, and power stations in between.
Goldman has lost money this year in U.S. gas and power trading, turning 2017 into its worst year for commodities since it became public nearly two decades ago, according to people familiar with the matter. In contrast, a slimmed-down commodities operation at Morgan Stanley has successfully weathered the difficult market, people familiar with the bank said, asking not to be named discussing internal matters.
For the two banks, the battle of trading strategies has a personal edge: Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman cut his teeth dealing metals and has stood by his large commodities unit while competitors cut people and capital. Morgan Stanley’s James Gorman took the opposite approach, selling large parts of the bank’s oil business in 2014-15 in a simpler-is-better bet that’s paying off now.
""They got out near the top, and Goldman and others have been more adversely impacted by the slowdown,"" said Craig Pirrong, a business professor at the University of Houston, of Morgan Stanley’s decision to reduce the size of its business. ""2014-2015 was a peak in oil trading overall, so in that the cutback seems well-timed.""
Energy Losses
Losses in natural gas and power trading were the major driver of the dire performance at Goldman’s commodities division this year, according to people familiar with the matter. The unit, which at its peak made $3.4 billion in a year, had net revenues of less than $200 million in the first nine months of this year, according to public statements from company executives and people familiar with the matter.
Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, has outperformed. The bank has made net revenues of about $400 million to $500 million so far this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. About half of that has come from gas and power, the person said.
""Gas prices have been low and there hasn’t been any volatility,"" said Amrit Shahani, research director at Coalition Development Ltd., an analytics firm that compiles estimates of banks’ commodities performance. ""There aren’t many traders who have got it right.""
Morgan Stanley’s success comes against a backdrop of drastically shrinking revenues across the sector in recent years. Commodities revenues across major banks have fallen from a peak of over $14 billion in 2008 to just $1.3 billion in the first half of this year, according to Coalition data.
Goldman is not alone in having a tough time navigating the gas and power markets. Benchmark gas prices have been stuck in a range of 86 cents per million British thermal units all year, the narrowest band in decades, thanks to record production, mild weather and competition from alternative electricity sources.
According to estimates from Coalition, net revenues in gas and power trading across 12 top investment banks fell 75 percent in the first half of 2017 from a year earlier. That outpaced a 41 percent drop in overall commodities trading revenues.
Morgan Stanley and Goldman both declined to comment.
Old Rivalry
For more than two decades, Goldman and Morgan Stanley were the dominant banks in commodity markets. But Morgan Stanley, despite a large physical oil trading business which competed with trading houses like Vitol Group and  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc, consistently made less money in commodities than its Wall Street rival.
From 2008 to 2012, for example, Goldman outperformed Morgan Stanley every year in net revenues from commodities, according to performance data that was disclosed as part of a Senate investigation into banks’ activities in commodities markets. Goldman’s commodities performance was on average about a third higher than its Wall Street rivals, according to a Bloomberg analysis of the data.
Then, under pressure from new regulations and scrutiny of its physical trading business, Morgan Stanley drastically shrank its commodities unit. It sold its stake in oil-transportation company TransMontaigne in 2014 and the following year sold its physical oil merchanting business, refocusing the business on the bank’s clients.
Goldman’s Blankfein, on the other hand, publicly endorsed the commodities business, arguing that the downturn in profitability was cyclical and the bank would be well-placed to benefit from an eventual rebound in activity.
Blankfein has stuck to his guns so far this year, spearheading a hiring spree at the commodities unit and trying to win more business from the bank’s clients. But Goldman’s poor performance has triggered an informal review led by securities division co-head Isabelle Ealet, who ran the commodities unit for five years until 2012.
On the other hand, Morgan Stanley’s strong performance has boosted the profile of Nancy King, a former oil trader who was promoted to run commodities in 2015. The bank’s performance this year has put it ahead of other rivals such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). in commodities, according to industry executives and consultants. It is only behind Macquarie, which is set to take the crown of leading commodities trader from Goldman this year, the same people said.
Losing Traders
Goldman’s struggles in gas and power have not been helped by the loss of some of the bank’s top traders. Gregory Agran, global head of commodities and a former head of North American gas and power trading, is set to leave the firm this month. Other departures this year include Owen West, global head of natural gas trading and co-head of global power trading, and Teoman Guler, head of U.S. power trading.
Goldman is hoping a former Morgan Stanley trader can help reverse its fortunes in the sector: it has hired Nitin Jindal as a partner to head North American natural gas and power trading, Bloomberg reported last month.
The exodus at Goldman underscores a broader generational shift in commodities banking, as a decline in profitability in the sector sees older traders who enjoyed years of booming profitability give way to a younger generation.
Henrik Sukonnik, a managing director who focuses on gas and power trading for recruiter H.W. Anderson Ltd, said Morgan Stanley had managed a turbulent few years for the commodities business better than its Wall Street rival.
""They have gone through major changes. They’ve had senior people leave or let go but they had younger talent that they brought in,"" he said.

Overnight, crude oil prices settled lower on Thursday as investors fretted over a potential uptick in global supply amid reports that Turkey and Iraq discussed resuming exports from the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline.
A discussion between Iraq and Turkey on resuming Kirkuk oil export from the Ceyhan pipeline sparked fears of oversupply as many said a possible uptick in exports would forced OPEC to rein in production.
“The priority is to resume oil exports from Kirkuk through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline once it has been rehabilitated or replaced by a new one,” Iraq’s Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi said.
That added to recent fears that rising U.S. production would dampened the impact of Opec’s production cuts, which so far are widely believed to be moving oil markets closer to rebalancing.
Preliminary U.S. production figures showed weekly output rose by 25,000 to an all-time high of 9.65 million barrels per day, as crude oil stockpiles rose for second week in arrow, the Energy Information Administration Energy Agency said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Offshore oil drilling and service companies, hurt by the energy industry's shift to lower-cost shale and away from deepwater projects, are dominating the year's energy bankruptcies in North America, according to law firm Haynes and Boone.
There were fewer oilfield service companies seeking protection this year than last but those that did have had larger debts. Through October, 44 oilfield services companies filed for bankruptcy in the United States and Canada owing creditors $24.8 billion, compared with 72 companies and $13.48 billion for all of 2016. 
Just two offshore companies accounted for 45 percent of the total owed creditors this year, the law firm's figures show. Deepwater offshore services firm  Seadrill  Ltd's (OL:SDRL) September filing was the largest bankruptcy this year with $8 billion in debts, while  Ocean Rig UDW Inc  (O:ORIG) filed owing $3.6 billion. 
On Nov. 12, another offshore driller, Pacific Drilling [PDSAX.UL], filed for bankruptcy protection with $3.2 billion owed to creditors. That filing was not included in the survey.
Oil prices have rebounded this year with the U.S. benchmark (CLc1) up 22 percent in the last 52 weeks to about $55 a barrel. That gain has stirred onshore drilling and production but has not been enough to boost the more costly offshore and deepwater drilling. 
""If you're going to get $50 a barrel oil you want the cheapest way of getting that barrel and offshore isn't it,"" Ian Peck, chairman of Haynes and Boone's restructuring practice group, said in an interview.
The law firm's survey of energy bankruptcy filings in the United States and Canada also shows a sharp reduction this year in the number of bankruptcy filings by oil and gas producers and by energy pipeline and storage firms. 
Twenty North American oil and gas producers have filed bankruptcies so far in 2017 owing creditors $5.6 billion, down from $56.8 billion owed across 70 filings for all of last year.
""The noise has died down quite a bit on the producer side,"" Peck said. 
Only four energy processing, transportation and storage companies have filed for bankruptcy through October, with debt totaling $2.71 billion, compared with 13 filings in all of 2016 for a tally of $11 billion. There were no bankruptcy filings by North American gathering, transportation and storage firms since April, the law firm said.

1192,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 16, 2017 02:40PM ET</span>","Crude Oil Settles Lower, Concerns Grow Over Uptick in Global Supplies","Investing.com – Crude oil prices settled lower on Thursday as investors fretted over a potential uptick in global supply amid reports that Turkey and Iraq discussed resuming exports from the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for December delivery fell by 19 cents to settle at $55.14 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent lost 52 cents to trade at $61.35 a barrel.
A discussion between Iraq and Turkey on resuming Kirkuk oil export from the Ceyhan pipeline sparked fears of oversupply as many said a possible uptick in exports would forced OPEC to rein in production.
“The priority is to resume oil exports from Kirkuk through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline once it has been rehabilitated or replaced by a new one,” Iraq’s Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi said.
That added to recent fears that rising U.S. production would dampened the impact of Opec’s production cuts, which so far are widely believed to be moving oil markets closer to rebalancing.
Preliminary U.S. production figures showed weekly output rose by 25,000 to an all-time high of 9.65 million barrels per day, as crude oil stockpiles rose for second week in arrow, the Energy Information Administration Energy Agency said.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by roughly 1.9 million barrels for the week ended Nov. 11, missing expectations  of a draw of 2.2 barrels.
Data pointing to rising U.S. output comes ahead of an OPEC meeting on Nov. 30 in Vienna, where it is expected the oil-cartel will extend its output-cut agreement beyond the March 2018 deadline.
In May, Opec producers agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.2 million bpd agreed in November last year."

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $3.11, or 0.35%, to $1280.77 a troy ounce.
Ahead of the GOP House vote on tax reform, gold prices traded in a narrow range on Thursday as gains amid a falling dollar were capped by an uptick in treasury yields.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims increased 10,000 a seasonally adjusted 249,000 for the week ended Nov. 11, missing forecasts of a 4,000 decrease.
Philly Fed manufacturing index for November fell to 22.7 in November from 27.9 in October, undershooting economists’ forecasts for a reading of 25.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Traders, however, shifted attention to tax reform as the House is poised to pass a massive overhaul of the U.S. tax code on Thursday as Republicans attempt to push through tax reform before year-end.
Uncertainty over the outcome of tax reform has renewed investor appetite for safe-haven gold, as data showed traders increase their bets on the precious metal last week.
Net bullish bets on gold rose to 195,800, from 193,100 the previous week according to a report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Monday.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures rose 0.57% to $17.08 a troy ounce, while platinum futures gained 0.26% to $935.50.

1194,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 16, 2017 10:55AM ET</span>",Natural Gas Futures Turn Lower After Weekly Storage Data,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures reversed gains on Thursday to trade lower despite data showing that domestic supplies in storage fell for the first time this season.
U.S. natural gas futures shed around 0.3 cents, or about 0.1%, to $3.080 per million British thermal units by 10:55AM ET (1555GMT). Futures were at around $3.091 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. fell by 18 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Nov. 10, compared to forecasts for a withdrawal of 14 billion. It was the first weekly decline since March.
That compared with a gain of 15 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 30 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 12 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.772 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 271 bcf, or around 6.7%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 101 bcf, or roughly 2.6%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.
Futures ended lower for the third day in a row on Wednesday amid forecasts for less heating demand through the end of this month.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in late October and early November, when mild weather weakens demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Thursday as rising U.S. production and inventories threatened to undermine a rally inspired in recent months by OPEC's curbs on output, despite expectations that these will be extended at the group's meeting on Nov. 30.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were down 46 cents a barrel at $61.41 by 1451 GMT. U.S. light crude (CLc1) fell 36 cents to $54.97.
Oil prices have slipped in recent days from the two-year highs hit last week by both crude benchmarks after signs that U.S. supply is rising fast and could potentially undermine OPEC's efforts to tighten the market.
""The oil market sell-off is easing, but the bearish afterglow from yesterday's update on U.S. oil stockpiles is keeping bears in the driving seat,"" PVM wrote in a note to clients, referring to new data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.
""Selling pressures are being underpinned by an unexpected jump in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories,"" PVM added.
The EIA data showed domestic crude inventories  rising for a second week in a row, building by 1.9 million barrels in the week to Nov. 10 to 459 million barrels.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected a decrease of 2.2 million barrels.
U.S. crude oil production  has hit a record of 9.65 million bpd, meaning output has risen by almost 15 percent since its mid-2016 low.
But expectations that a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna on Nov. 30 would result in OPEC nations and other big exporters extending their pact to tighten supply has offset some of the pressure on prices.
OPEC and non-OPEC exporters including Russia agreed a year ago to cut crude output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) between January this year and March 2018 to bolster prices.
Oil ministers have signaled that they are likely to extend the agreement, possibly until the end of next year.
""It is widely believed that OPEC and non-OPEC nations will roll over their production until (end) 2018,"" said PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga.

""If they don't, or if the period will be shorter than nine months, I think we will see even lower prices. Brent would break back below $60 a barrel.""

""This has implications on the oil markets, prices, trade flows, investment trends and the geopolitics of energy,"" IEA head Fatih Birol said at a U.N. climate conference in Bonn.
He said the United States, whose upstream energy industry has seen a resurgence with the development of fracking technology, would become the ""undisputed leader of oil and gas production worldwide.""
On the broader market, he said the IEA expected oil markets to rebalance in 2018 if oil demand remained ""more or less"" as robust as it was now and if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies extended output cuts.
OPEC and other producers are expected to extend production cuts beyond a March deadline in a bid to cut oversupply.
The Paris-based IEA cut its oil demand forecast in its latest monthly report by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) for this year and next, to an estimated 1.5 million bpd and 1.3 million bpd, respectively. 
It also said oil inventories in the developed world fell by 40 million barrels in September, dropping below 3.0 billion barrels for the first time in two years.

According to OPEC's own numbers, inventories were 154 million barrels above the five-year average in September. OPEC states have said they want to reduce stocks to their five-year average.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - In a square behind Libya's central bank, black market dealers, some of them armed, carry small plastic bags filled with dollars and larger ones with dinars in and out of one of many informal exchanges.
Traders buy food and other goods from abroad at the official rate and sell them at the unofficial one, pocketing vast profits; others make equally large sums by smuggling out heavily subsidized fuel.
In the back streets of the old city meanwhile, ordinary people have resorted to selling jewelry or dollars hidden at home as six years of post-dictatorship chaos take their toll.
""I haven't been paid for four months,"" said Fatima, 40, from the southern city of Sabha as she sold three small gold charms to pay for diabetes treatment for her sister, Hasina, who added: ""We're helpless, there's nothing else we can do.""
In other signs of rising poverty, elderly women beg motorists for cash on Tripoli's streets and families queue for charity food handouts. The U.N. estimated that about 1.3 million people in Libya need humanitarian assistance this year.
Their situation took another turn for the worse in the past two weeks after the black market rate of the dinar, which has long languished at record lows, slid again, fuelling inflation that is already around 25-30 percent.
The central bank blamed the audit bureau and the U.N.-backed government for restricting letters of credit that fund basic supplies to a divided country where a security vacuum and smuggling networks have destabilized the wider region.
Officials had come across suspect requests - one to import tuna worth $120,000, more than the country consumes in a year, according to a Libyan entrepreneur who declined to be named, fearing retribution from Libya's powerful armed groups.
Just $2.5 billion of an expected $7.4 billion of credit has been allocated, the trader said, helping knock the dinar from around 8.5 to 9.25 against the dollar on the black market. Its value has fallen by more than 600 percent since early 2014.
The economy ministry was not immediately available for comment on a complex credit system that passes through commercial banks and where the audit bureau had documented earlier abuses and lack of oversight.
""We're talking about an extremely bad economic and financial situation,"" Central Bank Governor Sadiq al-Kabir said in a rare news conference on Tuesday. ""Everyone, whether legislative or executive, holds responsibility equally.""
ELUSIVE PEACE
Traders and economists say political uncertainty is a major factor weakening the currency, with U.N. talks to broker a deal between rival factions currently suspended.
Libya is struggling to fund food imports and defend its foreign reserves, which the World Bank estimates will stand at $67.5 billion at the end of this year, compared to $123.5 billion in 2012.
International experts say the only way to resolve the issue is to devalue the dinar from the official exchange rate of 1.37 to the dollar, but agreeing an economic strategy in a country dominated by armed factions with rival governments and no budgets is no simple task.
A powerful or well-connected minority who are profiting from a flourishing shadow economy have little interest in change. 
The central bank did not comment on devaluation, but economists and diplomats say the bank is reluctant to devalue without a policy plan in place to deal with the resulting shock.
Libya managed this year to lift oil production to about 1 million barrels a day, but output is stuck well below the levels before the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi.
Revenues that normally account for about 80 percent of gross domestic product are largely used to pay salaries, including those of armed factions added to the state payroll for their role in the uprising. Subsidies include a $4 billion-plus annual fuel subsidy that is among the most generous in the world.
Premiums on the official exchange rate and subsidized fuel make Libya ""a criminal and terrorist cross-border funding paradise"", said Husni Bey, chairman of HB Group, one of Libya's biggest private firms.
""Most instability in Libya today is of a criminal nature... due to the lack of equitable exchange rate for the Libyan dinar and the subsidies that must be changed from goods to direct cash contributions.""
Last year Libya spent around $26 billion, but earned just $6 billion. ""This year we estimate that revenues should increase to around $14 billion, but spending will likely be more than double this,"" said Mark Griffiths, Libya Mission Chief for the International Monetary Fund. ""This is not sustainable."" 
The government has sought to reduce the public salary bill by 5 billion dinars annually, clamping down on abuse by removing some 100,000 people who had been claiming several salaries, according to a finance ministry report.
Libyans became used to plentiful public jobs and state handouts as Gaddafi sought to buy loyalty like other Middle Eastern oil producers. Migrant workers used to do the manual work, now Libyans without contacts have taken their place.
Salman Rashid, a public servant, said he had received just three months-worth of pay in the past year. ""It's not enough for basic needs,"" he said. ""Now I work on construction sites and in buildings maintenance.""
Entrepreneurs have withdrawn deposits from banks for fear of employees leaking word of them to kidnappers and others also prefer to keep money at home.
In a second shop in the old city, a woman who gave her name as Karima was changing 500 euros. ""I need to go to Tunis for surgery and am selling my foreign currency holdings,"" she said. ""Times are very difficult now.""
Shop owner Salahedin Zarti, 52, said up to 10 people come in daily to sell necklaces, bracelets and rings.

""In the beginning it was every day, but now I think people are starting to run out of jewelry,"" he said.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.08% to $1,278.74 a troy ounce.
Overnight, gold prices fell on Wednesday after the dollar moved off intraday lows on signs that fourth quarter economic growth remained solid, cementing investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will raised rates for the third time this year in December.
A duo of reports on retail sales and inflation lifted the dollar off lows, pressuring gold prices to retreat from highs as the precious metal remained on track to post a loss for the first time this week.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index rose 0.1% last month after jumping 0.5% in September.
Retail sales increased 0.2% last month, the Commerce Department said Wednesday beating expectations for a 0.1% increase.
The uptick retail sales suggested that consumption growth in the fourth quarter remained solid, further strengthening the narrative of an improving US economy. That cemented expectations for a year-end rate hike as investing.com’s fed rate monitor tool showed 100% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates in December.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for December delivery inched up 0.02% to $55.34 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent rose 0.10% to $61.94 a barrel.
Eurasia Group said that a default by Venezuela and its state-owned oil company remains highly likely.
""Predicting the precise timing of a default is difficult, as the government seems prepared to keep paying while it can,"" Eurasia Group said in a report.
""But if talks falter and it becomes apparent that it doesn’t have options, the government’s calculations may end up being shaped by electoral timing. (President Nicholas) Maduro is considering moving up the presidential election (due by end-2018) to March of next year, and the debt service profile is relatively light before then (the government owes a total of $1 billion in the first quarter between PDVSA and the sovereign) with bulkier payments due in April, August, and October.""
Overnight, crude oil settled lower for the third day amid ongoing concerns over rising US output and build in crude stockpiles for the second week in row.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by roughly 1.9 million barrels for the week ended Nov. 11, missing expectations of a draw of 2.2 barrels.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – rose by 894,000 barrels, confounding expectations for a draw of 919,000 barrels while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – fell by about 799,000 barrels, less than the expected decline of 1.3 million barrels.
The bearish data on refinery products such as gasoline and distillate come against the backdrop of an uptick in refinery activity as heating oil season gets underway.
Rising crude output, meanwhile, continued as preliminary U.S. production figures showed weekly output rose by 25,000 to an all-time high of 9.65 million barrels per day, the EIA said.
The uptick in US crude production added to recent fears that US producers are set to ramp up output after the IEA said on Tuesday that it expected global crude markets to remain oversupplied through the second quarter of 2018 amid an uptick in U.S. production.

The U.S. benchmark slipped 0.7 percent on Wednesday as Russia believes it’s too early to announce a possible extension at OPEC’s meeting at the end of the month, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The limits, sealed in a deal between OPEC and other producers in 2016, are scheduled to end in March. Meanwhile, U.S. government data showed that production climbed to a fresh record.
“It sounds like there is some discourse between OPEC and non-OPEC in terms of not committing to something at the end of the month, and maybe kicking the can down the road,” said Nick Holmes, an analyst at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC in Leawood, Kansas, which manages $16 billion in energy-related assets.
Oil rallied above $57 a barrel to a two-year high last week on escalating tensions in the Middle East and amid signals of a potential extension of supply curbs by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies. Since then, futures have slid about 3.5 percent.
OPEC has yet to show it has convinced Russia, one of its partners in the deal, that a decision to prolong output cuts is needed when the group meets in Vienna later this month. Another issue is how long any extension should be, with options including an added three months being considered.
Price Weakness
The Russian government has yet to reach a consensus with the nation’s oil companies on extending the deal, according to the people familiar with the discussions.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for December delivery fell by 37 cents to settle at $55.33 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent lost 34 cents to trade at $61.87 a barrel.
Crude oil settled lower for the third day amid ongoing concerns over rising US output and build in crude stockpiles for the second week in row.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by roughly 1.9 million barrels for the week ended Nov. 11, missing expectations  of a draw of 2.2 barrels.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – rose by 894,000 barrels, confounding expectations for a draw of 919,000 barrels while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – fell by about 799,000 barrels, less than the expected decline of 1.3 million barrels.
The bearish data on refinery products such as gasoline and distillate come against the backdrop of an uptick in refinery activity as heating oil season gets underway.
Rising crude output, meanwhile, continued as preliminary U.S. production figures showed weekly output rose by 25,000 to an all-time high of 9.65 million barrels per day, the EIA said.
The uptick in US crude production added to recent fears that US producers are set to ramp up output after the IEA said on Tuesday that it expected global crude markets to remain oversupplied through the second quarter of 2018 amid an uptick in U.S. production."
1208,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2017 01:50PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Britain, Canada ally to boost support for global coal phase-out","By Nina Chestney and Alister Doyle
BONN, Germany (Reuters) - Britain and Canada will urge nations at U.N. climate talks on Thursday to join them in a global alliance to phase out coal, a letter seen by Reuters shows, defying U.S. lobbying in favor of the fossil fuel at the same event.
Their Powering Past Coal alliance, which also includes the low-lying Marshall Islands, will be launched in Bonn days after a pro-coal presentation by the Trump administration jarred with many ministers who want the talks to focus on cleaner energy sources.
The pact is expected to attract at least another nine countries, a source close to the matter told Reuters.
Mexico, France, Finland, New Zealand, Italy and an African country, are expected to sign up on Thursday, as well as at least 20 other entities including U.S. states, Canadian provinces and businesses.
Since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, which aims to wean the world economy off fossil fuels, several countries have pledged to phase out coal, including Britain, Canada, France and the Netherlands.
""Joining Powering Past Coal is an opportunity to bring these national initiatives together, with sub-national and private sector action,"" said the letter to around 100 ministers gathered at the talks.
A group of around 100 countries formed a ""high-ambition coalition"" in Paris in 2015 that seeks to go beyond the 2 degree Celsius limit on global warming set down in Paris, a level the Marshall Islands and states in similar positions say may not be enough to stop them being submerged by the end of the century.
Coal is responsible for more than 40 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions.
The letter was signed by Britain's climate change and industry minister Claire Perry, Canadian minister of environment and climate change Catherine McKenna and the Marshall Islands' minister for foreign affairs and trade, John Silk.
""We would strongly urge you to sign or endorse the declaration of the global alliance to Power Past Coal,"" they said.
The letter said the alliance would work to expand its partners to 50 by the next U.N. climate summit in 2018 which will be held in Poland's Katowice, one of Europe's most polluted cities.
Germany, where the current U.N. climate conference is being held, was not mentioned as a signatory. Divisions over the pace of exit from coal power have this week dominated talks in Berlin on forming a new German coalition government.
Last month, Britain and Canada joined forces to focus on getting rid of coal as a power source.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $4.40, or 0.35%, to $1282.95 a troy ounce.
A duo of reports on retail sales and inflation lifted the dollar off lows, pressuring gold prices to retreat from highs as the precious metal remained on track to post a loss for the first time this week.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index rose 0.1% last month after jumping 0.5% in September.
Retail sales  increased 0.2% last month, the Commerce Department said Wednesday beating expectations for a 0.1% increase.
The uptick retail sales suggested that consumption growth in the fourth quarter remained solid, further strengthening the narrative of an improving US economy. That cemented expectations for a year-end rate hike as investing.com’s fed rate monitor tool showed 100% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to raise rates in December.
Royal Bank of Canada’s Tom Porcelli said that the bank revised upwards its estimate for fourth quarter consumption to 2.7% from 2.4% after the upbeat retail sales print while its estimate for fourth quarter GDP rose to 3.4% from 3.2%.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

Soros Fund Management LLC stayed out of gold for the fourth straight quarter.
New York-based Paulson & Co, led by longtime gold bull John Paulson, kept its stake in SPDR Gold Trust (P:GLD) at 4.36 million shares with a value of $530 million at the end of September, up from a value of $514.5 million in the second quarter, the 13F filing showed.
SPDR Gold Trust is the world's biggest gold exchange-traded fund.
Paulson also left stakes unchanged in AngloGold Ashanti Ltd and NovaGold Resources Inc, though their value declined versus the end of the second quarter. Stakes in IAMGOLD Corp, RandGold Resources Ltd, and Seabridge Gold Inc were also unchanged but their value rose.
Spot gold prices rose 10 percent in September, from the end of the second quarter, to a 13-month high at $1,357.54 an ounce, on safe-haven buying due to rising tensions on the Korean peninsula and concerns Pyongyang might launch more missiles after conducting nuclear tests.
Weak U.S. economic data also briefly lowered expectations for an interest rate hike in December.
Bullion prices later pared gains to close the third quarter up 3 percent as expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike rates returned.

CI Investments Inc sharply increased its holdings in SPDR Gold Trust to nearly 1.45 million shares worth $176.2 million in the three-month period ended Sept. 30, up more than five times from its 267,329 shares at the end of the second quarter, filings showed last week.

1211,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2017 11:45AM ET</span>",Oil prices fall for fourth day after U.S. crude stocks rise,"By David Gaffen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell for a fourth session on Wednesday, after the U.S. government reported an unexpected increase in crude and gasoline stocks, but an increase in refining runs and a dropoff in distillate stocks helped prices bounce off session lows. 
Prices remained under pressure from this week's International Energy Agency (IEA) outlook for slower growth in global crude demand.
While the crude build of 1.9 million barrels reported by the Energy Information Administration was more than forecast, it was not as big as the increase of 6.5 million barrels reported Tuesday by industry group the American Petroleum Institute. [L1N1NL0YO] The EIA data encouraged buying at session lows.
""Overall, the report is somewhat supportive because it was not as bearish as the previous API report last night – that is why we are slowly digging our way out of the downside seen earlier this morning,"" said Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. 
The data also showed distillate stocks in the U.S. Gulf fell to a one-year low, while refining rates rose in the latest week, led by a jump in East Coast refining, which is operating at a record 99.8 percent of capacity. Increased refining rates could eventually reduce crude inventories. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) was at $55.42 per barrel, down 31 cents, as of 11:11 a.m. EDT (1511 GMT). Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were down 37 cents at $61.85 a barrel, having fallen by 1.5 percent on Tuesday, its largest one-day drop in a month. 
Brent's price is down nearly 5 percent since last week when it hit its highest since mid-2015.
On Tuesday, the IEA cut its oil demand growth forecast by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) for both 2017 and 2018. That could mean world oil consumption may not breach 100 million bpd next year as many had expected. Also, supplies are likely to exceed that level, particularly as U.S. production continues to rise.
U.S. oil production  has jumped more than 14 percent since mid-2016 to 9.65 million bpd and is expected to grow further.
The IEA said non-OPEC production would rise 1.4 million bpd in 2018, undermining efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers to limit global crude supplies and support prices.
OPEC meets on Nov. 30 and is expected to agree an extension to its output cuts.

""The urgency for countries participating in the agreement to formulate an exit strategy is increasing as oil output in the US continues to climb,"" said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.

Technological advances that have enabled production from U.S. shale oilfields to boom will lead to growth of 8 million barrels a day between 2010 and 2025, the agency said in its annual World Energy Outlook.
The boom will turn the U.S., still among the largest oil importers, into a net exporter of fossil fuels.
While oil prices have recovered to a two-year high above $60 a barrel, they’re still about half the level traded earlier this decade as soaring U.S. output fed into a global supply glut.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 71 cents, or about 1.3%, to a two-week low of $54.99 a barrel by 10:35AM ET (1535GMT). Prices were at around $55.13 prior to the release of the inventory data.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., dipped 76 cents, or 1.2%, to $61.47 a barrel, its lowest since Nov. 3.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 1.9 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 10. That compared with analysts' expectations for a decline of 2.2 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply-gain of 6.5 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, fell by 1.5 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 459.0 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be at the upper half of the average range for this time of year.
U.S. crude oil imports averaged 7.9 million barrels per day last week, up by 521,000 barrels per day from the previous week.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 0.9 million barrels, disappointing expectations for a decline of 0.9 million barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a decline of 0.8 million barrels.
Oil prices lost almost 2% on Tuesday after the International Energy Agency cut its global oil-demand forecasts and projected an increase in U.S. shale production, casting doubts over the past few months' narrative of tightening energy markets.
This week's price drop means that crude futures are now down by around 5% since reaching 28-month highs last week, ending an impressive 40% rally between June and early November.
Despite the cautious sentiment, crude prices are expected to remain supported amid optimism that oil producing countries will agree to extend an output cut at their meeting at the end of this month.
Discussions are continuing in the run-up to the Nov. 30 meeting, which oil ministers from OPEC and the participating non-OPEC countries will attend.
In other energy trading, gasoline futures slipped 0.7 cents, or 0.4%, to $1.730 a gallon, while heating oil declined 1.3 cents, or 0.7%, to $1.893 a gallon.

U.S. natural gas futures tacked on 2.2 cents, or around 0.7%, to $3.123 per million British thermal units by 8:55AM ET (1355GMT). It reached a more than one-week low of $3.064 in the last session.
Futures lost 2% on Tuesday amid forecasts for less heating demand through the end of this month.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in late October and early November, when mild weather weakens demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 3 and 15 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Nov. 10.
That compares with a gain of 15 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 30 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 12 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.790 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 219 bcf, or around 5.5%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 71 bcf, or roughly 1.8%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

1217,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 15, 2017 08:30AM ET</span>",OPEC Nears Meeting Without Clear Plan on How to Extend Cuts,"(Bloomberg) -- Fifteen days from now, nations that pump more than half the world’s oil gather in Vienna to discuss extending the production cuts that helped lift prices to two-year highs. The outcome is far from certain.
Russia, which alongside Saudi Arabia was the architect of the historic cooperation between crude producers, is said to be unconvinced that a decision is needed so soon because the deal expires at the end of March. While OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo sees no opposition in principle to continuing the supply curbs, the extension could be as short as three months or as long as nine.
There’s good reason for doubts to creep into the deliberations. While forecasters agree that the production cuts have depleted bloated fuel stockpiles in recent months, there’s huge divergence in forecasts for 2018. Brent crude is finally trading above $60 a barrel, but it’s unclear whether that’s down to an improving market or the huge increase in speculative bets.
OPEC and Russia’s deal doesn’t expire for four months, but procrastinating in a volatile market with high expectations carries some risks.
“Any postponement in deciding a supply-cut extension, or even a disappointment relative to the duration of an extension, can easily lead to unraveling of speculative length on futures and a price correction,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity-markets strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) SA.
Preparations for the Nov. 30 meeting in the Austrian capital begin one week earlier, with a workshop to discuss the outlook for shale oil followed by the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ Economic Commission Board, said one delegate. This panel of representatives from member countries, which discusses the market before every ministerial meeting, will focus on forecasts for demand this winter, including consideration of the International Energy Agency’s estimate for weaker-than-expected fuel consumption, another delegate said.
Moscow Meeting
Speculation has grown that the cuts would continue beyond expiry, potentially to the end of 2018, after Russian President Vladimir Putin signaled that he’s open to such a move. Yet, he also said there had been no decision in Moscow.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, who met with bosses of the nation’s major oil companies in Moscow on Wednesday, has previously said that there won’t necessarily be a decision this month whether to extend the cuts. It’s hard to see if such a move is needed so long before the deal’s expiry, he said on Nov. 2. Moscow also dragged its feet at the OPEC meeting a year ago, keeping the market guessing until the last moment about whether it would join the cuts.
Cooperation with OPEC is “fruitful,” Tatneft PJSC Chief Executive Officer Nail Maganov told reporters after the meeting with Novak. Market monitoring and discussions need to continue, said Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) Neft PJSC CEO Alexander Dyukov.
Russia and its companies are “fully committed to the current parameters of the agreement,” the Energy Ministry said on its website. The executives at the meeting have differing opinions about whether an extension is necessary or how long it could last, and the talks with Novak didn’t yet reach a consensus, said a government official familiar with the matter, asking not to be named because they’re not authorized to speak to the press. Discussions will resume next week.
The leaders of Russia’s largest producers, who didn’t attend the meeting in Moscow, have previously voiced concerns about extending the deal. Lukoil PJSC’s billionaire CEO Vagit Alekperov said last month that the deal should end if oil prices reach $60 a barrel. Rosneft PJSC boss Igor Sechin has warned that growing U.S. shale output is undermining their efforts.
Diverging Forecasts
OPEC’s own forecasts could give members reason to think a full extension to the end of 2018 is unnecessary. With predictions for strong demand and a more modest expansion in production from non-members, inventories would decline at a rapid pace of 670,000 barrels a day through the year if the group and its allies keep supplies constrained.
“The latest OPEC figures could be interpreted as weakening the case for such a deal to already be agreed at the upcoming meeting,” Vienna-based consultant JBC Energy GmbH said in a report.
Yet the IEA sees demand for OPEC’s crude next year at 32.4 million barrels a day, 1 million lower than the organization’s own estimate and slightly lower than its output last month. If the agency is right, fuel stockpiles would start to expand again in the first half of 2018 and prices could fall below $60 again.
“To me, OPEC producing around October’s 32.5 million barrels a day through 2018 just doesn’t cut it, if regaining historical stock levels is the goal,” said David Fyfe, head of market research and analysis at Geneva-based commodities trader Gunvor Group Ltd. “So, superficially at least, there’s a rationale for further cuts.”

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Rosneft (MM:ROSN), the world's top listed oil company by output, sees the exit from a global oil production-cutting deal as a serious challenge, a spokesman for the firm said.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak met Russian oil company executives in Moscow on Wednesday ahead of talks in Vienna at the end of November between OPEC and non-OPEC producers. 
The ministry said Russian domestic oil producers are committed to a global deal to cut oil output. It said Novak and the companies would continue consultations on the global oil market situation.
Another meeting was scheduled in a week, oil company officials told reporters.
""The discussions are continuing,"" said Alexander Dyukov, the head of Gazprom Neft (MM:SIBN).
""The agreement that was signed and has been effective since July ... not so much time has passed since. That's why we need to continue monitoring. We will gather in a week and will discuss.""
The gathering in the Austrian capital could decide to extend the current deal further. 
OPEC sources last month told Reuters that producers were leaning towards prolonging the agreement until the end of 2018, though the decision could be postponed until early next year depending on the market.
""Speaking about the company's concerns, first of all it was about how to prepare for suspending measures to restrict production,"" said Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontyev.
""This is a serious question. Sooner or later, of course, these measures will be lifted. Now or later, that's a separate question. It's a serious challenge, for which one needs to prepare.""
Rosneft is limiting output at its newest fields under the deal, in which Russia has pledged to cut production by 300,000 bpd. The Kremlin-controlled company accounts for about 40 percent of Russia's total oil output.
Eric Liron, a first vice president at Rosneft, on Tuesday said that the company may delay some greenfield projects if the deal is extended beyond its March 31 expiry date.
Leontyev reiterated that Rosneft is sticking to its commitments under the pact but noted that Chief Executive Igor Sechin had expressed concerns over the deal.
Leontyev said Rosneft's tactics towards the deal are being prepared jointly with the Russian state. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin last month said that the pact was helping the global economy and should be extended at least until the end of 2018.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2017 08:50PM ET</span>",Jane Goodall urges U.S. Senate to halt quest for Arctic refuge oil,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - British primatologist Jane Goodall sent a letter to every U.S. senator on Tuesday urging them to oppose a push in the U.S. Congress to allow oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a region environmentalists say is one of the world's last paradises.
The Republican-led Senate is trying to open up the 1002 region on the coastal plain of the ANWR, a region inhabited by Gwich'in natives, caribou herds, polar bears and millions of birds that migrate to six of the world's seven continents.
""If we violate the Arctic Refuge by extracting the oil beneath the land, this will have devastating impact for the Gwich'in people for they depend on the caribou herds to sustain their traditional way of life,"" Goodall said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
The ANWR's ""very wildness speaks to our deeply rooted spiritual connection to nature, a necessary element of human psyche,"" wrote Goodall, best known for her study of chimpanzees in Tanzania.
Last week, a group of 37 U.S.-based scientists whose research focuses on Arctic wildlife asked senators to not open the ANWR, saying that drilling would be ""incompatible with the purposes for which the refuge was established.""
The Senate energy committee on Wednesday will consider a bill spurred by Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska and the head of the panel, to hold at least two lease sales in the ANWR over the next 10 years. 
Some Native Alaskans support drilling believing it will provide jobs. Matthew Rexford, a member of the Iñupiat tribe and the tribal administrator of the village of Kaktovik, has said he believes technological advances mean drilling can be performed with little impact to the land. 
The administration of President Donald Trump is pursuing a policy to make the country ""energy dominant"" by maximizing oil, gas and coal production. Republicans say the 1002 portion of the ANWR is a ""non wilderness area"" because the government put it aside decades ago for drilling.
Republicans have attached the ANWR measure to budget legislation, which needs only 50 votes to pass the Senate, but faces hurdles with many provisions being added to it. 
Democrats are fighting the ANWR bill saying that Republicans are trying to sneak it through the budget process, and that it would not survive as stand-alone legislation that would need 60 votes to pass.
Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the energy committee, told Reuters she was urging her fellow lawmakers to listen to scientists.

""Does it take the voice of Jane Goodall to beg Senators to stop hurting indigenous people and animals?"" asked Cantwell."" ""She's calling on them to set a conservation example instead of creating the next tragedy.""

China added 37 million barrels of oil to inventories in the first nine days of November, a rebound from September and October, when stockpiles fell by more than 120 million barrels, according to commodities intelligence firm Orbital Insight Inc. The drawdown coincided with China in October buying the least amount of foreign oil in a year, according to customs data.
Orbital’s analysis of China’s seasonal storage patterns is a rare look into one of the more hidden aspects of the oil market, as China doesn’t regularly report detailed inventory data. Instead Orbital uses satellite imagery to measure the levels of thousands of petroleum storage tanks throughout the country in order to assess inventory levels.
Such data can be vitally important to oil traders. For example, the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s weekly releases of storage and other petroleum data can set off large amounts of trading and sharp price moves.
From 2014 to 2016, China on average increased oil inventories by 22 million barrels from the beginning of November to the end of December, according to Orbital data. Renewed buying from China, which this year has surpassed the U.S. as the world’s largest oil importer, could be another tailwind for the resurgent crude market, which has seen prices rally by 40 percent since June.

Futures slipped as much as 1.2 percent in New York. Hopes that a potential extension of OPEC’s supply curbs will help support the market next year were tempered by a monthly report Tuesday from the International Energy Agency that said 2017 price gains along with milder-than-normal winter weather are slowing demand growth.
“If you put two and two together, it shows that we are going to be a little bit oversupplied in 1Q,” Michael Loewen, a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said by telephone referring to the IEA report. “Traders in the market are focusing on that right now. We rallied too far, too quick.”
Crude rallied above $57 a barrel in New York last week, largely due to tensions in the Middle East that increased the geopolitical risk premium and expectations that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will agree to an output-cut extension. That was before the IEA warned that the supply surge from U.S. shale oil and natural gas basins will beat the biggest gains seen in the history of the industry.
By 2025, the growth in American oil production will equal that achieved by Saudi Arabia at the height of its expansion, according to the agency.
“Some of the investors are getting a little bit skittish in terms of the impact on supply, particularly in North America, if we stay in this mid-$50 range,” Loewen said.
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery fell 49 cents to $56.27 a barrel at 9:44 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 15 percent below the 100-day average.

The IEA reduced its demand estimate for next year by 200,000 barrels a day to 98.9 million a day, according to projections in its report. Forecasts for demand growth next year also fell by 100,000 barrels a day to 1.3 million a day.

1232,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 14, 2017 10:02AM ET</span>",Buying Texas Oil at New Mexico Prices: Majors Go West for Shale,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil producers discouraged by the rising cost of accessing the vast deposits of the Permian Basin in Texas are sneaking into a geological back door, through neighboring New Mexico.
The state, which covers a smaller part of the oil-soaked shale formation, is the fourth-largest U.S. producer and luring industry giants including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM).,  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX), EOG Resources Inc (NYSE:EOG). and Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). Their investments -- while small compared with Texas -- are increasing as activity in the rest of the Permian starts to slow down.
In just the past five months, drilling on the New Mexico side of the Permian expanded 25 percent to 75 rigs, while Texas contracted by 2 percent to 490, according to data compiled by Drilling Info Inc., an Austin-Texas based industry consultant. At the same time, the pipeline network is being expanded, which could mean more sustained growth in development and production.
New Mexico “may well be the next wave,” said Haag Sherman, chief executive officer at Tectonic Holdings LLC, a Houston-based investment firm overseeing $3.2 billion for clients. “If Exxon’s looking at it, that’s probably a good sign.”
Earlier this year, Irving, Texas-based Exxon, the world’s largest energy company by market value, jumped into New Mexico with a $5.6 billion acquisition of assets from the Bass family. Exxon said the quarter-million acres it bought will provide 20 years of drilling prospects.
Oil and gas companies have invested about $13 billion in New Mexico over the past couple of years through mergers and acquisitions, according to Steve Vierck, who runs economic development efforts in Lea County, one of the places seeing the biggest increase in drilling activity. The state produced a near-record 462,000 barrels a day in August, twice what it was pumping six years earlier, Energy Information Administration data show.
""When we talk about the Permian, we tend to think of the Permian as West Texas,"" said Bernadette Johnson, vice president of market intelligence at Drilling Info. ""We do tend to ignore New Mexico.""
To understand how fracking works, watch this video.
Like Texas, North Dakota, Pennsylvania and a few other states, New Mexico is benefiting from the development of hydraulic-fracturing technology and horizontal drilling for energy deposits once considered too costly to produce at a profit. They’ve provided access to billions of barrels and set off a revival in U.S. output, which compounded a global glut and sent prices down from more than $100 a barrel in 2014 to less than $60 now.
U.S. production has almost doubled in the past decade, largely because of fracking and horizontal wells. Texas alone produces about 3.4 million barrels a day, up from about 1.1 million in 2009 and more than all but three of the 14-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
In the Permian, which is mostly in West Texas, the influx of energy companies has sparked bidding wars. Exploration rights in the basin that sold for $19,000 an acre on average in 2015 now fetch $30,000, according to data tracked by Drilling Info, even after a prolonged period of low crude prices. But in New Mexico, recent deals ranged from $18,000 to $24,000 an acre.
Still, there are six active drilling rigs in Texas for every one in New Mexico, according to Drilling Info. One reason the smaller state lags behind is a lack of pipelines and other oilfield infrastructure. But that’s beginning to change. Andeavor and Oryx Midstream Services II LLC are among the companies working on projects to expand New Mexico links with the rest of the Permian. Midland, Texas-based Oryx said construction of a 220-mile (354-kilometer) pipeline should be complete by the end of next year.
Once those networks are expanded, the infusion of cash will lead to an acceleration of drilling and production, Lea County’s Vierck said.
More Investment
The hottest areas of activity in the state are in the far southeast. In Lea County, which saw its first oil drilling in the late 1920s, the arrival of some of the world’s biggest producers has caught the attention of longtime locals.
“They’ve made it very clear this area is where they’re investing heavily and plan on doing it for a long time,"" said Sam Cobb, the 65-year-old mayor of Lea’s largest city, Hobbs.
Cobb, who also owns a food-processing company in town that makes products for Kraft Heinz Co., said he’s now competing with the oil industry for workers.
“But that’s good,"" the mayor said. “I’ll always take the challenges of a good economy versus one of not.""
Even the rivalry with economic-development counterparts in Texas is getting a boost after vaulting past Oklahoma for oil output in the state, Vierck said.
""New Mexico is not that well known for energy production,"" he said. ""We’re definitely an important part of the Permian.""

1233,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 14, 2017 10:01AM ET</span>",U.S. to Dominate Oil Markets After Biggest Boom in World History,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. will be a dominant force in global oil and gas markets for many years to come as the shale boom becomes the biggest supply surge in history, the International Energy Agency predicted.
By 2025, the growth in American oil production will equal that achieved by Saudi Arabia at the height of its expansion, and increases in natural gas will surpass those of the former Soviet Union, the agency said in its annual World Energy Outlook. The boom will turn the U.S., still among the biggest oil importers, into a net exporter of fossil fuels.
“The United States will be the undisputed leader of global oil and gas markets for decades to come,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg television. “There’s big growth coming from shale oil, and as such there’ll be a big difference between the U.S. and other producers.”
The agency raised estimates for the amount of shale oil that can be technically recovered by about 30 percent to 105 billion barrels. Forecasts for shale-oil output in 2025 were bolstered by 34 percent to 9 million barrels a day.
The U.S. industry “has emerged from its trial-by-fire as a leaner and hungrier version of its former self, remarkably resilient and reacting to any sign of higher prices caused by OPEC’s return to active market management,” the IEA said.
While oil prices have recovered to a two-year high above $60 a barrel, they’re still about half the level traded earlier this decade, as the global market struggles to absorb the scale of the U.S. bonanza. It’s taken the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia almost 11 months of production cuts to clear up some of the oversupply.
Price Cut
Reflecting the expected flood of supply, the agency cut its forecasts for oil prices to $83 a barrel for 2025 from $101 previously, and to $111 for 2040 from $125 before.
Lower prices are helping to support oil demand, and the IEA raised its projections for global consumption through to 2035, despite the growing popularity of electric vehicles. The world will use just over 100 million barrels of oil a day by 2025.
That will benefit the U.S. as it turns from imports to exports. The country will “see a reduction of these huge import needs,” Birol said at a press conference in London. That “will bring a lot of dollars to U.S. business.”
Nevertheless, U.S. shale output is expected to decline from the middle of the next decade, and with investment cuts taking their toll on other new supplies, the world will become increasingly reliant once again on OPEC, according to the report. The cartel, led by Middle East producers, will see its share of the market grow to 46 percent in 2040 from 43 percent now.
Yet that could still change, the IEA said.
As shale has outperformed expectations so far, the IEA added a scenario in which the industry beats current projections. If shale resources turn out to be double current estimates, and the use of electric vehicles erodes demand more than anticipated, prices could stay in a “lower-for-longer” range of $50 to $70 a barrel through to 2040.
“There could be further surprises ahead,” the IEA said.

1234,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2017 09:47AM ET</span>",Oil seen as real prize of Iran's Kurdish adventure,"By Ahmed Rasheed, Dmitry Zhdannikov and Bozorgmehr Sharafedin
BAGHDAD/LONDON (Reuters) - After helping Iraq stifle a Kurdish push for independence, Iran is now positioning itself to take control of oil exports from the region's giant Kirkuk field, with the first deliveries expected within days, officials and trading sources said.
In the weeks since September's failed Kurdish independence referendum, Iraq has agreed for the first time to divert crude from Kirkuk province, which it retook from the Kurds, to Iran, where it will supply a refinery in the city of Kermanshah.
Iran is locked in a proxy war with its regional rival and U.S. ally, Saudi Arabia. As well as Iraq, it has been extending its influence in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, raising increasing concerns in Washington and Riyadh.
Under the new arrangement, the first oil will be trucked across the border in the coming days. Initially Iran will receive 15,000 barrels per day worth nearly $1 million, rising gradually to 60,000 bpd, according to Iraqi officials and trading sources.
Baghdad and Tehran have also revived a project to build a pipeline to carry oil from Iraq's Kirkuk fields to central Iran and onwards for export from the Gulf.
Hamid Hosseini, the Iranian secretary-general of the Iran-Iraq Chamber of Commerce, said Iran want to build a pipeline that can take as much as 650,000 bpd of Kurdish oil for its domestic refineries and for exports.
The pipeline would replace existing export routes for crude from northern Iraq via Turkey and the Mediterranean and would be a blow to Ankara's hopes of becoming an energy hub for Europe.
It would also be evidence of a U.S. failure to prevent a rapprochement between its ally Iraq and one of its biggest political foes, Iran, which is rapidly regaining influence in the Middle East.
That is in part due to general Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds force, the international branch of the Revolutionary Guards, which is also taking a keen interest in Iran's oil business in Iraq.
Soleimani visited Iraqi Kurdistan in September to warn the region against holding an independence vote. He was also involved in the Iraqi army's recapture of Kirkuk.
""In Iraq, Iranian forces are working to sow discord as we recently saw in Kirkuk, where the presence of Quds force commander, Qassem Soleimani, exacerbated tensions among the Kurds and the government in Baghdad,"" U.S. Senator John McCain said in Washington last week.
KURDISH DIVISION
""The Kurdish dream of being a big oil exporter is in tatters,"" said a source close to the government in Erbil, who predicted that ""Iran will be king of the game"".
The Kurds' bid for independence angered Turkey and Iran, which both have large Kurdish populations and condemned the referendum as destabilizing the region. The United States also called on Kurdistan to scrap the vote. 
But it was probably internal Kurdish divisions which doomed the referendum to failure, local political sources believe. Oil was at the heart of this dispute.
The Kirkuk fields were controlled by Iraq's state oil firm SOMO before being taken over by Kurdish forces in 2014, when the Iraqi army retreated in the face of attacks by Islamic state.
The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan party (PUK), in Sulaimaniya, then accused the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) party of then President Massoud Barzani, based in the capital Erbil, of not sharing the oil wealth. The PUK wanted to export oil from Kirkuk to Iran.
""We tried to make Barzani accept joint management between Erbil and Sulaimaniya over the fields but he strongly opposed it,"" said Sherzad Yaba, a political adviser close to the PUK.
""To put an end to the illegitimate control of the KDP over Kirkuk oil, senior members from the PUK contacted both Baghdad and Tehran and encouraged the Iranians to build a pipeline to export Kirkuk crude through Bandar Abbas port,"" said Yaba.
The project lay dormant even though Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi and his Iranian counterpart Bijal Zanganeh signed a memorandum on the project in February. 
After the referendum, the KDP accused the PUK of striking a deal with Iran to withdraw from Kirkuk, which the PUK denies.
The recapture of Kirkuk was coordinated with Soleimani and left Iraqi government troops in control of half of all Kurdish oil output.
As Kurdish engineers fled the fields, output from Kirkuk was suspended and has remained shut for the past five weeks as Baghdad and Erbil argue over the revenue split.
With output of over 300,000 bpd suspended since mid-October, losses are approaching $1 billion, according to Kurdish industry sources.
To stop the losses, Iraq and the PUK resumed talks with Iran, according to Iraqi and Kurdish officials.
Officials from Iraq's and Iran's state oil firms, SOMO and NICO, met last month to iron out details of oil sales to the Kermanshah refinery, the acting chief of SOMO, Alaa al-Yasiri, said.
He also said active discussions were taking place about the pipeline project.
THE GUARDS RISING
Even though discussions between Baghdad and Tehran have been conducted between oil ministry officials and the Chamber of Commerce, the Revolutionary Guards are poised to step in.
""Any oil transaction between Iran and Iraq should be approved by the Revolutionary Guards, not the oil ministry."" said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in the energy equipment business in the Middle East.
Those dealings are overseen by the desk responsible for Iran's investments in Iraq at the president’s office and are run by the Revolutionary Guards.

The pipeline project will be the Revolutionary Guards' reward to the Kurds for helping with the recapture of Kirkuk, said Tabatabaei.

Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (2130GMT), amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 2.8 million barrels.
Market sentiment was dampened after the International Energy Agency cut its global oil-demand forecasts, in contrast to a more bullish outlook from OPEC released a day earlier.
In a monthly report, the Paris-based agency cut its oil demand forecast by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) for this year and next, to an estimated 1.5 million bpd in 2017 and 1.3 million bpd in 2018.
The IEA said warmer temperatures could cut consumption, while sharply rising production from outside OPEC might mean the global market tilts back into surplus in the first half of 2018.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 24 cents, or about 0.4%, to $56.52 a barrel by 8:40AM ET (1340GMT). It reached its best level since July 2015 at $57.92 last week.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., dipped 35 cents, or around 0.6%, to $62.81 a barrel. The global benchmark rallied to $64.65 last Wednesday, a level not seen since June 2015, but traders said the market had lost some momentum since then.
Oil prices finished mixed on Monday as the prospect of further rises in U.S. output undermined ongoing OPEC-led production cuts aimed at tightening the market.
Despite the cautious sentiment, crude prices stayed within sight of their strongest level in more than two years amid optimism that oil producing countries will agree to extend an output cut at their meeting at the end of this month.
Discussions are continuing in the run-up to the Nov. 30 meeting, which oil ministers from OPEC and the participating non-OPEC countries will attend.

U.S. natural gas futures slumped 6.0 cents, or around 2%, to hit $3.106 per million British thermal units by 8:10AM ET (1310GMT), after touching its worst level since Nov. 7 at $3.089 earlier.
Futures lost 4.6 cents, or 1.4%, on Monday, as traders reacted to forecasts showing a return to mild weather across most parts of the U.S. following a cold spell in the eastern part of the country.
The central and southern U.S. will be mild to warm with highs reaching the comfortable upper 60s to 80s through Nov. 23.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 3 and 15 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Nov 10.
That compares with a gain of 15 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 30 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 12 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.790 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 219 bcf, or around 5.5%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 71 bcf, or roughly 1.8%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf."

LONDON (Reuters) - Global oil demand growth looks likely to increase more slowly over the coming months, as warmer temperatures cut consumption, which may tilt the market back into surplus in the first half of next year, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday.
In its monthly oil market report, the Paris-based IEA cut its oil demand forecast by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) for this year and next, to an estimated 1.5 million bpd in 2017 and 1.3 million bpd in 2018.
Geopolitical tension in the Middle East and intermittent supply outages in the likes of Nigeria and Iraq have pushed oil above $60 a barrel for the first time since 2015, while global inventories have fallen, prompting many market watchers to raise their price forecasts.
""Does it mean the market has found a 'new normal' where the accepted floor might have moved from $50/bbl to $60/bbl? This might be a tempting view, assuming supply disturbances will continue and tensions in the Middle East will not ease,"" the IEA said.
""However, if these problems do prove to be temporary, a fresh look at the fundamentals confirms the view we expressed last month that the market balance in 2018 does not look as tight as some would like, and there is not in fact a 'new normal'."" 
The IEA noted that output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was down by 830,000 bpd year-on-year in October, although demand for the group's crude is expected to fall to 32.6 million bpd in the fourth quarter of this year and to 32.0 million bpd in the first quarter of 2018.
Compliance by the group with its joint 1.8-million-bpd output cut with 10 partners was 96 percent in October, the highest since the supply-reduction deal took effect in January.
The biggest threat to market balances, aside from a tempering in demand, is the growth in supply from non-OPEC nations.
""Even after some modest reductions to growth, non-OPEC production will follow this year’s 700,000-bpd growth with 1.4 million bpd of additional production in 2018 and next year’s demand growth will struggle to match this,"" the IEA said.
""This is why, absent any geopolitical premium, we may not have seen a 'new normal' for oil prices."" 
Oil inventories in the world's richest nations fell by 40 million barrels in September, breaking below 3.0 billion barrels for the first time in two years, driven in part by Hurricane Harvey, which shuttered much U.S. refining capacity in August.
""Using a scenario whereby current levels of OPEC production are maintained, the oil market faces a difficult challenge in 1Q18 with supply expected to exceed demand by 600,000 bpd followed by another, smaller, surplus of 200,000 bpd in 2Q18,"" the agency said. 
Global oil demand growth is likely to have slowed to 1.3 million bpd in the third quarter of this year, in part because of the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma in August and September on U.S. consumption.

Growth is expected to accelerate to 1.4 million bpd in the last three months of this year, even though mild temperatures and rising prices will restrain demand, the IEA said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices held largely steady on Tuesday as the prospect of further rises in U.S. output offset some of the optimism that OPEC-led production cuts would tighten the balance between crude supply and demand.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $63.11 per barrel at 0942 GMT, down 5 cents, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) was down 13 cents at $56.63.
Both benchmarks early in the previous week hit highs last seen in 2015, but traders said the market had lost some momentum since then.
Traders said they were cautious about betting on further price rises.
""Prices ... are starting to look like a pause or pullback is needed,"" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.
This sentiment comes in part on the back of rising U.S. oil output , which has grown by more than 14 percent since mid-2016 to a record 9.62 million barrels per day (bpd).
The U.S. government said on Monday U.S. shale production in December would rise for a 12th consecutive month, increasing by 80,000 bpd.
A cooling Chinese economy also stoked some concerns about demand, although so far the country's refiners are processing crude oil near record levels of 11.89 million bpd.
Fitch Ratings said in its 2018 oil outlook that it assumed 2018 ""average oil prices will be broadly unchanged year-on-year and that the recent price recovery with Brent exceeding $60 per barrel may not be sustained"".
So far in 2017, Brent has averaged $54.5 per barrel.
Despite the cautious sentiment, traders said oil prices were unlikely to fall far, largely due to supply restrictions led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, which have helped reduce excess stockpiles.
The International Energy Agency on Tuesday delivered a more cautious outlook for oil demand.
In a monthly report, the Paris-based agency cut its oil demand forecast by 100,000 bpd for this year and next, to an estimated 1.5 million bpd in 2017 and 1.3 million bpd in 2018.
The IEA said warmer temperatures could cut consumption, while sharply rising production from outside OPEC might mean the global market tilts back into surplus in the first half of 2018. 

""You cannot have the same forecast at $60 as you have at $40. You need to address that and the IEA is starting to make that adjustment,"" Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said.

Oil's rally, which began in early October, has been largely driven by growing indications that the crude market was finally starting to rebalance. Brent is over 40% above June's 2017 lows, while WTI is one-third higher than its 2017 lows.

""(The market) will be pushed out once it has received approval,"" it quoted Xie as saying on the sidelines of the latest round of climate negotiations in the German city of Bonn.
China, the world's biggest source of climate-warming greenhouse gases, originally planned to launch a nationwide emission trading scheme (ETS) in 2016 after a first phase of trading on seven local pilot projects.
But as part of pledges made ahead of climate negotiations in Paris in 2015, it pledged to launch the nationwide ETS in 2017.
By the end of September, an accumulated total of 197 million tonnes of carbon dioxide has been traded in the pilot cities with a total value of 4.5 billion yuan ($677.45 million).
Once launched, China's ETS is expected to become the world's biggest, overtaking the European Union's.
However, government officials and researchers have warned that the scheme is still facing problems and needs further improvements due to unreliable data and other regulatory problems.
A deputy director at a government think tank told reporters last week in a presser that he didn't expect the trading market to be in full swing until early next year.
The country also vowed to raise the share of non-fossil fuels to 20 percent of its total energy mix by 2020 and bring carbon emissions to a peak by around 2030. 
""It is very likely for China to cap carbon emissions by around 2030,"" said Xie, adding that China has identified 87 pilot cities across the country to explore ways to cut emissions.
Despite Beijing's efforts to boost renewable energy consumption, coal-fired power remains the major source of electricity in the country, accounting for 65.2 percent of total power generation in 2016.
Last month, thermal power generation in China fell 2.8 percent from a year earlier, while power generated from hydro and solar rose 16.9 percent and 35.7 percent respectively.
Coal-fired power capacity across the country is expected to be capped at 1,100 gigawatts by 2020, the National Energy Administration said on Monday.

(Reuters) - Global vehicle sales will decline over the next two decades as consumers embrace on-demand ride services like Uber, but demand for oil will keep rising, according to a study released Tuesday.
Another counterintuitive finding from the study by IHS Markit was that more than 80 percent of the vehicles sold worldwide in 2040 will still use some form of petroleum-fueled combustion engine.
Annual vehicle sales in the United States, Europe, China and India will decline over the next 23 years to 54 million in 2040, as total miles traveled rises 65 percent to around 11 billion miles a year, the study projected. About 80 million vehicles a year are sold currently in those regions.
Although there will be fewer cars sold, demand for petroleum, especially for non-transportation uses, is expected to rise, from the current 98 million barrels a day to 115 million barrels a day in 2040.
According to IHS Markit, which provides economic forecasts and data to the global energy and automotive markets, battery-powered all-electric vehicles will account for about 19 percent of sales by 2040. This compares with an estimated 14 percent of production by 2030 in a forecast by Boston Consulting Group on Nov. 2.
IHS Markit forecast that plug-in hybrid electric vehicles - those with electric motors and combustion engines - will account for another 14 percent of sales in 2040.
""Consumers are starting to embrace"" the advanced technologies in electric and self-driving vehicles, Tom De Vleesschauwer, IHS Markit's transport and mobility practice leader, said in an interview.
While the adoption of electric vehicles is being driven in part by technology advances and government policy, ""the part that's most consumer-driven is ride hailing,"" the on-demand service offered by such startups as Uber Technologies and China's Didi Chuxing, according to Daniel Yergin, IHS Markit vice chairman.
He said the firm was ""surprised when we saw (oil) demand increasing rather than going down.” Yergin noted that cars only account for a third of oil demand.

The study's authors expect 43 million barrels a day of new oil production will need to be brought into development by 2040 as demand rises and existing fields decline naturally.

1247,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 13, 2017 09:31PM ET</span>",China Is Over Coal and Bored With Oil as It Charts Green Future,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s worst polluter is leading the clean energy revolution, according to the International Energy Agency.
China will account for a third of new wind and solar power installations and 40 percent of electric vehicle investments through 2040, the Paris-based agency said Tuesday in its World Energy Outlook. Meanwhile, the country’s coal use peaked four years ago and it will cede its role as the driver of global oil demand to India after 2025.
Underscoring the shift is a maturing economy that is moving away from energy-intensive industry and government policies aimed at cleaning up air pollution that causes almost 2 million premature deaths a year, the agency said in the report. Falling costs of renewables also play a role, as solar is expected to become China’s cheapest source of new electricity additions, surpassing natural gas by 2020 and coal by 2030.
“China is entering a new phase in its development, with the emphasis in energy policy now firmly on electricity, natural gas and cleaner, high-efficiency and digital technologies,” the report said. “China’s choices will play a huge role in determining global trends, and could spark a faster clean energy transition.”
Until recently, China’s export-oriented economy demanded a coal- and oil-intense economy that over the past 15 years helped bring modern fuels to 260 million people who had been relying on burning wood and other biofuels for heat and cooking. That economic development brought with it a legacy of environmental issues, as only 2 percent of China’s population breathes air that meets World Health Organization particulate guidelines.
New government policies aiming to reverse poor air quality are proving to be a boon for natural gas, the most benign of fossil fuels, and renewables. Natural gas use, which was about 210 billion cubic meters last year, is projected to grow by 400 billion by 2040. China’s imports will be second to only the European Union, making it a lynchpin of global trade.
China is already a leader in renewables, ranked first in the world by installed capacity of wind, solar and hydropower. Half of all additions to its electricity generating capacity since 2013 have been renewables or nuclear. By 2040, the IEA sees renewables accounting for 40 percent of total power generation. Coal, which contributes about 67 percent of generation now, will fall to 40 percent over that period.
“The power supply in China undergoes a transformation, with renewables accounting for over three-quarters of all capacity additions to 2040,” the agency said. “Wind and solar PV lead the way, making up about two-thirds of total additions combined.”

Crude oil prices traded in a narrow range on Monday as investors weighed the prospect of supply disruption in the Middle East supporting a further rally in crude prices against expectations that U.S. producers will ramp up output.
Middle East tensions grew over the weekend, fueling expectations of supply disruptions in the region after Bahrain said Iran was behind an explosion to its main oil pipeline. Supply was restored, however, as Saudi Aramco said Monday that it fully resumed pumping crude oil to Bahrain.
Despite expectations for uptick in U.S. output, traders remained confident that Opec's output curbs would continue to support upside momentum in crude prices ahead of the upcoming Nov, 30 Opec meeting, at which it’s widely expected that Opec will extend its global accord on production cuts beyond March.

Investors already are assuming OPEC and its allied producers will agree at the end of this month to extend the limits well beyond their March expiration, Morse said at a gathering of energy economists in Houston on Monday.
Morse characterized the historic 2016 rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Russia that helped lead to the output limits as a “bromance,” and said anything short of a decisive step moving forward will disappoint traders and trigger a massive unwinding of long positions in the futures market.
That includes adopting half-measures, such as extending the deal by just a few months or delaying a decision until next year, according to Morse. For traders, “it’s logical to do the extension,” he said. “Otherwise, it’ll trigger a selloff.”
Morse’s remarks came just hours after OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo gave assurances in Abu Dhabi that the worldwide oil market is re-balancing at a quickening pace and production cuts are the “only viable option” to restore stability. 
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries should decide at its meeting later this month whether or not to extend the cuts, United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail Al Mazrouei said in a speech at a conference in Abu Dhabi. Neighboring Oman backs prolonging the output limits beyond March and sees producers extending them until the end of 2018, Oil Minister Mohammed Hamad Al Rumhy told reporters.
OPEC raised estimates for the amount of crude it will need to pump to meet demand next year by 400,000 barrels a day to 33.4 million a day, according to a monthly report Monday from the group. As that’s about 670,000 a day more than OPEC produced in the third quarter, global inventories would diminish further in 2018 if the group and its allies continue to keep supplies restrained. Stockpiles have declined by more than 180 million barrels this year alone, Barkindo said.
Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iraq have already signaled they would be open to extending the curbs.
Stability ‘Returning’
Brent has gained 11 percent this year and the benchmark grade touched $64.65 a barrel in London on Nov. 7, the highest intraday price since June 2015.
“We are seeing clear indications that the market is re-balancing at an accelerating pace and stability is steadily returning,” Barkindo said. “I am certain that if we had not mobilized ourselves when we did, building consensus and jointly taking action in responding to the crisis, the industry would be in worse condition than it is today.”
The U.A.E.’s Mazrouei affirmed that view, saying that coordinated cuts by OPEC and suppliers outside the group have helped trim crude inventories from record storage levels. The U.A.E., OPEC’s fourth-largest producer, sees no need for the organization to hold an extraordinary meeting in the first quarter of next year, he said.
“I am optimistic about the whole of 2018,” which will be a “recovery year” for oil markets, he said in a speech at the Abu Dhabi conference. U.S. shale output, a contributor to the global glut, has responded more slowly than expected to the recent increase in crude prices, he later told reporters.
Oman, a member of the producer committee monitoring the cuts, added its support to prolonging them until the end of 2018. The largest Arab oil producer outside of OPEC expects crude to stay above $60 a barrel and sees stable prices next year, Al Rumhy said in an interview.

Despite expectations for uptick in U.S. output, traders remained confident that Opec's output curbs would continue to support upside momentum in crude prices ahead of the upcoming Nov, 30 Opec meeting, at which it’s widely expected that Opec will extend its global accord on production cuts beyond March.
In May, Opec producers agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.2 million bpd agreed in November last year."

Futures in New York rose as much as 0.7 percent at one point, breaching $57 a barrel. They then fell 0.8 percent, before settling in at a mid level between the two that left prices little changed. OPEC raised its estimates for the amount it will need to pump to meet demand next year by 400,000 barrels a day to 33.4 million a day, according to a monthly report from the group. 
""With OPEC raising estimates, there’s an expectation that the market’s a lot tighter,"" said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group Inc. in Chicago, in a telephone interview. ""We’ve gone from mentality of glut, glut, glut, to more rebalancing.""
Oil has climbed about 20 percent since the start of September as global supplies tighten and speculation mounts that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will extend output curbs past the end of March. In Abu Dhabi on Monday, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo described the production curbs as the “only viable option” to rebalance a global market still contending with excess supply.
Prices have also been boosted by internal upheaval in Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest member, and escalating tensions with its rival and fellow producer Iran. An oil pipeline between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain halted briefly over the weekend following an attack.
""Without this fervor being continually fanned, prices are vulnerable to falling back,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund, by telephone.
At the same time, crude stockpiles at the storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma fell 1.9 million barrels to 64.6 million in the week ended Nov. 10, Genscape said, according to people familiar with the report. The dip comes after the Energy Information Administration reported supplies in the previous week were at the highest seasonal level going back to 2004.
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery traded 8 cents higher at $56.82 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:08 p.m. local time. Total volume traded was about 1 percent above the 100-day average. Prices capped a fifth weekly gain last week, the longest run since October 2016.

Brent for January settlement fell 26 cents to $63.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, after rising 2.3 percent last week. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $6.23 to January Crude Oil WTI Futures.
OPEC raised estimates for the amount of crude it will need to pump next year by 400,000 barrels a day to 33.4 million a day, according to a monthly report from the group.
Saudi Arabia said it will boost security at its oil facilities after Bahrain blamed Iran for a fire at a pipeline that connects the two Arab allies. Iran denied that it was involved. The pipeline resumed pumping later in the day after a brief halt.
The pipeline attack “is a dangerous Iranian escalation that aims to scare citizens and hurt the global oil industry,” Bahrain’s Foreign Minister Khalid Al-Khalifa said on Twitter. Iran responded by saying the Bahrainis “need to know that the era for lies and childish finger-pointing is over,” the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday, citing a foreign ministry spokesman.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $5.18, or 0.41%, to $1279.37 a troy ounce.
The House of Representatives is expected to vote this week on a major tax reform bill amid uncertainty over the outcome of the bill after the head of the House of Represents’ tax-writing committee said on Sunday he would not accept elimination of a federal deduction for state and local taxes.
With a 52-seat Senate majority, Republicans can only afford to lose two GOP senators – as Democrats are widely expected to vote no – , but Vice President Pence would have to break a tie.
Uncertainty over the progress of the Republican tax plan has weighed on the dollar, helping gold prices snap its three-week losing streak on Friday but traders expect the precious metal to make its next significant move higher or lower when the Fed members meet in December.
""I think some movement will come closer to the next Federal Reserve meeting in December,"" Capital Economics analyst Simona Gambarini said. ""Most markets expect a rate hike ... that could be what prompts [gold] prices higher or lower, depending on what happens.""
Also lifting sentiment on safe-haven demand were reports that British Prime Minister Theresa's Conservative party had agreed to sign a letter of no-confidence in her as some members doubted Mrs. May ability to lead the UK into a successful Brexit.
Rising UK political uncertainty pressured sterling to one-week lows and supported a move higher in the dollar, capping gains in the gold futures.
Gold prices are sensitive to moves higher in the U.S. dollar – A higher dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, thus, reduces demand.

1255,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2017 10:08AM ET</span>",OPEC points to larger 2018 oil supply deficit as market tightens,"By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC raised its forecast on Monday for demand for its oil in 2018 and said its deal with other producers to cut output was reducing excess oil in storage, potentially pushing the global market into a larger deficit next year.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also said in a monthly report it had cut its estimate of 2018 supply from non-OPEC producers and said oil use would grow faster than previously thought due to a stronger-than-expected world economy.
""The global economic growth dynamic has continued its broad-based and relatively strong momentum,"" OPEC said. ""The ongoing momentum could still provide some slight upside potential.""
OPEC said the world would need 33.42 million barrels per day (bpd) of OPEC crude next year, up 360,000 bpd from its previous forecast and marking the fourth consecutive monthly increase in the projection from its first estimate made in July.
The report is OPEC's last before a Nov. 30 meeting in which the group and its allies are expected to extend their supply-cutting deal further into next year. The projections pointing to a growing 2018 supply deficit could influence debate on how long to maintain the curbs.
Oil prices, which are close to their highest since 2015, rose further towards $64 a barrel after the report was issued. Crude is still about half its level of mid-2014, when a build-up of excess supply led to a price collapse.
The 14-country producer group said its oil output in October, as assessed by secondary sources, was below the 2018 demand forecast at 32.59 million bpd, a drop of about 150,000 bpd from September.
The report's OPEC production figures mean compliance with the supply cut by the 11 members with output targets has risen above 100 percent from 98 percent initially reported in September, according to a Reuters calculation.
""The high conformity levels of participating OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries ... have clearly played a key role in supporting stability in the oil market and placing it on a more sustainable path,"" the report said.
In a further sign supply excess is easing, OPEC said inventories in developed economies declined by 23.6 million barrels in September to 2.985 billion barrels, 154 million barrels above the five-year average.
""The excess overhang has fallen considerably,"" said OPEC, which aims to reduce stocks to the five-year average through the supply-curbing deal.
DEMAND BOOST 
Stronger demand has given tailwind to the supply cut, in which OPEC plus Russia and nine other non-OPEC producers are reducing output by about 1.8 million bpd until March 2018.
OPEC now expects oil demand to rise by 1.51 million bpd next year, up 130,000 bpd from previously, to 98.45 million bpd. World economic growth is seen accelerating to 3.7 percent, up from 3.5 percent in the previous forecast.
And in another forecast moving in OPEC's favor, the report lowered its estimate of supply growth from non-OPEC countries next year. It now sees a rise of 870,000 bpd, down 70,000 bpd from the previous forecast. OPEC cited downward adjustments to Mexico and Norway for the revision.
OPEC and its allies are discussing extending their supply pact for as long as nine months, officials have said ahead of the Nov. 30 meeting in Vienna.
Doing so could lead to a sizeable supply shortfall next year. Should OPEC keep pumping at October's level and other things remain equal, the market could move into a deficit of about 830,000 bpd next year, the report indicates.

Last month's report pointed to a smaller deficit of about 310,000 bpd.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude December contract was up 6 cents or about 0.11% at $56.81 a barrel by 09:50 a.m. ET (13:50 GMT), still within close distance of the previous week's two-year peak of $57.92.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for January delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was down 17 cents or about 0.22% at $63.35 a barrel, not far from last Wednesday's two-year high of $64.64.
Prices came under pressure after oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by nine to 738 last week. It was the biggest jump since June, sparking concern that U.S. shale producers will ramp up output with prices holding near 28-month highs.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for domestic oil production.
But the commodity remained supported by potential supply disruptions in the Middle East amid escalating tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Saudi Arabia is among the world’s top producers of oil and OPEC’s most influential member.
Oil prices are also still supported by optimism that oil producing countries will agree to extend an output cut at their meeting at the end of this month.
Under the original terms of the deal, OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine more months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Discussions are continuing in the run-up to the Nov. 30 meeting, which oil ministers from OPEC and the participating non-OPEC countries will attend.

U.S. natural gas futures declined 4.5 cents, or around 1.4%, to $3.168 per million British thermal units by 9:15AM ET (1410GMT). It reached its best level since May 30 at $3.224 in the last session.
Futures rose around 7.7% last week, its second-straight weekly advance, amid forecasts for more heating demand.
Natural gas prices typically rise ahead of the winter as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 3 and 15 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Nov 10.
That compares with a gain of 15 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 30 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 12 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.790 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 219 bcf, or around 5.5%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 71 bcf, or roughly 1.8%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers are moving toward deciding at their Nov. 30 meeting whether to extend a global agreement to curb oil supply further into 2018, two ministers said on Monday, a quicker time frame than previously indicated. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, are cutting output by about 1.8 million barrels per day until March in an attempt to eradicate a glut, and are considering extending the deal for longer.
Reuters reported last month, citing OPEC sources, that producers were leaning towards prolonging the agreement until the end of 2018, though the decision could be postponed until early next year depending on the market.
But United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui said on Monday he saw no need for the decision to be delayed beyond the Nov. 30 meeting in Vienna. His Omani counterpart voiced confidence there would be an agreement this month.
""I don't see the need to delay the decision until March ... We are not going to meet in that quarter unless it is extraordinary,"" Mazroui said at an energy industry conference.
If there is a decision to extend the supply cut it will be until the end of 2018, said the Omani oil minister, Mohammed bin Hamad al-Rumhi, adding that he did not think producers would agree to deepen the curbs. 
Mazroui, whose country next year holds the rotating OPEC presidency, said that while the UAE backed an extension, he could not say yet whether it would support maintaining the supply cut until the end of 2018.
In its November oil market report, OPEC increased the forecast for 2018 demand for its crude by 360,000 bpd from last month's report to 33.42 million bpd. 
It also said industrialized countries' September commercial oil inventories, a key marker OPEC uses to measure market balance, fall by 23.6 million barrels to 2.985 billion barrels. 
Stocks were 154 million barrels above the five-year average, the excess that OPEC aims to eliminate. 

OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo, speaking at the same event, said participants in the deal are committed to achieving market stability.

1263,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2017 01:16AM ET</span>","A year after Trump's election, coal's future remains bleak","By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A year after Donald Trump was elected president on a promise to revive the ailing U.S. coal industry, the sector’s long-term prospects for growth and hiring remain as bleak as ever.
A Reuters review of mining data shows an industry that has seen only modest gains in jobs and production this year - much of it from a temporary uptick in foreign demand for U.S. coal rather than presidential policy changes.
U.S. utilities are shutting coal-fired power plants at a rapid pace and shifting to cheap natural gas, along with wind and solar power. And domestic demand makes up about 90 percent of the market for U.S. coal.
""We're not planning to build any additional coal facilities,"" said Melissa McHenry, a spokeswoman for American Electric Power, one of the largest U.S. utilities. “The future for coal is dictated by economics … and you can’t make those kinds of investments based on one administration’s politics."" 
Coal plants now make up 47 percent of AEP’s capacity for power generation, a figure it plans to shrink to 33 percent by 2030.
(For a graphic on coal production, demand and employment, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2zKY1tQ)
The situation highlights the limitations of presidential policy on major industries and global economic trends. As some energy experts have said all along, the forces that will make or break mining are well beyond the powers of the Oval Office.
A White House official did not respond to a request for comment.
Trump has likely done all he can do to help the industry, said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, which represents major U.S. coal companies. 
“The government is no longer against us,"" he said. ""We now only have market forces to contend with.”
Trump has taken action on many promises he made to coal interests in states that helped him win the election.
The president started the process of killing former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, meant to reduce carbon emissions from power plants; ended an Obama-era moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands; ditched limits on dumping coal waste into streams; and started withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.
Now Trump’s Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, is attempting to push a rule through the independent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that would subsidize power plants that store at least a 90-day supply of coal on site. The goal is to extend the life of some coal burning power plants, a move Perry says will make the electric grid more reliable.
While the full impact of Trump's coal policy could take years to understand, the changes so far are unlikely to boost domestic demand, energy analysts and utility officials said.
“BACK 100 PERCENT”
Trump has cast the coal industry as a victim of burdensome regulation.
The industry has lost more than 40 percent of its work force in less than a decade and seen production drop to its lowest levels since 1978. Its share of the power market has fallen to less than a third from about half in 2003.
“We’re going to bring the coal industry back 100 percent,"" Trump said at a rally in Virginia in August of 2016.
So far, progress has been limited.
U.S. coal production is on track to rise more than 8 percent in 2017 over the previous year, to 790 million tons, according to the Energy Information Administration. But 2018 output is expected to decline.
The number of coal miners has also risen slightly to 51,900 in October, up about 2,200 since November 2016 - but down about 70 percent from a 1985 peak, according to the Labor Department.
On November 1, Trump cited the modest production increases in a Tweet, saying, “It is finally happening for our great clean coal miners!""
But these increases are largely attributable to demand for U.S. coal from Asian steel mills after temporary outages from their usual suppliers in Australia, according to James Stevenson, a coal analyst at IHS Markit.
During the first six months of 2017, Asian countries took in 7.5 million short tons of U.S. coal, up 97 percent over the same period in 2016, according to the EIA.
That demand will soon fade, Stevenson said.
“We are not going to get a repeat of 2017,” he said of the spike in exports.
“OBSOLETE”
Forecasts from utilities and the U.S. government reveal little reason for hope of a sustained coal rebound.
Utilities are expected to shut down more than 13,600 megawatts of coal plant capacity in 2018. That follows a loss of nearly 8,000 MW this year and 13,000 MW in 2016, according to EIA and Thomson Reuters data. 
By 2025, coal-fired power plant capacity will dip to 226,380 MW, down about 30 percent from 2011, according to EIA.
Three Texas coal plants owned by Vistra Energy Corp subsidiary Luminant are among the latest to close, bringing the number of plants that shut, or plan to, to 265 since 2010 - a figure higher than the 258 plants that remain, according to the Sierra Club, which has campaigned against coal.
Vistra said the closures were forced by lower prices for natural gas and renewable power - and not by environmental regulations.
 Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK), one of the country's largest utilities, has shut down more than 5,400 MW of coal capacity since 2011 and plans to shed another 2,000 MW by 2024.
Over the next decade, Duke plans to invest $11 billion in new natural gas and renewable power - and nothing in new coal-fired generation, said spokesman Rick Rhodes.
A Nov. 2 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis - which has two of the largest coal producers in its district, Peabody Energy Corp and Arch Coal Inc - said coal-fired power plants “may eventually become obsolete.”
Coal companies believe they can survive despite the troubling market outlook.
Peabody expects a “modest number"" of coal power plant retirements in the coming years, with some of that lost capacity shifting to remaining plants that will increase output, spokesman Vic Svec said. Arch spokeswoman Logan Bonacorsi offered a similar forecast. 
Robert Murray, the chief executive of privately-held Murray Energy Corp - one of America’s biggest underground miners - said Trump could do more for the industry. The administration, Murray said, should end tax breaks for wind and solar power and reverse an EPA finding that carbon emissions endanger human health.
But Trump’s tax bill last week preserved most solar incentives, which have bi-partisan backing. And the EPA has so far steered clear of the so-called “endangerment finding” on emissions that is the basis of many fossil-fuel regulations, given the breadth of scientific evidence that would be needed to reverse it.
Murray Energy, meanwhile, announced on Oct. 31 it will buy a 30.5 percent stake in a coal-mining partnership in Utah called Canyon Consolidated Resources, LLC.
The deal might help the companies cut costs, but it's unlikely to help workers: Murray said about 200 of 1,000 jobs in Utah could be lost.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.13% to 94.30 in late trade. For the week, the index was down 0.61%, snapping three straight weeks of gains.
A stronger dollar tends to weigh on gold, which is priced in the U.S. currency and becomes less affordable to foreign buyers when the dollar appreciates.
Senate Republicans unveiled a tax plan on Thursday that differed from the one crafted by House Republicans, highlighting the challenges to reconciling the differences between the two plans with just a short time before the year-end deadline they have set to pass it.
Hopes of tax reform have helped boost the dollar since mid-September. Some traders believe tax reforms could bolster growth, adding pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, known as the ""Trumpflation"" trade.
Elsewhere in precious metals trading, silver was down 0.57% at $16.87 a troy ounce late Friday, while platinum settled at $913.15, down 1.0% for the day.
Among base metals, copper was down 0.39% at $3.074 in late trade as lackluster Chinese demand data and increasing copper stockpiles stored in metal warehouses weighed.
In the week ahead, inflation readings will matter most for global financial markets, with the U.S., UK, euro zone and Canada all set to release CPI data.
Investors will also be focusing on the Central Bank Communications Conference hosted by the ECB, with a panel discussion including the heads of the European, U.S., British and Japanese central banks in the spotlight.

1265,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 12, 2017 02:43PM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices - Weekly Outlook: November 13 - 17,"Investing.com - Oil prices settled a bit lower on Friday, with a recent rally finally showing signs of slowing after closely-watched data showed an uptick in U.S. drilling activity.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by nine to 738 last week, underlining worries that U.S. producers will ramp up output with prices holding near 28-month highs.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for domestic oil production.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 43 cents, or around 0.8%, to end at $56.74 a barrel by close of trade. It reached its best level since July 2015 at $57.92 on Wednesday.
It ended around 2% higher for the week, up a fifth-straight week.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., slipped 41 cents, or roughly 0.7%, to settle at $63.52 a barrel. It rallied to $64.65 midweek, a level not seen since June 2015.
The global benchmark ended the week with an increase of approximately 2.4%, the fifth weekly gain in a row.
Oil's rally, which began in early October, has been largely driven by expectations that oil producing countries will agree to extend an output cut at their meeting at the end of this month.
Under the original terms of the deal, OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine more months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Discussions are continuing in the run-up to the Nov. 30 meeting, which oil ministers from OPEC and the participating non-OPEC countries will attend.
Prices received another boost amid ongoing unrest in the Middle East as well as escalating tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Saudi Arabia is among the world’s top producers of oil and OPEC’s most influential member.
In other energy trading Friday, gasoline futures dipped 0.7 cents, or 0.4%, to end at $1.812 on Friday. It closed up around 1.1% for the week, the fifth-straight weekly advance.
Heating oil slumped 1.2 cents, or 0.6%, at $1.934 a gallon, marking a 2.6% weekly gain and booking its fifth weekly climb in a row.
Natural gas futures tacked on 1.3 cents, or almost 0.4%, to settle at $3.213 per million British thermal units. It traded around 7.7% higher for the week, notching its second straight weekly advance.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Oil traders will also focus on monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency to assess global oil supply and demand levels.
The data will give traders a better picture of whether a global rebalancing is taking place in the oil market.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.

KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Bahrain said an explosion which caused a fire at its main oil pipeline on Friday was caused by ""terrorist"" sabotage, linking the unprecedented attack to its arch-foe Iran, which denies any role in the Gulf island kingdom's unrest.
A key Western ally and host to the U.S. Fifth Fleet, Sunni Muslim-ruled Bahrain has for years grappled with protests and sporadic violence coming from its Shi'ite majority.
""The incident was an act of sabotage and a dangerous act of terrorism aimed at harming the higher interests of the nation and the safety of the people,"" the interior ministry said on its website.
""Terrorist acts witnessed by the country in the recent period are carried out through direct contacts and instructions from Iran,"" the statement quoted Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid bin Abdullah al-Khalifa as saying.
In Tehran, Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi rejected the allegations as ""false talk and childish accusations"", the ministry said on its website. 
Bahraini authorities said they had brought under control the fire at the oil pipeline.
State-run Bahrain Petroleum Company (Bapco) closed the flow of oil to the stricken pipeline, the civil defence said in a statement earlier on Saturday.
Residents close to the incident near Buri village, some 15 kilometres (10 miles) from the capital Manama, were being evacuated to a safe shelter, the statement added. 
Saudi Arabia's energy ministry said pumping to Bahrain had been suspended and the kingdom was stepping up security precautions at its own facilities.
""The attack on the pipeline ... was followed by the suspension of the pumping of oil to the State of Bahrain,"" the Saudi Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources said.
""The Ministry of Energy also confirmed that it has increased its security precautions at all its facilities, and that all these facilities enjoy the highest levels of protection and safety,"" it added in a statement.
After authorities quashed Shi'ite-led ""Arab Spring"" protests in 2011, militants have launched deadly bombing and shooting attacks against security forces that Manama blames on Tehran.
Iran denies any role in Bahrain's unrest.
Bahrain relies on the Abu Safa oilfield for the majority of its oil. It shares the field with Saudi Arabia. Oil to Bahrain is transported via the 55 km A-B pipeline which has a capacity of 230,000 barrels per day (bpd).
A new 350,000-bpd oil pipeline between the two countries will be completed next year and will serve the planned expansion of Bahrain's refinery capacity.

Arabian Light crude oil will flow from Saudi Aramco's Abqaiq plant via the 115-km new pipeline, 73 km of which will run overland and the rest under the Gulf.

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 11, 2017 07:37PM ET</span>","As Trump targets immigrants, U.S. farm sector looks to automate","By Lisa Baertlein and P.J. Huffstutter
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Convincing big U.S. dairy owners to buy robots to milk their cows - and reduce the farmhands they employ - used to be a tough sell for Steve Fried. Recently, his job has gotten easier, he says, in part because of President Donald Trump.
""I get calls on a daily basis and it typically starts with, 'I don't want to deal with this labor headache any more',"" said Fried, sales manager for Lely North America, which makes robotic dairy milking and feeding systems.
Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration through stepped-up arrests and border enforcement has shaken the U.S. agricultural sector, where as many as 7 in 10 farm workers are undocumented, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation that would require all employers to check social security numbers against federal databases to ensure their workers are in the country legally, something that is now voluntary in all but a handful of states. 
The get-tough approach ""has created a great deal of anxiety,"" said Tom Vilsack, chief executive of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, who was U.S. Agriculture Secretary for eight years under President Barack Obama.   
The shift comes as the industry was already struggling to cope with a shrinking, aging workforce. That is ratcheting up pressure on the sector to embrace new technology.
Farmers and food companies increasingly are moving to automate dairy operations, chicken processing, crop production and harvesting. Even delicate crops such as strawberries and peaches are being considered for mechanization. 
""You'd be a fool to not have a plan that moves you that way,"" said Duff Bevill, who owns a vineyard management company in Sonoma County, California.
Pilgrim's Pride Corp, (O:PPC) the second largest U.S. chicken producer, this year cited a tightening migrant labor market as key to its decision to invest in robots and X-ray technology for its slaughterhouses. The goal: to swap human hands for machines that can debone the front half of chickens and perform other chores.
""We're investing heavily in automating our processes, taking labor out and making jobs easier,"" Pilgrim's CEO William Lovette said in an earnings call. He said the company also decided to increases wages.
In Gilroy, California, Christopher Ranch is likewise embracing new machinery. The largest North American producer of fresh garlic, Christopher Ranch will spend about $1 million this year for a new Spanish-made robot in its packing plant that inserts garlic heads into sleeves, according to Ken Christopher, vice president of the family-owned business.
A 2014 report by WinterGreen Research forecast significant growth in the use of robotics in ""every aspect of farming, milking, food production"" and other agricultural enterprises. The report put the market for agricultural robots at $817 million in 2013 and projected that it would reach $16.3 billion by 2020.
Sensing opportunity, investors are stepping up to address agriculture's labor squeeze with new automation, helped by falling electronics costs and advancements in software, robotics and artificial intelligence.
Google Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), this year spearheaded a $10 million investment in Abundant Robotics, which is working on an apple-picking robot. It also participated in a $20 million funding round for Bowery Farming, which uses robotics to grow leafy greens indoors.
Elsewhere, farm machinery maker Deere & Co (N:DE) announced that it spent $305 million to buy precision weed-killing robot maker Blue River Technology. 
INCENTIVES TO AUTOMATE
While little official data exists to illustrate the impact of Trump's immigration policies on farm laborers, there is no question that illegal migration is down sharply since he took office in late January.
The number of people caught trying to enter the United States illegally from Mexico dropped almost 60 percent between February and May compared the same period last year, according to government figures. Between late January to early September, the number of individuals arrested in the interior of the country by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) rose almost 43 percent over the same period in 2016.
Gary Wishnatzki, a third-generation strawberry farmer in Florida, says scarce labor convinced him to raise $5 million so far to build a robotic strawberry picker that he hopes someday will reduce his industry's need for field hands.
Bruce Taylor, CEO of Taylor Farms, a Salinas, California producer of salads and chopped vegetables for stores and restaurants, says his company has automated 20 percent of its packing plant. 
The company has also teamed with an equipment maker to build a mechanized romaine harvester that is currently in use, and it is exploring automation for iceberg lettuce, broccoli and other field crops, Taylor said.
RISING PAY
In the meantime, farmers are raising wages. Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's most recent farm labor report shows average wages during the week of April 9 to 15 were $13.23 per hour, up 4 percent from the same week a year ago. 
""The mantra in agriculture right now is automate what you can and pay well for the labor you absolutely have to have,"" said Paul Pittman, CEO of  Farmland Partners Inc , (N:FPI) a real estate investment trust that invests in North American farm land. 
To win the loyalty of its full-time production workers, garlic grower Christopher Ranch decided to raise pay by 50 percent between 2016 and 2018, getting a four-year jump on California's mandated $15 minimum wage that will take effect in 2022.
""Companies need to find ways of adapting and adjusting,"" Christopher, the executive, said. ""We're going to take a small financial hit, but we're going to be ready.""

1268,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 10, 2017 03:30PM ET</span>",Mysterious Gold Trades of 4 Million Ounces Spur Price Plunge,"(Bloomberg) -- Trades that moved about 4 million ounces of gold in a matter of minutes awakened the precious metal from its slumber.
After 11:10 a.m. on the Comex in New York almost 40,000 contracts, each representing 100 ounces of the metal, traded in a span of 10 minutes. That triggered a sell-off, sending prices down as much as 1.1 percent.
The trades jolted the market, which has seen 60-day historical volatility languishing near the lowest since 2001. The metal has struggled to sustain the pace of gains from earlier this year as the outlook for rising U.S. borrowing costs curbs demand for non-interest-bearing assets like gold.
“We didn’t see any headlines, any news to make gold drop $10, but it just did,” Miguel Perez-Santalla, a sales and marketing manager at Heraeus Metals New York LLC, said by telephone. “It’s going with someone who has a huge position that can trigger stops and make the market move in a direction.”
The trades accelerated a market exodus. In the half hour ended 11:30 a.m. volume reached 63,384 contracts. Gold Futures for delivery in December settled 1 percent lower at $1,274.20 an ounce at 1:46 p.m. If the mysterious trades within that half hour were paid at the settlement price (which was unlikely), they would have been worth more than $8 billion.
The bullion market has seen similar mysterious trades in the past few months.
Last month, contracts covering more than 2 million ounces of gold traded in just five minutes, sending prices higher. Two months earlier, contracts for a similar amount traded in a minute, propelling the metal higher. In June, the market saw trades for over 1.8 million ounces posted in just a minute.

1269,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 10, 2017 02:43PM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices Settle Lower on Concerns Over Rising US Production ,"Investing.com – Crude oil prices settled lower on Friday, as investors fretted over an uptick in U.S. production but losses were limited as expectations grew that Opec would extend its agreement on output curbs.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for December delivery fell 0.7% to settle at $56.74 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent lost 37 cents to trade at $63.56 a barrel.
Crude Oil futures fell to a weekly loss as investors weighed a report from Baker Hughes showing the number of oil rigs operating in the US rose to the highest in almost a month by 9 to 738.
The uptick in rig counts added to concerned over rising U.S. output after federal energy projections this week estimated U.S. production to rise to 9.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 and a record 10.0 million bpd in 2018.
Losses in oil prices were limited, however, as investor expectations for an extension to the Opec-led product-cut agreement remained elevated ahead of the upcoming meeting on Nov. 30.
In May, Opec producers agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.2 million bpd agreed in November last year.
Oil prices are expected to remain volatile over the near-term amid ongoing unrest in the Middle East after Saudi Arabia warned its citizens on Thursday not to travel to Lebanon and urged the international community to impose fresh sanctions on Iran.
The escalating tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran come after Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman accused Iran of “direct military aggression” by supplying Houthi rebels in Yemen with missiles, one of which was fired towards the Riyadh on Saturday."
1270,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 10, 2017 02:30PM ET</span>",Biofuels Fight Is Brewing Between U.S. and Brazil Over Ethanol,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. biofuels industry, fresh off a win against Big Oil, is lining up for a fight with Brazil.
American ethanol producers said Thursday in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that they’re seeking Brazil’s suspension from a trade program allowing duty-free imports into the U.S. The move follows Brazil’s decision in August to slap a 20 percent tariff on ethanol shipments from the U.S. that exceed a 600 million-liter (158 million-gallon) annual quota.
The U.S. ethanol lobby was buoyed last month by President Donald Trump’s instruction to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt to support the Renewable Fuel Standard, a law mandating the use of fuels such as corn-based ethanol and soy-based biodiesel. Trump’s personal intervention came despite the objections of oil refiners.
The spat with Brazil also comes as the White House pursues a protectionist agenda in dealing with international trade. On Thursday, the Commerce Department set import duties on biodiesel from Indonesia and Argentina after U.S. producers said they were harmed by unfair state subsidies given to competitors in those countries.
The letter to Lighthizer was signed by three industry groups: The Renewable Fuels Association, Growth Energy and the U.S. Grains Council. Ethanol in the U.S. is made from corn, making the industry an important part of the farm lobby. Trump visited ethanol plants in Iowa during his presidential campaign and told the state’s voters he would stand by the biofuel if he was elected.
“It is fair to say that President Donald Trump’s administration has been actively and constructively engaged in every step of the way of this process,” Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said Friday in a telephone interview.
Eligible Trade
Dinneen said the government has already signaled to Brazil there will be consequences for imposing the tariff. American ethanol exports to the country dropped 54 percent in August from January levels, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show.
No one at the U.S. Trade Representative or the Brazilian government immediately responded to requests for comment.
The ethanol groups are threatening to petition for Brazil’s suspension designated country status under the Generalized System of Preferences trade program, which allows duty-free imports to promote economic growth in other countries. Brazil is the third-largest beneficiary under the program, with $2.2 billion of eligible trade in 2016, the groups said in their letter. Brazil’s tariff violates the “spirit"" of the program, they said.
Brazil didn’t violate World Trade Organization rules, Eduardo Leao, executive director of Unica, a sugar and ethanol industry group, said in an interview Friday. The tariff is being levied only on the amount of ethanol that exceeds 600 million liters, which is the average amount of imports in the three years through 2016.
""We made a courtesy to the Americans in taxing only what exceeds the quota."" Leao said."
1271,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 10, 2017 01:42PM ET</span>",Gold Prices Slip 1% but Set To Snap Three-Week Losses,"Investing.com – Gold prices fell sharply on Friday but remained on track to snap three to three-week losing streak amid dollar weakness. 
Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $13.10, or 1.02%, to $1274.41 a troy ounce.
Gold prices fell 1% intraday as investors appeared to unwind their bullish positions on the precious metal despite ongoing dollar weakness amid fears of delay to corporate tax cuts. 
U.S. Senate Republicans unveiled a tax plan on Thursday that was significantly different from the House of Representatives’ version, as the Senate’s plan proposed a cut to the corporate rate to 20% from 35% in 2019, which differs from the GOP plan to slash the corporate rate immediately. 
President Trump’s tax-reform plan, which is widely viewed as inflationary – a boon for the U.S. dollar – was widely expected to be enacted before year-end.
Gold prices are sensitive to moves lower in the U.S. dollar – A lower dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency, thus, increases demand.
The outlook for gold turned negative after data from the World Gold Council showed global demand for gold slipped 9% to 915 tonnes during the third quarter of 2017, compared to the same period a year ago. 
In other precious metal trade, silver futures fell 0.54% to $16.88 a troy ounce, while platinum futures lost 1.06% to $930.65.

A total of 48,000 contracts have traded over the last few days that would profit most if Brent spikes before Christmas, including several large individual trades. They include 14,000 options giving traders the right to buy February Brent at $71 a barrel, as well as 22,000 for $85 and 12,000 for $80. They all expire on Dec. 21. 
Oil prices have rallied in recent weeks as OPEC supply cuts help to rebalance an oil market plagued by oversupply. More recently, growing tensions between Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest oil producer, and some of its neighbors helped prices break above $60 a barrel for the first time since 2015. 
Against that backdrop, the crude options market has generally been looking brighter. The so-called put skew, the difference in demand for bullish call options versus bearish put options, has also fallen in recent days. That gauge closed at its least bearish level since late-August on Thursday, bolstering oil’s rosy outlook.

1275,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 10, 2017 09:01AM ET</span>",OPEC and Hedge Funds Could Be Setting Oil Prices Up for a Fall,"(Bloomberg) -- As OPEC and its allies prepare to meet this month, expectations may be running so high they can only disappoint.
From Russian President Vladimir Putin to Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, signals abound that the grand alliance of oil states will choose to prolong supply cuts when they gather on Nov. 30. Spurred by these hopeful signs, hedge funds have laid on record bets that Brent crude futures will keep rising.
The risk for oil bulls and producers alike is that, with so much money already staked on an extension of the agreement, the market has no way to go but down. This happened when OPEC last met in May, when oil prices tumbled 4.6 percent after Saudi and Russian officials had pretty much confirmed before the meeting that they would agree on continued action.
“It’s already priced in, just like at the last meeting,” said Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. “The massive long overhang is about to get massively shorter.”
The sell-off could be deeper still if OPEC agrees a shorter deal than the end-2018 extension that is widely expected, or even postpones a decision until next year, which is what Citigroup Inc. expects.
“We’re back at a record level of net length, which is only a one-way street when you get there,” said Ed Morse, Citigroup’s head of commodities research in New York. After the meeting “the market will be pretty disappointed.”"
1276,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 10, 2017 06:55AM ET</span>", Crude Oil Prices Hold Steady Ahead of U.S. Shale Production Data,"Investing.com - Crude oil prices held ground in early morning trade on Friday ahead of U.S. weekly rig count data that showed a dip in the previous week, but also with a sharp eye on the Middle East as tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia, key OPEC members, simmer.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for December delivery inched up 0.03% to $57.16 a barrel at 6:54AM ET (11:54GMT), while on London’s Intercontinental Exchange, Brent rose 0.22% to $64.07 a barrel.
Overnight, crude oil prices settled higher on Thursday amid ongoing unrest in the Middle East while Saudi Arabia’s plan to slash crude exports lifted sentiment, backing expectations that major oil producers will extend their agreement to curb production in order for global markets to rebalance.
Saudi Arabia plans to cut its crude exports by 120,000 barrels per day in December compared with November, slashing allocations to all regions, Reuters reported Thursday, citing a energy ministry spokesman.
The reports of Saudi’s plan to reduce exports came as investor fears grew of instability in the Middle East after Saudi Arabia warned its citizens not to travel to Lebanon and urged the international community to impose fresh sanctions on Iran.
The escalating tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran come after Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman accused Iran of “direct military aggression” by supplying Houthi rebels in Yemen with missiles, one of which was fired towards the Riyadh on Saturday.
Analysts at RBC said the recent rally in oil prices is more sustainable than previous rallies, as geopolitical risk would play an increasingly larger “needle-moving” role as the excess oil supplies continued to narrow.
Crude prices remained on track for fifth straight weekly win despite a report showing that U.S. crude supplies rose last week.
Bullish sentiment has been supported by expectations that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other non-OPEC producers led by Russia will extend production cuts at a November 30 meeting until the end of 2018.
Still ahead on Friday, traders will watch the latest weekly data on U.S. shale production for signs that activity continues to decline.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported last week that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil had fallen by eight to 729. That was the fourth weekly decline in five.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for domestic oil production."

LONDON (Reuters) - Crude oil markets were slightly higher on Friday, supported by continuing supply cuts and expectations that an output deal will be extended at the end of the month.
Brent crude was at $64.22 a barrel at 1017 GMT, up 27 cents from the previous close and 43 cents off a more than two-year high of $64.65 reached this week.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was at $57.26, up 9 cents and also not far from this week's peak of $57.92, its highest in more than two years.
The higher prices are a result of efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to tighten the market by cutting output, as well as strong demand and rising political tensions.
There are also expectations in the market that OPEC's next meeting on Nov. 30 will agree to extend cuts beyond the current expiry date in March 2018.
""Clearly the market is still convinced that OPEC will succeed in tightening the market to a sufficient extent by extending its production cuts. Attention is therefore paid to any news that supports this view,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said.
""Even significantly weaker Chinese crude oil imports in October and an increase in U.S. crude production to a record level failed to exert any lasting pressure on oil prices.""
On Friday Saudi-owned Al Hayat newspaper cited UAE Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui as saying that oil producers will have little difficulty taking a decision on extending the pact.
""The market needs a bit of a correction. No one is talking about not extending the cut,"" he told the newspaper, adding that it is more a case of deciding on the duration of an extension. 
Also supporting prices is strong demand in southeast Asia, where the number of tankers holding oil in storage around Singapore and Malaysia has halved since June.
However, technicals signal that gains might not be sustained, some analysts say.
""The uptrend that has dominated oil futures contracts for most of the last five months is still in place, but it is beginning to look weary,"" said Robin Bieber, chart analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
""RBOB's (gasoline futures) action is evidence of this. Watch the five-day moving averages very carefully. The trend is OK while these are intact - below, and the contracts are very vulnerable to a correction lower to the eight-day moving averages,"" he added.

Comex gold futures were down $2.48 or about 0.19% at $1,284.92 a troy ounce by 05:00 a.m. ET (09:00 GMT), just off the previous session's three-week highs of $1,288.77.
U.S. Senate Republicans unveiled a plan on Thursday which would reduce the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% and make other significant changes to the individual tax system.
However, sentiment on the greenback remained fragile as Senate Republican leaders said they were considering postponing the implementation of the major corporate tax cut until 2019.
Meanwhile, a House tax reform bill, which differs from the Senate version, would be expected to take effect next year.
If the Senate and House pass separate tax bills, lawmakers will have to reconcile them.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down at 94.33, its lowest since November 3.
Gold is sensitive to moves in the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency.
Meanwhile, investors also continued to monitor developments in the Middle East after Saudi Arabia on Thursday ordered its citizens to leave Lebanon immediately amid mounting tensions with Iran, which it claims is running the Lebanese government through its proxy Hezbollah.
Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri surprised markets last Saturday by announcing his resignation, citing assassination threats and blaming Iran for interference in Lebanon.
Saudi Arabia has also been conducting an anti-corruption purge among the highest levels of the establishment. After a first crackdown over the weekend, local authorities said on Wednesday that they had made additional arrests and frozen more bank accounts among the kingdom's political and business elite.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures rose 0.28% to $17.02 a troy ounce.
Palladium futures remained suppported at $1,004.65. The metal rallied to a 16-year high of $1,023.17 on Thursday, boosted by growing interest in lithium-ion batteries used in electric cars.
Palladium is used in catalytic convertors that convert harmful gases in car exhaust into less toxic substances. Demand for the metal is growing dramatically as car manufacturers look for other ways to cut emissions."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The amount of oil stored on tankers around Singapore has dropped sharply in the last months, the latest indication that OPEC-led supply cuts are successfully tightening crude markets even as U.S. exports have soared.
Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows around 15 super-tankers are currently filled with oil in waters off Singapore and western Malaysia, storing around 30 million barrels of crude. That is half the number of ships in June and down from 40 tankers holding surplus fuel in mid-2017.
The drop in floating storage around Asia's main oil-trading hubs comes in the wake of voluntary production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia as they look to choke off a supply overhang that has dogged markets for years.
""There are less incentives for traders to hold crude given rising crude oil prices and premiums. So to some extent, the OPEC cuts have worked,"" said Eng Hian, head of trading at AgriTrade Energy in Singapore, which trades crude and operates tankers used for storage.
Brent crude futures are up more than 40 percent since July to almost $64 per barrel. Also, the Brent forward curve shows contracts for future delivery are cheaper than spot supplies, a condition known as backwardation which makes it unattractive to store oil.
""The (backwardation) structure has flushed out oil in storage,"" Eng Hian said.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED?
The OPEC-led cuts were initially slated to last for the first half of 2017, but have since been extended until March next year as some participants took time to comply with the curbs and as U.S. crude imports jumped.
Tighter supplies are also evident in physical oil markets.
Saudi Arabia this month lifted the price for its light crude in Asia to the highest level since September, 2014, just before the glut started.
U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said this week that falling inventories were also driven by strong demand for oil.
""Strength in demand is an important force in the rebalancing of the global oil market ... It has helped the decline in excess inventories,"" Goldman said in a note to clients.
Despite the tighter market, energy consultancy FGE warned this week that due to rising U.S. shale production and a potential jump in OPEC supplies after the end of its voluntary cuts, a supply glut could re-emerge.
""This may result in lower prices in 2019,"" FGE said.

U.S. oil production climbed to a record of over 9.6 million barrels per day (bpd) this month, and output is set to climb further. Texas issued around 1,000 oil and gas drilling permits last month, up nearly 17 percent from the same month a year ago, according to the state's energy regulator.

(Reuters) - Cuts in OPEC output that have led to a surge in U.S. oil exports to Asia may prove a godsend for struggling global shippers, driving rates for large crude shipments to China, India and other major oil importers sharply higher over the next year.
Operators such as  Frontline Ltd  (OL:FRO),  Euronav  (BR:EUAV) and Gener8 Maritime (N:GNRT) are still recovering from five years of weak rates and falling profits, and face more financial headaches after a glut of new supertanker launches.
But OPEC's strong compliance with output cuts agreed in 2016 is boosting prospects for the business by raising demand for previously little-used U.S.-Asia routes and allowing tankers to refill in the Gulf on return journeys to the United States.
""The impact of rising Asian demand will not be seen in strong earnings in the next two quarters, because there is still the problem of overcapacity,"" said George Los, the head of tanker research at U.S. ship brokerage Charles R. Weber Company.
""But by mid 2018 and by 2019 it will be able to make a notable impact on VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier) rates.""
The rate to ship U.S. crude oil from the Gulf of Mexico to Singapore  - still a relatively new route - has risen more than 50 percent since August to stand at $15.54 per tonne on Nov. 9, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Prices for the more traditional Middle-East to Asia route are also up nearly 48 percent. Volumes for the U.S.-Asia route nearly tripled to 5 million barrels in September since the beginning of this year, as per Thomson Reuters shipping data.
""As this trend for U.S. exports to the Far East grows, the positive impact on our business will be felt in the second half of 2018 and beyond,"" said Brian Gallagher, spokesman for Belgian tanker operator Euronav.
Carnegie analyst Ola Ekern Rugsveen said average VLCC spot rates have risen from $10,000 per day during the summer to $30,000 in the months of September-October.
OPEC
U.S. crude exports have boomed since a forty-year old ban was lifted less than two years ago and have been spurred further by OPEC's move to cap output a year ago, reaching 2.1 million barrels per day in September of this year.
With Iran and Saudi Arabia putting aside differences that prevented caps from functioning in the past, the premium that users pay for OPEC-supplied Brent crude (LCOc1) over U.S. light crude (CLc1) rose to almost $7 on Oct. 31 - its highest in more than two years.
China has taken advantage of the widening spread, importing about 115,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the United States through September this year, up from a single cargo of under 1 million barrels between January and August a year ago.
India, the world's third-largest oil importer, said earlier this year it would buy crude from the United States for the first time and Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts put overall U.S. exports to Asia at around 261,000 bpd in the first eight months of the year - 10 times more than 2016.
Up to September this year, 30 VLCCs - defined as those with a capacity between 1.9 million and 2.2 million barrels - came on line, according to shipping brokerage firm VesselsValue. That is the result of orders placed when oil neared $200 a barrel last decade.
VLCC spot prices now are about the same as what they were a year ago and down 48 percent from the peak of $29.81 per tonne in 2015, before crude hit its lowest of $27.88.
""We're in a period of time where the fleet growth is quite significant so there's quite a bit of new tonnage coming into the market, that's what's preventing the market from going further,"" Lars Barstad, commercial director of Oslo-based Frontline said.

""We are cautious about the market going forward for the next couple of quarters until the fleet has stopped to grow. But come second half 2018 we think the market balance will kind of improve for us.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of 37 U.S.-based scientists whose research focuses on Arctic wildlife asked two U.S. senators in a letter on Thursday not to open the National Arctic Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration, according to a copy seen by Reuters.
The scientists, including several retired former officials from the Alaska Department of Fish & Game, the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, said in a letter to Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington that drilling for oil and gas in the refuge would be ""incompatible with the purposes for which the refuge was established,"" protecting fish and wildlife populations and the environments in which they live. 
Murkowski, a Republican, introduced legislation on Wednesday that would create an oil and gas exploration program on the refuge's coastal plain, letting prospectors build any roads and other infrastructure they deemed necessary inside the refuge to carry out their operations. Half of the available drilling royalties would go to the state of Alaska and half to the federal government. The program's administrator would be required to hold at least two lease sales within 10 years after the bill became law. 
The scientists said drilling on the coastal plain would be particularly harmful because it contains a ""unique compression"" of habitats supporting animals like polar bears, grizzly bears, wolverines, representing ""the greatest wildlife diversity of any protected area above the Arctic Circle.""
In a Reuters interview, Cantwell praised the scientists for spelling out why drilling would be so harmful to the refuge and she would work to oppose the legislation. 
""To try to legislate mandated drilling in a wildlife refuge is just not where America is,"" she said. 
Murkowski's spokeswoman declined to comment and referred a comment request to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
The conflict over whether to allow drilling inside the refuge has deep roots. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the area on the Prudhoe Bay in Northern Alaska has up to 12 billion barrels of recoverable crude, and Republicans, who now control Congress and the White House, have long wanted to open a portion of the refuge called the 1002 area. 
Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, called the 1002 portion a ""non wilderness area"" because the government put it aside decades ago for petroleum exploration. Last month, Democrats tried and failed to pass legislation blocking drilling there.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose nearly 1 percent on Thursday, supported by supply cuts by major exporters as well as continuing concern about political developments in Saudi Arabia.
Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was up 59 cents or 0.9 percent to $64.08 a barrel by 11:30 a.m. (1630), still close to Tuesday's intra-day high of $64.65, which was the highest since June 2015.
U.S. light crude (CLc1) was up 46 cents or 0.8 percent at $57.27, just shy of this week's more than two-year high of $57.69 a barrel.
""The move is driven by developments in Saudi Arabia in recent days and anticipation that the consolidation of power by King Salman and the Crown Price will continue,"" said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy's Global Gas Analytics in London, ""Meanwhile, Saudi comments on Lebanon have also highlighted rising tensions between the kingdom and Iran.""
Saudi Arabia plans to cut its crude exports by 120,000 barrels per day in December compared with November, slashing allocations to all regions, a spokesman for the energy ministry told Reuters on Thursday.
Several traders said prices got a boost from unconfirmed rumors that Saudi King Salman would relinquish the throne to his son Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Similar rumors hit the market in September and October but never materialized.
Prices got a boost earlier this week from a crackdown on corruption by the Saudi crown prince, who says he is determined to remodel his conservative country into a modern state no longer dependent on oil. Analysts said his arrival to the throne would add to tensions between Saudi Arabia and several countries including Iran, Lebanon and Yemen.
Still, traders expressed caution that the rally that has pushed up Brent by more than 40 percent since July may have run its course. The rally has largely been driven by crude output cuts from producing nations led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia.
""Prices may have reached a short-term peak,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at futures brokerage Forex.com.
""It doesn't matter how bullish the fundamentals are ... when an asset goes vertical there is always room for a pullback and consolidation of recent price moves,"" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at brokerage AxiTrader.
OPEC will discuss output at a meeting on Nov. 30, and is expected to extend the limits beyond their expiry in March 2018. If that happens, some said the rally could still have legs.
""With the OPEC/non-OPEC deal extension beyond March 2018 a certainty, prices may become stronger and temporarily reach the $65-$70 per barrel range in 2018,"" said energy consultancy FGE.
U.S. crude production  rose 67,000 barrels per day to 9.62 million bpd, the highest for decades.

Output looks set to rise further. Texas issued 997 oil and gas drilling permits last month, up nearly 17 percent versus the same month a year ago.

1291,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2017 04:19AM ET</span>",Sky-high stock market has investors looking to commodities,"By Devika Krishna Kumar and Chris Prentice
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A growing number of investors are plowing money into commodities, seeking to diversify their holdings on gnawing concerns about a stock market correction as equities scale new highs almost daily.
Low interest rates, solid economic growth across the globe and rising corporate earnings have hoisted the S&P 500 (SPX) 16 percent this year. It reached an all-time high on Tuesday. By contrast the bellwether S&P Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Commodity Index (GSCI) <.SPGSCI> gained 7 percent in that same period. 
The last five years presents an even starker divergence. The S&P has gained 82 percent in that time, while the GSCI has dropped by 34 percent.
That may start to shift, portfolio managers and investment advisors say. Strong demand in markets like oil and copper, along with tightening supply, is shifting the fundamental outlook, boosting commodity flows. Oil prices recently hit a two-and-a-half-year high, while copper hit a three-year high.
While commodity markets pale in size to equities and fixed income, a notable shift toward the asset class could help validate the concerns of those who believe stocks have become overvalued. 
""We've been through a terrible bear market in commodities and equities have been in a tremendous bull market. Both are likely to change,"" said Roland Morris, portfolio manager and commodity strategist at VanEck Global, an investment manager in New York. 
In the past week, a net $324 million has flowed into funds that invest in a broad basket of commodities, Thomson Reuters data shows. In August, flows into commodity mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) hit $2.1 billion, the highest in more than six years. 
However, flows into commodities were patchy in September and October, and the $3.8 billion in net inflows this year through October pales in comparison to $6.5 billion for the same period in 2016. 
Commodity prices steadied after sinking to multi-year lows in 2016, but supply gluts in energy and grains markets have prevented heavily traded commodities from keeping up with stocks.
The spread between the indices such as the GSCI, or the Thomson Reuters/CoreCommodity CRB Index (TRJCRB), and the S&P 500 are at or near their widest on record. 
Commodities, unlike equities, can be expensive to hold for long periods of time, if future-dated prices are higher than current ones. That has exaggerated the spread between commodities and equities, Morris said, as passive investors in commodities lose money when the managers of commodity indices sell cheaper contracts as they come due for physical delivery, then buy costlier futures. 
As one example, even though the spot U.S. crude oil futures contract (CLc1) has gained nearly 6 percent this year, the United States Oil ETF (USO), which mimics that contract's daily moves, is down 2.8 percent, in the same period of time. 
Over the last few months, later-dated Brent crude prices have fallen below the spot oil price, so now when passive funds sell expiring contracts to buy fresh ones, they make money, rather than lose it. 
""The returns (from commodities) since mid-summer have been high ... oil right now has a positive roll yield for the first time in a few years,"" said Greg Sharenow, portfolio manager at PIMCO, who helps manage more than $3 billion in assets. 
Historically, such a move has been an indicator of future gains and that has, in part, led to increased interest in commodities, Sharenow said.
Benchmark Brent and U.S. crude fell to the lowest levels in more than a decade in 2016 and have recovered sharply in recent weeks, boosting commodity indices, where oil often carries the greatest weight. 
""Brent (crude) has already broken through the psychological barrier of $60 a barrel and if (U.S. crude) can get to $60 as well, it could spur even further investor interest,"" said Matt Sallee, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors. 
There has been rising interest in recent months from funds in livestock and metals, said Chip Whalen, vice president of education and research at Commodity and Ingredient Hedging LLC, a commodity trading advisor in Chicago.
Industrial metals and livestock have this year fetched the highest returns within the S&P GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index, which reflects yields to investors, according to Goldman Sachs. 

The bank forecasts returns of 1.2 percent for three months, 3.2 percent over the next six months and 3.6 percent for 12 months from the index.

1292,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2017 12:10AM ET</span>",Gold demand slides to eight-year low in third quarter of 2017: WGC,"By Jan Harvey
LONDON (Reuters) - Gold demand slid to its lowest in eight years in the last quarter as jewelry buying fell and inflows into bullion-backed exchange traded funds dried up, data from the World Gold Council showed on Thursday. 
Overall demand fell 9 percent to 915 tonnes, its weakest since the third quarter of 2009, the WGC said.
That pattern is likely to feed through to the full year, with the WGC forecasting annual demand of just 3,900-4,000 tonnes, compared to 4,347 tonnes in 2016. Gold demand has not been below 4,000 tonnes on an annual basis since 2009. 
""ETF inflows year to date are a fraction of the stellar inflows we saw last year,"" the WGC's head of market intelligence Alistair Hewitt said. ""India is similarly weak.""
India, which along with China leads the world in gold consumption, saw particularly soft gold demand due to the introduction of the new goods and services tax from the start of July, the WGC said. That brought forward many purchases.
In the full year the WGC expects Indian demand to hold at around 650-750 tonnes, in line with a weak 2016. Chinese demand is seen at 850-950 tonnes. 
Elsewhere, soaring stock markets also detracted attention from gold, the WGC said, denting interest in bullion-backed ETFs. ETF inflows totaled less than 19 tonnes in the last quarter, down from 144 tonnes a year earlier, outweighing a 17 percent rise in bar and coin investment to 222 tonnes. 
Turkish consumer demand jumped 73 percent to 25.4 tonnes, though that was down quarter on quarter. It was also well short of accounting for a huge jump in Turkish gold imports in the period, to 115 tonnes from 17 tonnes a year earlier.
""We've seen an increase in exports as well,"" Hewitt said. ""One of the factors we have seen in as increase in trade between Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.""
A rise in Turkish central bank buying also fed into a rise in overall official sector demand, though it was driven chiefly by Russia. Russian gold reserves are up by almost 164 tonnes in the year to date, the WGC said, two-thirds more than Turkey's. 
Gold demand from the technology sector also grew, it said, due to demand for memory chips used in high-end smartphones.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2017 05:58AM ET</span>",Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewables,"By Ernest Scheyder and Ron Bousso
HOUSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Two decades ago,  BP  set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun.
That transformation - marketed as ""Beyond Petroleum"" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands.
Today, BP (L:BP) might be more aptly branded ""Back to Petroleum"" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer.
""We made very big bets in the past,"" BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. ""A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."" 
The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.
Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.
A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
BP,  Chevron  (N:CVX),  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and  Total  (PA:TOTF) are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable.
""There is no sign of peak demand right now,"" said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. ""For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth.""
For a graphic showing BP's fossil fuel and renewable energy forecasts, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2h4vGHd 
The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden.
History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third. 
Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures.
Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future.
""There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon,"" he said. ""We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil.""
The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built.
Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries. 
Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars.
Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe.
Exxon declined to comment for this article.
SHORT-SIGHTED STRATEGY?
Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue. 
South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and operator Windlab Ltd.
Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization.
""You cannot flip a switch on a Monday morning from being one to another,"" he said. ""Paychecks in the oil and gas industry are based on fundamentally believing that the world cannot see economic growth without fossil fuels."" 
To achieve the same share of the renewables market that the largest publicly-traded oil companies now hold in oil and gas would require an investment of about $350 billion over the next 18 years, estimates consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Such spending would cut into the generous dividends that oil firms' shareholders have come to expect.
""We think it will be a real challenge for these companies to change their business model,"" said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group. 
PRI has guidelines calling for investment analysis that weighs environmental, social and governance issues. Its principles have been adopted by investors with $70 trillion in assets under management.
SMALL SCALE RENEWABLES INVESTMENTS
Oil companies have made relatively modest investments a wide range of renewable technologies. Chevron has a smattering of mostly small wind and solar ventures; Shell invests in sugar-cane ethanol in South America, wind farms in the United States and electric-car charging stations in Europe; and BP still owns the U.S. wind farms it once tried to sell. 
John Browne - who as BP's CEO two decades ago helped launch the early investments in renewables - said he still believes the renewable power will grow. 
""It will take time,"" he said in an interview with Reuters last month. ""And they have time."" 
Shell pledged to invest up to $1 billion a year by 2020 in what it calls ""new energies."" 
Total said this year it would spend $500 million annually on developing alternatives. But soon after that announcement, it unveiled its $7.5 billion acquisition of Maersk Oil, part of a plan to pump more crude from Norway's North Sea.
Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne in October explained the focus on economics at an October oil conference in London.
""When you ask our customers what their priority is, either in developed economies or in emerging countries, price comes first,"" he said. A hasty shift to renewables, he said, ""could bring great economic and social damage to our 6 billion customers.""
Exxon Mobil is backing research into biofuels, joining with gene modification firm Synthetic Genomics to coax algae to produce more lipids, an oil substitute. It hasn't detailed its investment but said the effort remains far from commercialization. By comparison, Exxon this year spent $5.6 billion on U.S. shale oil assets.
BATTERY-POWERED CARS, PLANES
Some of the oil industry's largest customers are planning a shift to renewable alternatives, especially in transportation, which accounts for about a quarter of annual energy consumption. 
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) earlier this fall disclosed it would aim, by 2030, to derive a third of its sales from battery-powered cars and another third from gas-electric hybrids. 
A startup backed by  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) recently announced plans for a small hybrid jet by 2022, using batteries from Tesla and battery supplier Panasonic Corp (T:6752).
Yet oil firms continue to forecast aggressive growth in liquid fuels. Exxon predicts 90 percent of the transportation industry will rely on petroleum through 2040.
BP projects the world's auto fleet doubling to 1.8 billion vehicles by 2035, with only 75 million of those powered by electricity.

""We'll see if (electric cars) can be delivered in a way that doesn't require large subsidies"" from governments, Chevron's Watson told Reuters. ""That's what we're seeing now.""

 Comex gold futures were up 0.26% at $1,279.06 a troy ounce by 04:05 a.m. ET (08:05 GMT).
The greenback was hit by reports that a key corporate tax cut currently under discussion in U.S. tax reforms plans could be delayed for one year.
The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that Senate Republican leaders are thinking of postponing the implementation of the major corporate tax cut to comply with Senate rules.
The U.S. dollar had been supported in recent session by hopes the U.S. administration's tax cuts could boost the economy.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 94.74.
Gold is sensitive to moves in the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency.
Meanwhile, investors remained cautious after, in an address to the South Korean parliament on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump addressed tensions with North Korea, saying that it ""has interpreted America's past restraint as weakness.""
""This would be a fatal miscalculation. This is a very different administration than the United States has had in the past,"" he added.
Trump arrived in South Korea on Tuesday after meeting with Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the weekend.
Safe-haven demand also strengthened after Saudi Arabia over the weekend launched an anti-corruption purge among the highest levels of the establishment. In a separate event, the Saudi Kingdom accused Iran of being responsible for a ballistic missile attack carried out in Yemen, adding to local geopolitical tensions.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday as Chinese crude imports slipped to their lowest level in a year, although traders said the overall market remains well supported because of OPEC-led supply cuts.
Traders said they were closely eyeing escalating tensions in the Middle East, especially between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Brent futures (LCOc1) were at $63.43 per barrel at 0744 GMT, down 26 cents, or 0.4 percent. The decline follows Brent rising to an over two-year high of $64.65 earlier this week.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) was at $56.90 per barrel, down 30 cents, or 0.5 percent, from its last settlement. WTI also marked its highest in over two years earlier this week, at $57.69.
China's October oil imports fell sharply from a near record-high of about 9 million barrels per day (bpd) in September to just 7.3 million bpd, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Wednesday. That is the lowest level since October 2016, though imports were up 7.8 percent from a year ago.
""Lower imports reflected less purchases from independent refineries as many of them are running out of crude quotas for this year,"" said Li Yan, oil analyst with Zibo Longzhong Information Group.
For next year, however, independent refiners are likely to boost their imports again as authorities on Wednesday raised the 2018 crude oil import quota by 55 percent over 2017 to 2.85 million bpd.
Overall, oil markets remain well supported largely due to an ongoing effort led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to withhold supplies to prop up prices.
""Stronger oil fundamentals and investor inflows have been the catalyst for higher oil prices, but adding further support now is a focus on several geopolitical risks that have been looming over oil markets for a while,"" said U.S. bank Citi. 
With crude up more than 40 percent since June, many U.S. shale oil drillers have locked in recent profits by selling future production, pushing up trading in WTI crude futures.
While producers are profiting from higher oil prices, oil-consuming industries are starting to feel the pinch.
""Oil is back up to $60 a barrel, and I think it is going to put downward pressure on airline profits and margins in the coming years,"" said Brian Prentice, a partner at aviation services firm Cavok.
Despite recent oil price rises, offshore oil drilling activity remains low as companies are still reluctant to invest big sums into future output, Bernstein Research said on Wednesday.
""We find little evidence of significant new work ahead ... We would have to see significant pick-up in sanctioning activity by year-end to believe in the beginning of a recovery,"" it added.

OPEC also said in its 2017 World Oil Outlook that demand for its crude would rise in the next two years more slowly than previously expected as a recovery in prices due to OPEC's return to supply management stimulates output growth outside the group.
The forecast is not the first time OPEC's annual long-term report has referred to a demand plateau, but it comes in a year which looks set to be ""tipping point"" for electric vehicles (EVs), according to global miner BHP.""In just a few years, EVs have gone from being completely unaffordable, impractical and not particularly nice, to representing a valid option for a niche pool of customers,"" OPEC said in the report. 
OPEC said the report's forecast that world oil demand would rise to 111.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2040 could be curbed to 108.60 million bpd if electric vehicles are adopted more widely than assumed in the report's reference case.
""Moreover, global oil demand is estimated to plateau around this level in the second half of the 2030s,"" OPEC said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is not alarmed, though, saying oil use won't peak yet and expecting its market share to rise to 46 percent in 2040 from 40 percent in 2016.
""There is therefore no peak oil demand for the foreseeable future,"" OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told a news conference.
MORE SHALE OIL
OPEC and rivals including Russia have been cutting output in 2017 to clear a glut. 
A resulting price rise will spur a rebound in non-OPEC supply in the next few years, the report shows, before OPEC's market share increases further down the line.
Demand for OPEC crude will reach 33.10 million bpd in 2019, the report said. While up from 32.70 million bpd in 2016, the 2019 figure is down from 33.70 million bpd forecast in last year's report.
OPEC raised its forecast for the supply of tight oil, which includes U.S. shale. It said a rise in prices in 2017, plus sustained demand growth, had resulted in a higher forecast for supplies outside OPEC.
""The medium-term outlook for non-OPEC liquids growth has changed quite considerably,"" OPEC said in the report, referring to its 2016 forecasts. ""Most strikingly, U.S. tight oil production has exceeded previous growth expectations."" 
Oil prices hit their highest since July 2015 on Monday, trading above $62 a barrel. 
This year's report did not mention the oil price it assumes. Last year's report assumed OPEC's basket of crude oils would reach $65 in 2021. 
Global output of tight oil will reach 7.0 million bpd by 2020 and 9.22 million bpd in 2030, the report said, as Argentina and Russia join North America as producers.
Last year's estimates were 4.55 million bpd by 2020 and 6.73 million bpd by 2030.

OPEC also increased its medium-term world oil demand forecast, expecting oil use to reach 102.3 million bpd by 2022 - 2.24 million bpd more than in last year's report.

1308,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2017 11:21AM ET</span>",OPEC seeks consensus on duration of oil cut pact before meeting,"By Alex Lawler and Shadia Nasralla
VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC is seeking to achieve consensus agreement before a meeting on Nov. 30 on how long to extend a global pact to curb oil production, OPEC's secretary general said on Tuesday, with no country unwilling to prolong the accord.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, are cutting oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018 in an effort to eradicate a supply glut that has weighed on prices.
The comments indicate an increasing chance that the deal will be extended further into next year at the Nov. 30 meeting. Oil prices are trading at a more than two-year high, but an overhang of stored oil has yet to be fully eradicated.
""Extensive consultations are currently ongoing to reach some consensus before Nov. 30 on the duration beyond the March 2018 deadline,"" OPEC's Mohammad Barkindo told reporters.
""I have not heard so far any participating country that is violently objecting to extending the decision.""
The producers are in the process of inviting other countries to the Nov. 30 meeting, Barkindo said, with a view to joining the deal. He declined to name the countries concerned.
Reuters reported last month, citing OPEC sources, that producers are leaning towards extending the deal for a further nine months, though the decision could be postponed until early next year depending on the market. 
Barkindo, who was speaking at a press conference for OPEC's latest World Oil Outlook, said the recent rise in prices reflected improved market fundamentals and producers' high adherence to the supply pact.
""As a result of the high level of conformity of the 24 participating countries in the declaration of cooperation, the market has also responded very positively,"" he said.
""I am not hearing any diverging view that this market that has been out of balance since the fall of 2014 is finally coming back to a rebalanced market driven largely by fundamentals, assisted by the efforts of OPEC and non-OPEC (members).""

The supply pact is aimed at reducing oil stocks in OECD industrialized countries to their five-year average and the latest figures suggest OPEC is more than halfway there.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude December contract was down12 cents or about 0.21% at $57.23a barrel by 09:50 a.m. ET (13:50 GMT),not far from Monday's two-year peak of $57.55.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for January delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was down 43 cents or about 0.65% at $63.85 a barrel, just off a two-year high of $64.42 hit overnight
Oil prices were boosted by potential supply disruptions following a number of corruption arrests that targeted royal family members and ministers in Saudi Arabia.
The weekend purge included a wave of arrests of Saudi Arabian princes, businessmen and government ministers in what has been billed as an anticorruption crackdown but is seen by some as a consolidation of power by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.
Saudi Arabia is among the world’s top producers of oil and OPEC’s most influential member.
Prices have also been supported in recent weeks by expectations that oil producing countries will agree to extend an output cut at their meeting at the end of this month.
Under the original terms of the deal, OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine more months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Discussions are continuing in the run-up to the Nov. 30 meeting, which oil ministers from OPEC and the participating non-OPEC countries will attend.
Meanwhile, investors looked ahead to weekly data from the U.S. on stockpiles of crude and refined products to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30 p.m. ET (20:30 GMT) on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 2.8 million barrels, which would mark the second weekly decline in a row.

1310,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 07, 2017 09:01AM ET</span>",OPEC Sees U.S. Shale Oil Powering Ahead After Cuts Boost Prices,"(Bloomberg) -- OPEC said shale oil production will grow considerably faster than expected over the next four years after the group’s output cuts triggered a crude-price recovery that helped U.S. producers.
North American shale output will soar to 7.5 million barrels a day in 2021, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said in its World Oil Outlook report on Tuesday. That’s 56 percent higher than it forecast a year ago. The revised outlook illustrates OPEC’s dilemma: with supply curbs also helping its rivals, demand for the group’s crude will remain little changed until shale oil output peaks after 2025.
U.S. shale oil “most strikingly” exceeds previous expectations after showing the “resilience and ability to bounce back,” OPEC said. “This growth is heavily front-loaded, as drillers seek out and aggressively produce barrels from sweet spots in the Permian and other basins.”
OPEC assumes shale oil production growth will mostly originate from the U.S., with some contribution from Canada, Argentina and Russia over the forecast period to 2022. North American shale production for 2017 is now seen at 5.1 million barrels a day, up by almost a quarter from last year’s World Oil Outlook report.
OPEC and its partners, including Russia, are meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30 to decide whether to extend the deal to curb production beyond the end of March. Since Jan. 1, they’ve targeted output cuts of about 1.8 million barrels a day in a bid to reduce global stockpiles.
Brent crude has rebounded more than 10 percent this year, trading at more than $62 a barrel in London.
OPEC expects shale oil production to peak after 2025 and decline from about 2030. OPEC will then be required to increase its own output from about 33 million barrels a day in 2025 to 41.4 million in 2040, according to the report.
OPEC raised its forecast for global oil demand by 2.3 million barrels a day in 2021 compared with last year’s report. The group said demand growth will be particularly robust in 2020 as regulations to reduce shipping pollution kick in, leading to higher refinery runs to provide the required fuels.
OPEC also raised its oil demand forecast in 2040 by 1.7 million barrels a day to about 111 million barrels. China and India will lead the demand growth, offsetting declines in developed nations, it said.

U.S. natural gas futures shed 2.5 cents, or around 0.8%, to $3.109 per million British thermal units by 8:35AM ET (1335GMT). It reached its best level since Sept. 20 at $3.148 earlier in the session.
Futures surged 5% on Monday, the biggest single-session jump since Oct. 30., as traders reacted to bullish weather forecasts for most parts of the United States over the next two weeks, that should lead to an increase in heating demand.
Temperatures are forecast to dip well below normal from the U.S. Pacific Northwest to the Northeast through Nov. 10.
Natural gas prices typically rise ahead of the winter as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build of approximately 8 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Nov 3. That compares with a gain of 65 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 54 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 45 bcf.
If confirmed, that would be the smallest increase for this time of year since supplies of the heating fuel declined in 2006.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.775 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 180 bcf, or around 4.5%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 41 bcf, or roughly 1.1%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

1313,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2017 07:27AM ET</span>",BP joins Shell in helping Mexico execute oil hedge: sources,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) -  BP  (L:BP) helped Mexico execute its 2018 oil hedge, the biggest in the industry, becoming the second major after Shell to participate in the highly coveted program and challenging the traditional role of banks in the operation.
Three industry sources said BP has become a participant of the 2018 program on which Mexico spent some $1.26 billion to hedge its 2018 oil exports against oil price falls as part of government's efforts to stabilize its budget.
BP declined to comment.
BP joins rival Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), which made a first foray last year to become the first major to challenge years of dominance of big Wall Street banks in the program.
Shell declined to comment.
Banks such as Goldman Sachs (N:GS), Citi (N:C) and JPMorgan (N:JPM) have dominated Mexico's program for years but their role has diminished with tighter regulations on bank commodity trading, including a near total ban on proprietary trading.
Commodities-related revenue across Wall Street banks broadly tumbled in the first half of 2017 to its lowest level since at least 2006, consultancy Coalition said in a report. 
This was due mainly to a drop in client activity and a slump in trading performance in the energy sector.
Mexico did not disclose the volumes of oil hedged nor detail of the average price per barrel of put options that the government has purchased.
In September, the finance ministry proposed a 2018 budget that based expected oil export revenue on an estimate of $46 per barrel. In October, members of Congress increased that estimate to $48.5 per barrel as global oil prices rose.
On Tuesday, Brent oil prices stood at $64 per barrel.
For more than a decade, Mexico's government has paid for a hedge every year in a bid to guarantee its revenues from oil exports by state company Pemex. The program is seen as the world's top sovereign derivatives trade.
Last year, the government bought put options at an average price of $38 per barrel to cover 250 million barrels of crude at a cost of $1.03 billion and underpin the 2017 budget, which was based on an average price of $42 per barrel.
This year, Mexico is on track to not see any income from its oil hedge as prices for Mexican crude trade well above $50 per barrel. In 2016, Mexico saw a $2.65 billion payout from its oil hedge.
Mexico used to receive about one-third of federal revenues from oil sales, but it now funds less than one-fifth of the budget with oil sales after the collapse of crude prices in late 2014 and a decline in production.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 07, 2017 06:20AM ET</span>",China to pledge more U.S. soy imports during Trump visit,"By Benjamin Kang Lim and Dominique Patton
BEIJING (Reuters) - China will commit to buy more U.S. soybeans during President Donald Trump's visit to Beijing this week, a U.S. industry official said, underlining the importance of trade in farm goods even as tensions grow between the world's top two economies.
China is the world's biggest soybean importer and the U.S. is its second largest supplier. 
Chinese soybean buyers will sign a letter of intent with the U.S. Soybean Export Council committing to purchasing a certain volume of soybeans in the future, Paul Burke, the body's North Asia regional director, told Reuters by phone on Tuesday.
He declined to disclose the volume of beans to be included in the agreement. But Chinese importers said in July they would buy 12.53 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans, the second largest such agreement.
The volume under the new deal will be ""much less"" and will reflect orders due to be signed in the current marketing year that were not included in the July agreement, said Burke.
But China will also promise to buy more U.S. soybeans in future, according to a source familiar with the plan.
A signing ceremony is scheduled to take place as Trump meets Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
China will also promise to buy more U.S. beef, barley and dairy products, including cheese, the source said. China dropped a 14-year ban on U.S. beef imports this year.
Agriculture trade has been a bright spot in U.S.-China relations under Trump's administration, unlike other sectors such as steel and aluminum where the two countries have faced disputes.
A separate purchase agreement between a Chinese firm and a U.S. agricultural products exporter will also be signed, said Burke, adding he was not aware of details.
Major grains trading house ADM (N:ADM) was on an initial list seen by Reuters of U.S. companies taking part in a trade mission accompanying Trump to China but ADM has not confirmed its participation. 
The U.S. sold 20.7 million tonnes of beans to China in the first nine months of this year, up 14.8 percent from a year ago. In 2016, it sold 38.2 million tonnes, or 40 percent of China's total soybean imports. 
China is expected to import 96 million tonnes of soybeans in the 2017/18 marketing year, up from 93.5 million tonnes previously, according to the China National Grain and Oils Information Centre, an official think-tank.

The dealmaking comes as U.S. farmers seek to export more beans after growing another record crop but with top exporter Brazil set to steal a share of their sales during the peak selling season.

“Everybody recognises that (the) job is not done yet by any means, we still have significant amount of work to do to bring inventories down. Mission is not yet complete, more needs to be done,” he added.
In May, Opec producers agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.2 million bpd agreed in November last year.
In the U.S. meanwhile, traders continued to cheer data pointing to tightening in production after Baker Huges reported Friday that the number of oil rigs operating in the US fell by eight to 729."

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $11.72, or 0.93%, to $1280.96 a troy ounce.
Gold prices made a strong start to the week as investors piled into the precious metal amid growing political uncertainty in the Middle East after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman led an anti-corruption drive which resulted in a series of arrests of prominent Saudi Arabians.
“We have political uncertainty, risk of political instability in this major oil producing country [Saudi Arabia] and also unforeseen implications for the entire region,” Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said.
A retreat in the dollar, meanwhile, also underpinned a move higher in gold prices as investor concerns grew over the leadership of the Federal Reserve after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York confirmed that William Dudley was preparing to retire earlier than planned.
Gold prices are sensitive to moves lower in the U.S. dollar – A lower dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency, thus, increases demand.
Despite data showing market participants increased their bullish bets on the precious metal last week, traders expected gold prices to remain range bound with biased toward the downside. 
Net bullish bets on gold rose to 193,100, from 191,400 the previous week according to a report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday.
""Speculative financial investors are still withdrawing from gold,"" Commerzbank said on Monday. 
In other precious metal trade, silver futures added 2.28% to $17.22 a troy ounce, while platinum futures rose 1.56% to $936.25.
Copper traded at $3.16, up 1.33% while natural gas rose by 4.79% to $3.13. 
The uptick in natural gas prices comes as Commodity Weather Group said it expected below-normal temperatures in U.S. Pacific Northwest, Midwest and parts of Northeast between Nov. 6-10."

Other members of the consortium include Norwegian oil firm  Statoil  (OL:STL), trading houses Gunvor, Koch Supply & Trading, and Mercuria, and banks ABN Amro, ING and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
Blockchain technology, which first emerged as the architecture underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin, uses a shared database that updates itself in real-time and can process and settle transactions in minutes using computer algorithms, with no need for third-party verification.
Mercuria has been a vocal advocate of implementing blockchain technology to significantly cut costs in oil trading.
""Ideally, it would help to eliminate any confusion over ownership of a cargo and potentially help to make managing risk more exact if there are accurate timestamps to each part of the trade,"" said Edward Bell, commodities analyst at Dubai-based lender Emirates NBD PJSC.
Similar efforts for an energy trading platform have failed to take off, Bell said, but added this latest bid with backing from BP and Shell and the banks, ""may have more success than if it were an independent party trying to convince oil and gas companies to make use of it.""
The new venture is seeking regulatory approvals and would be run as an independent entity, the consortium said in a statement.
""The platform aims to reduce administrative operational risks and costs of physical energy trading, and improve the reliability and efficiency of back-end trading operations...,"" the statement said.

Their IPO is expected to be the biggest in history, floating 5% of shares at a predicted price of $100 billion. That would give Aramco a $2 trillion valuation. While Saudi Arabia is working on a domestic listing, they are also considering a flotation abroad, in New York, London, Hong Kong, or Tokyo. On Saturday, President Trump sounded eager for the Saudis to choose America, tweeting he: “Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange. Important to the United States!” (Insert image of tweet) Despite trump’s enthusiasm, questions remain whether the United States is a viable option for Aramco. The U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act which passed last September would allow Saudi Arabia to be sued on the grounds that it helped plan the 9/11 attacks on the United States. Such litigation risks could force the Saudi government which owns Aramco to choose a different location. Meanwhile, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority is looking to roll back regulatory requirements for government-owned companies, which would make things easier for Aramco. What Aramco decides to do remains to be seen. According to the Financial Times, a final decision on the structure of the IPO is expected to come by the end of the year. "

Natural gas prices typically rise ahead of the winter as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
U.S. natural gas futures jumped almost eight cents, or around 3%, to $3.065 per million British thermal units by 8:00AM ET (1300GMT). It reached its best level since Sept. 21 at $3.095 earlier.
Futures rose around 0.7% last week as traders monitored near-term weather models to gauge demand for the heating fuel.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 11 and 21 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Nov 3.
That compares with a gain of 65 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 54 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 45 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.775 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 180 bcf, or around 4.5%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 41 bcf, or roughly 1.1%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

1334,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 05, 2017 08:31PM ET</span>",How China Drew Respect From Greens While Boosting Its Pollution,"(Bloomberg) -- If politics make strange bedfellows, few are more unlikely than the growing link between China and the environmentalists seeking to rein in climate change.
The nation that spews the most pollution and is building dozens of coal-fired power plants is also winning accolades from the likes of Greenpeace and WWF for its efforts to fight global warming and steer an eventual path away from fossil fuels.
“Air quality kills competitiveness, kills people -- that’s a big driver for China,” said Rachel Kyte, a United Nations special representative who leads the Sustainable Energy for All program. “How that translates into their leadership beyond the way they’re already leading is something that will be important to watch.”
Once a wrecker of global warming deals, China under President Xi Jinping is moving to shape the consensus on how to rein in greenhouse gases after President Donald Trump decided to scale back U.S. involvement. China’s ambitions on climate will be on display this week, when Trump arrives in Beijing on Nov. 8 to meet Xi, and on the other side of the world where envoys from almost 200 nations gather starting Monday in Bonn for UN climate talks. 
Xi is seeking to translate his prestige into gains for China’s diplomatic and trade agenda, opening doors for its rapidly-expanding clean energy businesses -- especially the solar panel making industry it dominates. The nation’s central role on climate may both reduce friction between richer and poorer countries that held up deals in the past and weaken rules designed to bring transparency to measuring pollution. 
For now, environmental groups are praising Xi’s handling of both climate and Trump. Part of is out of necessity: the practices they use in the west of confront and protest wouldn’t work with China. Also, the green groups remain critical of China and have long suggested ways it can clean up its industry.
Still, the words green groups use indicate they want Xi as an ally -- and a foil against Trump. Shuo Li, a senior global policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia, said China has been effective in working around Trump on climate using “a soft approach without direct confrontation.” At WWF, Lou Leonard said the nation has no choice but to work on reducing its footprint on the environment.
“They’re either going to be seen as a constructive proactive force or they’re going to be seen as a big part of the problem,” said Leonard, who is the group’s senior vice president on climate and energy. “They’re the world’s largest annual emitter now.”
Praise for China on the environment is remarkable given the scale of its emissions and that the government has said pollution won’t peak until 2030. While photovoltaic makers including Trina Solar Ltd. and JA Solar Holding Co. are stepping up capacity to feed booming demand at home and abroad, energy in China is dominated by fossil fuels.
China surpassed the U.S. as the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2006 and is now responsible for 27 percent global pollution, according  BP  (LON:BP) Plc. As the U.S. and Europe retire their dirtiest power plants, China by 2040 will install 26 percent of all the new coal-fired generation, according to International Energy Agency data.
“It’s easy for environmental activists to point to the amount of money that China is spending on renewables or the fact that they’re engaged in Paris,” said Nicolas Loris, research manager for energy and environment at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington. “I don’t know if the outcome of China doing those things will result in any averted warming. They continue to rely on and build conventional power plants.”
Loris is concerned China will water down standards on how countries measure carbon dioxide coming from industry, leaving scientists less certainty over the path of emissions and the outlook for temperatures.
“I don’t know how much they can be trusted in terms of reducing their CO2 emissions and actually reporting an accurate assessment,” Loris said.
China may use its leverage on the environment to open up trade -- or to choke it off with unsupportive countries, said Tim Yeo, a former U.K. lawmaker who follows climate policy and now leads New Nuclear Watch Europe, an industry-funded lobby group.
“They won’t talk about it until they know they can beat most people, and then they’ll say they’re imposing trade sanctions,” Yeo said in an interview. “They want to have more economic power.”
Growing Assertion
Evidence of China’s assertive stance is gathering, with Xi picking allies to help shape the agenda at the UN talks and beyond. 
Just days after Trump announced the U.S. was pulling out of the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, Xi met with California Governor Jerry Brown for almost an hour. Trump’s Energy Secretary Rick Perry was offered a relatively low level meeting with an official who ranked seventh in the command structure at the time.
Xi, setting out a vision for the country at the Party Congress last month, noted China “is approaching the center of the world stage.” On the environment, his aspirations may be for a gradual shift. Xie Zhenhua, the country’s special representative on climate, said at a briefing last week that China would uphold commitments under the Paris accord, but he also encouraged the U.S. to remain engaged.
“We hope the U.S. can come back to the big family of the Paris pact again,” Xie said in Beijing. 
In the wake of Trump’s decision to exit, Xi himself has tried to rally the world behind the Paris deal. He has signed agreements with other big polluters including the European Union and Canada to keep up the pressure on reducing emissions while giving speeches reaffirming China’s central role in the debate.

It’s a big shift from 2009, when China helped bring down a global deal on climate at the UN talks in Copenhagen.
“China has increased its leadership. That’s a matter of fact,” said Nicholas Stern, a former World Bank chief economist who has advised the U.K. and European governments on climate policy.

Chief Edwin Clark, who leads the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), which has been holding peace talks with the government since last year, called on the Niger Delta Avengers militant group to ""be patient.""
The Avengers, whose attacks last year wrought havoc on the nation's oil output, promised on Friday a ""brutish, brutal and bloody"" return to violence because they said they had ""lost faith"" in local leaders to get what they wanted from the government.
""This is not the time to resume hostilities,"" Clark said in a statement issued by the Presidential Amnesty Programme. ""It is true that the federal government has not been quite serious about the negotiations, but we are asking the Niger Delta Avengers to maintain the peace.""
He added that PANDEF was sending a delegation to meet the group's leaders.
The Avengers, like many in the Niger Delta, say they want a greater share of Nigeria's energy wealth to stay in the impoverished swampland region, which produces the bulk of the oil but is largely underdeveloped.
The statement came after a government delegation led by Brigadier General Paul Boroh, special adviser to the president on the Niger Delta, visited Clark at his Abuja home on Sunday. Clark said Boroh assured him that the talks were ""back on track"", and that PANDEF leaders would meet soon in Warri.
The 2016 attacks slashed oil output to close to 1 million barrels per day from roughly 2.2 million bpd. That along with low oil prices pushed the nation into its first recession in 25 years.

1338,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 05, 2017 06:04AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices - Weekly Outlook: November 6 - 10,"Investing.com - Oil prices extended their recent rally on Friday to reach the highest level in more than two years amid expectations that major global producers will extend a deal to curb production beyond its current expiry date next March.
Prices received another boost as a sizable weekly drop in active U.S. oil rigs fed expectations for a slowdown in domestic crude output growth.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil fell by eight to 729 last week. That was the fourth weekly decline in five.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for domestic oil production.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures surged $1.10, or around 2%, to end at $55.64 a barrel by close of trade. It reached its best level since July 2015 at $55.76 earlier in the session.
It ended around 3.2% higher for the week, up a fourth-straight week.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., jumped $1.45, or roughly 2.4%, to settle at $62.07 a barrel. It touched an intraday peak of $62.23, a level not seen since July 2015.
The global benchmark ended the week with an increase of approximately 2.7%, the fourth-straight weekly gain.
Oil prices extended a rally which began in early October, largely driven by hopes that oil producing countries will agree to extend an output cut at their meeting at the end of this month.
Under the original terms of the deal, OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine more months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Discussions are continuing in the run-up to the Nov. 30 meeting, which oil ministers from OPEC and the participating non-OPEC countries will attend.
In other energy trading Friday, gasoline futures advanced 2.3 cents, or 1.3%, to end at $1.793 on Friday. It closed up around 1.4% for the week.
Heating oil rose 3.2 cents, or 1.7%, at $1.886 a gallon, ending roughly 1% higher for the week.
Natural gas futures spiked 4.9 cents, or almost 1.7%, to settle at $2.984 per million British thermal units. It traded around 0.7% higher for the week.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.

Falih met his counterparts from Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in Tashkent on Saturday. The Saudi minister said after the meeting that more work was needed to cut inventories.
""Uzbekistan has responded (positively) to participating at the Vienna meeting this month, and has expressed its readiness to attend as an observer,"" Falih said on his Twitter account.
Uzbekistan is a small oil producer with around 594 million barrels of proven crude oil reserves. In 2015, its total petroleum and other liquids production was 78,900 barrels per day (bpd), according to the EIA.
Saudi Arabia and Russia are leading a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to cut oil supply, with the aim of draining global inventories and propping up oil prices. 
OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, has been urging other producers to join the supply cut pact. Riyadh holds the presidency of OPEC this year.
The involvement of Uzbekistan is a sign of how the pact is gaining more support from other producers, OPEC sources said.
OPEC, Russia and other oil producers are due to meet on Nov. 30 in Vienna to decide whether to extend the current agreement which expires in March 2018.

1340,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2017 09:20PM ET</span>",U.S. shale producers promise both higher output and returns,"By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are telling investors impatient for better returns that they can keep boosting oil output aggressively and do so while still making money for shareholders.
Investors have pushed top U.S. shale companies to focus on returns, rather than higher output, a move that threatened to slow the breakneck growth in supply sparked by the shale revolution in the world's top oil consumer.
For the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, slower shale production gains would have been welcome. The cartel this year put caps on its members' production to end a supply glut and boost oil prices, only to find U.S. shale gains and record exports muting the impact of their curbs. 
But in comments during recent third-quarter earnings calls, shale executives signaled they expect to deliver both higher returns and output. 
At least seven of the largest U.S. shale companies, including  Noble Energy  Inc (N:NBL) and  Devon Energy  Corp (N:DVN), forecast 10 percent or better production gains this quarter in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield. 
Underpinning the effort: Rising global oil demand and crude (CLc1) prices that are up about 30 percent since June lows. Shale producers are also proving they can drive output higher even after several last summer reported some Permian wells had begun delivering more natural gas, a sign of aging fields.
""I'd like to think the industry is changing for the better,"" said Todd Heltman of wealth manager Neuberger Berman, which invests in shale producers. ""Investors are more focused on return metrics."" 
Devon plans to boost oil production this quarter by 20 percent from the Permian and Oklahoma shale plays and spend less on each new well. 
""We are taking the appropriate steps to become an industry leader with our disciplined approach to capital allocation,"" said Devon Chief Executive Dave Hager.
U.S. shale output is expected to hit 6.1 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) this month, up 35 percent from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
The inventory of drilled-but-uncompleted wells, a backlog for future output, in September reached 7,120, up 42.6 percent from the year-ago period, and an all-time high. While the number of oil drilling rigs in the United States has slid in recent months, each rig's efficiency has jumped sharply in the past year. 
EOG Resources Inc (N:EOG) boosted third-quarter production by 8 percent and swung to a $100 million profit, from a loss in the same period last year, helped in part by rising oil prices. CEO Bill Thomas said the company is aiming for 20 percent increase in U.S. crude output this year over last. Its stock is up nearly 17 percent since August.
Noble Energy forecast its fourth-quarter shale production will rise 15 percent to at least 102,000 bpd.
""If you look at the growth from our Permian Basin drilling operations, you can see very substantial increases in oil production growth of about 15 percent,"" said Tim Dove, CEO of  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co (N:PXD).
Pioneer, one of the largest Permian oil producers, plans to boost its shale output by at least 16,000 bpd this quarter. The company's shares are up 15.4 percent since early August. 
Next year could bring more of the same gains. 
""We are excited about the trajectory of production growth in the upcoming quarters,"" said Vicki Hollub, CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY), another top Permian producer. Oxy projects its Texas oil output will rise by more than 80,000 bpd by the end of 2018, to more than 200,000 bpd. 
Shale producers outside Texas are cranking up production, too. 
 Whiting Petroleum Corp  (N:WLL), which operates in North Dakota's Bakken shale, plans a 10 percent jump in its fourth-quarter production.
""We're confident about the areas in which we're drilling through to the end of the year and really, through the end of 2018,"" said Jim Volker, who retired as Whiting's CEO this week.
 Continental Resources Inc  (N:CLR) and  Parsley Energy  Inc (N:PE), two other large U.S. shale producers, are due to report quarterly results next week. 
OPEC TENSION 
U.S. shale increases are keenly watched by OPEC, and likely will be in the spotlight when the group and other major producers meet on Nov. 30 in Vienna. 
Emmanuel Kachikwu, Nigeria's oil minister, warned at the last OPEC meeting in May that the group would ""sit down again and look at what process it is we need to do"" if U.S. shale output continues to weigh on global markets.
Adding to the pressures, major oil companies that were late to recognize shale's potential have brought their own resources to bear.  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM)are setting out aggressive plans for U.S. shale production, especially in the Permian.
Exxon, which more than doubled its Permian holdings earlier this year, plans to boost the number of drilling rigs there by 50 percent, to 30, by the end of next year. By 2020, Exxon expects its Permian oil production to rise 45 percent.
Chevron, which has operated in the Permian since the 1930s, recently added a 15th drilling rig in the Permian, with plans to add five more.

""We'll be in a position to grow production for a period of years just from the shale,"" Chevron CEO John Watson said of the company's Permian operations.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for December delivery rose $1.10 cents to settle at $55.64 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added $1.50 to trade at $62.12 a barrel.
Crude oil settled at two-year highs amid a spike in sentiment on oil prices after the number of oil rigs operating in the US fell by eight to 729, declining for the fourth week in five, according to data from energy services firm Baker Hughes.
That was the first time since May 26 that oil rig counts fell below 730, fueling expectations that market rebalancing is well underway as data earlier this week showed Opec members continued to cut output.
Saudi Arabia continued to cut oil output as inventories declined significantly in October, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Thursday, describing compliance with the Opec-led accord to curb output as ""excellent.""
Russian also adhered to the cuts stipulated in the output-cut agreement despite increasing output to 10.93 million bpd in October from 10.91 million bpd in September, official data showed Thursday.
In May, Opec producers agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.2 million bpd agreed in November last year.
The rally in crude oil prices comes as investor optimism on an extension of the Opec-led agreement following recent comments from both Opec and non-opec officials ahead of the Opec meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30."
1342,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2017 02:20PM ET</span>",Nigeria's 'Delta Avengers' militants end oil hub ceasefire,"By Alexis Akwagyiram
LAGOS (Reuters) - A Nigerian militant group whose attacks on energy facilities in the Niger Delta last year helped push Africa's biggest economy into recession said on Friday it had ended its ceasefire.
The Niger Delta Avengers announced a halt to hostilities in August 2016, although they carried out attacks in October and November last year.
""Niger Delta Avenger's ceasefire on Operation Red Economy is officially over,"" the group said on its website ( http://www.nigerdeltaavengers.org/ ).
""Our next line of operation will not be like the 2016 campaign which we operated successfully without any casualties; this outing will be brutish, brutal and bloody,"" it said in a section of its statement addressed to oil companies.
The move threatens Nigeria's fragile economic growth and poses a further security challenge for President Muhammadu Buhari, in addition to the jihadist Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast and rising secessionist sentiments in the southeast.
The government has been in talks for more than a year to address grievances over poverty and oil pollution but local groups have complained that no progress has been made, despite Buhari receiving a list of demands at a meeting last November.
Buhari's office did not immediately comment.
The 2016 attacks cut oil production from a peak of 2.2 million barrels per day (mbpd) to near 1 mbpd, the lowest level in Africa's top oil producer for at least 30 years.
The attacks, combined with low oil prices, caused the OPEC member's first recession in 25 years. Crude sales make up two-thirds of government revenue and most of its foreign exchange. Nigeria came out of recession in the second quarter of this year, mostly due to the rise in oil production after attacks stopped and as prices strengthened.
The Niger Delta Avengers, who say they want a greater share of Nigeria's energy wealth to go to the impoverished swampland region, said they decided to end the ceasefire because they had ""lost faith"" in local leaders.
""We can assure you that every oil installation in our region will feel the warmth of the wrath of the Niger Delta Avengers,"" it said.
There have been no substantial attacks in the region since January.
Eric Omare, president of the Ijaw Youth Council, which represents the largest ethnic group in the Niger Delta, said the government had paid only ""lip service"" to communities' concerns.
""The truth is that the federal government has not demonstrated any seriousness towards addressing the issues that led to the Niger Delta agitation,"" Omare said, while adding that his group sought a ""peaceful dialogue.""
Nigeria's economy grew 0.55 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, largely on higher oil receipts.
The World Bank cut its 2017 growth forecast in October to 1 percent from 1.2 percent as the oil production increase was lower than expected and non-oil sector growth was subdued.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $7.98, or 0.62%, to $1270.13 a troy ounce.
Gold prices remained on track to post a three-week losing streak amid ongoing risk-on sentiment as service sector growth offset data pointing to labor market weakness. 
ISM nonmanufacturing data for October showed an uptick to 60.1, beating expectations of 58.5. That was the highest reading for the service sector index since 2005.
The upbeat nonmanufacturing report raised investor expectations of bullish U.S. economic growth, spurring a rebound on the dollar, which pressured gold prices to sink to session lows.
The U.S. economy added 261,000 jobs in October, the Department of Labor said Friday, that missed economists’ estimates for 310,000 new jobs.
The jobless rate remained steady at 4.2% while average hourly earnings was sluggish with growth roughly flat for the month.
Analysts noted, however, that while weaker wage growth could weigh on markets it is unlikely to derail the Fed’s plan to raise rates in December, 
“Flat wages doesn’t concern us too much,” analysts at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) said. “We do think wage pressure could start to weigh on the markets next year in a tight labor market.”
Gold prices are sensitive to moves higher in interest rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday, nearing their highest levels in more than two years, with buyers attracted by expectations of an extension to a global pact to cut output that has reduced oversupply.
Global benchmark Brent futures (LCOc1) traded up 45 cents at $61.07 a barrel at 0914 GMT, approaching levels around $61.70 a barrel last seen in July 2015. Brent has risen around 38 percent since its low in 2017 reached in June.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) traded at $54.92 a barrel, up 38 cents. WTI is around 31 percent above its 2017 low hit June.
This week's U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) report on crude inventories and exports showed a large draw in U.S. stocks, showing that market is rebalancing.
""Wednesday's EIA report was bullish so the longs took profit then but now the uptrend is reasserting itself. Roll-over of the OPEC/non-OPEC deal looks certain and is also supportive,"" said Tamas Varga, senior analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets at the end of November to discuss further action after it agreed nearly a year ago with Russia and other producers to hold back 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil supply.
Russia said on Thursday the deal, which is due to expire in March, could be extended if necessary but that a decision was not imminent.
While supplies are being withheld, demand is also rising, especially in China, whose roughly 9 million bpd of imports have surpassed those of the United States to top the world's crude importer list.
""China's oil demand growth appears to be accelerating,"" investment bank Jefferies said.
Physical oil prices are also rising. Saudi Aramco, the UAE's ADNOC and Qatar Petroleum have all raised their crude prices for Asian buyers, with Aramco's December premium over the average of the Oman and Dubai benchmarks now at the highest in three years.

1347,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2017 05:10AM ET</span>",Weak U.S. demand for Basra crude wipes out premium for Iraq's oil,"By Florence Tan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Iraqi Basra crude cargoes in November have sold at the widest discounts to official prices in more than a year, with cargoes backed up after hurricanes hit the U.S. Gulf coast facing competition from Mexican crude, trade sources said on Friday.
The drop in U.S. demand for Iraqi oil may impede the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' second-largest producer's effort to increase exports from the southern port of Basra to make up for a shortfall from the north.
Basra crude shipments have been backed up after four hurricanes disrupted arrivals into the U.S. Gulf between August and October. 
More than 22 million barrels of Basra crude were due to land in the United States in both October and November, trade flow data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed, the highest monthly volumes since data tracking started in 2015.
But some of the cargoes remain unsold as crude from Mexico has filled some U.S. demand, a Singapore-based trader said.
U.S. imports of Mexican crude hit a four-month high of 21.3 million barrels in October, data showed, after earthquakes and storm damage shut Mexico's biggest refinery for most of the month.
""The hurricanes caused an overhang of Basra crude while more Mexican oil was sold into the U.S. because of the refinery turnaround,"" the trader said. 
November-loading Basra Light discounts widened to 30 cents to 70 cents a barrel to OSPs. In the previous month the price ranged from a premium of 30 cents to a discount of 10 cents, depending on the cargo's destination. 
Premiums for November-loading Basra Heavy slipped to 10 cents to 50 cents to official prices, they said, from premiums of 80 cents to $1 the previous month.
They declined to be named as they are not authorized to talk to the media.
To cope with Basra crude surplus in the United States, traders have slowed ships and stored some cargoes off the Gulf coast, shipping data on Eikon showed.
For example, supertanker New Achievement, carrying 2 million barrels of Basra crude, has been parked in the U.S. Gulf since Oct 8.
The big discounts for Basra are attracting demand from Asian refiners, the sources said. 
December-loading Basra crude for Asia has been sold at a discount of about 50 cents as Iraq is likely to raise monthly official prices in line with Saudi Arabia while also increasing exports.
In a further blow to Iraq, it failed to attract any bids for prompt-loading Basra crude to Europe in an auction on Tuesday.

Saudi Arabia continued to cut oil output as inventories declined significantly in October, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Thursday while compliance with the OPEC-led accord to curb output had been “excellent”.
Falih also expressed a desire to continue with output curbs, saying that OPEC should work to ensure stockpiles continue to fall beyond March. OPEC is slated to next meet at its headquarters in Vienna on November 30.
In May, major oil producers agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March 2018.
Russian remained in compliance with its part of the accord despite increasing output to 10.93 million bpd in October from 10.91 million bpd in September, official data showed Thursday.
The U.S., however, continued to ramp up weekly production to 9.55 million bpd, up 46,000 from a week ago, while exports rose to an all-time high of 2.13 million barrels per day, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) said Wednesday.
The rise in production was offset by a steeper-than-expected draw in U.S. crude inventories, which fell 2.4 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 27 while gasoline inventories declined by 1.8 million barrels.
Later on Friday, market participants will also keep an eye on U.S. shale production when Baker Hughes releases its most recent weekly rig count data.

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2017 04:26AM ET</span>",Worried about Russia's march on grain markets? It could be worse,"By Polina Devitt
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian grain is flowing around the world in a way not seen since the last years of the Tsarist empire a century ago but the country's export expansion looks set to hit a wall because of a lack of infrastructure.
While Russia has increased its capacity to export grain ninefold over the last 15 years even that impressive increase will not be enough to keep pace with its 2017-18 grain harvest which is expected to be a record 133 million tonnes.
Out of that crop, 44.5 million tonnes are earmarked for export, up from 37.7 million a year earlier, according to SovEcon consultancy. Analysts and officials say that's about as much as the country's infrastructure can cope with for now.
""If it was not the issue of infrastructure we would be able to ship over 50-55 million tonnes,"" said Andrey Sizov, managing director of SovEcon, one of leading agriculture consultancies in Moscow.
Still, 45 million tonnes of wheat, maize, barley and other grains is already a marked improvement since Russia resumed grain exports in earnest in the early years of the 21st century.
In 2000-01, for example, Russia only exported about 1.3 million tonnes of grain, according to USDA data.
The surge in Russian exports has contributed to a global grain glut. The world's wheat market is set for a fifth surplus in a row in 2017-18 with stocks climbing to a record 268 million tonnes, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.
World wheat prices, meanwhile, have steadily declined. The Chicago Board of Trade's wheat futures contract  hit $9.16 a bushel in November 2012. It is now trading at $4.21 and fell below $4 in September last year for the first time since 2006. 
Russia is also set to overtake the United States as the world's biggest wheat exporter this year - regaining the top spot it last held before World War One - and cement its leading position over other major wheat exporters such as the European Union, Canada, Australia and Ukraine.
In a search for new markets for its grain, Russia has been building up exports to Asia countries such as Bangladesh and Indonesia, muscling in on markets traditionally supplied by Australia. 
Russia has also boosted grain exports to Morocco and several other markets traditionally supplied by France, taking advantage of a poor French crop last year.
TOUGH SITUATION
But fears Russia's exports will keep on rising look overdone, at least for the coming few years, given the practical constraints preventing it shipping even more of its rapidly increasing grain stocks, farmers and analysts said.
""There will be tough situation with port and transport infrastructure capacity this year, especially in the first half of the season,"" said Dmitry Rylko, head of the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies (IKAR) consultancy.
In the Soviet era, the country was mainly an importer of grain for domestic consumption and to supply its large dairy and meat industries - and much of the grain arrived at ports in what are now independent Baltic states.
But the collapse of the communist state devastated Russia's dairy and meat industries in the 1990s and freed up surplus grain that started to be exported after the turn of the century.
""In 2002, when we were only starting to export grain, the transhipment capacity in Russia was 5 million tonnes per year,"" said Agriculture Minister Alexander Tkachev.
""It is currently at 45 million tonnes, excluding the capacity which is currently being built or planned,"" he said.
To boost its capacity to ship grain after losing access to Baltic ports, Russia embarked on projects to build new terminals in the Black, Caspian and Azov seas and modernize grain terminals such as the Novorossiysk Grain Plant.
While more projects to boost Russia's export capacity are being built or discussed none is set to be completed before 2020, meaning the country is more likely to add to its grain stocks than flood the global market.
Forecasts for Russia's 2017-18 grain crop have been steadily upgraded in recent months but officials and analysts have left export estimates largely unchanged at about 45 million.
Arkady Zlochevsky, head of Grain Union, a non-state farmers' lobby group, said it would be good for Russia to export 55 million tonnes this season but it will only ship 45 million.
""Our supplies are limited with infrastructure and other difficulties,"" Zlochevsky told reporters last month.
UKRAINE COMPLICATIONS
Besides infrastructure constraints at home, Russia's ability to export grain has also been hampered by the conflict in Ukraine. It was common practice before Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014 for Russian traders to use Ukraine's Black Sea ports, which can ship 52 million tonnes of grain.
But those ports are no longer available to Russian traders. Ports such at Sevastopol and Kerch in Crimea have some capacity to export Russian grain but shipments have also been complicated by legal issues following the annexation.
Recognising its export limitations, Russia is upgrading some terminals and has plans to build one in the Black Sea port of Taman, as well as two more in the east near China. Investors are also considering construction of a grain terminal in Russia's Baltic Sea port of Ust-Luga.
Agriculture Minister Tkachev has said the planned terminals near China will add a total of 11 million tonnes to Russia's grain export capacity by about 2020, though some analysts say the infrastructure needed to feed these terminals means it could be longer before they are up and running.

IKAR's Rylko said it would be up to three years before all the projects improve the export situation significantly.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped 0.01% to $1277.97 a troy ounce.
Overnight, gold prices were roughly unchanged on Thursday supported by dollar weakness as investors looked ahead to President Donald Trump's choice of nominee to head the Federal Reserve.
Gold prices remained on track to snap a two-week losing streak amid dollar weakness despite upbeat labor market data lifting expectation for a bullish nonfarm payrolls report due Friday.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims fell 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 229,000 for the week ended Oct. 28, a steeper drop than economist had expected.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said that nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rose at a 3% annualized rate, outpacing economists’ forecasts of 2.4%.
The data comes amid speculation that President Donald Trump is set to nominate Fed governor Jerome Powell to lead the Federal Reserve in early February. Trump is expected announce his nominee for Fed chair at 3 p.m. ET.
Powell, a Republican, was appointed to the Fed’s board of governors in 2012 by President Barack Obama. He was confirmed for a full term in 2014.
The gradual path of monetary policy is not expected to change should Powell get the nod for the Fed’s top post as the governor shares a similar stance to current Fed chair Janet Yellen on monetary policy.
Gold prices are sensitive to moves higher in interest rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for December delivery rose 0.48% to $54.80 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 0.15% to $60.48 a barrel.
Crude oil prices settled higher on Thursday as ongoing Opec and non-Opec output cuts, fuelled expectations that global oil market rebalancing was underway.
Saudi Arabia continued to cut oil output as inventories declined significantly in October, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said Thursday while compliance with the Opec-led accord to curb output had been ""excellent.""
Falih also expressed a desire to continue with output curbs, saying that Opec should work to ensure stockpiles continue to fall beyond March. Opec is slated to next meet at its headquarters in Vienna on Nov. 30.
In May, Opec producers agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.2 million bpd agreed in November last year.
Russian remained in compliance with oil output cuts despite increasing output to 10.93 million bpd in October from 10.91 million bpd in September, official data showed Thursday.
The U.S., however, continued to ramp up weekly production to 9.55 million bpd, up 46,000 from a week ago, while exports rose to an all-time high of 2.13 million barrels per day, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) said Wednesday.
The rise in production was offset by a steeper-than-expected draw in U.S. crude inventories, which fell 2.4 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 27 while gasoline inventories decline by 1.8 million barrels.
Traders are expected closely monitor oil rig data slated for Friday for an insight into U.S. oil production and demand.

Bullion for immediate delivery advanced 0.1 percent to $1,276.04 at 3:42 p.m. in New York. The metal earlier rose as much as 0.8 percent to $1,284.23 an ounce, the highest since Oct. 20. Fed Governor Powell has been supportive of current Chair Janet Yellen’s strategy of gradual tightening.
gold has advanced about 11 percent this year, building on gains in 2016 as U.S. policy makers opted for two rate increases. They also took the first steps in paring the bank’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet that was amassed as the Fed undertook an unprecedented program to revive the world’s top economy. On Thursday, the Bank of England raised rates for the first time in more than 10 years while indicating another increase isn’t imminent.
The next Fed chair “will be a continuation of Yellen,” Bob Haberkorn, a senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. It’ll probably be “a continuation of the same rate plan we’ve been seeing over the past two years. Gold’s upside will be limited between now and the next Fed meeting. There will be a reluctance to add to positions unless there’s some geopolitical event.”
The U.S. central bank upgraded its assessment of the economy and reinforced expectations of a December hike at the end of its policy-setting meeting Wednesday. Investors are also weighing uncertainty about the prospects of Trump’s U.S. tax cuts.
House Republican leaders began rolling out a tax bill Thursday that contains sweeping changes for business and individual taxes. The bill ran into opposition almost immediately.
Powell’s appointment to the biggest job in the financial world is subject to Senate confirmation. He’s been a Fed governor since 2012, and in that time has never dissented from a monetary-policy decision. The Washington native would be taking over at a tricky time, with inflation well below the bank’s 2 percent target, while asset prices are at levels considered lofty by policy makers.

Futures rose by 0.4 percent in New York to the highest settlement since July 2015. Oil chiefs from Saudi Arabia and Iraq expressed confidence the historic accord between OPEC and other major crude suppliers that has trimmed stockpiles will be extended beyond its March expiration. Saudi Arabia and Iraq together account for almost half of the barrels OPEC produces.
There is growing optimism among investors about the longevity of the OPEC-led agreement, Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts, said by telephone. “We are seeing more balanced markets than we’ve had since 2014.”
Oil has climbed more than 15 percent since the beginning of September on signs that global supplies are tightening and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers may extend their efforts. In the U.S., crude stockpiles slid to the lowest level since January 2016 last week, according to an Energy Information Administration report on Wednesday.
Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih said in Bangkok that he expects “improving market conditions to continue, and as my colleagues in OPEC and non-OPEC gather in four weeks in Vienna, I expect that we will renew our resolve to return already improving global inventories to their normal levels.”
Iraq Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi told reporters in Baghdad that it backs any OPEC decision to help support oil prices. Meanwhile, Kuwait also expects an extension to be formalized at the Nov. 30 gathering, said Issam Almarzooq, the nation’s oil minister. West Texas Intermediate for December delivery rose 24 cents to settle at $54.54 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after switching between gains and losses during the session. Total volume traded was about 26 percent below the 100-day average.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Thursday, steadying near two-year highs as the outlook remained upbeat as OPEC-led supply cuts have tightened the market and drained inventories.
Brent crude (LCOc1) settled up 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $60.62 per barrel. The benchmark hit $61.70 on Wednesday, its highest intraday level since July 2015. The contract is up by more than a third from its 2017-lows in June.
U.S. crude (CLc1) ended 24 cents, or 0.4 percent, higher at $54.54, almost 30 percent above its 2017-lows in June.
Confidence has been fueled by an effort this year lead by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia to hold back about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in oil production to tighten markets.
Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said supply and demand balances were tightening and oil inventories falling, while compliance with the OPEC-led pact to curb supplies had been ""excellent"".
""Compliance as a whole for OPEC [ended] up being rather strong,"" said Mark Watkins, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank. ""Now that we've flipped the calendar to November we have the OPEC meeting at the end of the month. There's expectation that there will be positive comments about extending the cuts past March.""
The pact to withhold supplies runs to March 2018, but there is growing consensus to extend the deal to cover all of next year.
Iraq's oil minister said that OPEC's second-largest producer supports keeping curbs on global oil supply to bolster prices, adding $60 per barrel would be an acceptable target price for his country.
The energy ministers of Russia and Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil producers, were expected to travel to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on Thursday night, two sources told Reuters. Both said the ministers were expected to give a briefing.
Oil was also supported by falling U.S. commercial crude inventories despite rising output.
U.S. crude oil inventories fell 2.4 million barrels last week despite a 46,000 bpd increase in production to 9.55 million bpd.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it expected year-on-year U.S. oil production growth of 0.8 million to 0.9 million bpd at year-end 2017. That would put end-2017 output at 9.6-9.7 million bpd, close to its highest for at least three decades.
Traders said this was due to U.S. crude trading at a wide discount to Brent, making exports attractive. 

U.S. independent oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources said it expected to export 2.3 million barrels of oil in the fourth quarter.

U.S. natural gas futures rose around 4.0 cents, or about 1.4%, to $2.937 per million British thermal units by 10:35AM ET (1435GMT). Futures were at around $2.926 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 65 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended Oct. 27, compared to forecasts for a build of 62 billion.
That compared with a gain of 64 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 54 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 60 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.775 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 180 bcf, or around 4.5%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 41 bcf, or roughly 1.1%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.
Futures recovered from an early decline to end little changed on Wednesday as traders monitored near-term weather models to gauge demand for the heating fuel.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather weakens demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.

Iraq is talking to Turkey to allow SOMO to sell the Kurdish crude that arrives by pipeline in Ceyhan, the Turkish terminal on the Mediterranean, acting SOMO director general Alaa al-Yasiri told reporters in Baghdad.
About 530,000 barrels per day (bpd) used to arrive in Ceyhan via the pipeline until mid-October, of which about half came from the Kurdistan Regional Government's oilfields and the rest from Kirkuk, a disputed province claimed by both the Kurdish region and Iraqi authorities in Baghdad.
Output from Kirkuk fell in mid-October, when Iraqi forces took back control of the northern region's oilfields from Kurdish fighters who had been there since 2014.
Kurdish Peshmerga forces deployed in Kirkuk in 2014, when the Iraqi army fled in the face of an advance by Islamic State militants. The Kurdish move prevented the militants taking control of the oilfields.
The pipeline carried on average 419,000 bpd in October, down from 600,000 bpd in September, said Farid al-Jadir, the director general of North Oil Company, which operates Kirkuk.
NOC should resume exports from Kirkuk through the Kurdish pipeline this month, after the two sides agree on terms of use, Yasiri said. Kirkuk would also export by tanker trucks about 15,000 bpd to the refinery of Kermanshah in Iran, he added.
Yasiri expected an old pipeline that bypasses most of the Kurdistan region to resume operation in three months.
The pipeline was severely damaged by Islamic State after it took over Mosul's Nineveh province in 2014. U.S.-backed Iraqi forces ousted the group from Mosul in July, after a nine-month campaign supported by Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.
Iraq, the second-largest producer of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries after Saudi Arabia, supported any future decision by the group to support oil prices, Yasiri said.
OPEC is expected to extend curbs on oil output when it meets in Vienna at the end of month.

The ongoing surge in U.S. crude exports comes as the widening spread between WTI crude and Brent oil prices continued to increase international demand for cheaper U.S. crude.
The uptick in production overshadowed a mixed report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showing crude and gasoline stockpiles declined more than expected, while distillate fell less-than-expected.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 2.4 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 27, a steeper decline than the 1.8 million barrels expected.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – fell by 4 million barrels, confounding expectations of a draw of just 2.1 million barrels while supplies of distillates – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – fell by about 320,000 barrels, undershooting expectations of a decline of 2.1 million barrels.
The dip in oil prices comes amid growing expectations for an extension to the output-cut agreement lifted crude prices to an eighth-month high after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC members signaled support for an extension ahead of the upcoming OPEC meeting in November.
In May, OPEC producers agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March 2018.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for December delivery rose 0.07% to $54.34 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 0.23% to $60.63 a barrel.
Overnight, crude oil prices settled lower on Wednesday as a surge in crude exports offset data showing supplies of U.S crude oil and gasoline decline more-than-expected.
U.S. oil production grew by 46,000 barrels a day (bpd) to 9.55 million barrels a day, not far off the June. 5, 2015 record high of 9.61 million barrels per day while weekly U.S. crude oil exports rose to an all-time high of 2.13 million barrels per day, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) said Wednesday.
The ongoing surge in U.S. crude exports comes as the widening spread between WTI crude and Brent oil prices continued to increase international demand for U.S. crude.
The uptick in production overshadowed a mixed report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showing crude and gasoline stockpiles declined more than expected while distillate fell less-than-expected.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 2.4 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 27, a steeper decline than the 1.8 million barrels expected.
Gasoline inventories – one of the products that crude is refined into – fell by 4 million barrels, confounding expectations of a draw of just 2.1 million barrels while supplies of distillate – the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – fell by about 320,000 barrels, undershooting expectations of a decline of 2.1 million barrels.
The dip in oil prices comes amid as growing expectations for an extension to the output-cut agreement lifted crude prices to an eighth-month high after OPEC and non-OPEC members signalled support for an extension ahead of the upcoming OPEC meeting in November.

1370,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 01, 2017 04:33PM ET</span>","From Oil to Ruthenium, Here's How Commodities Are Bouncing Back","(Bloomberg) -- Commodities are booming again.
The Bloomberg Commodity Index is up more than 9 percent from its late-June lows, outpacing the S&P 500 Index’s 6 percent advance over the same stretch.
Signs that the long-awaited rebalancing of the global crude market is at hand have pushed Brent futures to two-year highs, while West Texas Intermediate isn’t too far behind. And it’s not just oil: Synchronized global growth and China’s crackdown on capacity in a bid to help clean up the environment have fostered gains across the spectrum for raw materials.
Even more impressive for the broad commodity rally: It’s occurring amid back-to-back months of gains for the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, typically a headwind for raw materials.
Here’s a look at how commodities have gone from bust to boom:
The six-month futures spread for West Texas Intermediate has dipped into backwardation for the first time since 2014 -- nearer-term contracts are pricier than later ones.
This curve marks a successfully rebalancing market. The WTI’s previously upward-sloping front end encouraged shale producers to lock in future production thanks to the higher prices on longer-dated contracts; the reverse will help further alleviate the glut in crude.
There’s also been a near-relentless draw in U.S. oil inventories since March -- a chief aim of the deal made by OPEC and other major producers in late 2016 to curb output -- and the number of active U.S. rigs has gradually declined from an August peak, implying a limited supply response to the rally in prices.
Equities have reflected these changes, and major producers have been steadily finding a way back to normality. The bright outlook for energy prices has boosted  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). despite lackluster third-quarter results. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is on the verge of a 52-week high after its better-than-expected figures, while in Europe both  BP  (LON:BP) Plc and  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) are trading at multimonth highs after beating revenue expectations and posting a jump in profits, respectively.
Metals are also on a tear, giving traders and industry experts gathered for LME Week in London plenty to cheer about. From aluminum to zinc, just about everything is up. Codelco, the biggest copper producer, suggested a run toward the all-time high of $10,190 a ton may be possible. Expectations of surging battery demand are buffering nickel prices. But the real star of 2017? That’s palladium. The metal is heading for its highest close since 2001 thanks to its role as a key component in curbing emissions in gasoline-powered vehicles.
A testament to firming demand buoying metals prices: Inventories on the London Metal Exchange continue to shrink.
“The extreme optimism shown by experts during LME Week helped the nickel price achieve a spectacular turnaround,” analysts at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), including Eugen Weinberg, said in a note. “Most metals currently find themselves in supply deficit.”
Even platinum, the worst performer among precious metals, has turned a corner, rising 1.4 percent to $929.46 an ounce. Worries about declining demand for diesel cars, its main market, haven’t deterred investors from increasing holdings in platinum exchange-traded funds to their highest since August.
The rally has even extended to some of the lesser-known metals. Ruthenium and rhodium posted impressive rallies in October. Rhodium, used to curb emissions, has benefited from Europeans’ shift away from diesel-powered vehicles. Ruthenium is used in organic light-emitting diodes and water purification."

Nickel sulphate, a key ingredient in lithium-ion batteries, will see demand increase by half to 3 million tons by 2030, Saad Rahim, chief economist at Trafigura, said in an interview. That echoes bullish views from miner and trader Glencore. Batteries are likely to use more nickel and less cobalt in future, Rahim said.
Nickel is now up 28 percent for 2017, vying with aluminum for the title of top base metal of the year.
Chinese investors piled into Shanghai futures at the start of morning session, and prices were locked up by the limit just short of 100,000 yuan a ton, the highest intraday level since November.
MMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC, which competes with Vale SA as the world’s top nickel producer, has warned that the market may have become too bullish too quickly. The company sees this year’s nickel demand from batteries at about 65,000 tons, compared with total usage of 2 million tons, according to Anton Berlin, head of analysis and market development. It will take a few years for EVs to become a significant consumer, he said.

Futures were little changed in New York after earlier climbing above $55 a barrel for the first time since early January. The government’s tally of oil and gasoline held in U.S. storage tanks failed to register withdrawals as large as those reported by the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday.
The federal figures released on Wednesday “came in not quite as strong as API, which was extremely bullish,” Brian Kessens, who helps manage $16 billion in energy assets at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC, said by telephone.
The 5.2 percent rally in the benchmark U.S. crude grade in October had been largely fueled by the determination of Saudi Arabia, Russia and other major oil producers to extend output curbs well into 2018. While a formal decision to extend the caps may not be made at a Nov. 30 meeting, it’ll come sooner or later, according to PIRA Energy Group, a unit of S&P Global Platts.

U.S. Inventories
Nationwide crude stockpiles slid by 2.44 million barrels last week, while gasoline supplies edged lower by 4.02 million, according to the Energy Information Administration report released Wednesday.

Oil inventories at the key Cushing, Oklahoma, pipeline hub ticked higher by 90,000 barrels last week and domestic crude production increased. Distillate supplies slid to levels not seen since 2015 and U.S. crude exports rose for a third week, the EIA data showed.
The crude and gasoline draws weren’t “as big as anticipated. It wasn’t consistent with the API,” James Williams, president of London, Arkansas-based energy researcher WTRG Economics, said by telephone. “We’ve had a strong run in oil prices. It’s time to get a little bit of a pull-back.”

DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC is likely to stay the course by keeping its current curb on oil production in place for the whole of 2018 despite potential output disruptions next year, Gulf OPEC sources said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, have cut overall output by about 1.8 million bpd since January. The pact runs to March 2018, but the producers are considering extending it.
OPEC is scheduled to next meet at its headquarters in Vienna on Nov. 30.
Venezuela's oil production, which has been falling by about 20,000 barrels per day per month since last year, is on track to fall an additional 240,000 bpd next year as U.S. sanctions and a lack of infrastructure investment hobbles operations.
Oil flow from other OPEC members such as Nigeria and Libya continue to see supply disruption. 
But Saudi Arabia and OPEC are unlikely to raise output elsewhere next year to compensate for this decline as the exporting group wants to remain focused on reducing the level of oil stocks in OECD industrialized countries to their five-year average, one OPEC source familiar with Saudi thinking on its oil policy said.
""OPEC is likely to stay the course for the rest of 2018. We want to see commercial stocks going down,"" the source said.
Another OPEC source said there was a high risk of a supply drop from Venezuela next year but that does not necessarily mean that OPEC will raise output elsewhere to make up for the decline.
The first OPEC source said that output from the Latin American OPEC nation could fall in 2018 by 300,000-600,000 bpd, adding that the risk of supply disruptions from other OPEC producers such as Libya and Nigeria also remained high.
""The feeling in OPEC is that $60 (a barrel) should be the floor for oil prices next year,"" the first source said.
The market has been concerned that once the supply cut deal comes to an end producers will increase supplies again, causing prices to fall. 
But Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih last week raised the prospect of prolonged restraint once the pact ends, as the world’s top oil exporter Saudi Arabia is determined to reduce inventories further through the OPEC-led deal.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman told Reuters last week that the kingdom supports the idea of extending the OPEC-led pact.

Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, rose by 90,000 barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 454.9 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be at the upper half of the average range for this time of year.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories fell by 4.0 million barrels, much more than expectations for a decline of 1.5 million barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a decline of 0.3 million barrels.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures rose to an intraday peak of $61.70 a barrel, its best level since July 2015, boosted by signs that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has significantly improved compliance with its pledged supply cuts.
OPEC's October output declined by 80,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 32.78 million bpd, putting adherence to its pledged supply curbs at 92%, compared to September's 86%.
In addition, Russia said it cut its output by around 300,000 bpd last month, below October 2016 levels of 11.247 million bpd.

It lost 7.0 cents, or 2.4%, on Tuesday, as bearish speculators bet that forecasts for warmer weather over the next two weeks will reduce demand for the heating fuel.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather weakens demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 60 and 70 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended October 27.
That compares with a gain of 64 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 54 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 60 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.710 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 189 bcf, or around 4.8%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 46 bcf, or roughly 1.2%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

1384,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 01, 2017 07:25AM ET</span>","Awaiting Trump's coal comeback, miners reject retraining","By Valerie Volcovici
WAYNESBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - When Mike Sylvester entered a career training center earlier this year in southwestern Pennsylvania, he found more than one hundred federally funded courses covering everything from computer programming to nursing.
He settled instead on something familiar: a coal mining course. 
""I think there is a coal comeback,” said the 33-year-old son of a miner.
Despite broad consensus about coal's bleak future, a years-long effort to diversify the economy of this hard-hit region away from mining is stumbling, with Obama-era jobs retraining classes undersubscribed and future programs at risk under President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 budget.
Trump has promised to revive coal by rolling back environmental regulations and moved to repeal Obama-era curbs on carbon emissions from power plants. 
""I have a lot of faith in President Trump,"" Sylvester said.
But hundreds of coal-fired plants have closed in recent years, and cheap natural gas continues to erode domestic demand. The Appalachian region has lost about 33,500 mining jobs since 2011, according to the Appalachian Regional Commission. 
Although there have been small gains in coal output and hiring this year, driven by foreign demand, production levels remain near lows hit in 1978.
A White House official did not respond to requests for comment on coal policy and retraining for coal workers.
What many experts call false hopes for a coal resurgence have mired economic development efforts here in a catch-22: Coal miners are resisting retraining without ready jobs from new industries, but new companies are unlikely to move here without a trained workforce. The stalled diversification push leaves some of the nation's poorest areas with no clear path to prosperity.
Federal retraining programs have fared better, with some approaching full participation, in the parts of Appalachia where mining has been crushed in a way that leaves little hope for a comeback, according to county officials and recruiters. They include West Virginia and Kentucky, where coal resources have been depleted.
But in southern Pennsylvania, where the industry still has ample reserves and is showing flickers of life, federal jobs retraining programs see sign-up rates below 20 percent, the officials and recruiters said. In southern Virginia's coal country, participation rates run about 50 percent, they said.
""Part of our problem is we still have coal,"" said Robbie Matesic, executive director of Greene County’s economic development department. 
Out-of-work miners cite many reasons beyond faith in Trump policy for their reluctance to train for new industries, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen former and prospective coal workers, career counselors and local economic development officials. They say mining pays well; other industries are unfamiliar; and there’s no income during training and no guarantee of a job afterward. 
In Pennsylvania, Corsa Coal opened a mine in Somerset in June which will create about 70 jobs – one of the first mines to open here in years. And Consol Energy recently expanded its Bailey mine complex in Greene County. 
But Consol also announced in January that it plans to sell its coal holdings to focus on natural gas. And it has commissioned a recruitment agency, GMS Mines and Repair, to find contract laborers for its coal expansion who will be paid about $13 an hour - half the hourly wage of a starting unionized coal worker. The program Sylvester signed up for was set up by GMS.
The new hiring in Pennsylvania is related mainly to an uptick in foreign demand for metallurgical coal, used in producing steel, rather than domestic demand for thermal coal from power plants, the industry's main business. Some market analysts describe the foreign demand as a temporary blip driven by production problems in the coal hub of Australia.
Officials for U.S. coal companies operating in the region, including Consol and Corsa, declined requests for comment. 
“The coal industry has stabilized, but it’s not going to come back,” said Blair Zimmerman, a 40-year veteran of the mines who is now the commissioner for Greene County, one of Pennsylvania’s oldest coal regions. “We need to look at the future.”
EMPTY SEATS
The Pennsylvania Department of Labor has received about $2 million since 2015 from the federal POWER program, an initiative of former President Barack Obama to help retrain workers in coal-dependent areas. But the state is having trouble putting even that modest amount of money to good use.
In Greene and Washington counties, 120 people have signed up for jobs retraining outside the mines, far short of the target of 700, said Ami Gatts, director of the Washington-Greene County Job Training Agency. In Westmoreland and Fayette counties, participation in federal job retraining programs has been about 15 percent of capacity, officials said.
""I can't even get them to show up for free food I set up in the office,"" said Dave Serock, an ex-miner who recruits in Fayette County for Southwest Training Services.
Programs administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission, a federal and state partnership to strengthen the region’s economy, have had similar struggles. One $1.4 million ARC project to teach laid-off miners in Greene County and in West Virginia computer coding has signed up only 20 people for 95 slots. Not a single worker has enrolled in another program launched this summer to prepare ex-miners to work in the natural gas sector, officials said.
Greene County Commissioner Zimmerman said he’d like to see a big company like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Toyota come to southwestern Pennsylvania to build a distribution or manufacturing plant that could employ thousands. 
But he knows first the region needs a ready workforce.
Amazon spokeswoman Ashley Robinson said the company the company typically works with local organizations to evaluate whether locations have an appropriate workforce and has no current plans for distribution operations in Western Pennsylvania. Toyota spokesman Edward Lewis said the company considers local workforce training an ""important consideration"" when deciding where to locate facilities. 
SIGNS OF LIFE
For Sean Moodie and his brother Steve spent the last two years working in the natural gas industry, but see coal as a good bet in the current political climate. 
“I am optimistic that you can make a good career out of coal for the next 50 years,” said Sean Moodie.
Coal jobs are preferable to those in natural gas, they said, because the mines are close to home, while pipeline work requires travel. Like Sylvester, the Moodie brothers are taking mining courses offered by Consol’s recruiter, GMS.
Bob Levo, who runs a GMS training program, offered a measure of realism: The point of the training is to provide low-cost and potentially short-term labor to a struggling industry, he said. 
""That’s a major part of the reason that coal mines have been able to survive,"" he said. ""They rely on us to provide labor at lower cost.""
Clemmy Allen, 63, a veteran miner and head of the United Mineworkers of America's Career Centers, said miners are taking a big risk in holding out for a coal recovery.
He’s placing his hopes for the region's future on retraining. UMWA’s 64-acre campus in Prosperity, Pennsylvania - which once trained coal miners - will use nearly $3 million in federal and state grants to retrofit classrooms to teach cybersecurity, truck driving and mechanical engineering.
""Unlike when I worked in the mines,"" he said, ""if you get laid off now, you are pretty much laid off.""

1385,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 01, 2017 04:19AM ET</span>",Gold Prices Move Higher Ahead of Fed Decision,"Investing.com - Gold prices rose on Wednesday as investors awaited the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s meeting later in the day for fresh signals on future monetary tightening.
Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange were up $6.15 or 0.48% to $1,276.64 a troy ounce by 04:12 AM ET (08:12 AM GMT).
The Fed was expected to leave interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting later Wednesday, but investors were waiting for any indications that it will resume raising rates next month as expected and on the timing of any rate hikes in 2018.
Traders were also awaiting President Donald Trump’s announcement about his pick for the next head of the U.S. central bank. Recent reports have indicated that Trump is likely to appoint Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who is viewed as more dovish than other candidates.
The dollar was little changed against a basket of the other major currencies, with the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies at 94.50.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in the U.S. dollar – a stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, thus, reduces investor demand for the precious metal.
Meanwhile, reports on Tuesday indicated that the U.S. economy is gaining momentum as traders looked ahead to Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for October.
Consumer confidence jumped to an almost 17-year high last month and another report showed that wage growth accelerated in the third quarter.
In other metals trading, silver futures were up 1.09% to $16.87 while platinum futures added 0.77% to $928.45.
Copper for December delivery was up 1.35% to $3.154 a pound.
Data on Wednesday showed that China’s manufacturing output rose at the slowest pace in four months in October, a potentially bearish sign for industrial metals.
China accounts for nearly half the world’s copper consumption and optimism over strong economic growth this year has helped push prices to three-year highs."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose to near recent highs on Wednesday as data showed OPEC has significantly improved compliance with its pledged supply cuts and Russia is also seen keeping to the deal.
Brent futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $61.32 per barrel at 0759 GMT, up 38 cents, or 0.6 percent, since their last close and near the $61.41 a barrel two-year high from intraday trading on Tuesday. Brent is up almost 40 percent since its 2017-lows last June.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was at $54.95 a barrel, up over half a dollar, or 1 percent, to a fresh high. It is up some 30 percent since 2017 lows hit in June.
Physical oil markets are also strong, with top exporter Saudi Arabia expected to hike December crude prices for customers in Asia to levels last seen in 2013 or 2014, a Reuters survey showed.
Arab Light's December official selling price to at least 90 cents a barrel above Oman/Dubai quotes, the survey of five refiners showed. That would be the highest premium since $1.65 in September 2014, according to Reuters data.
Bullish sentiment has been fueled by an effort this year lead by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to hold back about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in oil production to tighten markets.
While compliance was low during the first half of the year, supplies have been reduced significantly since.
OPEC's October output fell by 80,000 bpd to 32.78 million bpd, putting adherence to its pledged supply curbs at 92 percent, up from September's 86 percent.
Russia is also seen to be in compliance with cutting its output by around 300,000 bpd below October 2016 levels of 11.247 million bpd.
Trade data shows that global oil markets have been slightly undersupplied during the past quarters, resulting in inventory drawdowns.
What is unclear is how countries involved in withholding production will exit the supply-cutting deal, which ends in March 2018. 
Saudi Arabia and Russia support extending the agreement to potentially cover all of next year.
Should participants after that return to full capacity and U.S. output also grow, a supply glut could return.
""We could rapidly ... go from a predicted deficit of around 260,000 barrels to a surplus of close to 1.5 million barrels. Prices would undoubtedly collapse,"" said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services.
Another factor will be U.S. output, which has risen by almost 13 percent since mid-2016 to 9.5 million bpd.

""U.S. crude oil production is 410,000 bpd below the April 2015 peak of 9.62 million bpd. We expect production to surpass this level before year-end,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) bank said.

Elsewhere, Brent oil for January delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up 31 cents or about 0.51% at a two-year high of $61.25 a barrel.
Crude prices were boosted following news OPEC's October output declined by 80,000 bpd to 32.78 million bpd, putting adherence to its pledged supply curbs at 92%, compared to September's 86%.
In addition, Russia said it cut its output by around 300,000 bpd last month, below October 2016 levels of 11.247 million bpd.
The reports came after OPEC’s Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo noted last week comments from both Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin that suggested they were in favor of a nine-month extension for the current deal to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day.
He said that their remarks “clear the fog on the way to (the cartel’s next meeting in) Vienna on November 30.”
Meanwhile, market participants were eyeing official U.S. stockpiles data to be released on Wednesday by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia will hike December crude prices for customers in Asia to levels last seen in 2013 or 2014, a Reuters survey showed, with OPEC-led output cuts and robust demand re-balancing markets for the commodity.
The producer is expected to raise flagship Arab Light's December official selling price to at least 90 cents a barrel above Oman/Dubai quotes, the survey of five refiners showed. That would be the highest premium since $1.65 in September 2014, according to Reuters data.
Prices for heavier grades may see a bigger boost in December, the survey showed, with Arab Heavy's OSP set to rise to at least $1.30 below Oman-Dubai quotes. That would be the narrowest discount for Saudi heavy crude since minus $1.05 in December 2013, according to Reuters data.
The increases would come on the back of stronger Middle East crude benchmark prices and firm refining margins, the respondents said.
Dubai's backwardation widened in October compared with the previous month. In a backwardated market, prompt prices are higher than those in future months signaling strong demand for spot cargoes.
Complex refining margins in Singapore, a gauge of refiner profitability in the region, held above $7 a barrel for a fourth month in October, Thomson Reuters Eikon data showed.
Gains in naphtha margins could prop up Arab Extra Light's OSP in December by at least 50 cents a barrel, the survey showed.Saudi crude OSPs are usually released around the fifth of each month, and set the trend for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi prices, affecting more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude bound for Asia.
Saudi Aramco sets its crude prices based on recommendations from customers and after calculating the change in the value of its oil over the past month, based on yields and product prices.
Saudi Aramco officials as a matter of policy do not comment on the kingdom's monthly OSPs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled higher again on Tuesday, notching a monthly gain of more than 5 percent, but analysts said bullish sentiment that has driven Brent crude to its highest in more than two years could encourage U.S. producers to export more oil.
Brent (LCOc1) settled up 47 cents or 0.7 percent to $61.37, close to its July 2015 highs reached earlier this week, and up around 37 percent from its 2017 lows hit in June. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) (CLc1) settled up 23 cents or 0.4 percent to $54.38, still near its highest since February and close to its highest in more than two years. 
Traders and brokers said investors were adjusting positions after price rises of around 5 percent in October.
For the month, Brent was up 6.7 percent, while WTI rose 5.2 percent. WTI's discount to Brent  has widened to nearly $7, making it attractive to exporters.
""The large differential has opened the door on regional arbitrage, driving a spike in U.S. crude exports over recent weeks,"" BMI Research said in a note.
U.S. crude exports have jumped to close to 2 million barrels per day (bpd) and production  has risen almost 13 percent since mid-2016 to 9.5 million bpd.
""The problem is as soon as prices move up it's too easy for U.S. producers to add another rig or another completion crew,"" said Stewart Glickman, energy equity analyst at CFRA Research in New York, ""Then they increase production and you’re back where you started.""

Eleven analysts polled ahead of inventory reports from the industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) and the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated, on average, that crude stocks were forecast to have fallen 1.8 million barrels in the week ended Oct. 27.

Iraq's move to increase oil exports from its southern ports by 220,000 bpd to 3.45 million bpd to make up for supply disruptions from its northern Kirkuk fields also weighed on prices, traders said.
Bullish sentiment has been fueled by a pledge by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other exporters to hold back about 1.8 million bpd in oil production to tighten markets.
OPEC's adherence to its pledged supply curbs rose to 92 percent from September's 86 percent, a Reuters survey showed, as top exporter Saudi Arabia continued to pump below its OPEC target and output in Venezuela, in economic depression, declined further.

Futures rose 0.4 percent in New York on Tuesday, capping a 5.2 percent jump this month. Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled support for extending production caps well into 2018. Meanwhile, U.S. crude stockpiles probably dropped for the fifth time in six weeks, according to a Bloomberg survey before a government tally scheduled for release on Wednesday.
The output restraints by OPEC and allies such as Russia are “tightening the market supply-demand fundamentals,” Gene McGillian, a market research manager at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, said by telephone. “I don’t think we have any indications that the rebalance has completely been priced into the market.”
The global benchmark Brent crude this month topped $60 a barrel for the first time since July 2015 while the dominant U.S. grade, West Texas Intermediate, touched an eight-month high. The market was also buoyed by conflict between the Iraqi central government and semi-autonomous Kurds that threatened crude supplies from northern fields. The wild card remains North American shale’s potential to upend any coordinated moves to keep a lid on global production.
“As we approach the $55 a barrel level in WTI and the $60 we just crossed in Brent, are we going to start to see a response by drillers in the United States to capture some of these elevated prices, by bringing some of their drilled-but-uncompleted wells online and increasing their drilling activity?” McGillian said.
West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery added 23 cents to settle at $54.38 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level since February. Total volume traded was about 26 percent below the 100-day average.
Brent for December settlement, which expires Tuesday, advanced 47 cents to end the session at $61.37 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, the highest level since July 2015. The more-active January contract rose 35 cents to settle at $60.94. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $6.99 to WTI.
The recent price surge for West Texas Intermediate may stall out as it inches closer to the $55 level, Jay Hatfield, a New York-based portfolio manager at the InfraCap MLP exchange-traded fund, said by telephone. But ultimately, a move into the $55 to $60 range is more probable than a major correction.
“Inventories are in good shape,” Hatfield said. “Demand is quite positive globally. We’ve been appropriately bullish.”

That’s down from a break-even of $96.60 a barrel in 2016, the biggest drop of eight crude producers in the Persian Gulf. The break-even is a measure of the crude price needed to meet spending plans and balance the budget.
Gulf oil producers are cutting spending and eliminating subsidies after crude plunged from more than $100 a barrel in 2014 to average just over half that this year. The need to curb spending is more urgent with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cutting output to reduce a global glut. Oil will trade at $50 to $60 a barrel for the “medium term,” the IMF said. Benchmark Brent crude is on track for a second consecutive monthly gain and traded at $61.01 a barrel at 7:20 p.m. in Dubai.
“The reality of lower oil prices has made it more urgent for oil exporters to move away from a focus on redistributing oil receipts through public sector spending and energy subsidies,” the IMF said.
Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Qatar will have break-evens below the oil price, more than enough to balance the budget in 2018, according to IMF estimates and forward Brent price data compiled by Bloomberg. Countries like Saudi Arabia will take longer to balance their budget, the IMF said.
None of the producers have yet created economies that will support their population “once hydrocarbon resources are exhausted,” the IMF said.

1400,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 31, 2017 11:00AM ET</span>","Oil Curve Trades Most Bullish Since 2014, Buttressing $60 Brent","(Bloomberg) -- The oil curve, a closely watched barometer of supply tightness in the crude market, is trading at its most bullish in more than three years and buttressing Brent futures’ rally through $60 a barrel.
Brent futures for December 2017 are now treading at a premium of more than $2 to those for a year later, while December 2018 futures are about $1.50 more expensive than for the same month in 2019. In both cases, the premium for the nearer contract is the biggest since early 2014, when prices were above $100 a barrel, in a sign that the traders sees supply tightening.
Surging global demand and supply cuts by some of the world’s key producers combined with simmering geopolitical tensions helped to propel Brent above $60 a barrel last week for the first time in more than two years. With the global glut shrinking, a so-called backwardated market structure has emerged that makes holding onto long positions profitable. The opposite structure, known as contango, had largely prevailed since late 2014.
“It’s not much more complicated than this: stockpiles are falling, the market is bullish,” said Tamas Varga, an analyst at brokerage PVM Oil Associates Ltd. in London. “The whole change in structure was triggered by the perception that global inventories are falling.”
The International Energy Agency, a Paris-based energy policy adviser to major economies, said earlier this month that global oil inventories are set to decline by 300,000 barrels a day this year. Global oil demand will climb the most since 2015 this year, the IEA said a month earlier. In the U.S., which provides the most frequently published inventory data, total crude and product stockpiles have shrunk by about 95 million barrels since early June.
Optimism over re-balancing has brought speculators back to the oil market, with investors boosting their bullish bets on crude by nearly 40 percent since the end of June. Traders’ outright long positions in combined Brent and West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. benchmark, recently rose back above one billion barrels for the second time in 2017.
“In contrast to earlier this year, a long Brent position can benefit from quite nice roll gains” with the market in backwardation, said Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Group AG in Zurich. “It reflects how much inventories fell in the third quarter.”
OPEC-Led Cuts
Just how tight the supply-demand becomes depends in part on sustained adherence to the cuts made by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies. Skeptics caution that prices above $60 may tempt some producers to ease up on curbs. Still, the group’s compliance with production reductions is at a record, and the producers now seem all but certain to extend restrictions after Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last week publicly supported extending the program beyond March 2018.
The turnaround in crude’s fortunes is increasingly being reflected in major Wall Street banks’ outlooks for the commodity. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). boosted its forecast for Brent in 2018 by $11 a barrel this week, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and ING Bank NV all bolstered their near-term price outlooks in recent weeks.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). said last week that backwardation will generate investor returns of about four percent next year, while JPMorgan said the market structure should be around for a while.
“Continued stock draws and tighter market conditions are sufficient to support spot prices at close to $60/bbl and Brent markets in backwardation on average in the coming 15 months,” JPMorgan anlaysts including David Martin wrote in an emailed report.

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 31, 2017 05:50AM ET</span>",Electric cars set world's nickel miners on new course,"By James Regan and Melanie Burton
SYDNEY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Battery makers are increasingly turning to nickel to help power growing global electric car sales, but only half of the world's producers of the metal are likely to benefit, mining analysts and executives say. 
Lithium batteries containing nickel, which helps keep a charge over longer distances, are being installed in electric cars from Tesla's top-of-the-line Model X to General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) modestly-priced Chevy Bolt.
The battery boom promises a new and growing market for miners producing high-grade nickel products. However, half the world's supply of the metal, comprised of so-called ferronickel and nickel pig iron grades, is unsuitable for battery production, according to analysts at UBS.
Some of the biggest producers of the higher-grade ores, including BHP Norilsk Nickel, Vale and Sumitomo Corp, are moving quickly to take advantage and seal long-term supply deals with battery producers.
Smaller producers with ores suitable for batteries, such as Australia's Independence Group and Western Areas also stand to win. These producers are building plants to convert the metal into a powder-like sulfate that is particularly suited for use in batteries. Sulfate nickel regularly fetches a price premium over London Metal Exchange-traded nickel.
""Not everyone will be a winner,"" said Dan Lougher, chief executive of Western Areas.
""We've met with quite a number of battery manufacturers, and they are quite specific on their requirements. Nickel is an important component of these batteries.""
Among those losing out would be lower-grade nickel mines like Cerro Matoso in Columbia, owned by South32 Ltd and Glencore's Koniambo in New Caledonia, as well as Anglo American's mines in Brazil producing ferronickel.
""The market dynamics will change in the coming years as a result of electric vehicles,"" said Peter Bradford, chief executive of Independence Group Ltd, which is aiming to produce around 25,0000 tonnes of high-purity nickel this year from a new mine. 
""Battery growth is going to disrupt the market,"" he said.
The big companies are already moving.
Norilsk, the world's biggest nickel miner, in June announced a tie-up with the German battery maker BASF.
Within a few weeks, BHP unveiled plans to retool its Nickel West division to start shipping nickel to battery manufacturers beginning in April 2019. 
The announcement marked a turnaround for Nickel West, which two years ago was in its death throes, with its workforce of 2,000 told that their jobs would end in 2019. 
Eduard Haegel, division chief of Nickel West, expects demand for electric vehicle batteries to account for about 90 percent of the division's annual output of 100,000 tonnes within the next six years.
Meanwhile, Vale is looking for a partner in its loss-making New Caledonia nickel complex. It has been in talks with the Chinese battery maker GEM Co, the Financial Times reported. 
""If we are not successful, we'll have to face the reality, which is this operation is holding the company back,"" Luciano Siani Pires, Vale's chief financial officer, said, referring to the New Caledonian business.
Plants already shut may get a second chance, too. 
Two with shots at restarting are Brazil's Votorantim Metais, and First Quantum Minerals's Ravensthorpe in Australia, which at today's nickel prices cannot compete but could be profitable if the market continues to climb.
NICKEL GROWTH SEEN 
Benchmark prices on the London Metal Exchange have jumped 17 percent in the year to date to $11,725 per tonne, but remain well below the 2014 peak of more than $21,400, and over 75 percent off the all-time high of just over $51,000 in 2007.
In a sign of how much the electric car industry is changing the market, the London Metal Exchange this week said it may offer a nickel contract specifically targeting the battery market.
Manufacturing electric cars with high-driving ranges is fueling demand for nickel-rich batteries, according to  Porsche  (DE:PSHG_p). The German carmaker expects the ratio of nickel to cobalt and manganese in a typical battery to rise eight-fold as electric cars become more mainstream. 

UBS estimates that 15 million electric vehicles will be on the road by 2025, lifting nickel demand by 300,000-900,000 tonnes, or by 10-40 percent of the current market.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's state oil major Sinopec is evaluating two projects in the United States that could boost Gulf Coast crude oil exports and also expand storage facilities in the Caribbean, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, with U.S. President Donald Trump set to visit Beijing next week.
With U.S.-China energy trade likely to feature prominently during Trump's visit, the people said one of the projects could see Sinopec (SS:600028) (HK:0386) partnering with U.S. commodities trader Freepoint Commodities LLC and U.S. private equity firm ArcLight Capital Partners LLC.
The trio is mulling building a pipeline to move shale oil from the Permian basin in Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast for export, the people said. 
This project also includes the construction of a terminal that can load 2 million barrels of crude onboard a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC), they said. This will reduce a big chunk of logistics costs incurred for U.S. crude exports, making the oil more competitive in Asia, the sources said.
ArcLight and Freepoint are among the U.S. energy and commodities firms that will make up a major part of a business delegation visiting Beijing when Trump goes to China next week.
Sinopec and the U.S. firms have also been exploring an expansion of oil storage at Limetree Bay (LB) Terminals in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, in the Caribbean, and restarting an idled refinery at the same site, the people said. They declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to media.
The Chinese company, which is Asia's largest oil refiner, ArcLight and Freepoint declined to comment.
The investments could reduce China's trade deficit with the United States, a source of tension between the world's two largest economies, while allowing Beijing to tap growing U.S. crude supplies as the top global oil importer seeks to diversify its import sources.
INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
Taking stakes in oil infrastructure is also part of Sinopec's ambition to expand its global trading profile. Sinopec already owns part of a Saudi refinery at the Red Sea, although a recent attempt to buy a  Chevron  (N:CVX) refinery in South Africa's Cape Town was thwarted by  Glencore  PLC (L:GLEN).
""There is room for energy cooperation between China and the United States, but the projects will have to be commercially viable before the companies reach any agreement,"" one of the people familiar with the matter said.
LB Terminals, a joint venture between ArcLight and Freepoint Commodities, said on its website that it planned to double its oil storage capacity and restart the 650,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) refinery at the site.
In a 10-year strategic deal, Sinopec has already leased 75 percent of the existing crude oil storage capacity at LB Terminals. (http://reut.rs/2lsMHfm)
China overtook the United States to become the world's largest crude oil importer this year as shipments grew on declining domestic oil output and refinery expansions. 
Sinopec's trading arm Unipec is set to import 5.7 million tonnes, equal to about 42 million barrels, of U.S. crude in 2017, making it the largest U.S. crude buyer in Asia.
Chinese refineries like certain U.S. crude grades because they are easy to process and have a low-sulphur content, enabling them to meet more stringent fuel standards as Beijing fights pollution, said multiple trade sources.

The Americas are expected to overtake Africa as the world's second-biggest crude supplier to Asia by 2025, Unipec said in September.

China reported the official manufacturing PMI for October at 51.6, compared with a level of 52 expected, and its non-manufacturing survey at 54.3, after 55.4 in the previous month.
Overnight, gold prices rebounded from session lows as the dollar came under pressure after data showed inflation continued to stutter amid growing speculation that President Donald Trump is likely to pick Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to replace current Fed chair Janet Yellen.
Gold prices steadied ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting which gets underway on Tuesday after data showed inflation remained subdued while consumer spending grew at its fastest rate in more than eight years.
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 1.3% in the 12 months through September.
That was in-line with expectations but well below the Fed’s 2% target, fuelling expectations that the trend of subdued inflation will keep interest rates lower for longer.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 1% last month, the Commerce Department said on Monday. That was the biggest jump in consumer spending since August 2009.
The mixed duo of reports come amid reports that President Donald Trump’s is leaning toward appointing Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell – who shares a similar stance to Janet Yellen on monetary policy – to be the next chairman of the Fed, Reuters reported Monday, citing a source.
Gold prices are sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A higher dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while higher U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Gold prices have dropped for two-straight weeks as traders continued to unwind their bullish bets on the precious metal amid a rebound in the dollar and growing expectations that global central banks will continue to tighten monetary policy.
Net bullish bets on gold fell to 191,400, according to a report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday.

The estimates are followed by official data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday. The EIA and API figures often diverge.
Crude oil prices settled higher on Monday as concerns over an uptick in Iraqi exports were offset by ongoing speculation that OPEC will agree to extend output cuts beyond March.
Crude oil prices continued their march higher, rising to an eight-month high amid bullish talk from OPEC and non-OPEC members on a possible extension to the output-cut agreement.
OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said Russian-Saudi backing for an extension cleared the fog ahead of the group\'s meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30.
“OPEC welcomes the clear guidance from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia on the need to achieve stable oil markets and sustain it beyond the first quarter of 2018,” Barkindo said weekend.
“Together with the statement expressed by President Putin, this clears the fog on the way to Vienna on Nov.30”, he added.
Barkindo’s comments came just a few days after Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters on Thursday, the kingdom would support extending output cuts in order to rid the market of excess supplies.
In May, OPEC producers agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.2 million bpd agreed in November last year.
Growing expectations that OPEC will continue to comply with output cuts has forced analysts to lift their forecasts on oil prices amid signs that the OPEC-led deal to cut output is narrowing the gap between demand and supply.
JP Morgan raised its 2018 Brent and WTI forecasts by $11 and $11.40 to $58 and $54.63 per barrel, respectively.

1412,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2017 02:30PM ET</span>",Oil Near Two-Year High as Investors Eye OPEC Deal Extension,"(Bloomberg) -- Brent crude traded near a two-year high as OPEC and Russia signaled they’ll extend supply cuts, while instability in Iraq’s Kurdish region persists.
The global benchmark rose to as high as $61 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate held above $54, though both crudes pulled back from Monday’s highs as they moved closer to levels that signal they might be overbought. Supporting the rally is Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last week backing an extension of production cuts by OPEC beyond March, following similar signals from Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“When you’re in a range-bound market without a lot of really clear and definitive fundamental information, people tend to start trading off of technicals,” Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, said by telephone. “Momentum in oil has been pretty strong, so unless you’ve got something out there that tells you we are on a clear path to $60, you’re going to want to see how the data plays out.”
Oil has rallied this month as investors wait to see whether OPEC will formally agree to an extension of its cuts at a meeting in November. Both Brent and WTI’s 14-day relative strength index moved toward 70, indicating the commodity may be overbought. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). raised both its Brent and WTI 2018 forecasts.
Brent for December settlement, which expires Tuesday, rose 19 cents to $60.63 a barrel at 1:15 p.m. on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, after touching $61, the highest intraday level since July 2015. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $6.53 to WTI.

WTI for December delivery rose 16 cents to $54.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 14 percent below the 100-day average.
Oil exports resumed from Iraq’s Kurdish region after halting earlier Monday, a port agent said, highlighting uncertainty about pipeline shipments from OPEC’s second-biggest producer.
The halt came days after Iraqi troops captured oil fields from Kurdish fighters in northern Iraq’s disputed Kirkuk province. Shipments by pipeline averaged 264,000 barrels a day before the stoppage, less than half their normal daily level of 600,000 barrels.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $5.59, or 0.44%, to $1,277.28 a troy ounce.
Gold prices steadied ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting which gets underway on Tuesday after data showed inflation remained subdued while consumer spending grew at its fastest rate in more than eight years. 
The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy, rose 1.3% in the 12 months through September.
That was in-line with expectations but well below the Fed’s 2% target, fuelling expectations that the trend of subdued inflation will keep interest rates lower for longer.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 1% last month, the Commerce Department said on Monday. That was the biggest jump in consumer spending since August 2009.
The mixed duo of reports come amid reports that President Donald Trump’s is leaning toward appointing Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell – who shares a similar stance to Janet Yellen on monetary policy – to be the next chairman of the Fed, Reuters reported Monday, citing a source.
Gold prices are sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A higher dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while higher U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Gold prices have dropped for two-straight weeks as traders continued to unwind their bullish bets on the precious metal amid a rebound in the dollar and growing expectations that global central banks will continue to tighten monetary policy. 
Net bullish bets on gold fell to 191,400, according to a report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures added 0.60% to $16.85 a troy ounce while platinum futures rose 0.27% to $920.85.
Copper traded at $3.11, up 0.23% while natural gas rose by 0.44% to $2.98."
1414,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 30, 2017 01:00PM ET</span>",Oil Investors Roll Dice on OPEC as Saudi Prince Ups the Ante,"(Bloomberg) -- The OPEC trade is back, and Saudi Arabia is in the driver’s seat.
Just before the de facto OPEC leader doubled down on its plan to drain the oil glut, propelling Brent crude prices beyond $60 a barrel for the first time since 2015, hedge funds were almost as bullish on the global benchmark as they’ve ever been. Short-sellers retreated to levels last seen in February, when OPEC production cuts were fueling an oil-price surge.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in an interview with Bloomberg that “of course” he wanted to prolong the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ output-reduction deal into 2018. That was after Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said an extension should run through at least the end of next year. With the leaders of the world’s two biggest oil-exporting countries on board, an agreement is seen as all but certain at a meeting in Vienna next month.
“We have evidence that people are positioned long into OPEC in November; the consensus trade on the street is that they’ll extend cuts,” Chris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at Macro Risk Advisors LLC, said in an interview in New York. The prince’s support has led to more seriousness around a potential extension and “it makes it very hard to be aggressively short.”
The fundamentals are looking brighter, too. U.S. crude inventories are near the lowest levels since January 2016. Saudi Arabia’s minister of energy and industry, Khalid Al-Falih, said oil demand is more resilient than people think, and  Statoil  (OL:STL) ASA’s Chief Executive Officer Eldar Saetre said the market is “definitely balancing.”
There’s a stronger belief that the “supply-demand set-up has turned the corner, particularly with the push by the Saudis to keep the deal going and to drain global inventories,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund. “It’s worth betting that prices will go higher.”

Things started going south in the oil market in March as concern over rising U.S. stockpiles overshadowed confidence in OPEC’s efforts. Hedge-fund bets and rising futures indicate that the confidence is coming back.
Hedge funds boosted their Brent net-long position -- the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a drop -- by 2.6 percent to 506,737 contracts in the week ended Oct. 24, according to data from ICE Futures Europe. That’s close to a record at the end of September and the previous high in February. Longs increased by 1.5 percent, while shorts slid 6.6 percent to the lowest since February.
The West Texas Intermediate net-long position rose by 7.2 percent to 234,878 futures and options, the first increase in four weeks, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Shorts fell 4.2 percent, while longs climbed 2.7 percent to the highest level since April.
In the fuel market, money managers boosted their net-long position on benchmark U.S. gasoline by 11 percent, with long positions rising to the highest level in more than three years. Meanwhile, the net-bullish position on diesel increased 0.8 percent.
Front-month Brent contracts have been trading at a premium to later-dated ones, a market structure known as backwardation that indicates strong demand and tight supplies. That’s a shift away from contango, typical of a glut, which had loomed over the market for the past two years. WTI is also in backwardation in some areas of the futures curve.
“People are starting to think that the global inventory situation is better than they thought,” Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Massachusetts, said by telephone. “The contango is getting very small, which suggests the markets perceive we’re a lot closer to being rebalanced than people had thought earlier.”
Brent futures for December delivery were little changed from Friday at $60.42 a barrel as of 4:30 p.m. in London, after reaching $61, the highest since July 2015. WTI rose to as high as $54.46 in New York, the highest since Feb. 27.
Yet optimism around surging oil prices comes with risks. U.S. crude output remains above 9.5 million barrels a day and rose by the most since 2012 in the week ended Oct. 20.
“My concern is what happens now that we’re getting to these price-highs where we’ve typically seen a supply response,” Rob Haworth, who helps oversee $142 billion in assets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle, said by telephone. “Fundamentally, you should see a supply response and that’s going to make it tougher for these bulls to hang in there.”

Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather weakens demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
U.S. natural gas futures shed half a cent, or around 0.2%, to $2.958 per million British thermal units by 8:50AM ET (1250GMT).
Futures lost about 5.6% last week as bearish speculators bet that forecasts for warmer weather over the next two weeks will reduce demand for the heating fuel.
Market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 60 and 70 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended October 27.
That compares with a gain of 64 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 54 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 60 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.710 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 189 bcf, or around 4.8%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 46 bcf, or roughly 1.2%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

Comex gold futures were little changed at $1,271.8 a troy ounce by 08:40 a.m. ET (12:40 GMT).
The U.S. Commerce Department reported on Monday that personal spending rose more than expected last month.
The U.S. dollar was already boosted after the Commerce Department reported on Friday that the U.S. economy grew at a 3% annual rate in the third quarter, better than forecasts for growth of 2.5%.
The stronger-than-expected reading underlined the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates befoe the end of the year.
The greenback was also supported after House Republicans passed a budget blueprint for 2018 last week, setting the stage for a tax overhaul. Some investors believe tax reforms could bolster growth and prompt the Fed to raise rates at a faster pace.
However, investors remained cautious following a report that U.S. President Donald Trump is considering nominating Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to lead the U.S. central bank, a move that would signal continuity for monetary policy.
Powell is seen less hawkish than Stanford University economist John Taylor, another potential nominee to lead the Fed.

LONDON (Reuters) - Brent oil held above $60 a barrel on Monday, near its highest since mid-2015, on expectations OPEC-led production cuts would be extended beyond March although rising Iraqi exports put a lid on prices.
Benchmark Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were 7 cents higher at $60.51 per barrel at 1050 GMT, close to their highest since July 2015. They are 36 percent above the 2017 lows marked in June.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were little changed at $53.89 a barrel, near an eight-month high.
""The latest uptick can to a certain extent be attributed to further Saudi and Russian support for extending the supply cut,"" consultancy JBC Energy said. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus Russia and nine other producers agreed to cut 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from January 2016 to clear a supply glut.
The pact, already renewed once, now runs to March 2018, but Saudi Arabia and Russia, who are leading the effort, have voiced support to for a further extension. 
OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said Russian-Saudi backing for an extension cleared the fog before the group's meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman repeated the kingdom's support for extending the deal at the weekend. 
However, traders said a 900,000 bpd export capacity increase from Iraq's southern ports to 4.6 million bpd had prevented Brent rising further. 
Also helping to keep a lid on prices, U.S. production  is up by almost 13 percent since mid-2016, resulting in a steep WTI discount of $6.50 per barrel against Brent , making U.S. crude exports attractive. 
Nevertheless, hedge funds and other money managers raised their bullish wagers on U.S. crude futures and options in the week to Oct. 24, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.
The speculator group raised its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 15,041 contracts to 280,634 during the period.
Some analysts added a note of caution.
""We note that both contracts' (Brent and WTI) relative strength indices (RSI) are both approaching overbought levels. This may imply that crude has risen enough in the short term and some consolidation is required,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore.

U.S. crude showed cautious trade around the unchanged mark Monday with the benchmark unable to hold the $54 mark, though the London barrel managed to extend gains.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude December contract slipped 2 cents, or 0.04%, to $53.88 a barrel by 5:12AM ET (9:12GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for January delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rose 23 cents, or 0.38%, to $60.36 a barrel.
Monday’s mixed move was a continuation of a rally at the end of last week that pushed Brent above the $60 mark, spurred by speculation that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will agree to extend a deal to cut levels of production in order to rebalance the market.
The original agreement, struck nearly a year ago between OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia, was to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day for six months. The agreement was then extended in May of this year for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Earlier in the week, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman indicated that the top oil exporter needed to extend production cuts in order to stabilize markets, suggesting an agreement for another nine month extension through the end of next year.

""As part of UAE compliance with the OPEC agreement, ADNOC announced its December crude oil nomination cut,"" Mazroui wrote on his Twitter account. ""This reflects the UAE's continued focus on reducing its oil production by 139,000 (barrels per day) as per its OPEC commitment.""
State-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) said last week it has cut the amount of oil supplies to its customers for December by reducing Murban grade by 15 percent, Das grade by 10 and Upper Zakum crude by 5 percent.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied non-OPEC producers including Russia cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day from Jan. 1, and extended the existing supply curb into March 2018. OPEC will review policy at a Nov. 30 meeting.
Compliance with the cuts among OPEC and other oil producers were over 100 percent in the past couple of months, a rare level of commitment to supply curbs for the organization.

The UAE's compliance, however, has been lower because it is using its own, higher, output level as a reference point for its supply cut, rather than the supply baseline used in the agreement.

1425,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2017 04:08AM ET</span>","U.S. oil exports boom, putting infrastructure to the test","By Catherine Ngai and Bryan Sims
NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Tankers carrying record levels of crude are leaving in droves from Texas and Louisiana ports, and more growth in the fledgling U.S. oil export market may before long test the limits of infrastructure like pipelines, dock space and ship traffic.
U.S. crude exports have boomed since the decades-old ban was lifted less than two years ago, with shipments recently hitting a record of 2 million barrels a day. But shippers and traders fear the rising trend is not sustainable, and if limits are hit, it could pressure the price of U.S. oil.
How much crude the United States can export is a mystery. Most terminal operators and companies will not disclose capacity, and federal agencies like the U.S. Energy Department do not track it. Still, oil export infrastructure will probably need further investment in coming years. Bottlenecks would hit not only storage and loading capacity, but also factors such as pipeline connectivity and shipping traffic.
Analysts believe operators will start to run into bottlenecks if exports rise to 3.5 million to 4 million barrels a day. RBC Capital analysts put the figure lower, around 3.2 million bpd. 
The United States has not come close to that yet. A total of the highest loading days across Houston, Port Arthur, Corpus Christi and St. James/New Orleans - the primary places where crude can be exported - comes to about 3.2 million bpd, according to Kpler, a cargo tracking service. 
But with total U.S. crude production currently at 9.5 million barrels a day and expected to add 800,000 to 1 million bpd annually, export capacity could be tested before long. Over the past four weeks, exports averaged 1.7 million bpd, more than triple a year earlier. 
""Right now, there seems to be a little more wiggle room for export levels,"" said Michael Cohen, head of energy markets research at  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
""Two to three years down the road, if U.S. production continues to grow like current levels, the market will eventually signal that more infrastructure is needed. But I don't think a lot of those plans are in place right now."" 
If exports do hit a bottleneck, it would put a ceiling on how much oil shippers get out of the country. Growing domestic oil production and limited export avenues could sink U.S. crude prices. 
Shippers have booked vessels to go overseas in recent weeks because the premium for global benchmark Brent crude widened to as much as $7 a barrel over U.S. crude, making exports more profitable for domestic producers. 
EXPORT PLANS 
Exports could hit 4 million bpd by 2022, an Enterprise Products Partners LP executive told an industry event in Singapore recently.
Though some operators are already eyeing expansion plans, there are limitations, said Carlin Conner, chief executive at SemGroup Corp, which owns the Houston Fuel Oil Terminal. SemGroup has three docks for exporting crude and is building additional ones. 
""There aren't very many terminals with the needed pipeline capabilities, tank farm capacity and proper docks to load the ships ... Adding this is expensive and not done easily. So there are limitations to unfettered export access,"" he said. 
For instance, exports are expected to start from the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) in early 2018 at around one supertanker a month, according to two sources. The LOOP is potentially a key locale for exports. Its location 18 miles (29 km) offshore means it can handle larger vessels than other, shallower ship channels.
While LOOP can load around 40,000 barrels per hour, operating at that capacity is not likely because that same pipe is used to offload imports, the sources added. LOOP did not respond to a request for comment.
In Houston, when looking at the top 30 loading days, crude exports averaged 700,000 bpd, Kpler added. That includes Enterprise's Houston terminal, among the largest of the export facilities, that had 615,000 bpd.
Other terminal operators are also developing additional facilities. NuStar Energy LP currently can load between 500,000 to 600,000 bpd at its two docks in Corpus Christi, which has about 1 million in capacity, according to a port spokesman. NuStar is developing a third dock, which should come online either late first quarter or early second quarter.

In Houston, Magellan Midstream Partners LP is planning a new 45-foot draft Aframax dock for mid-2018. Aframax vessels can carry about 500,000 to 700,000 barrels of crude.

Catalonia’s parliament on Friday declared independence from Spain, adding to fears over instability in the European Union. The moves prompted Spain’s prime minister to sack the Catalan government and call elections next month.
Bullion is often used as a safe haven in times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty, while riskier assets such as equities are generally sold off.
Gold’s gains were held in check as the U.S. dollar continued to trade near three month highs against a currency basket.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.18% at 94.72 in late trade.
The index hit a high of 95.06 earlier in the session, its strongest level since July 17. For the week the index was still up 1.33%, its largest weekly increase so far this year.
The dollar eased following a report that U.S. President Donald Trump is considering nominating Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to lead the U.S. central bank, a move that would signal continuity for monetary policy.
Powell is seen less hawkish than Stanford University economist John Taylor, another potential nominee to lead the Fed.
The dollar rose earlier after the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy grew at a 3% annual rate in the third quarter, better than forecasts for growth of 2.5%.
The stronger-than-expected reading underlined the case for the Fed to raise interest rates at a faster pace in the coming months. Higher rates tend to make the dollar more attractive to yield seeking investors.
The dollar had already received a boost on Thursday after House Republicans passed a budget blueprint for 2018, setting the stage for a tax overhaul.
Some investors believe tax reforms could bolster growth, adding pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates, known as the ""Trumpflation"" trade.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
Elsewhere in precious metals trading, silver was up 0.4% at $16.87 a troy ounce late Friday, paring its weekly decline to 1.07%, while platinum settled at $918.40, down 0.4% for the day.
Among base metals, copper was down 2.31% at $3.104 in late trade amid profit taking by investors. For the week copper was down 1.81%, the first weekly fall in five weeks.
In the week ahead, investors will be focusing on Wednesday’s Fed meeting for fresh clues on the likely trajectory of monetary policy. Friday’s U.S. jobs report for October will also be closely watched.

1429,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 29, 2017 06:30AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices - Weekly Outlook: October 30 - November 3,"Investing.com - Oil prices rallied on Friday, lifting the U.S. benchmark to its highest finish in nearly eight months and sending the global crude benchmark above $60 a barrel for the first time in more than two years amid expectations that major global producers will extend a deal to curb production beyond its current expiry date next March.
The fog has been cleared ahead of OPEC's next policy meeting by Saudi Arabia and Russia declaring their support for extending a global deal to cut oil supplies for another nine months, OPEC's secretary general said on Friday.
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman said earlier in the week he was in favor of extending the term of the agreement for nine months, following on from similar remarks by Russian made by President Vladimir Putin at the start of October.
Under the original terms of the deal, OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day (bpd) for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine more months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Discussions are continuing in the run-up to the Nov. 30 meeting, which oil ministers from OPEC and the participating non-OPEC countries will attend.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures surged $1.26, or around 2.4%, to end at $53.90 a barrel by close of trade. It reached its best level since March 1 at $54.20 earlier in the session.
For the week, WTI prices rose $2.06, or about 4.7%, the third-straight weekly gain.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., added $1.14, or roughly 1.9%, to settle at $60.44 a barrel. It touched an intraday peak of $60.65, a level not seen since July 2015.
The global benchmark ended the week with an increase of approximately 4.7%.
Rising U.S. crude production remains an issue for OPEC as it strives to clear a global supply overhang.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said Friday that its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the U.S. rose by one to 737, snapping three consecutive weeks of declines.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for domestic oil production.
In other energy trading Friday, gasoline futures advanced 1.8 cents, or 1%, to end at $1.768 on Friday. It closed up around 5.4% for the week.
Heating oil rose 2.5 cents, or 1.4%, at $1.866 a gallon, ending roughly 3.5% higher for the week.
Natural gas futures sank 8.7 cents, or 2.9%, to settle at $2.964 per million British thermal units. It fell 5.6% for the week.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2017 06:42PM ET</span>","U.S. finds China dumped aluminum foil on U.S. market, imposes duties","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Friday it made a preliminary finding that China dumped aluminum foil on the U.S. market and imposed duties ranging from 97 percent to 162 percent.
In 2016, U.S. aluminum foil imports from China were valued at $389 million, it said in a statement. The department said it will issue its final determination on Feb. 23, 2018.
The decision was a victory for U.S. aluminum foil makers who filed a complaint with the department accusing Chinese producers of dumping foil into the U.S. market.
In August, the department placed preliminary anti-subsidy duties of about 17 percent to 81 percent on China's aluminum foil imports.
The Commerce Department was scheduled to issue its preliminary anti-dumping decision on Oct. 5, but delayed it ""to fully analyze information pertaining to China's status as a non-market economy (NME) country,"" the department said at the time.

President Donald Trump's administration has made enforcement of trade laws a top priority. From Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, through Oct. 25, the Commerce Department said it initiated 77 anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations, up 61 percent from the previous year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped about 2 percent on Friday, with global benchmark Brent crude rising above $60 per barrel, on support among the world's top producers for extending a deal to rein in output and as the dollar retreated from three-month peaks.
Saudi Arabia and Russia declared their support for extending an OPEC-led deal to cut supplies for another nine months, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' secretary general said ahead of the group's next policy meeting on Nov. 30. The pact currently runs to March 2018. 
Brent futures (LCOc1) rose $1.14, or 1.9 percent, to settle at $60.44 a barrel after hitting a session peak of $60.53, the highest since July 2015 and more than 35 percent above 2017 lows touched in June.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI) (CLc1) ended the session up $1.26, or 2.4 percent, at $53.90 after reaching a session peak of $53.98 a barrel, the highest since early March. 
For the week, Brent was 4.6 percent higher, notching its third straight weekly gain. U.S. crude rose 4.7 percent for the week.
U.S. crude's gains have lagged the global benchmark amid rising domestic output.
Oil prices have been hovering near their highest levels for this year amid signs of a tightening market, renewed support this week of an extension of production cuts and tensions in Iraq.
However, the announcement on Friday of a ceasefire between Iraqi forces and the Peshmerga from the country's autonomous northern Kurdish region eased some concerns.
""What is interesting is that the pop in WTI futures moved above the Sept. 28 high,"" said David Thompson, executive vice president at Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington.
""So even though the dollar is giving back some of its move, crude may now be trading off of a new driver, the technical breakthrough to a new high.""
The dollar trimmed its earlier gains versus a basket of currencies (DXY) following a Bloomberg report that U.S. President Donald Trump is leaning toward Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as his pick to head the U.S. central bank.
A weaker dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities, including oil, cheaper for holders of other currencies.
""I think the combination of short-covering and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon (NYSE:XOM) both missing their production guidance for the third quarter has resulted in the market strength today,"" said Scott Shelton, energy futures broker with ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Durham, North Carolina.
 TransCanada Corp  (TO:TRP) said in a filing on Thursday that it is seeking to raise the temporary discounted spot rate for light crude on its 700,000 barrel-per-day Marketlink pipeline. That sent WTI's discount to global marker Brent  to the widest in a month. 
OPEC and other major producers including Russia have pledged to reduce production by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to drain a global supply glut.
""If OPEC and their non-OPEC partners can agree to extend their production curtailments through 2018, then we estimate the oil market will remain in modest under-supply until 2019,"" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.
Rising U.S. crude production remains an issue for OPEC as it strives to clear a global supply overhang.
Government data showed that U.S. crude production rose 1.1 million bpd last week to 9.5 million bpd after a decline due to Hurricane Nate, while U.S. oil exports hit a new record four-week average of 1.7 million bpd. [EIA/S]
U.S. drillers added one oil rig in the week to Oct. 27, but the rig count, an indicator of future production, fell by 13 for the month, the biggest such decline since May 2016, data showed.
Hedge funds and other money managers raised their bullish wagers on U.S. crude futures and options in the week to October 24, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday. 
""Momentum may take us a little further here but longer term, I would expect a supply response here domestically,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
""It's a market we feel is rangebound (for U.S. crude) in the mid-$40s to mid-$50s.""

1433,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2017 03:20PM ET</span>",Shell wins three oil blocks in Brazil's deepwater,"By Marta Nogueira and Alexandra Alper
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Oil major Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSA) won half the blocks awarded in Brazil's deepwater oil auction on Friday, while rival  BP  (L:BP) took two blocks and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) took one in a historic opening of the pre-salt play to foreign operators.
Brazil awarded six of the eight blocks on offer in the auction for the rights to pump oil from the country's coveted pre-salt region, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped below thousands of feet of salt in the country's Atlantic waters.
The wins will bolster Shell's position as the largest foreign operator in Brazil's offshore oil sector, second only to state-run oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) (SA:PETR4). 
The Anglo-Dutch oil major won one area in consortium with France's  Total  SA (PA:TOTF), another with Petrobras and Repsol-Sinopec, and a third with Qatar Petroleum International (QPI) and China's CNOOC.
Shell has said it is confident it can pump from the pre-salt fields at below $40 a barrel.
Rival BP Plc (L:BP), which is active in Brazil but not yet producing oil, took two more blocks on Friday. 
""We see the government of Brazil being more supportive of foreign companies entering Brazil,"" BP Latin America President Felipe Arbelaez said after the rounds.
""There are high quality assets. We believe that the assets here will be resilient in any price environment.""
Brazil earned 6.15 billion reais ($1.88 billion) in signing bonuses for the six fields that it awarded in the auction. 
President Michel Temer's government has enacted reforms to make the energy sector more attractive to foreign investment, and for the first time international oil firms will be allowed to operate fields in the pre-salt. 
Countries worldwide sitting on oil and gas reserves are keen to pump it before it becomes less valuable as global policies to address climate change kick in.
The opposition in Brazil has opposed some of the reforms, and the auction was delayed by three hours on Friday after a federal judge issued an injunction to suspend the process at the behest of the leftist Workers Party.
That left top executives from the world's largest oil companies milling around in the hotel that hosted the auction, in an upscale seaside neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro.
EXXON
In a twist, U.S. major Exxon Mobil, whose 10-block win in last month's Brazilian auction was seen by many as a prelude to a big play on Friday, took just one block as part of a consortium with Norway's  Statoil  ASA (OL:STL) and Portugal's Petrogal [PETP.UL], a unit of  Galp Energia  (LS:GALP). Two blocks got no bids. 
The quality of reserves and the reforms have made Brazil an important target for oil majors, even though they have had less appetite for capital-intensive mega projects since crude prices crashed in 2014. 
Brazil has high hopes for the volume of oil the companies can pump from the blocks. Brazilian oil output could double to more than 5 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2027, compared with the 2.6 million bpd produced in August, regulator ANP said on Thursday.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for December delivery rose by 2.4% to settle at $53.90 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 1.75% to trade at $60.35 a barrel.
Crude oil prices settled at their highest since March as investors received the strongest signal yet that support for prolonged cuts is growing among Opec members after Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters on Thursday the kingdom would support extending output cuts in order to rid the market of excess supplies.
In May, Opec producers agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.2 million bpd agreed in November last year.
The comments, weeks after Russia President Vladimir Putin said he supported the idea of extending the output-cut agreement through 2018, eased concerns over a potential uptick in global output after Iraq and Peshmerga Kurdish forces agreed to a ceasefire, reducing the possibility of supply disruptions.
In the U.S., meanwhile, investors mulled over data showing the number of oil rigs rose, snapping a three consecutive weeks of declines.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said Friday its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the United States rose by 1 to 737.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $2.91, or 0.24%, to $1,272.52 a troy ounce.
Gross domestic product increased at a 3.0% annual rate in the July-September period, the Commerce Department said in its initial estimate on Friday. That was above economists’ estimates for growth of 2.5%.
The upbeat growth sparked a surge in both the dollar and U.S. treasury yields which limited gains in gold prices amid ongoing speculation concerning President Donald Trump’s choice of candidate for the Fed’s top post. 
President Donald Trump is leaning toward appointing Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to be next chairman of the Fed, Politico reported Thursday, citing a source. 
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Gold prices are on track for a second-straight week of losses amid growing optimism that upbeat economic data could persuade the Fed to adopt a more aggressive monetary policy outlook. 
“U.S. economic news flow has markedly firmed relative to forecasts since mid-June, opening the door for an upside surprise that stokes tightening bets further and compounds pressure on the yellow metal,” said Ilya Spivak, commodities and currency strategist with Daily FX.

1437,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 27, 2017 01:00PM ET</span>",Venezuela State Oil Company Says It Made Vital Bond Payment,"(Bloomberg) -- Venezuela’s state-run oil company said it transferred the funds to make an $842 million principal payment on its bonds due Friday, overcoming the first of many hurdles the country will face in coming days as it seeks to avoid sinking into default.
The announcement spread a sense of relief to investors in the bond market, who drove up Venezuelan asset prices across the board Friday. A second big payment is due Nov. 2, and the country’s decision to disburse the cash for today’s payment indicates that it likely intends to meet that one too.
But plenty of obstacles remain, including the immediate challenge of ensuring that the cash makes it all the way into the accounts of creditors. In recent weeks, Venezuelan officials told investors that less-critical interest payments have gotten held up in the payment chain because U.S. sanctions on the government scared many international banks into refusing to take part in the cash transfers.
“Given logistics and steps needed to get payment to bondholders, I doubt that the money will arrive by the end of today,” said Ray Zucaro, the chief investment officer at Miami-based RVX Asset Management. “Monday is more realistic, and then we will hear a big sigh of relief.”
While Petroleos de Venezuela SA said it made the principal payment on amortizing notes due 2020, there was no reference to the $107 million of interest due at the same time. The company and government have been using grace periods on more than half a billion dollars of such payments due this month, but the principal amount Friday had no such buffer. It’s next big challenge is the additional $1.2 billion owed on notes maturing next week.
“I don’t think we’ll sweat as much going into November 2, given the fact that they’ve made this amortization payment,” said Siobhan Morden, who heads Nomura Securities International’s Latin America fixed-income strategy. Missing the interest owed “reaffirms the coupon watch and concerns that they continue to struggle to make these payments.”
A default for PDVSA could have potentially been disastrous at a time when access to credit has already been severely curtailed, refineries are running at less than half of their capacity and oil output has tanked to less than 2 million barrels a day. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has insisted that his government will continue to honor its international obligations even as he curbs imports to save cash for debt payments, causing shortages of goods to worsen in a nation already suffering a deep recession and hyperinflation.
PDVSA “confirms its full solvency and capacity to fulfill its commitments, despite the economic war and the imposition of unjustified sanctions from Donald Trump,” the oil firm said in its statement.
The notes due 2020 jumped 3.5 cents to 85 cents on the dollar as of 12:27 p.m. in New York, while the securities due next week climbed to a three-year high of 95.8 cents. Sovereign bonds due in 2027 leaped 9.6 percent to 36.9 cents on the dollar.
To be sure, there are plenty of Venezuela watchers -- including economists such as Ricardo Hausmann -- who have been urging the government to stop payments. They say the debt load is unsustainable, and sending dollars to foreign investors while cutting back on imports of food, medicine and basic goods for the Venezuelan people is immoral.

The government and PDVSA will owe international creditors $10 billion in bond payments next year and $14 billion in 2019, according to Capital Economics. International reserves have sunk to a 15-year low near $10 billion.
“It remains a question of when -- not if -- PDVSA and the government default,” analysts at the research firm said in a note Friday.
If PDVSA makes the pending payments through next week, Venezuela should have a smooth ride until its next hefty chunk of payments come due in April 2018, according to Jan Dehn, the head of research at London-based Ashmore Group Plc, which oversees about $58 billion of assets and is the largest reported holder of PDVSA’s 2020 and 2017 bonds.
“They were saving up to make these very large payments,” he said.

The documents relate to Glencore’s acquisition of Katanga Mining Ltd., which runs copper and cobalt mines in Congo, and dealings with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, said the people, asking not to be identified because the records haven’t been made public.
Appleby, a Bermuda-based provider of offshore legal services, said on Tuesday that it suffered a “data security incident” last year and reporters from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and other media groups had recently been asking questions about leaked information.
""Appleby has thoroughly and vigorously investigated the allegations and we are satisfied that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing,"" the firm said in a statement posted on its website.
Appleby was told by the ICIJ that the journalists are investigating documents that detail Appleby’s business with a wide range of clients, the law firm said in the statement. Appleby has both corporate and high net-worth individuals as clients, according to its web site.
The journalist group is known for publishing the Panama Papers, a trove of files from law firm Mossack Fonseca made public in 2016 that exposed offshore companies and hidden financial dealings.
Congo Copper
While Bloomberg News hasn’t seen the confidential Appleby documents, public records show Appleby lawyers advised Katanga on various transactions. Those include the merger with Gertler’s Nikanor Plc in 2007, and rights offers and loan agreements with Glencore between 2007 and 2009.
Spokesmen for Glencore, Gertler and the ICIJ declined to comment. Appleby did not respond to a voice message seeking comment.
Glencore, the world’s biggest commodities trader, is a major investor in Congo and has created thousands of jobs, helping the nation become Africa’s top copper producer. However, its business with Gertler, a friend of Congo President Joseph Kabila, has been contentious.
Last year, hedge fund manager Och-Ziff Capital Management agreed to pay U.S. authorities $412 million to settle charges that it participated in a bribery scheme involving Congolese officials. As part of the settlement, Och-Ziff acknowledged that it made a loan in 2010 to its partner in Congo to buy Katanga shares. That partner was Gertler, according to a person familiar with the matter. Glencore wasn’t accused of any wrongdoing.
Glencore’s work with Gertler on the takeover of Katanga has been questioned by Global Witness, a London-based advocacy group. In 2014, it released a report saying Glencore may have channeled funds to Gertler at the expense of other Katanga shareholders. Glencore denied those allegations.
In February, Glencore cut ties with Gertler in a $960 million deal to acquire his stakes in Katanga and Mutanda Mining. Gertler’s company has said it still receives royalties from both projects.
Peter Grauer, the chairman of Bloomberg LP, is a senior independent non-executive director at Glencore.

LONDON (Reuters) - The fog has been cleared ahead of OPEC's next policy meeting by Saudi Arabia and Russia declaring their support for extending a global deal to cut oil supplies for another nine months, OPEC's secretary general told Reuters on Friday.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, have cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to get rid of a supply glut. The pact runs to March 2018 and they are considering extending it.
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman said this week he was in favor of extending the term of the agreement for nine months, following on from similar remarks by Russian made by President Vladimir Putin on Oct 4. 
""OPEC welcomes the clear guidance from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia on the need to achieve stable oil markets and sustain it beyond the first quarter of 2018,"" OPEC's Mohammad Barkindo told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference.
""Together with the statement expressed by President Putin this clears the fog on the way to Vienna on Nov. 30.""
""It's always good to have this high-level feedback and guidance,"" Barkindo added, when asked if the crown prince's comments suggested a nine-month extension of the pact looked more likely.
Reuters reported on Oct. 18, citing OPEC sources, that producers were leaning towards extending the deal for nine months, though the decision could be postponed until early next year depending on the market.
Discussions are continuing in the run-up to the Nov. 30 meeting, which oil ministers from OPEC and the participating non-OPEC countries will attend.
The deal has supported the oil price, which on Friday reached $59.91 a barrel, the highest level since July 2015, but a backlog of stored oil has yet to be run down and prices are still at half the level of mid-2014.
The supply pact is aimed at reducing oil stocks in OECD industrialized countries to their five-year average, and the latest figures suggest producers are just over half way there.

Stock levels in September stood at about 160 million barrels above that average, according to OPEC data, down from January's 340 million barrels above the five-year average.

Other participants include  BP  (L:BP),  Total  (PA:TOTF), Eni (MI:ENI), Repsol (MC:REP),  Statoil  (OL:STL), CNPC, Pemex [PEMX.UL] and  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI).
Together, the 10 firms produce around 20 percent of the world's oil and gas and last year pledged to invest $1 billion over 10 years on technologies to curb climate change.
Rangarajan said new members would be expected to pledge a further $100 million each.
In the first investments, U.S. firm Solidia Technologies will receive funding for making cement with carbon dioxide instead of water, potentially lowering emissions by 70 percent and water use by 80 percent, the OGCI said. 
It will also help U.S.-based Achates Power, which develops vehicle engines that produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions, to roll out its technology worldwide. 
Financial details were not revealed.
Neither of the U.S. oil majors, Exxon (N:XOM) or  Chevron  (N:CVX), are a part of the initiative. Rangarajan said the location of its members was not a factor in deciding where investments would be made.
""We have to be open to looking anywhere in the world for the best ideas,"" she said. 
The OGCI also plans to help design a full-scale gas power plant with carbon capture and storage technology (CCS), although it did not specify where the project would be built, or how much funding would be allocated.
The International Energy Association (IEA) said CCS technology is vital if the target to limit a global rise in temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius, as set out in the Paris climate agreement, is to be met.
However, CCS project developers have struggled to bring down costs. There are currently fewer than 40 large-scale CCS projects globally and the majority of these are pilot schemes.

In early morning trade, oil prices were clawing back from prior losses and breached positive territory.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude December contract gained 30 cents, or 0.57%, to $52.94 a barrel by 9:52AM ET (13:52GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for December delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rose 10 cents, or 0.17%, to $59.40 a barrel.
Oil prices have moved higher this week on speculation that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will agree to extend a deal to cut levels of production in order to rebalance the market.
The original agreement, struck nearly a year ago between OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia, was to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day for six months. The agreement was then extended in May of this year for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Crude rose nearly 1% on Thursday after Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman indicated that the top oil exporter needed to extend production cuts in order to stabilize markets, suggesting agreement for another nine month extension.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said in Moscow earlier this month that November was too early to make a decision, but, at the same time, added that he doesn't rule out an extension to the end of 2018.
On Friday, OPEC’s Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo declared that “OPEC welcomes the clear guidance from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia on the need to achieve stable oil markets and sustain it beyond the first quarter of 2018.”
“Together with the statement expressed by President Putin this clears the fog on the way to (the cartel’s next meeting in) Vienna on November 30,” he added in comments to Reuters.
Later on Friday, market participants will also keep an eye on increasing U.S. shale production when Baker Hughes releases its most recent weekly rig count data.
Last week the oilfield services firm said that its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell by seven to 736, chalking up its third straight decline to the lowest level since June.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for November delivery fell 0.21% at $1.7476 a gallon by 9:53AM ET (13:53GMT), while November heating oil gained 0.23% to $1.8462 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for November delivery traded down 3.43% to $2.791 per million British thermal units."

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for December delivery lost $0.57, or about 0.04%, to $1.269.03 a troy ounce by 4:01AM ET (8:01GMT).
That was just off an intraday low of $1,266.28 touched earlier in the session, its lowest level since October 6.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose 0.20% at 94.74. That was close to a 3-month high of 94.98 reached on July 20.
Gold is sensitive to a stronger dollar as the gains in the greenback made the precious metal more expensive for holders of foreign currency.
The dollar found further support overnight after the U.S. House passed a budget resolution Thursday, paving the way for Congress to move on to “massive tax cuts” proposed by President Donald Trump.
The greenback found upside earlier on Thursday in its exchange with the euro as the single currency felt pressure from the European Central Bank’s decision to pare its bond purchases while extending its monetary stimulus program for a period of nine months.
ECB president Mario Draghi’s indicated that the central bank’s asset purchase program is “open ended”, leaving the door open to a prolonged period of monetary stimulus beyond September 2018.
Draghi further assured market participants that the ECB would continue to reinvest principal payments from maturing bonds in the program well after the monetary authority stops expanding its balance sheet.
Traders were also wary of data out stateside later in Friday’s session.
The U.S. is to release preliminary figures on third-quarter economic growth at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT) Friday.
The report is expected to show growth slowing to an annual rate of 2.6% from 3.1%, with a decline in retail sales, industrial production, homebuilding and home sales blamed on Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

Overnight, crude oil prices settled higher on Thursday as recent data showing an uptick in U.S. crude supplies and a surge in domestic production was offset by growing expectations that Opec will extend its global accord to cut output.
Crude Oil prices struggled for direction as investors weighed the recent uptick in U.S. crude supplies and production against growing expectations that Opec would extend its supply-cut agreement amid bullish comments from Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Answering a question on whether he supported extending the production cut agreement, Prince Salman said “of course” and insisted that Opec “need to continue stabilizing the market”, fuelling investor expectations that support for prolonged cuts is growing among Opec members.
“Everyone is looking forward to the OPEC meeting at the end of next month,” said Thomas Pugh, a commodities economist at Capital Economics.
In May, Opec producers agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.2 million bpd agreed in November last year.
The bullish comments helped turn sentiment on oil prices positive amid investor concerns over recent data showing both U.S. crude supplies and domestic production jumped last week.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by roughly 856,000 barrels in the week ended Oct. 20, missing expectations of a draw of 2.6m barrels. That was the first increase in five weeks.
U.S. crude production, meanwhile, surged to 9.5m barrels per day (bpd) as daily exports of crude, diesel and other petroleum products climbed to 7.66m barrels last week, the EIA said Wednesday.

1446,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",Brazil vs. Mexico: Latin America's fight for Big Oil's money,"By Marianna Parraga and Alexandra Alper
HOUSTON/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil and Mexico are competing for a diminishing resource: the investment dollars of oil majors beating a retreat from the big-ticket offshore projects they once coveted.
After two waves of resource nationalism that left few openings in Latin America for energy giants such as  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) and  Total  (PA:TOTF), the tables are turning.
Governments throughout the continent are enacting reforms and changing contract terms to lure oil firms that have slashed spending as they adapt to lower crude prices. Global policy changes to address climate change have given an added sense of urgency to governments in the region and worldwide that are sitting on oil and gas reserves. They want to pump it before it becomes less valuable.
The competition pits Brazil's high-cost but prolific deepwater reserves against lower-cost oilfields in Mexico that come with a larger dose of political risk. [For a graphic on Brazil vs Mexico crude output and rig count click on http://tmsnrt.rs/2lfbP9n]
""Both are attractive. Both have real potential,"" said Wael Sawan, Shell's executive vice president for deepwater. ""We have as a company, I think as an industry, scarce capital resources to be able to make the investments that the particular projects in deep water require."" 
Sawan is among the executives from the world's top energy firms who have jetted into Rio de Janeiro this week, hoping to win fields in Brazil's latest auction.
Brazil has created a more conducive environment for investment than in the past, and venturing into Mexico looks exciting despite concerns over political risk and lack of infrastructure, he said.
Low crude prices have made oil firms choose carefully where they invest, but they need the substantial reserves Brazil and Mexico are offering. The rate that energy companies replace the barrels they produce is a key metric for shareholders, and offshore blocks such as those in Mexico and Brazil come with billions of barrels in available reserves. 
BETTER TERMS FOR TECHNOLOGY
Latin America governments have relaxed deal terms and set accelerated auction schedules to lure investment to everything from ultra-deep water to mature fields that need specialist technology to squeeze more oil and gas from wells.
To boost its chances, Brazil has ended its requirement for state-controlled Petrobras (SA:PETR4) to be the operator of deep-sea projects in the country's pre-salt province, which contains large volumes of high-value light oil. That gives majors more freedom to manage exploration and output.
Brazil has loosened local content requirements on equipment and supplies, which had previously slowed development, and set out a three-year calendar of oilfield auctions to facilitate planning for foreign firms.
Mexico has countered with an easier qualification process to bid in auctions and is selling geological data on oilfields for majors and service firms to reprocess, while offering flexible local content requirements according to field type.
For many oil majors, the Mexican side of the Gulf offers a familiar geology: the formations below the seabed are similar to those they have drilled for decades in the nearby U.S. waters. But unlike Brazil, there has been no deepwater development in Mexico, so more infrastructure needs to be built.
Beyond the potential of the oilfields, the two countries offer different political challenges. 
Mexico's relatively recent reforms and a presidential election in 2018 imply a high political risk for majors, many of which were squeezed out of their Venezuela holdings by the country's socialist governments in the last decade. 
Foreign firms are beginning to operate in Mexico just as the country's relationship with the United States worsens as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks trade concessions from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.
Trump's public statements on Mexico have riled many Mexicans, giving the leftist opposition firebrand Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is openly critical of Trump, a lift in the opinion polls. Lopez Obrador has said he could hold a referendum on the energy reform if he became president. [nL4N1FV4PI]
""I have no doubts that Mexico could be more attractive than Brazil,"" said Francisco Monaldi, a fellow in Latin American Energy Policy at Rice University's Baker Institute.
""But the possible combination of Trump and Lopez Obrador is scary for investors,"" Monaldi said. 
Mexico's next bidding round should be concluded in January and includes 29 blocks that hold an estimated 4.2 billion barrels of prospective reserves. Another 35 blocks in shallow water areas with potentially 2 billion barrels will follow, with results expected to be announced in March. [nL2N1MU1PT]
MAJOR BIDS FOR OIL
Brazilian authorities have billed the round to be held on Friday its most competitive yet. Some 16 firms qualified to bid for blocks in the country's pre-salt reservoirs, where oil and gas are trapped under layers of salt beneath the ocean floor. 
""In the last year we have made extraordinary advances in the regulatory framework,"" said Joao Carlos de Luca, an adviser to the Brazilian Petroleum, Gas and Biofuels Institute that represents oil companies working in the country. ""That has put Brazil back on the map.""
The previous auction, for 287 blocks in September, received $1.2 billion in offers, far more than expected. That was largely down to Exxon, which stole the show with aggressive bids. Until that round, Exxon was one of the few big oil firms absent from Brazil's offshore areas. 
Exxon has spent heavily this year on projects to replenish diminishing reserves, including in the U.S. Permian Basin shale play.
In South America, Exxon has also invested in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale areas while venturing into offshore Guyana along with  Hess Corp  (N:HES) in a $4.4 billion offshore project. [nL2N1M929Q] [nL3N1JD3UC] [nL2N1LI1RA]
In Ecuador, where every administration in recent decades has changed the country's oil contracts, President Lenin Moreno has called two new bidding rounds in 2018 for up to 24 blocks under more attractive terms. [nL2N1MH14S]
Argentina also plans to announce next year a bidding round for oil and gas exploration blocks off its Atlantic coast after a 15-year hiatus on offshore auctions.
""Current conditions are exactly opposed to those for nationalism. Everybody is now offering fields, but the spots available in the majors' portfolios under $50-60 per barrel of crude are just a few,"" Monaldi said.
Other oil majors including  BP  Plc (L:BP) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) also are exploring investment opportunities in the region, from the Gulf of Mexico to Argentina.
But making the case within oil majors for offshore capital-intensive projects is a challenge, said Javier La Rosa, president of Chevron's Brazil unit, at an industry conference in Rio on Wednesday.

""I face this battle each year when our corporate business plan is put out,"" he said. ""It is not easy to convince shareholders to spend more money on deepwater fields when there are other lower cost options still available.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent crude closed at a 27-month high on Thursday as the market focused more on comments from Saudi Arabia about ending a global supply glut instead of an unexpected increase in U.S. crude inventories and high U.S. production and exports.
Brent futures (LCOc1) gained 86 cents, or 1.5 percent, to settle at $59.30 a barrel, its highest close since July 3, 2015.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1), meanwhile, rose 46 cents, or 0.9 percent, to settle at a six-month high of $52.64, its highest close since April 17.
With Thursday's gains, Brent futures were up for three days in a row following comments earlier in the week from Saudi Arabia that the Kingdom was determined to end a global supply glut that has weighed on prices for more than three years.
""We are committed to work with all producers, OPEC and non-OPEC countries ... We will support anything to stabilise the oil demand and supply,"" Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman told Reuters on Thursday when asked whether the kingdom would support extending an agreement to cut supplies until the end of 2018.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), plus Russia and nine other producers, have cut oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) since January. The pact runs to March 2018, but they are considering extending it.
""When you couple what Mohammed Bin Salman said along with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, you have to realize we have two of the largest oil producers basically putting a blessing on an extension of production cuts through the end of 2018,"" Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors.
Putin said earlier this month the oil supply deal could be extended to the end of 2018, although OPEC ministers have not given specific commitments on doing so.
""Price volatility in the oil market is expected to persist in the run-up to the November OPEC meeting. Saudi Arabia’s bullish stance, together with ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, will remain supportive of prices,"" said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.
OPEC will next meet on Nov. 30 in Vienna. 
""However, the market is also mindful of rising oil production in the United States and persistently high exports from the country, which will cap price gains,” Kumar noted.
U.S. crude inventories rose by 856,000 barrels last week, U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed on Wednesday, versus analysts' forecast for a 2.6 million-barrel draw. [EIA/S]
The data also showed that U.S. crude production rose 1.1 million bpd last week to 9.5 million bpd after a decline due to Hurricane Nate, while U.S. oil exports hit a new record four-week average of 1.7 million bpd. [EIA/S]
""We continue to highlight a near record level of crude exports that appears sustainable near 2 (million bpd) through next month due to a widening Brent-WTI spread that pushed above $6 per barrel resistance in yesterday’s trade,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note.

Brent's premium over WTI  was up 6.7 percent on Thursday at $6.68 amidst renewed strength in the global benchmark.

To appreciate the impact of the recent jump in prices, one need look no further than the streets of Chicago. A police locale put out a bulletin on Oct. 23 alerting residents to thefts of catalytic converters, vehicle pollution-control devices that contain palladium. About 75 percent of palladium demand is related to the production of auto-catalysts,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA said in a note.
The price of palladium has climbed as robust U.S. auto sales add to demand, with supplies of the metal expected to tighten further. Palladium has surged about 42 percent this year, outperforming precious metals including gold, silver and palladium and fueling demand in the scrap market. 
“When you see prices rally and then some thefts going on, it’s generally about price and availability,” Peter Thomas, senior vice president at Zaner Group in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Usually it’s someone who finds a friendly recycler that won’t ask any questions. Thieves slide under the car with a hacksaw.”
The metal last month eclipsed the price of platinum, which helps to reduce smog from diesel vehicles, for the first time since since 2001.

""Mexico does not agree with the legal reasoning of the WTO ruling,"" the ministry said in a statement after the decision, which undermines its claim for sanctions against Washington.
The ruling comes as Mexico, the United States and Canada engage in fraught talks to try to save the North American Free Trade Agreement, a lynchpin of the Mexican economy.
U.S. President Donald Trump says NAFTA is unfairly balanced in Mexico's favor, killing U.S jobs and manufacturing, and has threatened to pull out of the pact.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer welcomed Thursday's ruling, saying the WTO had now decisively rejected Mexico's argument.
""I am pleased that WTO panels have finally agreed with the overwhelming evidence that U.S. dolphin-safe labeling requirements are accurate and fair,"" Lighthizer said in a statement.
""The Trump Administration is committed to defending U.S. rights to enforce environmental measures that protect wildlife and facilitate fair trade.""
Mexico has said since 2008 that U.S. ""dolphin-safe"" labeling on tuna products is inconsistent with WTO rules and unfairly penalized its fishing industry. The United States has objected to Mexican fleets' method of catching tuna that involves chasing and capturing dolphins in nets.
WTO judges had previously faulted the U.S. rules on tuna and authorized Mexican trade sanctions.
The United States, however, said it had done enough to bring its laws into line and claimed an exemption from the WTO rules on the grounds of environmental conservation.
Mexico has said it had cut dolphin deaths to minimal levels but that U.S. demands for paperwork and sometimes government observers were discriminatory. Tuna catches from other regions did not face the same stringent tests, the nation said.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 64 billion cubic feet in the week ended October 20, while analysts had forecast an increase of 65 billion.
After the release, natural gas for delivery in November on the New York Mercantile Exchange lost 2.2 cents, or about 0.75%, to trade at $2.897 per million British thermal units by 10:33AM ET (14:33GMT).
Futures had been declining by 2.9 cents, or 0.99%, at $2.890 prior to the release of the supply data.
That compared with a build of 51 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the preceding week and represented a decline of 189 billion from a year earlier and was 46 bcf below the five-year average.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.710 trillion cubic feet, 4.8% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 1.2% below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather weakens demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks."

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dipped 20 cents, or around 0.4%, at $51.98 a barrel by 3:15AM ET (0715GMT), after losing 29 cents, or 0.6%, a day earlier.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., shed 11 cents, or 0.2%, to $58.34 a barrel.
Oil prices settled lower on Wednesday, pressured by an unexpected increase in U.S. crude inventories and as oil output and exports from the United States rose last week.
Crude oil inventories rose by 856,000 barrels, according to the EIA, marking the first increase in five weeks. That compared with analysts' expectations for a decline of 2.6 million barrels.
The report also showed that domestic production rebounded by 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) to 9.5 million and net imports rose by just over 500,000 bpd, after the falloff due to Hurricane Nate the week before.
Prices remained supported by comments from Saudi Arabia's energy minister on Tuesday reiterating its determination to end a global supply glut and as geopolitical turmoil threatened global inventories.
In other energy trading Thursday, gasoline futures held steady at $1.731 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 0.4 cents to $1.814 a gallon.
Gasoline inventories fell by 5.5 million barrels last week, much more than expectations for a decline of 17,000 barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a decline of 5.2 million barrels.
Natural gas futures rose 0.6 cents to $2.925 per million British thermal units, as traders looked ahead to weekly storage data due later in the global day.

The ECB is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates when it announces its monetary policy decision at 7:45AM ET (1145GMT) Thursday. Most of the focus will be on President Mario Draghi's press conference 45 minutes after the announcement, as investors look for more clues on when and how it could start unwinding its monthly quantitative easing program.
Market experts believe the ECB will announce that it will start trimming its monthly asset purchases to €40 billion from the current €60 billion beginning in January.
They were mostly split on whether the program would last six or nine more months after that.
Sources close to the ECB's pre-meeting discussions say the a nine-month extension seems likely with debate over monthly volumes between €25-and-€40 billion a month.
But the real issue will be whether to keep the asset buys open ended, making another extension possible, or signal an eventual end of bond purchases, as demanded by hawks, including powerhouse Germany.
Comex gold futures rose $3.50, or around 0.3%, to $1,282.42 a troy ounce by 2:50AM ET (0650GMT) after touching its worst level since Oct. 6 at $1,272.00 in the last session.
The yellow metal recovered from an early decline to eke out a small gain Wednesday as the dollar and stocks lost some steam after a recent rally.
Meanwhile, market watchers continued to grapple with uncertainty over who will become the next Federal Reserve chief and how that will influence the outlook for interest rates.
President Donald Trump had on Tuesday polled the Republicans on whether they would prefer Stanford University economist John Taylor or current Fed Governor Jerome Powell for the job, and more senators preferred Taylor.
Taylor is seen as someone who may put the Fed on a path of faster interest rate increases compared to current Fed chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires next February.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, was a shade lower at 93.46, edging away from a two-week high of 93.90 set on Monday.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures tacked on 9.0 cents, or 0.5%, to $17.01 a troy ounce. Among other precious metals, platinum was little changed at $926.30, while palladium gained 0.7% to $964.28 an ounce.
Meanwhile, copper futures shed 0.7 cents, or 0.2%, to $3.176 a pound. It hit its best level since Aug. 2014 at $3.239 on Tuesday, boosted by expectations of strong economic growth in China, the world's top user of the red metal.

1457,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>",U.S. farmers tighten belts to compete with cheap LatAm grain,"By Mark Weinraub and P.J. Huffstutter
CHICAGO (Reuters) - When Kansas farmer Tom Giessel drove over a deer carcass and punctured a tire on his combine during harvest this fall, he did not have the time or cash to fix it. He borrowed his neighbor's tractor to finish.
U.S. farmers are cutting costs any way they can to compete against cheaper producers in Argentina and Brazil. Four years of global oversupply have pushed down grain prices, reduced agricultural revenues and put more expensive producers under financial pressure.
In response, U.S. farmers have bought cheaper seeds, spent less on fertilizers and delayed equipment purchases as they seek to ride out the downturn. But more bumper harvest forecasts and rising energy prices herald another tough year for farmers in 2018.
""The logical thing to do is stop farming,"" said Giessel, 64, who farms about 5,000 acres and has worked on the land all of his adult life.
Giessel has cut spending on what he can control - seeds, chemicals, fertilizer, rented land - and chewed through his farm's savings. He stands to lose $93 an acre, or nearly $15,000, on one corn field alone this year.
""My burn rate is a raging fire. And I am no different than anyone else out here,"" Giessel said.
Some farmers have had to sell assets to keep afloat. Others have gone into bankruptcy.
U.S. farmers have taken another hit this year because of rising prices of labor, fuel and electricity. Those costs together account for about 14.5 percent of total expenses and are largely out of farmers' control. Interest expenses have also risen as banks have tightened credit to the agricultural sector.
These items were expected to push overall costs up 1.3 percent in 2017, which would mark the first year since 2014 that farmers have failed to reduce total costs.
Farmers cut $40.20 billion to bring total costs down to $350.49 billion between 2014 and 2016, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service.
The downturn in spending has hurt farm equipment manufacturers.
Sales in the agriculture division at Deere & Co (N:DE) and  CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI) fell sharply during 2015 and 2016. Deere expects farm equipment sales in the United States and Canada to be down another 5 percent this year, and CNH said in July that sales in North America were down.
CROP PRICES, YIELD
Falls in crop prices have outpaced the cuts farmers have made in spending.
Corn futures (Cv1) have dropped about 12 percent during 2017 from 2014 averages while soybean prices are 17 percent lower and wheat has tumbled 24 percent.
Farmers are looking for bigger yields through better seed and pesticide technology to improve their ability to compete with their counterparts in Latin America and elsewhere. But they are struggling to afford the expensive latest varieties as they tighten their belts.
Hardier seed breeds and rising yields have for years boosted U.S. farm productivity. But they have also contributed to the massive oversupply in global grains markets.
Saving money on capital purchases is one thing. But cuts to farm inputs – from reducing how many seeds are planted to cutting back on fertilizer use – will eventually hurt productivity, say farmers.
 ""You find yourself in a Catch-22,"" said Jeff Fisher, who grows corn and soybeans on 1,600 acres in Illinois.
""You just hope the yield won't be hit too bad next year.""
David Miller, who grows corn and soybeans on 500 acres in southern Iowa, saved about $8 per acre for beans and some $20 per acre for corn by using cheaper seeds.
The risk is that they will produce a smaller harvest. Adding to that concern: After a dry summer, he expects his poorest soybean field to yield around 20 bushels per acre, 65 percent off the state average.
Even with the cuts, U.S. farmers are still spending more per acre than their competitors in Latin America.
In Argentina, corn was expected to cost just under $200 per acre in the 2017/2018 season, according to Ezequiel de Freijo, analyst at farm association Sociedad Rural's Institute of Economic Studies, well below the around $310 per acre in the United States in 2016.
Soy farmers in the Latin American country are spending around $115 an acre, compared to around $163 in the United States during 2016
The lower costs have helped Latin American producers take market share from their competitors in the United States. Brazil and Argentina combined are expected to capture nearly 42 percent of the global corn export market in the 2017/2018 crop year, up from under 38 percent in 2014/2015.
During the same period, the United States saw its share of global corn exports drop to around 31 percent of the market from 33.5 percent.
Latin American farmers, like their counterparts in the north, are also searching for ways to cut costs to boost their margins and take more of the global market from competitors.
""We are cutting use of fertilisers, for example,"" said José Fernandes, who farms 400 hectares, or nearly 1,000 acres, of soy in Brazil's key Mato Grosso production region.

""We have been 'burning fat' for a long time here on costs.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices slipped on Wednesday after a surprising increase in U.S. crude inventories, while U.S. gasoline futures rallied 1 percent on a sharp falloff in inventories.
Brent crude edged up after top exporter Saudi Arabia reiterated its determination to end a three-year supply glut.
The deep draw in gasoline inventories came even as refining output rose, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This suggested demand remained strong after the peak U.S. driving season.
Crude inventories rose by 856,000 barrels in the week to Oct. 20, the EIA said. Analysts had expected a decrease of 2.6 million barrels. Production rebounded from a falloff due to Hurricane Nate, and imports rose.
Brent crude futures settled up 11 cents at $58.44 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 29 cents to $52.18.
The EIA data showed gasoline and distillate inventories both fell by more than 5 million barrels, and refinery utilization rates rose 3.3 percentage points. 
RBOB futures rose 1.1 percent to $1.7341 a gallon. Heating oil futures got a brief boost but settled slightly lower. 
""Demand has been a little stronger than some people might have anticipated as we pushed out of the driving season, and that's where today's strength is coming from,"" said Gene McGillian, manager of research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn.
On Tuesday, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih on Tuesday raised the prospect of prolonged output restraint even after the end of an OPEC-led pact to cut supplies.
Even as global inventory levels are falling, Brent has remained below $60 a barrel, partly on concern the crude glut may grow again after March 2018, when the output reduction deal is due to end.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers have cut oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). OPEC's next meeting is on Nov. 7 in Vienna, Austria, when they will consider extending the deal.
While other producers cut output, U.S. production rebounded to 9.5 million bpd in the latest week. U.S. crude exports have averaged 1.7 million barrels a day over the past four weeks, the highest ever.
""Saudi Arabia's determination to rebalance the market, together with ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, will remain supportive of oil prices,"" said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London. 
""However, rising oil production in the U.S. and persistently high exports from the country will be the key bearish factors."" 

Disruptions to exports from Iraq, OPEC's second-largest producer, have supported oil. Kurdish authorities on Wednesday offered to suspend their independence drive, but Baghdad said it would continue its offensive to retake Kurdish territory.

1464,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 25, 2017 12:00PM ET</span>",Fear of Iranian general left Iraqi Kurdish oil fields deserted,"By Ahmed Rasheed and Dmitry Zhdannikov
BAGHDAD/LONDON (Reuters) - When the Iraqi army and Iranian-backed Shi'ite militia entered a key oil processing facility in Iraq's north to retake it from Kurdish Peshmerga forces last week, the installation was deserted and its alarm bells ringing.
Engineers and workers on the facility, which processes oil from two major fields in the Kirkuk area of predominantly Sunni Kurdistan, had fled, fearing the military advance.
""No one wanted to risk their life and decided to evacuate as stories about the Shi'ite militia and Qassem Soleimani were spreading fast,"" said a senior Kurdish oil industry source, referring to the head of foreign operations for Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards. The source declined to be identified.
Iraqi engineers arrived to the sound of alarm bells warning about system malfunctions, prompting them to immediately shut down wells. Now, they need passwords and expertise from their Kurdish counterparts to restore oil output fully. 
The loss of control of Kirkuk oil fields is likely to starve the KRG of vital oil revenue and cause deep concern to global trading houses such as Vitol and  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), which have granted the semi-autonomous government billions of dollars in loans against future oil sales.
Baghdad's lightning military offensive into northern Iraq came after the Kurdistan Regional Government held an independence referendum last month.
Major-General Soleimani, one of the most influential military figures in the Middle East, with reach in Syria and Lebanon, issued tough warnings to Kurdish leaders ahead of the Iraqi military advance.
""We went inside the oilfield facilities after Kurdish workers fled and we found overalls and safety boots thrown on the ground,"" said an engineer from the Baghdad-run North Oil Company, who declined to be named because he was ordered not to speak publicly about the issue. 
""It seems that workers took them off and escaped very quickly."" 
RINGING ALARMS
NOC crews entered oil facilities in the Bai Hassan and Avana fields on Oct. 17 for the first time since 2014, when Peshmerga forces drove Islamic State from the area and found all crude oil stations unmanned. Peshmerga fighters had also withdrawn.
""After we discovered that some of the key equipment was missing and the control panel was ringing alarms of crude processing malfunction, we immediately shut down oil wells,"" the NOC engineer said.
A week after the operation, Iraqi engineers are still struggling to resume Kirkuk's oil production, saying they had yet to understand how to operate the equipment processing some 350,000 barrels per day.
The military offensive more than halved Kurdistan's oil output and cut its exports to global markets via Turkey by two thirds. 
The drop in exports has deprived the region of more than $200 million in revenues over the past week, a Kurdish oil industry source familiar with loadings told Reuters.
It has also dealt a further blow to the region's finances already stretched by a fight against Islamic State and a budget crisis caused by a fall in oil prices. The United States has called on both sides to resume dialogue, saying the tensions hamper efforts to fight Islamic State.
Resuming normal oil production and exports will be challenging and will take at least another week and will only succeed if Iraqi and Kurdish engineers agree to cooperate, according to both sides.
On Tuesday, NOC officials asked Kurdish engineering firm Kar Group to send back its workers, according to sources on both sides. Iraqi engineers need guidance on how to operate recently installed equipment at Bai Hassan and Avana, the sources said.
The pumping and operational stations for both oil fields are located in the city of Dahuk, which unlike Kirkuk is still under the control of the Peshmerga forces.
LIKE A LOCKED BOX
""Energy facilities in Kirkuk are more like a locked box and only their crew have the password,"" the Iraqi engineer said.
Kar Group has, however, so far refrained from going back without security guarantees, according to sources close to the engineering company.
Kirkuk, one of the oldest and best known oil areas in the Middle East, had long been under the control of Iraqi forces until it was over-run by Islamic State. In 2014, it was retaken by the Peshmerga, the official security forces of the KRG, as part of their advance on Islamic State.
That allowed Kurdistan to regain control of an area it believes is historically Kurdish and ramp up exports from the oil fields while borrowing billions of dollars from trading houses and Russian state oil major Rosneft.
""We need to figure out who gets what when the fields resume production. At the moment the potential split of revenues is far from clear,"" said the Kurdish oil industry source.
Before the referendum, Kurdistan was exporting some 600,000 bpd of crude via Turkey, which it said had made it almost totally economically independent as it could pay its own bills without the need to wait for budget transfers from Baghdad.
Under the deal with Baghdad, Kurdistan was exporting 540,000 bpd on behalf of the government in the city of Erbil and some 60,000 bpd on behalf of NOC.
With the loss of control of the Kirkuk area, Kurdistan will be in theory left with only 250,000-300,000 bpd of its own output, less than it needs to cover its debt obligations.

Vitol, Glencore, Petraco and Trafigura have loaned Kurdistan some $2.5 billion and Russia's Rosneft has loaned some $1.2 billion. Glencore's boss Ivan Glasenberg said last week he could not rule out a rescheduling of the payments.

Oil futures seesawed in a 54-cent range in New York. Daily exports of crude, diesel and other petroleum products climbed to 7.66 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Bullish aspects of the report such as falling gasoline and distillate stockpiles were tempered by the rise in oil production as well as a bump up in crude inventories.
“The exports are ripping higher,” Michael Loewen, a commodities strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto, said by telephone. “That’s very good for the market. At the end of the day, crude oil demand is only one part of the equation. If you have strong products demand, that means refineries are going to buy more crude oil to create those products. Demand looks great.”
Oil has held above $50 a barrel for the past two weeks in New York amid increasing confidence that supply cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia will be extended beyond March. OPEC is said to be working on an exit strategy in an effort to reassure investors that the group will manage a controlled release of supplies to avoid a new glut when the curbs eventually expire.
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery fell 24 cents to $52.23 a barrel at 10:56 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was about 19 percent below the 100-day average.

Brent for December settlement rose 4 cents to $58.37 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude traded at a premium of $6.16 to WTI.
Gasoline futures rose as much as 1.6 percent to $1.7429 a gallon, the highest intraday level since late September. The gasoline crack spread, a rough measure of the profit from refining crude into gasoline, jumped as much as 5.7 percent.
U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 856,000 barrels last week, the EIA said. Oil supplies at the key Cushing, Oklahoma, pipeline hub decreased for the first time since August. At the same time, gasoline supplies fell by 5.47 million barrels and distillate supplies dropped by 5.25 million barrels.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dipped 21 cents, or around 0.4%, to $52.24 a barrel by 10:40AM ET (1440GMT). Prices were at around $52.30 prior to the release of the inventory data.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., added 24 cents, or about 0.4%, to $58.57 a barrel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 856,000 barrels in the week ended October 22.
That compared with analysts' expectations for a decline of 2.6 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply-gain of 519,000 barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, declined by 237,000 barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 457.3 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be at the upper half of the average range for this time of year.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories fell by 5.5 million barrels, much more than expectations for a decline of 17,000 barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a decline of 5.2 million barrels.
Oil prices climbed on Tuesday, as Saudi Arabia reiterated a pledge to help balance the global crude market and geopolitical turmoil threatened global inventories.
They received another boost amid expectations that major global producers will extend a deal to curb production beyond its current expiry date next March.
The original deal, struck nearly a year ago between OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia, was to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
In other energy trading Wednesday, gasoline futures inched up 0.3 cents to $1.736 a gallon, heating oil added 0.9 cents to $1.831 a gallon, while natural gas futures slumped 2.2 cents to $2.952 per million British thermal units.

Natural gas futures shed 3.7 cents, or around 1.3%, to $2.938 per million British thermal units by 8:55AM ET (1255GMT), after losing 1.7 cents in the last session.
Futures finished lower on Tuesday as traders reacted to forecasts showing temperatures across the east-central U.S. would not be as cold as initially expected.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather weakens demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
Market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 62 and 72 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended October 20.
That compares with a gain of 51 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 73 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 75 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.646 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 179 bcf, or around 4.9%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 35 bcf, or roughly 1%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

1471,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 25, 2017 08:30AM ET</span>",Big Oil Set to Make Facebook-Level Cash Even With $50 Crude,"(Bloomberg) -- Crude may still be languishing near $50, but Big Oil is on track to rejoin the world’s corporate elite by squeezing more cash from each barrel.
The five biggest oil producers generated about $34 billion of cash from operations in the third quarter, according to estimates from Jefferies LLC. That puts each of them at least on a par with tech giant  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)., a welcome return to the top tier of global business after three years on the skids.
The oil majors are reaping the benefits of deep cost cuts, but they’re still not doing quite enough. The target: being able to fully fund dividends and investments at $40, or even $30 a barrel, according to  BP  (LON:BP) Plc Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley.
“It’s not peak diet yet,” said Dudley, who sees potential for even more stringent cost and spending discipline. “Our industry is going through a great, massive change in the cost structure.”
 Total  SA (PA:TOTF),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) are scheduled to announce results on Oct. 27, BP on Oct. 31 and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc two days later. Here are five things to look out for in third-quarter earnings.
Cash Is King
Cash is king for the oil majors as they negotiate crude's biggest downturn in a generation. It’s one of the most important metrics for investors as they gauge companies’ ability to keep paying dividends without having to borrow.
Four of the five big oil companies are forecast by Jefferies to boost cash compared with the preceding quarter.
Reaping The Dividend
Oil majors have deferred projects, renegotiated contracts and laid off thousands of employees in an attempt to cut costs and generate income in a low crude-price environment. That’s helped lower the price at which they can cover their dividend payout and capital expenditure.
BP, Shell and Total continue to give a portion of shareholder payouts in shares and are still unable to cover the entire dividend. In the third quarter, BP reduced the price at which it would cover the dividend and spending to $54 a barrel and Shell to $55. Brent crude averaged $52.17 in that period and traded near $58 on Wednesday.
Living With $50
Big Oil has demonstrated this year that it can live with oil at $50. Analysts expect that trajectory to continue in the third quarter as oil prices rose and cost cuts continued.
“We expect the tone of the earnings calls to be broadly positive,” said Jason Gammel, a London-based analyst at Jefferies. 
Spending Spree Over
Expenditure is another key metric for investors, after companies promised to rein in the lavish spending that came with $100 oil. At the same time, the market still wants to see if producers are plowing enough money back into projects to ensure future growth.
Spending by the five biggest companies combined is likely to drop for a fourth consecutive year in 2017, according to estimates by UBS Group AG. It could rebound next year, but may only reach 2016 levels by the end of the decade, the bank said.
Laggards Reveal Doubts
Concern about growth is showing in oil industry shares, which have lagged behind the wider market and crude this year. Though the sector outperformed in September, it’s behind again in October as investors doubt the sustainability of the rally in oil prices.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report at 10:30AM ET (1430GMT).
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories rose by 519,000 barrels in the week ended October 22. That compared with analysts' expectations for a decline of 2.5 million barrels.
However, the API report also showed a sharp drop of 5.8 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks fell by 4.9 million barrels.
There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures was down 8 cents, or around 0.2%, at $52.39 a barrel by 3:25AM ET (0725GMT), after gaining 57 cents, or 1.1%, a day earlier.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., was up 16 cents, or 0.3%, to $58.49 a barrel, after settling up 96 cents, or 1.7%, in the last session.
Oil prices climbed on Tuesday, as Saudi Arabia reiterated a pledge to help balance the global crude market and geopolitical turmoil threatened global inventories.
They received another boost amid expectations that major global producers will extend a deal to curb production beyond its current expiry date next March.
The original deal, struck nearly a year ago between OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia, was to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
In other energy trading Wednesday, gasoline futures dipped 0.4 cents to $1.727 a gallon, heating oil added 0.9 cents to $1.831 a gallon, while natural gas futures rose 1.0 cent at $2.984 per million British thermal units.

U.S. President Donald Trump used a luncheon with Senate Republicans on Tuesday to get their views on who he should tap to be the next head of the central bank, according to senators who attended.
A source familiar with the matter said Trump polled the Republicans on whether they would prefer Stanford University economist John Taylor or current Fed Governor Jerome Powell for the job, and more senators preferred Taylor.
Taylor is seen as someone who may put the Fed on a path of faster interest rate increases compared to current Fed chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires next February.
In an interview aired in recent days, President Donald Trump said he is ""very, very close"" to making his decision.
That helped send U.S. 10-Year Treasury note yields to their highest since March, supporting the dollar and dampening the appeal of bullion.
Comex gold futures lost $3.60, or around 0.3%, to $1,274.35 a troy ounce by 2:55AM ET (0655GMT) after touching its worst level since Oct. 6 at $1,272.60 earlier in the session.

Meanwhile, copper futures dropped 3.5 cents, or 1.1%, to $3.163 a pound. It hit its best level since Aug. 2014 at $3.239 in the last session, boosted by expectations of strong economic growth in China, the world's top user of the red metal.

Natural gas futures shed 1.7 cents, or around 0.6%, to $2.974 per million British thermal units by 8:55AM ET (1255GMT).
Futures rose 2.6% on Monday to notch their second-straight winning session.
Cooler temperatures will return during the second half of this week across the east-central U.S. through the weekend after trending warmer last week.
Looking further ahead, weather systems with cooler than normal temperatures will linger across the northern and eastern U.S. through the first week of November.
Bullish speculators are betting that the cold weather will increase early-winter demand for the heating fuel. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 62 and 72 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended October 20.
That compares with a gain of 51 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 73 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 75 bcf.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's imports of iron ore and lead concentrate from North Korea plunged to their lowest in more than six years, while coal arrivals fell sharply after the United Nations' latest sanctions against the isolated nation, data showed on Tuesday.
Lead ore and concentrate arrivals totaled just 1,321 tonnes, worth $1.18 million, down 84 percent from a year earlier and the lowest on Reuters records dating back to January 2010, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. 
Iron ore shipments plunged 98 percent to 3,035 tonnes, worth about $55,000, the lowest monthly volume on Reuters records from January 2011. 
China imported 511,619 tonnes of coal, worth about $44 million, from North Korea, down 71.6 percent from a year earlier. 
The data represents the final shipments allowed through customs before the U.N. penalties came into force on Sept. 5, banning Pyongyang from selling coal, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood abroad.
Numbers released last week showed trade between the world's second-largest economy and its northern neighbor totaled $412 million, the weakest since April.
The U.N. Security council unanimously imposed new sanctions on North Korea. The sanctions took effect this month, but China enforced the new measures from Aug. 15, amid growing pressure from the United States to rein in Pyongyang's missile program. 
Gasoline and diesel shipments remained slow after China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) suspended sales of gasoline and diesel at the end of June to North Korea over concerns CNPC would not get paid for its goods. The measures are still in place, sources familiar with the matter say.

Gasoline exports were the lowest since January 2016, and diesel sales were the smallest since May.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Russia held on to its position as China's top crude oil supplier ahead of Angola and Saudi Arabia for the seventh straight month in September, with shipments hitting a record as refiners rushed to buy lower-sulfur oil to meet cleaner fuels standards.
Imports from Russia last month were almost 6.35 million tonnes, or 1.545 million barrels per day, up 60.5 percent from the same month last year, according to a detailed breakdown of commodity trade data released by the General Administration of Customs. 
For the first three quarters, crude volumes from Russia gained 18 percent year-on-year to nearly 45 million tonnes, or 1.2 million bpd, also holding firm its top ranking. 
The lower cost of Russian crude and China's shift to cleaner diesel was the key driver behind the record Russian oil purchases.
""Many teapot refineries are not equipped with hydrotreating units to cut down sulfur. That means they need to import crude with lower sulfur content to meet the cleaner diesel quality,"" said Harry Liu of consultancy IHS Markit.
The widening spread between Brent-linked crudes and Middle Eastern benchmark Dubai also made Russia's ESPO grade, priced off Dubai, relatively attractive, Liu added. 
Meanwhile Angola, China's second largest source of crude, supplied 11.7 percent more oil than a year earlier at 4.677 million tonnes, or 1.14 million bpd. Angola also maintained the second spot for the January-September supplies ahead of Saudi. 
Supplies from Saudi Arabia were up 9.6 percent last month year-on-year at 4.276 million tonnes, or about 1.04 million barrels per day (bpd).
Shipments for the January-September period dipped 0.6 percent on year at 38.52 million tonnes, or 1.03 million bpd.
Russian supplies could climb further next year as privately run conglomerate CEFC China Energy agreed earlier this month to buy 220,000 to 260,000 bpd of oil from Rosneft, as part of a $9.1 billion investment in the world's largest listed oil company.
Shipments from Iran were up 59 percent last month from a year earlier to 3.22 million tonnes, or 784,060 bpd. Traders with knowledge of Iran's oil sales said the hefty growth was spurred by resumption of condensate lifting and as Chinese firms lifted more oil from joint venture productions in Iran. 
U.S. supplies last month were 120,580 bpd, up 260 percent on year, and for the January-September totaled 4.755 million tonnes (127,150 bpd), after the country started exports to China last year.
China's total crude oil imports in September climbed to the second highest on record at around 9 million bpd, buoyed by purchases from CNOOC and as independent refineries returned from maintenances.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices inched up on Tuesday, getting support from a decline in oil exports from OPEC's second-biggest producer Iraq and a projected extended fall in U.S. commercial oil stocks. 
London Brent crude for December delivery was up 10 cents at $57.47 a barrel by 0651 GMT after settling down 38 cents on Monday.
U.S. crude for December delivery was up 6 cents at $51.96.
Iraqi oil exports have fallen more than 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) so far this month, as shipments from both the north and the south of the country declined.
""The market is currently weighing supportive materials more, such as the Kurdistan situation, the slowdown in shale-related (U.S.) rig counts and the possible extension in OPEC (output) cuts,"" said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting in Tokyo.
Crude oil exports through the Iraqi Kurdistan controlled-pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan rose 13 percent to 288,000 barrels per day (bpd) on Monday afternoon, but that was still less than half normal levels due to tensions in the region, a shipping source told Reuters.
Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Saturday southern exports were increasing by 200,000 bpd to make up for the northern shortfall.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan region on Monday to resolve their conflict over Kurdish self-determination and disputed territories through dialogue.
The drop in supplies from Iraq comes as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers are cutting output by about 1.8 million bpd until March 2018 in an effort to drain a glut and support prices. 
In September OPEC and non-OPEC countries achieved the highest compliance on planned cuts since the deal kicked off in January - at a rate of 120 percent - helping reduce oil stocks further at Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development nations, OPEC said.
Russia held on to its position as China's top crude oil supplier, ahead of Saudi Arabia, for the seventh month in September, with shipments hitting a record 1.545 million bpd, customs data showed on Tuesday.
Meanwhile U.S. crude inventories likely fell by 2.5 million barrels last week, while gasoline and distillate stockpiles also fell, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday ahead of data by the American Petroleum Institute later on Tuesday.

President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday he is ""very, very close"" to deciding who should chair the Federal Reserve after interviewing five candidates for the position.
These include current Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February, as well as Fed Governor Jerome Powell, Stanford University economist John Taylor, Trump's chief economic advisor Gary Cohn, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.
The U.S. dollar index held near a two-week high against the other major currencies, while bond yields remained supported near their recent peaks, dampening the appeal of bullion.
Comex gold futures tacked on $2.30, or around 0.2%, to $1,283.26 a troy ounce by 2:35AM ET (0635GMT) after touching its worst level since Oct. 6 at $1,273.60 in the last session.
The yellow metal recovered from an early decline to eke out a small gain on Monday as stocks lost some steam after a run to another round of all-time highs.
Interest rate futures are pricing in around a 90% chance of a December Fed rate hike according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. The U.S. central bank has already raised rates twice this year.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures inched up 6.5 cents, or 0.4%, to $17.14 a troy ounce. Among other precious metals, platinum added 0.2% to $929.25, while palladium rose 0.8% to $960.65 an ounce.
Meanwhile, copper futures rallied 3.7 cents, or 1.2%, to $3.221 a pound. It hit its best level since Aug. 2014 at $3.239 earlier, boosted by expectations of strong economic growth in China, the world's top user of the red metal.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Southeast Asian demand for oil will keep growing until at least 2040 as emerging nations there rely on the fossil fuel to transport their rapidly growing populations, ship goods and make plastics, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday.
Oil usage in the region will expand to around 6.6 million barrels per day by 2040 from 4.7 million bpd now, with the number of road vehicles increasing by two-thirds to around 62 million, the agency said in a report. It did not make any forecasts beyond 2040.
A global push to replace combustion engines in vehicles with electric-powered ones to fight climate change has raised concerns in the oil industry that demand for the commodity could peak in the next 10-20 years.
But oil will continue to meet around 90 percent of transport-related demand in Southeast Asia, especially for trucks and ships, Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA's director of energy markets and security, said at the Singapore International Energy Week.
""Unless there are any drastic technological changes that can decarbonize these areas, we do not expect oil demand to fall,"" he said.
Oil demand from the petrochemicals sector, one of the largest users of the fossil fuel, will also grow fairly substantially, Sadamori said. Oil can be used as a raw material for plastics and textiles.
The IEA expects electricity to account for only 1 percent of transport energy demand in 2040, saying there will be only about 4 million electric cars in a total passenger vehicle stock of 62 million.
Meanwhile, Southeast Asia's overall energy demand is expected to climb nearly 60 percent by 2040 from now, led by power generation, as rising incomes in the region spur more people to buy electric appliances including air conditioners, the IEA said.
The region will have universal access to electricity in the early 2030s and is expected to install more than 565 gigawatts (GW) of power-generation capacity in 2040, from 240 GW today, the agency said. Coal and renewables account for almost 70 percent of new output, it added.
Coal alone will account for almost 40 percent of the growth while renewables will quadruple by 2040 to become the second largest source of electricity after coal, overtaking gas, IEA forecasts showed. 
Southeast Asia will become a key driver for energy demand globally as its economy triples in size and its total population grows by a fifth, the IEA said. But the region's net energy import bill is also climbing as oil production declines, raising concerns over energy security.
Southeast Asia will have to fork out more than $300 billion in 2040 for net energy imports, equivalent to about 4 percent of the region's total gross domestic product, the IEA said.

""Apart from the mounting import bill, the region's increasing dependence on imported energy raises significant energy security concerns,"" the agency said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's biggest state-run aluminum producer said consumption of the metal is set to increase by 9-10 percent this year on the back of strong downstream demand, and keep growing at a faster rate than the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018.
Ge Honglin, chairman of Aluminum Corp of China, known as Chinalco, told Reuters in an emailed answers to questions that consumption was expected to come in at 26.25 million tonnes in the first three quarters of 2017, up 9 percent year on the year, with peak end-year demand yet to come.
The executive, a delegate at China's 19th Communist Party congress, said Chinalco expects national aluminum consumption growth ""will continue to be higher than GDP in 2018, and the huge consumer demand will remain the ballast for the healthy development of the global aluminum industry"".
China, which is targeting GDP growth of around 6.5 percent this year, has not yet set a 2018 goal. The International Monetary Fund sees China's GDP climbing by 6.5 percent in 2018.
Some of Chinalco's rivals, such as China Hongqiao Group, are facing restrictions on smelting this winter for environmental reasons.
But asked how his company would be affected, Ge mentioned only cutbacks in Shandong and Henan processing of alumina, a substance used to produce aluminum.
Rising prices of alumina, carbon and power have pushed up primary aluminum production costs by 14 percent this year, Ge said. 
Aluminum demand from China's packaging sector was up by 20 percent in January-September, according to Ge, while demand from real estate, transportation and electronic products grew by 8 percent and the power sector by 5 percent, he said.
Asked about Chinalco's proposed purchase of another 46.6 percent stake in its Simandou iron ore project in Guinea from  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) - a deal that has still not closed despite being agreed a year ago - Ge said only that his company's projects in the country were ""progressing smoothly"".
Chinalco's listed arm, known as Chalco, in September agreed to invest $500 million in a project to process bauxite, used to produce aluminum, in Guinea.
Trading in Chalco's Shanghai-listed shares has been suspended since Sept. 12 pending an event that a filing to the bourse stated may constitute a material asset restructuring. Ge said further announcements would be made in due course.

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2017 09:30PM ET</span>","Plan to support coal, nuclear divides U.S. energy industry","By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industries that rarely agree - gas drillers and renewable energy producers - urged a federal agency on Monday to dump a government directive to prop up ageing nuclear and coal plants, saying the electricity grid was already reliable.
The split in the energy industry showed that a Trump administration push to make the country energy ""dominant"" by boosting output from every part of the sector may face hurdles.
A group of 20 organizations including the Independent Petroleum Association of America and the Solar Energy Industries Association submitted comments to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as it considered a regulation proposed late last month by U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.
Perry's directive would reward certain nuclear and coal fired power plants that store 90 days of fuel on site for contributing to the reliability of the power grid. He wants the FERC to pass the rule before the winter season starts.
The groups said Perry's request ""fails to provide substantial evidence"" for its claim that competitive markets do not already value fuel security.
The proposed rule would ""prop up uneconomic generation that is unable to compete … and that is not otherwise needed for reliability,"" the groups said.
The FERC rejected a request to extend the comment period on the directive that ended on Monday. But its three commissioners have hinted that they may not pass the rule, or that it could be changed, because they do not want to damage competitive markets. The FERC panel is supposed to be five members strong, but the U.S. Senate has not yet voted on two other FERC nominees.
Coal and nuclear interests insisted that many plants need the support in order to survive. Coal producer Murray Energy said in comments to FERC that it and other coal producers and related industries are ""threatened with bankruptcy and significant economic harm"" if plants and other operations are forced to shut by ""unreasonable and unsupportable market pricing mechanisms.""
Robert Murray, the head of the company, has urged the Trump administration to kill many environmental rules that affect coal producers and he stood by the president's side earlier in the year as he signed a law repealing limits on the dumping of coal waste into streams.
Maria Korsnick, head of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group, said that the failure of power markets to value nuclear power's contribution of reliable power to the grid has led to early retirements of many nuclear reactors, which generate electricity almost free of emissions linked to climate change.

1495,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2017 09:03PM ET</span>","U.S. sets antidumping duties on Argentine, Indonesian biodiesel","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday set preliminary antidumping duties on imports of biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia, after an initial finding that the products used as motor fuel were being sold at prices below market value in the United States. 
The antidumping duties set range from 54.36 percent to 70.05 percent on soy-based biodiesel from Argentina, and 50.71 percent on palm oil biodiesel from Indonesia, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in the statement that the government of Argentina has asked for negotiations and that the department is working on possible suspension agreements.
Argentina's Foreign Ministry said the new duties would have little impact because preliminary countervailing duties of as much as 64.17 percent that had been applied in August already made ""access to the U.S. market impossible.""
""A possible application of additional duties has no practical effect in terms of real market access,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to Reuters. 
The statement said the Argentine government was working toward an agreement to suspend both the antidumping and the subsidies investigations.
The administration of President Donald Trump has made enforcement of trade laws a top priority. From Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, through Oct. 23, the Commerce Department says it initiated 73 antidumping and countervailing duty investigations, up 52 percent from the previous year. 
U.S. producers of biodiesel petitioned the government earlier this year, saying foreign imports came into the United States below market value, harming domestic makers.
The National Biodiesel Board, a trade group representing producers such as Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM), praised the latest action, saying it had joined the petition to ""address a flood of subsidized and dumped imports from Argentina and Indonesia that has resulted in market share losses and depressed prices for domestic producers.""
“It is reassuring with each decision that the Commerce Department is reviewing the data and facts at face value,"" said Doug Whitehead, chief operating officer of the National Biodiesel Board.
Carbio, the Argentine biodiesel industry group that represents producers including Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) and Louis Dreyfus Co [LOUDR.UL], declined to comment on the antidumping decision. In August, it denied there were subsidies on the country's biodiesel exports and called the duties protectionist. 
Argentina's government is negotiating a minimum price for its biodiesel that it hopes could replace punitive tariffs, Horacio Reyser, secretary of international economic relations at the Foreign Ministry, told Reuters last month.
In 2016, imports of biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia were valued at an estimated $1.2 billion and $268 million, respectively, according to the Commerce Department.
Argentina in 2016 accounted for two-thirds of U.S. biodiesel imports, totaling 916 million gallons (3.5 billion liters), according to U.S. government data.
Commerce Department head Ross said he was hopeful that the solutions could be found.
“We are thankful to the government of Argentina for their proactive approach to solving this issue, and remain optimistic that a negotiated solution can be reached both with Argentina and with Indonesia,” Ross said in his statement.
The department is scheduled to make its final antidumping decision around Jan. 3.

The duties need to be upheld by a finding by the U.S. International Trade Commission that the imports harm U.S. producers. Such a finding would lock the duties in place for five years.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela this month allowed a $1.7 billion gold swap with Germany's  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) to lapse, according to an opposition legislator who said it weakens the balance sheet of the crisis-stricken OPEC nation's central bank.
Through the operation, Venezuela had received $1.2 billion in cash in exchange for putting up $1.7 billion worth of gold in guarantee, part of efforts to improve the liquidity of foreign reserves amid heavy foreign debt payments and low oil prices.
Legislator Angel Alvarado said the contract's expiration weakens international reserves, which are hovering near 21-year lows as the country's socialist economic model collapses under low oil prices.
""Venezuela decided to allow this contract to lapse,"" said Alvarado in a telephone interview on Monday. ""We think the government could have negotiated better.""
The central bank will receive another $500 million in cash to reflect the difference between the amount of the loan and the value of the guarantee, said Alvarado, who obtained the information from finance industry sources.
Venezuela had to pay $1.2 billion by the middle of October to recover the gold, he said.
Alvarado added that Deutsche officials informally contacted the opposition-run legislature several months ago to ask about the legal implications of rolling over the swap.
The legislature told Deutsche to put that request in writing, but it never did, Alvarado said.
Deutsche declined to comment. Venezuela's central bank did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
The government of President Nicolas Maduro has used swaps in recent years as a way of boosting the liquidity of international reserves, nearly 75 percent of which were held in monetary gold in August.
Venezuela and state oil company PDVSA must pay nearly $3.5 billion in debt service in October and November, including maturity payments of $2 billion.
Bonds issued by Venezuela and PDVSA were down across the board on Monday, with some falling as much as 2.5 points.
Traders attributed the decline to increased nervousness over delayed coupon payments.
The heavy payment schedule has left the government with limited hard currency for imports of basic items such as food and medicine, spurring product shortages and leaving millions struggling to eat.
Maduro says the government is victim of an ""economic war"" led by political adversaries and fueled by several rounds of economic sanctions by Washington.

Cooler temperatures will return during the second half of this week across the east-central U.S. through the weekend after trending warmer last week.
Looking further ahead, weather systems with cooler than normal temperatures will linger across the northern and eastern U.S. through the first week of November.
Bullish speculators are betting that the cold weather will increase early-winter demand for the heating fuel.
U.S. natural gas futures jumped 8.3 cents, or around 2.9%, to $2.998 per million British thermal units by 8:50AM ET (1250GMT).
Futures lost about 2.8% last week as a bearish weather outlook led to a dip in heating demand.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather weakens demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 62 and 72 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended October 20.
That compares with a gain of 51 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 73 bcf a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 75 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.646 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 179 bcf, or around 4.9%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 35 bcf, or roughly 1%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude December contract gained 28 cents, or 0.54%, to $52.12 a barrel by 7:36AM ET (11:36GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for December delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rose 7 cents, or 0.12%, to $57.82 a barrel.
Political tensions in the Kurdistan region continued to disrupt crude supplies with oil exports from Iraq's Kurdistan towards the Turkish port of Ceyhan reportedly flowing at average rates of between 200,000 and 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) versus the usual flows of 600,000 bpd.
The supply disruption in Iraq comes amid ongoing political uncertainty in the region following conflict between Iraqi and Kurdish forces. Iraqi troops marched toward Northern Iraq earlier in week and regained control of two major oilfields from Kurdish forces.
Meanwhile, in the U.S., investors mulled over data showing oil drilling activity fell for a third week in a row, extending a two-month drilling decline.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said late Friday that its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell by seven to 736, the lowest level since June.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for domestic oil production.
In a speech last Thursday, Mohammad Barkindo, secretary-general at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said that the oil market is balancing at an “accelerated pace,” and demand will continue to rapidly grow in coming decades.
The original deal, struck nearly a year ago between OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia, was to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Analysts have warned that OPEC needs to extend its agreement to reduce oil output beyond its current March 2018 expiry date in order to rebalance the market.
The cartel's next meeting is set for November 30 in Vienna.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said in Moscow earlier this month that November was too early to make a decision, but, at the same time, added that he doesn't rule out an extension to the end of 2018.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. refineries from Ohio to Minnesota are capitalizing on access to cheap crude from Western Canada and North Dakota oilfields, helping their region break a historic dependence on fuel from the Gulf Coast while redrawing oil trade maps.
Since the early 2000s, crude and fuel flows from the Gulf Coast into the U.S. heartland have been cut in half, as crude coming from Canada and North Dakota has pushed U.S. Midwest refining activity to record levels. In 2016, Midwest refining capacity rose to 3.9 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, the highest annual volume on record. 
Midwest refiners such as Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC), Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX),  BP  (LON:BP) PLC and Husky Energy have invested billions of dollars on new units capable of turning sludgy crude from Canada into gasoline and diesel. Investments in the Dakota Access Pipeline and other avenues have helped bring in shale oil from North Dakota.
""Ten years ago, we were 1 million barrels per day short on products, with the Gulf Coast supplying the product. Today, the midcontinent is flush with products,"" Marathon Petroleum Chief Executive Gary Heminger said in a recent Reuters interview at the company’s Findlay, Ohio, headquarters.
Yet analysts warned that weakening U.S. gasoline demand will make it challenging for Midwest refiners to sell their growing output. The Midwest is land-locked, making it hard to get products to new markets, especially as rival refiners defend their turf. Philadelphia area refiners are currently fighting efforts to reverse a pipeline so Midwest companies can move fuel to western Pennsylvania.
(Graphic: Midwest Breaks Free of Gulf, Looks North Instead: http://tmsnrt.rs/2jZ07Pt)
CHANGING FLOWS 
For years, Gulf refiners with access to cheaper crudes could underprice their Midwest rivals in Chicago, Indianapolis and other cities in the region. Traders made easy money sending gasoline north in the summer. Now, Midwest plants can compete more effectively thanks to booming production in western Canada and North Dakota of crude that routinely sells at a discount against the U.S. benchmark price. 
""The Midwest is well positioned to supply its region and parts of southern Canada, and will even have excess supplies to send to the East Coast. It’s in a good spot,"" said Mark Routt, chief economist at KBC Advanced Technologies. 
At the turn of the century, the Midwest received 3.4 million bpd of crude and refined products from the Gulf. In 2016, that figure was halved. Chicago gasoline peaked at a premium of 14 cents a gallon versus the future contract this summer, much less than the summer premiums of nearly 40 cents in 2014 and 2015. 
""The trade was as slow as I've ever seen it,"" said one scheduler who sends barrels along the line. 
Hurricane Harvey knocked out half of the Gulf's capacity, while Midwest refiners processed a record 4.06 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in late August and early September, 12 percent more than the 2016 average. 
The Rockies, which includes Bakken oil fields, sent 550,000 bpd to the Midwest last year. That is triple the volumes seen in 2010 before Dakota Access opened. Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum are minority partners in the line, which opened in 2017 and can pump as much as 525,000 bpd.
Canada has sent an average of 2.1 million bpd of crude through June of this year, more than triple the rate from two decades ago, according to EIA data.
SPENDING ON UPGRADES
Midwest refiners invested billions of dollars to handle the heavier Canadian crude. For instance, Marathon and BP spent over $6 billion to install new coking units to handle the heaviest parts of the Canadian oil.
Marathon's 144,000 bpd Detroit refinery nearly tripled its usage of Canadian crude last year, hitting a record high of 137,400 bpd, EIA data showed. BP's 430,000 bpd Whiting, Indiana, refinery can now process up to 85 percent heavy crude, up from 20 percent before the upgrades.
But analysts predict that ebbing U.S. gasoline demand will eventually force Midwestern refiners to find other markets, including exports. To facilitate this, some pipelines that used to carry product to the Midwest have already been reversed. But Philadelphia-area refiners are pressuring state regulators to reject reversal of a pipeline that would bring Midwest fuel to the Pittsburgh area.
The owners of the 1.2 million bpd Capline Pipeline, the nation's largest crude pipeline by volume, will soon gauge shipper interest in reversing that line, which currently runs from Louisiana to Illinois. The line is owned by Marathon, BP and Plains All American, and the group said reversal would not come until 2022.
Shippers abandoned the line in recent years due to the waning financial incentive to move barrels north. But BP, which has an ownership interest in the pipeline, has slowed the reversal over concerns that it could erode the discount on Canadian oil enjoyed by its Whiting refinery. BP did not respond to questions about that pipeline.
Analysts expect regional market-share battles to intensify. The Midwest will go from being short roughly 500,000 bpd of gasoline this year to a surplus of roughly 200,000 bpd by 2030, according to Wood Mackenzie refinery analyst Andrew Shepard. 
A gasoline supply glut would pressure prices and weaken profit margins for refiners, Shepard said. Eventually, Midwest refiners will have to close plants if they cannot access new markets.

""The Midwest must gain increased access to the East Coast market,"" Shepard said.

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2017 03:20AM ET</span>","Noble Group to sell oil liquids unit to Vitol, flags $1.2 billion loss","By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Struggling commodities trader Noble Group agreed to sell its Americas-focused oil trading business to Vitol for about $580 million as part of a debt-cutting strategy, and warned of a big loss for its third quarter.
Monday's move came after Reuters reported late on Friday that Vitol, the world's largest oil trader, was nearing a deal to buy Singapore-listed Noble's oil liquids unit.
Noble, whose founder Richard Elman took advantage of a commodities bull run to build it into one of the world's biggest traders after starting it in 1986, is shrinking to an Asian-centric company focused on its core coal trading, LNG and freight businesses.
It is slashing jobs and selling assets to reduce debt and win support from lenders after a crisis-wracked two years. In July it agreed to sell its smaller gas and power business to Mercuria.
""I guess the question is when are they going to basically turn around their business, which is quite key. If they can actually provide more details, what sort of assets they can still sell, that would be great,"" said Annisa Lee, Nomura's head of Asia ex-Japan's flow credit analysis.
Hong Kong-based Noble was plunged into crisis in February 2015 when Iceberg Research questioned its accounts, and then the company was hit by a commodities downturn.
While Noble has stood by its accounts, the upheaval triggered a share price collapse, credit downgrades, a series of writedowns, as well as fund raising and management changes. Noble's market value has plummeted to less than $400 million from $6 billion in February 2015.
Noble said gross proceeds from the sale of its oil liquids business would be $1.4 billion, and after deducting debt of about $836 million, cash proceeds would be about $580 million.
""It gives the company some positive momentum going into a liability management exercise and it likely raises recovery realizations under a restructuring scenario modestly,"" said Todd Schubert, fixed income analyst at Bank of Singapore.
In July, Noble announced an up-to-$1 billion disposal plan for assets outside North America over the next two years as Chairman Paul Brough, a restructuring specialist appointed in May, sought to tackle Noble's more than $3 billion of debt.
""Conservative liquidity management and constraints placed on the group's access to trade finance lines led to disruption costs and prevented the group from taking advantage of profitable trading opportunities,"" the company said on Monday.
Its stock fell 10 percent on Monday, extending losses to 80 percent this year.
In a one-line statement, Vitol U.S. Holding Co. confirmed it had agreed to acquire Noble Americas Corp subject to certain conditions precedent and referred to Noble's statement on the deal.
Noble bonds due 2020 were higher by two points at 39/41 cents on the dollar. As recently as April, the 2020s were trading around 97 cents on the dollar.
BILLION DOLLAR LOSS
Noble warned of a total net loss of $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion in the three months ending September, citing non-cash losses and underlying trading results. This follows a $1.75 billion net loss reported in April-June.
Noble has been locked in negotiations with its core lenders to support a $2 billion credit facility, secured on its inventories and working capital.
""Whilst no assurance can be given as to the outcome of these discussions, the group believes that these are open and constructive, and are moving forward,"" it said.
In August, ratings agencies S&P and Moody's cut their credit ratings on Noble, citing high default risks.
Noble is a big player in the global physical oil market, trading crude and refined products. But its operations shrank this year due to higher prices and liquidity constraints. The company has blending and wholesale capabilities in North America and the Caribbean, alongside long-term storage leases globally.

A purchase of Noble's oil liquids business will reinforce Vitol's position as a leading oil trader.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday over supply concerns in the Middle East and as the U.S. market showed further signs of tightening while demand in Asia keeps rising.
Brent crude futures were at $57.87 at 0622 GMT, up 12 cents, or 0.21 percent, from their last close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was at $52.04 per barrel, up 20 cents, or 0.39 percent.
""Oil prices are holding comfortably above $50 as possible supply disruptions in the Kurdish region of Iraq support prices,"" said William O'Loughlin, analyst at Rivkin Securities.
""U.S. production was also recently impacted by a hurricane for the second time in as many months and the number of U.S. drilling rigs declined for the third week in a row,"" O'Loughlin said.
The amount of U.S. oil rigs drilling for new production fell by seven to 736 in the week to Oct. 20, the lowest level since June, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.
With the U.S. tightening, flows from Iraq reduced due to fighting between government forces and Kurdish groups, and production still being withheld as part of a pact between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers to tighten the market, much will depend on demand going forward.
In Asia, growth remains strong especially in China and India, the world's number one and three importers.
China's oil demand remains voracious, hitting a January to September average of 8.5 million barrels per day (bpd).
""Three main factors are driving China's insatiable appetite for crude: declining domestic production, increased access to imports and exports for independent refiners, and building up the strategic petroleum reserve,"" Britain's  Barclays  (LON:BARC) bank said.
India's fuel thirst is also increasing. India imported a record 4.83 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil in September as several refiners resumed operations after extensive maintenance to meet rising local fuel demand.
The country's September imports stood 4.2 percent above this time last year and about 19 percent more than in August, ship-tracking data from industry sources and Thomson Reuters Analytics showed.
Given the tightening oil market conditions, many analysts expect prices to rise further.
""We will see oil prices higher by 10 percent by the end of the year. We have started to accumulate strong positions within the oil sector,"" said Shane Chanel, equities and derivatives adviser at ASR Wealth Advisers.
Despite the tightening market and recent price rises, market volatility has been low.
The crude oil volatility index, which measures market expectations for 30-day price volatility, fell to levels similar of 2014 last Friday.

Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.24% to $1,277.39 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Overnight, gold prices fell on Friday, pressured lower by the stronger U.S. dollar which was boosted after President Donald Trump's plans to overhaul the tax code cleared a critical hurdle.
The dollar rose on Friday, making gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, after Senate Republicans approved a budget measure that will allow them to pursue tax cuts without support from the Democratic Party.
The index ended the week up 0.69%, its fifth weekly increase in six weeks. Investors expect a fiscal boost to push up inflation, adding pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, known as the ""Trumpflation"" trade.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
But Republicans have yet to produce a tax reform bill amid divisions over what cuts to make and how to pay for them and analysts have warned that the White House still faces a long battle to push through its agenda.
Elsewhere in precious metals trading, silver was down 1.21% at $17.04 a troy ounce late Friday, bringing its weekly decline to 2.22%, while platinum settled at $926.00.
Among base metals, copper pared early gains and closed at $3.169 a pound. The industrial metal was still up 1.03% for the week after Monday’s rally to three-year highs on the back of upbeat Chinese economic data.
The country accounts for almost half the world’s copper consumption.
In the week ahead, investors will be watching the European Central Bank meeting for further details on plans to scale back its massive stimulus program.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 0.42% to $52.06 a barrel. Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., gained 0.28% to $57.91 a barrel.
Last week, oil prices settled higher in see-saw trade on Friday, as political tensions in the Kurdistan region continued to disrupt crude supplies.
Oil exports from Iraq's Kurdistan towards the Turkish port of Ceyhan were flowing at average rates of 216,000 barrels per day versus the usual flows of 600,000 bpd, a shipping source said.
The supply disruption in Iraq comes amid ongoing political uncertainty in the region following conflict between Iraqi and Kurdish forces. Iraqi troops marched toward Northern Iraq earlier in week and regained control of two major oilfields from Kurdish forces.
Meanwhile, in the U.S., investors mulled over data showing oil drilling activity fell for a third week in a row, extending a two-month drilling decline.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said Friday that its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the United States fell by seven to 736, the lowest level since June.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for domestic oil production.
In a speech Thursday, Mohammad Barkindo, secretary-general at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said that the oil market is balancing at an “accelerated pace,” and demand will continue to rapidly grow in coming decades.
Despite the bullish signals, analysts warned that OPEC needs to extend its agreement to reduce oil output beyond its current March 2018 expiry date in order to rebalance the market.
The original deal, struck nearly a year ago between OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia, was to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
The cartel's next meeting is set for November 30 in Vienna.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.

1509,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2017 08:50PM ET</span>","No future(s): Asian financial coal trading dries up as Noble declines, Glencore rules","By Henning Gloystein and Vera Eckert
SINGAPORE/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Financial trading of thermal coal has virtually ceased in Asia as a result of the woes at one major trading house and the growing dominance of another, despite the region being by far the world's biggest consumer of the fuel.
Asia gobbles up some 70 percent of all coal used for power generation, and the unprecedented demise of its futures market poses significant risks for utilities in particular.
With coal prices rising sharply this year, power generators would usually hedge or protect themselves by taking positions in related derivatives markets.
""With Asia's futures pretty much gone, that greatly increases our risk for supplies in that region. It may mean that we source less from there going forward,"" said a risk manager with a big European utility, declining to be named as he was not authorized to speak publicly about company risk. 
Data from several exchanges shows that since its heyday in 2015, Asia coal futures trading activity has declined by over 90 percent.
Two senior coal brokers and six senior traders at merchant houses, utilities and miners spoken to by Reuters pointed to the shrinking role of Singapore-listed commodity merchant Noble Group (SI:NOBG) as the single most important factor in the decline of Asian coal futures volumes.
Noble has sold-off assets and slashed trading operations following allegations from Iceberg Research in 2015 that it had overstated its assets by billions of dollars, sending its share price tumbling.
""Noble is a massive loss to the market. Its troubles seriously dented liquidity,"" one merchant trader said.
Noble declined to comment for this article, but said in a letter to Singapore Exchange in May ""very thin trading liquidity"" in hedging instruments had contributed to its first quarter losses. 
GLENCORE DOMINANCE
Many traders also see a link between declining Asian coal futures and the growing dominance of a single company in supplying physical Asian coal.
Swiss-based, London-listed  Glencore  (L:GLEN) is the world's biggest producer of thermal coal, exporting well over 50 million tonnes from Australia alone in 2016, a quarter of the country's shipments. Physical Newcastle coal prices, which act as Asia's key futures benchmark, have jumped from around $70 to over $100 per tonne this year.
Glencore, which owns a dozen thermal coal mines in Australia, declined to comment. But market participants say the firm is not as active in coal futures trading as many of its peers, instead preferring bilateral supply deals with customers.
""Doubts over deliberate intervention on the supply side for Australian coal linger, which kills any enthusiasm to trade the (financial) product,"" said Georgi Slavov, head of research at commodity brokerage Marex Spectron.
Glencore's control and knowledge of actual coal output in Australia and the influence this has on derivatives contracts means it is difficult for outsiders to predict price movements, scaring off traders.
""If you don't know what Glencore's mines are up to, it's very hard to trade Australian coal futures,"" said one trader with a large European utility. ""It's not Glencore's wrongdoing, just the way it is.""
Glencore has previously said it is as vulnerable as any other market participant to commodity price swings, and in the past has also used derivatives to hedge its own production. 
STEEP DECLINE
The decline in Asian coal futures volumes stands in stark contrast to booming oil and natural gas futures.
The amount traded in front-month Australian coal futures on the Intercontinental Exchange (N:ICE) has collapsed from a high of over 1.6 million tonnes in September 2014 to under 290,000 tonnes this September. 
Data from rival CME Group (O:CME) shows that open interest, which describes the number of open positions, of its Asian coal futures as fallen from around 2.7 million tonnes in early 2015 to just 65,000 in August this year, with Indonesian and Chinese futures totally vanishing.
""In that sort of environment, utilities stop hedging. It's too risky,"" said a senior coal trader with a major commodity merchant, requesting anonymity.
Major European utilities that source international coal include Germany's RWE (DE:RWEG), Uniper (DE:UN01) and ENBW (DE:EBKG), Italy's ENEL (MI:ENEI), Sweden's Vattenfall, as well as Switzerland's Axpo Holding.
""All coal derivatives markets have shrunken this year… as a result of lower options trading, and due to some counter parties that have become less active,"" said Joachim Hall, cross commodity trader at RWE Supply & Trading, the trading arm of Germany's biggest power supplier.
""Europe's API2 (coal futures market) remains liquid, but it does not move in parallel with physical coal we buy in Asia,"" Hall said.
VOLUMES DOWN, RISK UP
Noble's troubles and Glencore's strength are not the only reasons for the malaise.
Unlike many other markets, no single exchange has attracted enough liquidity to hedge reliably.
Instead bourses like ICE, CME and others including China's Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE), Singapore Exchange (SI:SGXL) or the European Energy Exchange (DE:T3PA) offer contracts with varying delivery options, differing underlying coal qualities, and in various currencies.
Chinese exchanges like ZCE <0#CZC> have grown somewhat, but months can still pass without trades, and Chinese coal futures are problematic for international traders.
""There has been quite a bit of turmoil in the coal trading business,"" said Ben Tait, analyst at British energy consultancy Prospex Research. ""China is the driver. Its coal policy shifts can make prices soar or plunge. This has led to some big trading losses."" 
Yet not everybody sees only doom and gloom. 
RWE's Hall said he hoped liquidity would gradually improve again over time, something Pat Markey, managing director of Singapore's Sierra Vista Resources, also expected.

""The Asian market is poised for growth in financial trading, but this will take time as the Asian market is quite fragmented,"" Markey said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias said they captured Syria's largest oil field on Sunday, pressing their assault against Islamic State in the east of the country.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said they took al-Omar field on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river in the early hours. ""Our forces managed to liberate the fields without notable damages,"" said Lilwa al-Abdallah, spokeswoman for the offensive in Deir al-Zor province. 
The jihadists holed up in buildings in a nearby district, where the SDF was trying to hunt them down, she said. 
With U.S.-led jets and special forces, the SDF has been battling in Deir al-Zor bordering Iraq. The alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias has focused on territory east of the river, which bisects the oil-rich province. 
The Syrian army, with Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, has been waging its own separate offensive against Islamic State, mostly to the west of the river. 
The U.S.-led coalition and the Russian military have been holding deconfliction meetings - to prevent clashes between planes and troops - though the two offensives have sometimes come into conflict.
Islamic State has lost vast territory across Syria, and has now come under attack in its last footholds in a strip of the Euphrates valley and the desert in Deir al-Zor.
The SDF declared victory over the jihadists in their former headquarters in Raqqa city this week. SDF fighters would now move to the frontlines in Deir al-Zor, speeding up the battle in eastern Syria.
Last month, the Kurdish-led militias captured a major natural gas field upstream of Sunday's advance.
Al-Omar oil field lies some 10 km (6.21 miles) north of the town of al-Mayadin, which government troops and their allies took earlier this month. The town had turned into a major base for Islamic State militants after the U.S.-backed offensive drove them out of Raqqa.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Islamic State fighters who had withdrawn from the oil field mounted a counter-attack overnight against government forces. The militants made some gains around al-Mayadin, the Britain-based monitor said. 
But a Syrian military source denied this, saying there was no significant attack and fighting raged on at the same pace. 

Any attack by the Islamic State militants there was a ""desperate attempt"", the source said. ""The Syrian Arab Army is attacking, hitting Daesh positions...and advancing,"" the source said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has backed off a series of proposed changes to the nation's biofuels policy after a massive backlash from corn-state lawmakers worried the moves would undercut ethanol demand, according to a letter from the agency to lawmakers seen by Reuters.
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in the letter dated Oct. 19 that the agency will keep renewable fuel volume mandates for next year at or above proposed levels, reversing a previous move to open the door to cuts. 
The move marks a big win for the biofuels industry and lawmakers from corn-states like Iowa, Nebraska and Illinois, while dealing a blow to merchant refiners like PBF Energy Inc and  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) who hoped the administration of President Donald Trump would help provide regulatory relief.
The White House issued a statement hours after the Pruitt letter was delivered to lawmakers expressing the president's support for maintaining the renewable fuel plan. 
“President Donald J. Trump promised rural America that he would protect the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), and has never wavered from that promise,"" the White House statement said.
Trump's second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses in early 2016 gave credibility to his candidacy and he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in the Nov. 8 election. It was the first time a Republican had won Iowa since George W. Bush in 2004 and provided Trump a key takeaway.
The letter could end uncertainty about the future of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard that has roiled commodity and energy markets for months. The program, which requires refineries to blend increasing amounts of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation's fuel supply or buy credits from those who do, appeared on the verge of a massive overhaul.
The most popular form of program credits hit two-month highs on Friday on the EPA news, traders said.. 
The so-called D6 credits sunk to 68 cents last month as EPA considered cost-cutting measures, but prices have rebounded in recent weeks and approached 90 cents on Friday, traders said.
Pruitt said the EPA would not pursue another idea floated by EPA leadership that would have allowed exported ethanol to be counted toward those volume quotas.
Pruitt also said the EPA did not believe a proposal to shift the biofuels blending obligation away from refiners was appropriate. That plan is backed by representatives of a handful of independent refining companies who have warned the cost of the program will bankrupt plants and cost thousands of jobs.
Those ideas would have eased the burden on some in the refining industry, who have argued that biofuels compete with petroleum, and that the blending responsibility costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
But Midwestern lawmakers, including Republicans Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst, had vocally opposed all those ideas, calling them a betrayal of the administration's promises to support the corn belt. They were concerned the moves would undercut domestic demand for ethanol, a key industry in the region that has supported corn growers. 
“It’s a great day for Iowa and a great day for rural America. Administrator Pruitt should be commended for following through on President Trump’s commitment to biofuels,"" Grassley said in a statement.
In the letter, Pruitt said the EPA was prepared to work with Congress to examine the possibility of a waiver that would allow the sale of E15 gasoline, containing 15 percent ethanol, year-round - something currently not permitted during the summer due to concerns about smog.
Renewable Fuels Association President and Chief Executive Bob Dinneen said in a response to the letter on Friday morning that the U.S. ethanol industry was ""grateful for Administrator Pruitt's epiphany on the road to the RFS."" 
The program disproportionately hurts mid-sized refiners and mom-and-pop gas stations that are the backbone of the nation's energy infrastructure and needs to reformed, said Greg Blair, a spokesman for the Fueling American Jobs Coalition, a group of merchant refiners formed to seek changes in the program.

""If the administration follows the course set out in Administrator Pruitt’s letter, manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania, Ohio and other states – jobs President Trump promised to protect – will be at risk,"" Blair said.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for November delivery rose 18 cents to settle at $51.47 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 33 cents to trade at $57.56 a barrel.
In what was a volatile session, crude oil prices struggled for direction as investors weighed the impact of falling domestic demand against supply disruptions in the Kurdish region of Iraq.

1518,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2017 11:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: PDVSA blocked from using NuStar terminal over unpaid bills,"By Marianna Parraga
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela's state-run petroleum firm PDVSA has been barred from using a NuStar Energy (N:NS) oil storage terminal in the Caribbean over $26 million in unpaid bills, according to documents reviewed by Reuters, halting delivery of a cargo to an oil trader. 
The suspension was triggered when PDVSA missed a payment for use of NuStar's Statia facility on the island of St. Eustatius, according to company documents viewed by Reuters. 
""We should not load this cargo,"" wrote NuStar Vice President James Calvert in response to a loading request, according to one document. 
NuStar's refusal to retrieve the oil over what amounts to nearly a year's worth of monthly fees shows how recurring legal and trade disputes are disrupting PDVSA's ability to deliver its oil to foreign customers, which generate more than 90 percent of the country's export revenue. 
Shipping delays and quality concerns also are jeopardizing the OPEC-member country's crude sales, the lifeblood of its troubled economy.
The suspension comes months after PDVSA had expanded its NuStar storage contract following a payment dispute with Buckeye Partners (N:BPL) over a Bahamas storage facility. Both U.S. firms operate key transit hubs for companies that move oil through the Caribbean.
NuStar declined to comment. PDVSA did not respond to a request to comment.
NuStar's refusal and other details of PDVSA's payment problems emerged after trader Trafigura [TRAFG.UL] sought to load a cargo of Venezuelan oil held at Statia. Trafigura was the winner of a court-ordered auction of the heavy crude intended to help resolve a separate billing dispute between PDVSA and units of Russian state-run conglomerate Sovcomflot . 
Trafigura declined to comment on the auction or whether it expects to receive the cargo. Sovcomflot also declined to comment. 
NuStar first sought fees for the stored oil from PDVSA. On Oct. 10, after receiving no response from the Venezuelan firm, NuStar sent a $287,500 invoice to Sigma Navigation, a unit of Sovcomflot. NuStar offered to allow the oil to be loaded by Oct. 20 if payment was made before that date.
That request led to a series of exchanges between representatives of the three companies. In one, a law firm representing Sigma alerted PDVSA's lawyers that its client was willing to pay the NuStar bill but reserved the right to seek repayment as part of the broader claim, according to documents. 
Sigma's lawyers also revealed in emails that, according to its talks with NuStar, the U.S. firm was claiming PDVSA owed it another $26 million for accumulated unpaid Statia storage fees. 
LONG TRIP
The tangled story of the oil cargo at the heart of the dispute began a year ago, when PDVSA sent 550,000 barrels of crude oil to St. Eustatius on tanker NS Columbus rented from Sovcomflot. The oil had been sold to Norway's  Statoil  (OL:STL), which planned to retrieve it at Statia.
Before it could get there, Sovcomflot had a St. Maarten court freeze the delivery in hopes of collecting partial payment for shipping fees unpaid by PDVSA. Five months after crossing the Caribbean, the court ordered the tanker to discharge its cargo at Statia. 
Trafigura's attempts to obtain the oil first were delayed due to force majeure declared by NuStar due to Hurricane Irma, and later over the unpaid bills between PDVSA and NuStar.
""We are facing a delay in the payment for the use of such facilities and related services contracted there. PDVSA is doing its best to catch up with outstanding debts, but has not made any special arrangements to cover the storage costs of the relevant tank,"" a PDVSA official wrote in an email in October. 
The PDVSA official explained that ""since June no payment has been made to NuStar,"" but also said that a payment schedule was proposed to the U.S. firm in a meeting in September in Caracas, with a first installment of $2.3 million planned for October.
According to the schedule, 10 percent of the accumulated debt was to be paid from October through December, with a one-time additional payment due in January and the remainder paid off through 10-percent monthly installments.
PDVSA has not yet paid the October installment, according to a PDVSA source, prompting NuStar's refusal to load. 
In a memorandum to PDVSA's finance chief, Simon Zerpa, the oil company's trade and supply department warned further payment delay to NuStar could result in possible tanker embargoes, broken supply contracts with Caribbean customers and a shortage of fuels for Venezuela's domestic market.
In the September meeting, PDVSA suggested it could terminate a related contract with NuStar for fuel oil tanks rental and sublease a portion of its Statia storage to an undisclosed firm as a way to reduce further debts. 
NuStar countered that PDVSA could pay off the debt with oil, or by allowing it to become a partner in the state-run company's terminal on the island of Bonaire along with a partial payment to show good faith. 

It is unclear if any agreement on topics different than the payment schedule was reached.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday and were set for a weekly loss as investors sought to book profits, despite tensions in the Middle East that have slashed supplies of crude. 
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were down 47 cents at $56.76 a barrel at 0954 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $50.75 per barrel, down 54 cents.

Iraqi troops regained control of two major oilfields northwest of Kirkuk from Kurdish Peshmerga forces this week, and the oil ministry in Baghdad expects to bring the fields back on stream on Sunday.
In a major development, Russia's biggest oil company, Rosneft (MM:ROSN), has agreed to take control of Iraqi Kurdistan's main oil pipeline in a $1.8 billion investment.
The deal ""makes it a bit harder for Baghdad to do anything against those flows"", Jakob said. 
TIGHTENING MARKET
Despite the losses on Friday, analysts say the market is on a path towards rebalancing.
""The oil market has moved into modest undersupply and we expect this will persist at least through the end of the year,"" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.
U.S. commercial stocks of crude oil have dropped 15 percent from their March records, to 456.5 million barrels, below levels seen last year. 
Part of this drawdown has been due to rising exports as a result of the steep discount of U.S. crude to Brent, which makes it attractive for American producers to export their oil. 
Additionally, crude futures price curves are in backwardation, which makes it attractive to sell produced oil immediately rather than store it for later dispatch.
Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that overseas U.S. crude oil shipments have soared from virtually zero before the government loosened export restrictions in late 2015 to around 2.6 million bpd in October.
""Physical bottlenecks are unlikely to kick in until waterborne (U.S.) exports approach 3.2 million bpd,"" RBC Capital Markets said.

The district of Altun Kupri, or Perde in Kurdish, lies on the road between the city of Kirkuk - which fell to Iraqi forces on Monday - and Erbil, capital of the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in northern Iraq that voted in a referendum last month to secede from Iraq against Baghdad's wishes.
A force made up of U.S-trained Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service units, Iranian-backed Popular Mobilisation and Federal Police began their advance on Altun Kupri at 7:30 a.m. (0430 GMT), said an Iraqi military spokesman.
""Details will be communicated later,"" the spokesman said in a short posting on social media.
Kurdish Peshmerga forces withdrew from the town of Altun Kupri, located on the Zab river, after battling the advancing Iraqi troops with machine guns, mortars and rocket propelled grenades, security sources said.
It was not immediately clear whether there had been any casualties in the fighting.
The Iraqi forces have advanced into Kirkuk province largely unopposed as most Peshmerga forces withdrew without a fight.
The fighting at Altun Kupri marked only the second instance of significant violent resistance by the Kurds in Kirkuk province since Monday.
Altun Kopri marks the administrative limit between Kirkuk and Erbil. It belongs administratively to the Kirkuk province.
Iraqi forces are seeking to reestablish Baghdad's authority over territory captured by the Kurdish Peshmerga outside the official boundaries of the Kurdistan region in the course of the war on Islamic State militants.
The Peshmerga had moved into Kirkuk after the Iraqi army fled the region in the face of Islamic State's advance in 2014. The Kurdish move prevented Kirkuk's oilfields from falling into the hands of the militants.

1525,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2017 02:20AM ET</span>",Crude or condensate? The dilemma over Nigeria's oil-cut exemption,"By Libby George
LONDON (Reuters) - When OPEC agreed to exempt Nigeria from its oil production-restraint deal last year, it knew the country faced a huge challenge in recouping output lost due to militant unrest.
As tensions subside and the country pumps closer to normal levels, another dilemma looms for the producer group as it continues efforts to eradicate a price-sapping oil glut - how to count Nigeria's crude output without mixing in condensates.
The answer could determine when – and indeed if ever – Nigeria has to cut or curtail oil production, its key source of foreign currency. 
While Nigeria promised to cap at 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) once production ""stabilizes"", that limit exempts all of the West African nation's condensates. And no one seems to agree on how much of that ultra-light oil it pumps. 
""Previously, due to the whole issue of militancy, quotas were not an issue,"" said Gail Anderson, research director at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. But now, ""if you start thinking about OPEC cuts, then the definition of crude and condensate becomes quite important"". 
Nigeria, along with OPEC peer Libya, was exempt from cuts due to militancy in its Delta region that slashed output from 2.2 million bpd to as low as 1.2 million bpd last year. The attacks have abated, with no major incidents since January. 
Nigeria's output has also rebounded, and secondary sources such as consultancies and price-reporting agencies quoted by OPEC said it edged above 1.8 million bpd in August and September - reinstating the country as Africa's largest oil exporter. 
But Nigeria has said some of that total included condensates, an ultra-light oil that is not counted as part of its promise to cap. 
Oil minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu told Reuters in July that condensates contributed 450,000 bpd to Nigeria's production that month.
The figure exceeds external estimates for condensate production ranging from 200,000 to 250,000 bpd and suggests Nigeria's own condensate definition could keep it out of any cap. 
""Definition matters and all producers are playing with definitions,"" said Ehsan Ul-Haq, director of crude oil and refined products at Resource Economist Ltd, a consultancy. 
Neither Nigeria's state oil company, NNPC, nor its Ministry of Petroleum, responded to Reuters requests for comment on its production or definition of condensate. 
WHAT'S IN A NAME? 
Oil exists in many types of quality – from heavy, sulfur-rich Canadian oil sands to ultra-light shale oil. 
Condensates are liquefied once extracted from high-pressure reservoirs, where they exist as a gas. Nearly all oilfields produce some condensates, usually in small amounts. Once it becomes a liquid, there is no widely agreed way to differentiate condensate from crude.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries does not publish a figure, reporting only the crude output of its 14 members, and NNPC also publishes no condensate numbers.
Asked how OPEC would define condensate if it needed to determine Nigerian production volumes, a spokesman for the producer group said the definition was based on ""international standards"" such as those of the American Petroleum Institute.
But those standards focus on whether the oil was a gas when extracted. Once liquefied, there is no widely agreed rule. 
Often – including in Nigeria – condensates are blended into crude exports, and not tracked carefully. The issue briefly flared when the U.S. shale revolution led to a spike in oil production, and more would-be exporters sought to send oil abroad as condensate, circumventing a ban on exports of crude. [http://reut.rs/2yzrJA8]
Washington lifted its export ban before it could craft a clearer definition. 
This lack of consensus on what constitutes condensate makes it tricky to determine how much any country produces. 
""Nigeria does produce quite a bit of condensate, but apart from Akpo it's not really measured because it's blended into crude,"" Wood Mackenzie's Anderson said.
LABELS AND EXPORTS
Akpo, the only substantial Nigerian grade that trading and analyst sources told Reuters is marketed as condensate, is typically exported at a rate of 100,000-133,000 bpd. Production of another condensate grade, Oso, has declined so substantially that it is blended into Qua Iboe crude exports.
Late last year, the Paris-based International Energy Agency began counting another Nigerian grade, Agbami, with 220,000-250,000 bpd of exports, as condensate. Oil trading and industry sources told Reuters the grade is marketed as crude oil, and the IEA declined to give a reason for the change.      
Under IEA figures counting Agbami and Akpo as condensate, Nigeria's crude production has not hit 1.8 million bpd since November 2015. 
Despite a contrasting picture from OPEC's secondary-source figures, Nigeria's direct communication with the organization has not shown crude output holding above 1.8 million bpd in the past two years; the country's own full-year 2015 figure was 1.75 million bpd, with that for 2016 at 1.43 million bpd.
Other experts said hitting 1.8 million bpd without Agbami or Akpo would be tough in the near term.         
""They would have to ramp up existing production or bring new fields online,"" said Audrey Dubois-Hebert, senior oil analyst with FGE, an energy consultancy.    
Wood Mackenzie estimates that export grades aside, roughly 12 percent of Nigeria's production could be classified as condensate but that it could be higher. This murky, but sizeable, chunk of output could keep Nigeria from capping. 

""Having a lot of wellhead condensate production could work to your benefit,"" Anderson said.

Senator Lisa Murkowski, the chair of the Senate energy committee and an Alaskan Republican, called the 1002 portion a ""non wilderness area"" because the government put it aside decades ago for petroleum exploration. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the area on the Prudhoe Bay in Northern Alaska has up to 12 billion barrels of recoverable crude. 
A Senate budget measure introduced this fall instructed Murkowski's committee to raise $1 billion over 10 years. She hopes some of that money will come from energy company royalties after opening the 1002 area to drilling. Murkowski urged senators to see the ""instruction as an opportunity to do something constructive"" and focus on boosting energy output from federal lands that have long been off limit. 
The failed amendment, sponsored by Senator Maria Cantwell the top Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee, would have eliminated the directive from the budget resolution seeking to raise funds.
Republicans led a ""sneak attack"" that turned ""public lands over to polluters,"" Cantwell said. Senator Jeff Merkley, another Democrat, has said there is ""something cynical and sad"" about the effort to open ANWR because it would boost oil output from the state feeling the fastest effects of climate change, which a majority of scientists link to carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and development. 
The battle is not over. The House of Representatives will next have to pass its version of a plan to raise revenues from the drilling. A final budget package would then be worked out by leaders from the two chambers. 
Petroleum interests have long lobbied to explore in the area and say technology advances mean the impact of operations in the reserve would be small. Murkowski said oil companies could use infrared cameras to detect and avoid polar bear dens while exploring for oil and gas.
It is uncertain whether energy companies that have faced years of static crude prices amid a wealth of oil in the continental United States would be willing to increase drilling in the harsh and frigid Arctic. 

Environmentalists vowed to keep up their fight. ""Congress cannot sneak this through the back door when they think nobody is looking,"" said Jamie Williams, president of the Wilderness Society. ANWR ""is simply too fragile and special to drill, and we have a moral obligation to protect it for future generations of Americans.""

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for November delivery fell 1.4% to settle at $51.29 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent lost 1.58% to trade at $57.23 a barrel.
Crude oil prices fell as signs that Opec would extend the global supply-cut agreement deal failed to offset ongoing investor concerns over data showing a sharp rise in gasoline and diesel supplies.
A weekly report from the Energy Information Administration released Wednesday showed U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose for a fourth straight week while supplies of distillates - the class of fuels that includes diesel and heating oil – increased for the first time since August.
“We’re following through on the bearish influence that we had from product builds in the U.S.,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London.
The uptick in supplies of refinery products such as gasoline comes amid a traditional slowdown in refinery activity as refiners undergo seasonal maintenance.
Sentiment on oil prices, however, improved after Opec leaders signalled a possible extension to the output-agreement deal, set to expire in March.
OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo that Russian President Vladimir Putin's suggestion this month that the deal could be extended to the end of 2018 were being taken ""seriously"".
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year."

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $7.48, or 0.58%, to $1,290.48 a troy ounce.
Gold prices were on track to snap a three-day losing streak benefitting from political uncertainty in Spain after Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the country would trigger Article 155 allowing the government to take control of Catalonia after Catalan Leader Carles Puidgemont failed to renounced the region’s push for independence.
Also supporting demand for gold was a slump in the dollar amid a fall in treasury yields despite data pointing to underlying strength in the U.S. economy.
The Philadelphia Fed said Thursday its manufacturing index rose to a reading of 27.9, from 23.8 in September, beating economists forecast of a reading of 22.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims decreased 22,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Oct. 13, beating forecasts of a 4,000 decrease.
Sentiment on the gold, however, remained negative as market participants said the precious metal could come under pressure amid signs of solid U.S. economic growth and expectations for a year-end interest rate hike.
""The lack of safe-haven demand combined with expectations of higher interest rates is weighing on gold. If gold remains below $1,300, there's a risk of a deeper correction in the coming days or weeks,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at FOREX.com

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 51 billion cubic feet in the week ended October 13, while analysts had forecast an increase of 55 billion.
After the release and despite the bullish reading, natural gas for delivery in November on the New York Mercantile Exchange lost 2.1 cents, or about 0.74%, to trade at $2.833 per million British thermal units by 10:32AM ET (14:32GMT).
Futures had been dropping by just 0.1 cents, or around 0.04%, at $2.853 prior to the release of the supply data.
That compared with a build of 87 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the preceding week and represented a decline of 179 billion from a year earlier and was 35 bcf below the five-year average.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.646 trillion cubic feet, 4.7% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 1.0% below the five-year average for this time of year.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude November contract was down76 cents or about 1.46% at $51.27 a barrel by 09:45 a.m. ET (13:45 GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for December delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was down 87 cents or about 1.51% at $57.26 a barrel.
Crude prices rallied after the EIA reported this week that crude oil inventories fell by 5.7 million barrels, marking the fourth straight weekly decline. However, gasoline stockpiles were up 900,000 barrels for the week, while distillate stockpiles rose by 500,000 barrels.
The report also showed that domestic crude production slumped by 11% from the previous week to 8.4 million, as production had to be shut because of Hurricane Nate, which hit the U.S. Gulf coast earlier in October.
Prices received another boost amid expectations that major global producers will extend a deal to curb production beyond its current expiry date next March.
The original deal, struck nearly a year ago between OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia, was to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Meanwhile, oil traders continued to monitor geopolitical developments in Iraq's Kurdistan region, where Iraqi forces this week captured the Kurdish-held oil city of Kirkuk.
The fighting follows a referendum in which the Kurds, who run their own semiautonomous region in northern Iraq, voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence last month, defying Baghdad, regional powers and the U.S., triggering fears of supply disruptions.
Adding to these tensions, U.S. President Donald Trump last week refused to certify Iran's compliance over a nuclear deal, leaving Congress 60 days to decide further action against Tehran.
Elsewhere, gasoline futures were down 0.97% at $1.635 a gallon, while natural gas futures were little changed at $2.856 per million British thermal units."

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil producers are working to build consensus on extending their deal to reduce supplies, OPEC's secretary general said on Thursday, with the potential for continuation throughout 2018 forming a basis for talks. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and nine other producers, are cutting oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018 in an attempt to eradicate a supply glut that has weighed on prices.
The deal has supported prices, which are trading within sight of a two-year high, but an overhang of stored oil has yet to be fully eradicated and producers are considering extending the deal at their next meeting on Nov. 30.
OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo, in a briefing with reporters on Thursday, said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's suggestion this month that the deal could be extended to the end of 2018 were being taken ""seriously"".
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, the OPEC president, and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak ""are taking cue from the open statement of President Putin and engaging the rest of the participating countries ... to build consensus before Nov. 30"", Barkindo said.
Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing OPEC sources, that producers are leaning towards extending the deal for a further nine months, though the decision could be postponed until early next year depending on the market.
Barkindo said it wasn't yet clear if the decision would be made on Nov.30 and, asked whether another meeting could be held in early 2018, said that Falih and Novak would consult and decide. 
""It's difficult to say at the moment what will be decided in November,"" Barkindo said.
""It will depend on a number of factors, chief among which is how far are we from achieving our objective of a convergence of supply and demand.""
Falih and Novak are also talking to producers not currently participating in the supply cut, Barkindo added.
BALANCED MARKET IN SIGHT
Earlier in the day Barkindo said the supply pact was helping to speed the balancing of the crude market.
""There is no doubt that this market is rebalancing at an accelerating pace,"" he said in a speech at the Oil & Money conference in London.
""Stability is steadily returning and there is far more light at the end of the dark tunnel we have been traveling down for the past three years.""
Oil prices, trading above $57 on Thursday, are half their level of mid-2014, prompting energy companies to cut back on exploration and producers to curb production.
The supply pact is aimed at reducing oil stocks in OECD industrialized countries to their five-year average.

Stock levels in September were about 160 million barrels above that average, Barkindo said, down from January's 340 million barrels above the five-year average.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Thursday but held onto most recent gains, supported by OPEC-led supply cuts, tension in the Middle East and lower U.S. production.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 75 cents at $57.40 a barrel by 1135 GMT, still around 30 percent above mid-year levels. U.S. light crude (CLc1) was 65 cents lower at $51.39, almost 25 percent higher than its lows in June.
Analysts said some investors were taking profits after two weeks of gains but upward momentum remained strong.
""The oil market is tightening gradually,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
""OPEC is expected to roll over output restrictions for another nine months, supplies are at risk in the Middle East and U.S. inventories are falling."" 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.7 million barrels in the week to Oct. 13, to 456.49 million barrels. 
U.S. output slumped by 11 percent from the previous week to 8.4 million barrels per day (bpd), its lowest since June 2014 as production was shut in by a hurricane.
Instability in the Middle East has increased risks to supply from key oil-producing areas.
""The 'Fragile Five' petrostates - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela - continue to see supply disruption potential, with northern Iraq crude exports at risk due to an escalation of tensions between the (Kurdistan Regional Government), Baghdad and Turkey, while the United States has decertified the 2015 Iran nuclear deal,"" U.S. bank Citi said.
Iraqi Kurdistan's oil exports more than halved to 225,000 bpd on Wednesday as the Iraqi military retook some of the biggest fields from Kurdistan's Peshmerga forces.
""Geopolitical risk has returned to the oil market ... As a result, we have raised our ICE Brent forecast for 4Q17 from $45 per barrel to $52,"" Dutch bank ING said on Thursday.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week refused to certify Iran's compliance over a nuclear deal, leaving Congress 60 days to decide further action against Tehran.
During the previous round of sanctions against Iran, around 1 million bpd of oil was cut from markets.

VERONA, Italy (Reuters) - A global deal to cut oil output has not led to a breakthrough on high inventory levels, while an expected rise in U.S. shale oil output may destabilize the market in 2018, the head of Russia's Rosneft, Igor Sechin, said on Thursday.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other leading global oil producers led by Russia have agreed to cut their combined output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to remove excessive oil from inventories and prop up prices.
""The analysis shows that the announced goal of inventories stabilization has not been fully implemented and it is too early to talk about a watershed in the global market,"" Sechin told an industry forum in Verona on Thursday.
Sechin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, is known for his scepticism about OPEC's ability to regulate the world oil market. 
That global pact is aimed at reducing oil stock levels in leading industrialized countries to their five-year average.
According to OPEC, stocks in September were about 160 million barrels above that average, which is down from 340 million in January.
Oil prices have fallen by 50 percent since mid-2014, prompting energy companies to cut back on exploration and producers to curb production. The prices have stabilized above $50 per barrel, the level seen as ""fair"" by many producers.
Sechin said the rebalancing of supply and demand is ""fragile"" as U.S. shale oil production next year may significantly increase if oil prices stay relatively firm.
""That's why I think, we shouldn't expect a jump in oil prices in nearest future,"" Sechin said.
He also said that the global efforts to stabilize oil market are complicated by the lack of reliable information on inventories as well as on the oil supply and demand balance.
""The key task here is to create a unified system of inventory measurement and removal of stock overhang,"" Sechin said.
He said the expected initial public offering of Saudi Aramco may not be a ""fully fledged international listing"" to due legal risks, but he did not elaborate.
One option includes selling some stock immediately to so-called cornerstone investors, such as China, and then selling shares on the local bourse as well as an international stock exchange, with New York, London and Hong Kong in the running.

""The scenarios of private share placement of local listing, which are being discussed today, unfortunately will not achieve the goals, which the organizers had initially set out,"" he said.

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2017 01:45AM ET</span>",Peace gives Colombian coffee an extra shot,"By Marcy Nicholson
SAN CARLOS, Colombia (Reuters) - Farmers who fled war in the Colombian Andes are returning to revive their abandoned land, cultivating coffee trees that are boosting global supplies of the highest-quality beans.
Colombia's five-decade civil war, the longest in the Americas, displaced millions and disrupted farming for decades in areas that produce coffee for the most exacting consumer.
The revival of coffee farming in the former conflict zones could help boost Colombia's coffee output by 40 percent, according to government estimates. That would raise global supplies of mild arabica beans by about 13 percent.
The additional supply could reduce the cost of the raw material for the world's top roasters, many of whom are seeking to secure increased supply from Colombia.
About 950 coffee-growing families have returned to the San Carlos area, representing about 60 percent of the 1,600 families who left during the war, according to data from the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation (FNC). The supply from this region, about 330 kilometers (205 miles) north west of the Colombian capital of Bogota, could expand further as farmers plant more of their land and more people return to the region to provide the needed labor.
The area now has about 800 hectares of coffee farms, double the low of 400 hectares during the war. That's still only about half of the 1,500 hectares prior to the conflict, according to FNC data.
Among those who returned was Libardo Garcia, who lost two brothers in the conflict - one was shot and the other killed by a landmine. He and his family moved back to their 12-hectare (30 acres) farm in 2015 after fleeing in 2001. 
""All the coffee trees were dead when we came back,"" said Garcia, who has since planted 8,000 trees on two hectares of steeply sloped land.
Arabica is the highest quality coffee bean, and Colombia is the world's top producer of mild arabica. To make that variety, beans are separated from the cherry then dried to increase quality.
Arabica makes up about 60 percent of global coffee supplies, with lower-quality robusta beans accounting for the rest. While some coffee roasters add robusta to their highly secretive blends, premium brands are typically 100 percent mild arabica.
A peace deal between the government and the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in late 2016 paved the way for many to return to their homes and farms, including thousands of coffee growers.
About 220,000 people died and millions were displaced in decades of fighting among leftist guerillas, paramilitary groups, criminal organizations and government forces. The conflict impacted large areas of the country, and the government struggled to exert control over highlands and remote jungle areas in the west and south of the country.
Some farmers who stayed through the violence have also switched to coffee from growing coca and other illegal crops that they cultivated during the conflict. Coca is used for cocaine production, and the cash from growing it helped finance armed groups during the war.
The combination of farmers returning to their abandoned land and others switching to coffee could help boost the country's total output to a record 20 million 60-kg bags by 2020, the government estimates, up from 14.2 million bags in 2016.
GOING HOME
In the Andean region of San Carlos, the revival in coffee production has advanced quickly since conflict in the region abated around 2014, when the peace deal was still being negotiated. The country's conflict with rebels began in 1964 and peaked in this region around 2000.
After fleeing his farm, Garcia spent time in the city of Medellin and then in the town of San Carlos.
""We came back because we love the land,"" he said, leaning against the fence outside his home, a brick house adorned with baskets of flowers.
Wearing a wide-brimmed hat, Garcia pointed out a former FARC stronghold in the distance, in tree-covered mountains about an hour's walk from his farm.
Most of his neighbors have yet to return, he said, either because they are skeptical the peace will last or because they have made lives elsewhere.
Before moving his family back, Garcia traveled the 13 kilometers from nearby San Carlos every weekend for three years to plant new coffee trees and remove the dead ones.
Garcia has plenty of land to expand his farm further but cannot yet find the labor because too few people have returned to surrounding communities.
New high-yielding trees have helped boost harvests, but the region is still far from reaching its potential because of the labor shortage, said Rosa Velasques, manager of the local cooperative where about 1,000 local farmers sell their beans.
'A LOT OF WORK'
International roasters have jumped at the opportunity to buy more beans from Colombia, the world's third-largest coffee producer and the source of a third of the world's mild arabica supplies.
Italian roaster illycaffe has expanded its buying to parts of the country that were unreachable during the violence.
""Now they've opened up,"" said illycaffe Chairman Andrea Illy.
The firm had increased purchases from the region by double digit percentages for the last two to three years, Illy said, and it expects growth to continue at similar rates.
In 2016, Nestle Nespresso bought its first coffee from a post-conflict region of Colombia and launched it this year as a limited edition.
""A lot of these regions, nobody had even been in and tasted the coffee until recently,"" said Katherine Graham, Nestle Nespresso's corporate communications manager. 
""There are some areas with strong potential,"" Graham said. ""But it needs a lot of development, a lot of work.""
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) Co expanded its partnership with the United States Agency for International Development to give 1,000 farmers in post-conflict zones agricultural training. It also partnered with the Inter-American Development Bank to support 2,000 farmers in Colombia - mainly women - with a loan initiative.
Colombian entrepreneur Gonzalo Navarro launched a roasting company called Piccolo Piacere in Medellin earlier this year, focusing on sourcing from small coffee growers, many in former conflict zones.
""We have access to farmers who in the past were growing other things, such as coca,"" he said.
Back near San Carlos, farmer Rubiela Cuervo works a remote farm with her family. She fled to Medellin to escape the violence in 2005 but struggled to make a living and returned a year later despite the ongoing violence.
She has expanded the farm as peace returned to the area in recent years.
""We hope that peace will bring us more employment, more income for our work,"" she said. ""I'm hoping not to be displaced again.""

1544,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2017 08:20PM ET</span>",U.S. diesel margins to drive refiner profits for third quarter and beyond,"By Devika Krishna Kumar and Jarrett Renshaw
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. refiners are set to blow past quarterly earnings expectations after margins surged to a two-year peak on the back of a crippling hurricane season that squeezed already tight gasoline and diesel supplies. 
A series of hurricanes, most notably Harvey, which struck Texas in late August sapped demand for crude oil and led to crushing gasoline lines in various parts of the U.S. Southeast and Midwest. 
However, those supply interruptions boosted margins for refiners, suddenly presented with lower crude oil costs and a big jump in gasoline and diesel prices. It came after a summer when refiners surprisingly reduced their volumes of distillates - heating oil, diesel, jet fuel and kerosene - just before demand for those products ramps up in the fall and winter.
Refiners such as  Valero Energy  (N:VLO) and PBF Energy (N:PBF) will continue to ride healthy diesel margins in the coming months amid post-hurricane recovery efforts and sustained exports that will keep supplies at some of the lowest levels in years, analysts said.
""In addition to the increased distillate demand based on economic activity, there will be immense rebuilding needs in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico from damage caused by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, all in August and September 2017,"" Moody's said in a note.
Diesel margins rose about 50 percent during the third quarter, the biggest jump seasonally in six years, as overall volumes fell by about 10 percent to a two-year low. 
Per-share earnings estimates for the third quarter for seven independent refineries, have, on average, seen their earnings-per-share estimates rise by 2.4 percent over the past week, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine figures. 
Current estimates may not be high enough. StarMine currently predicts those seven companies will beat consensus expectations by an average of 3 percent.
All seven companies rank in the top 25 percent of U.S. companies in StarMine’s analyst revision models, which take into account changes in forecasts for revenue and earnings, as well as overall analyst recommendations. 
Quarterly results should detail which companies were most hurt by lost production due to Harvey, and which benefited most by being able to boost refining runs as margins peaked. Valero Energy Corp (N:VLO), which operates three refineries affected by Harvey, has nonetheless seen 13 upward revisions to EPS predictions in the last week, compared with 4 downward revisions. 
On the flip side, analysts have been lowering expectations for Phillips 66 (N:PSX), with 6 increases and 10 decreases, according to StarMine. Refiners will begin reporting earnings next week, kicking off with Valero on Oct. 26.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note last week that estimates are likely to fluctuate, due to the difficulty in predicting how some refiners fared during the storm.
DIESEL DOMINATES
Robust exports are expected to keep demand for U.S. fuels elevated. European appetite for U.S. diesel has soared in recent months, but imports for September and October have been dented by the supply crunch created by Harvey.
Margins to produce diesel fuel rose to a more than two-and-a-half year high of $26.95 a barrel during the third quarter and traded at nearly $24 a barrel on Wednesday, a four-year high for this time of the year. Gasoline margins  also jumped during the third quarter, hitting two-year highs in early September.
U.S. distillate exports will remain more than 10 percent higher in 2018 than in 2016, with further increases possible with continued demand and unplanned refinery outages from Latin America and Europe, according to Moody's.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) currently estimates U.S. refiners' 2018 earnings per share to beat estimates by 20 percent. 

""We anticipate refiners will have a higher tilt toward distillate production heading into year-end ... In our view this will help set up an attractive 2018 gasoline market,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note.

U.S. natural gas for November delivery sank 4.9 cents, or around 1.7%, to $2.913 per million British thermal units by 8:40AM ET (1240GMT). It fell to its lowest level since Sept. 11 at $2.897 earlier in the session.
Futures tacked on 1.6 cents, or around 0.5%, on Tuesday, as hopes for higher heating demand this winter than in the past two winters provided support.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather weakens demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
Market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 52 and 62 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended October 13.
That compares with a gain of 87 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 77 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 78 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.595 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 153 bcf, or around 4.1%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 8 bcf, or roughly 0.2%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

1557,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2017 03:33AM ET</span>","Canada's oil sands survive, but can't thrive in a $50 oil world","By Nia Williams
CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada's oil sands producers are stuck in a rut.
The nation's oil firms are retrenching, with large producers planning little or no further expansion and some smaller projects struggling even to cover their operating costs.
As the era of large new projects comes to a close, many mid-sized producers - those with fewer assets and producing less than 100,000 barrels of oil a day in the oil sands - have shelved expansion plans, unable to earn back the high start-up costs with crude at around $50 per barrel. Larger Canadian producers, meanwhile, focus on projects that in the past were associated with smaller names. 
The last three years have seen dozens of new projects mothballed and expansions put on hold, meaning millions of barrels of crude from the world's third-largest reserves may never be extracted.
Where industry groups in 2014 expected Canada's oil sands output to more than double to nearly 5 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030, that forecast has been knocked down to 3.7 million bpd.
This follows a spell of consolidation that has seen foreign majors sell off more than $23 billion in Canadian assets in a year and turn to U.S. shale patches such as the Permian basin in Texas, which produce returns more quickly and where proximity to refiners means the barrels fetch a better price.
""We cannot compete with that huge sucking noise to the south that is called the Permian. Investment dollars are spiraling away down there,"" Derek Evans, chief executive of small oil sands producer Pengrowth Energy told Reuters in an interview. 
Permian production rose 21 percent in 12 months through July compared to a 9 percent increase in Alberta's oil sands, according to Canadian and U.S. government data. 
COSTLY STARTUP PHASE
Mid-sized producers are hurting the most, due to start-up costs that far exceed those in other major producing areas. Oil sands producers have slashed operating costs by a third since 2014, but building a new thermal project - in which steam is pumped as deep as one kilometer (1094 yards)underground to liquefy tar-like bitumen and bring it to the surface - requires U.S. crude benchmark at around $60 a barrel to break even, analysts estimate.
The North American benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude has traded between $42 and $55 a barrel so far this year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts it will average $49.69 a barrel in 2017 and $50.57 a barrel next year. 
There are around half a dozen thermal projects in the costly start-up phase, when engineers steadily increase steam pressure to bring a reservoir's production up to full capacity.
One of those is Athabasca Oil Corp's Hangingstone project. It was originally conceived as a 80,000 bpd project, but instead will bring output to only 12,000 bpd from the current 9,000 bpd. The project can break even with U.S. crude prices of at least $53 a barrel, meaning right now Athabasca keeps losing money on Hangingstone production. Size is crucial in the oil sands; the more bitumen a company can squeeze out of a plant, the lower fixed costs per barrel will be. 
""(Athabasca) was a company built when oil was $100 a barrel. In those days we were going to find funding for joint ventures and build greenfield projects to a massive size. The reality is the world changed,"" chief executive Rob Broen told Reuters.
Quarterly filings show why smaller players are struggling. Transportation and marketing costs at Hangingstone, along with the cost of natural gas used to produce steam to extract oil, and other operating costs are much higher compared with Cenovus Energy's Christina Lake project, one of the highest-quality and biggest bitumen reservoirs in the oil sands. 
Pengrowth's development plans are on hold as well, Evans said, because the company needs U.S. crude to stay at $55 for a sustained period to justify investment in its 14,000 bpd Lindbergh thermal project, at one point intended to grow as large as 40,000 bpd. 
THE BIG GO SMALL
Large producers have pulled back in response to lower global prices as well. For example, Suncor Energy's 194,000 bpd Fort Hills mine, due to start producing oil by the end of this year, is the company's last megaproject.
Canadian Natural restarted construction on its 40,000 bpd Kirby North project last November, one of a handful of smaller projects to start producing in 2019. 
Other companies like MEG Energy are planning expansions at existing sites in 20,000 bpd ""modules"" rather than starting large new projects from scratch. But even such more modest investments are out of reach for smaller companies like Athabasca and Pengrowth.

""It's very hard (for a small company) to drag itself out of the financing black hole it would have to get in to build a project to start with,"" said Nick Lupick, an analyst at AltaCorp Capital. ""A large company can take that on their balance sheet without having to leverage too highly.""

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2017 02:51AM ET</span>","Oil prices rise on tighter U.S. market, Middle East tensions","By Henning Gloystein
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday, lifted by a fall in U.S. crude inventories and concerns that tensions in the Middle East could disrupt supplies.
Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $58.16 at 0643 GMT, up 28 cents, or 0.5 percent from their last close - and almost a third above mid-year levels.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.03 per barrel, up 15 cents, or 0.3 percent, and almost a quarter above mid-June levels.
Trading volumes were limited during Asian hours on Wednesday due to a public holiday in Singapore, Malaysia and parts of India.
However, a technical pattern known as a 'Golden Cross' was approaching in WTI crude oil contracts on Wednesday, in which the 50-day moving average price climbs higher than the 200-day moving average. This is widely seen as a bullish price indicator, and already occurred with Brent futures on Sept. 25.
Traders said that prices were pushed up by a drop in U.S. crude inventories as well as concerns that fighting in Iraq and mounting tensions between the United States and Iran could affect supplies.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 7.1 million barrels in the week to Oct. 13 to 461.4 million barrels, the American Petroleum Institute (API) said late on Tuesday.
""API data from the U.S. overnight showed a big draw ... If $52.83 in WTI and $59.22 in Brent give way, then oil is stepping into a new and much higher range,"" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.
Official U.S. fuel inventory data is due later on Wednesday from the Energy Information Administration, which Dutch bank ING said would likely also show a stock drawdown.
Adding to a tightening U.S. market, tensions in the Middle East meant that a risk premium was being priced into oil markets.
Iraqi government forces captured the major Kurdish-held oil city of Kirkuk earlier this week, responding to a Kurdish independence referendum, and there are concerns that fighting could disrupt supplies.
""In the case of Kurdistan, the 500,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Kirkuk oil field cluster is at risk,"" U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said on Tuesday.
The Iraq crisis adds to a looming dispute between the United States and Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump last week refused to certify Iran's compliance over a nuclear deal, leaving Congress 60 days to decide further action against Tehran.

During the previous round of sanctions against Iran, some 1 million bpd of oil was cut from global markets.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2017 10:02AM ET</span>",Kurds abandon territory in the face of Iraq government advance,"By Ahmed Rasheed and Mustafa Mahmoud
BAGHDAD/KIRKUK (Reuters) - The Baghdad government recaptured territory across the breadth of northern Iraq from Kurds on Tuesday, making startingly rapid gains in a sudden campaign that has shifted the balance of power in the country almost overnight.
In the second day of a lightning government advance to take back towns and countryside from forces of the Kurdish autonomous region, Kurdish troops known as Peshmerga pulled out of the long disputed Khanaqin area near the Iranian border.
Government troops took control of the last two oilfields in the vicinity of Kirkuk, a city of 1 million people that the Peshmerga abandoned the previous day in the face of the government advance. A Yazidi group allied to Baghdad also took control of the town of Sinjar.
The government advances have redrawn the map of northern Iraq, rolling back gains by the Kurds who infuriated Baghdad last month by holding a referendum on independence.
The Kurds govern three mountainous northern provinces in an autonomous region, and have also held a wide crescent of additional territory in northern Iraq, much of which they captured after helping drive out Islamic State fighters.
Prime Minister Haidar Abadi ordered his troops on Monday to raise their flag over all Kurdish-held territory outside the autonomous region itself. They achieved a swift victory in Kirkuk, reaching the centre of the city in less than a day.
The fighting in one of Iraq's main oil-producing areas has helped return a risk premium to oil prices. After months of range-bound trading, benchmark Brent crude is now above $58 a barrel, up almost a third from its mid-year levels. 
Oil officials in Baghdad said all the fields near Kirkuk were working normally on Tuesday after the last came under government control. Kirkuk is the base of Iraq's Northern Oil Company, one of the two giant state energy firms that provide nearly all government revenue.
DILEMMA FOR WASHINGTON
The advances create a dilemma for Washington, which has armed and trained both sides in its successful campaign to drive Islamic State fighters out of Iraq.
""We don't like the fact that they're clashing,"" U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday. ""We've had for many years a very good relationship with the Kurds as you know, and we've also been on the side of Iraq.""
So far most of the advances appear to have come unopposed, with Kurds withdrawing before government forces move in. There have been reports of just one major clash, in the early hours of Monday on the outskirts of Kirkuk.
In Kirkuk, one of Iraq's most diverse cities, members of the Turkmen ethnic group who have opposed Kurdish rule had celebrated on Monday, driving through the streets in convoys and firing weapons in the air.
By Tuesday, the once ubiquitous green, red and white Kurdish flag with a blazing yellow sun had vanished from the streets. U.S.-trained Iraqi special forces and local police patrolled to maintain order. Markets, shops and schools were open as normal.
Some Kurdish families who had left the city on Monday were already returning home. They said thousands of Kurdish fighters in convoys were lining up in a long queue attempting to flee Kirkuk towards the Kurdish regional capital Erbil, which clogged the road and made it difficult for civilians to leave.
For the Kurds, the loss of territory, particularly Kirkuk which Kurdish folklore views as the heart of their homeland, is a severe blow just three weeks after they voted to declare the independent state that had been their goal for decades.
""Our leaders abandoned us in the middle of nowhere. Our future is dark,"" said Malla Bakhtiyar, a retired schoolteacher in Kirkuk.
He said he tried to escape on Monday but returned with his wife and sons after an Arab neighbour phoned, begging him not to leave and assuring him the city was safe.
University lecturer Salar Othman Ameen blamed the Kurdish authorities for calling the independence referendum prematurely.
""We feel broken now. The referendum was a catastrophic decision...Our Kurdish leadership was supposed to think of the consequences before moving along with independence vote. Now we have lost what we have achieved over three decades.”
The setbacks led to recriminations among the two main Kurdish political parties, which each control separate units of Peshmerga fighters. Officials in the KDP of Kurdish regional government leader Masoud Barzani accused the PUK of his longterm rival Jalal Talabani of ""treason"" for abandoning Kirkuk.
Talabani, who served as ceremonial Iraqi president in Baghdad from 2003-2014, died two weeks ago. His widow denied blame for the fall of Kirkuk and said her party had tried to avert the advance through contact with U.S. and Iraqi officials. 
Barzani was expected to issue a statement calling on Kurdish factions to avoid ""civil war"", according to Kurdish Rudaw TV.
The advances were a second major triumph for Abadi, the soft-spoken Iraqi prime minister, months after his forces recaptured Mosul from Islamic State. Abadi had faced threats from Iran-backed Shi'ite armed groups to take matters into their own hands if he did not act decisively to take on the Kurds.
""If elections were held tomorrow, I would vote with ten fingers for Abadi. He succeeded in keeping Iraq a single state,"" said Adel Abdul Kareem, a Baghdad lawyer.
""When Kurdish leaders were threatening Baghdad, Abadi was always smiling,"" he said. ""We did not expect he was hiding a tornado behind this smile. He proved he was a smart leader, and with his wisdom he won against Masoud (Barzani) with a knockout in the second round.""
In Sinjar, home to the small Yazidi religious minority that faced genocide in 2014 when the area was captured by Islamic State fighters, a Yazidi group called Lalesh took control of the town after Kurdish Peshmerga withdrew.
""There was no violence. The Lalesh group moved after the Peshmerga pulled out,"" said a resident reached by telephone.

The decision by the Kurds to hold an independence referendum had angered neighbours Turkey and Iran. Washington, friendly to the Kurds for decades, had also called on them to cancel the vote, fearing it could trigger war.

In their latest forecasts, meteorologists at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted temperatures from November through March would be 13% colder than last winter and close to the average of the previous 10 years.
Traders were optimistic that colder weather would boost heating demand this winter over the prior two snow seasons, which were among the warmest on record.
U.S. natural gas for November delivery jumped 4.5 cents, or around 1.6%, to $2.994 per million British thermal units by 9:00AM ET (1300GMT).
Futures slumped 5.4 cents, or 1.8%, on Monday as traders reacted to forecasts showing a return to mild weather in the eastern U.S. following last week's cold spell.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather weakens demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 52 and 62 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the week ended October 13.
That compares with a gain of 87 bcf in the preceding week, a build of 77 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 78 bcf.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.595 trillion cubic feet (tcf), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 153 bcf, or around 4.1%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 8 bcf, or roughly 0.2%, below the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts estimated the amount of gas in storage would end the April-October injection season at 3.8 tcf due primarily to higher liquefied natural gas shipments abroad. That would fall short of the year-earlier record of 4.0 tcf and the five-year average of 3.9 tcf.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Wheat shipments to Egypt, the world's largest buyer, are being disrupted by a dispute involving government inspectors angered by a ban on the expenses-paid foreign trips they once enjoyed to approve cargoes at their ports of origin.
Those trips, funded by exporters, have been canceled as part of Egypt's efforts to streamline imports worth more than $1 billion a year. Traders say the new system has backfired as inspectors are now rejecting cargoes at Egyptian ports on arbitrary and unpredictable grounds.
There is more to the problem than erratic policies and red tape, according to interviews with grains traders, agriculture quarantine inspectors, government officials, and a review of inspection documents.
According to these sources, difficulties for importers are rather the result of a tug-of-war over the right to inspect cargoes abroad, where until recently government quarantine inspectors enjoyed fully-funded trips, dinners and shopping at the expense of supply companies looking to secure safe passage for their wheat.
By applying higher standards to grains upon arrival, inspectors are driving up costs in a bid to undermine inspection companies that replaced them abroad, traders said.
Six inspectors who Reuters spoke to denied they are trying to get their foreign trips reinstated and said they are simply upholding quality standards.
Suppliers say uncertainty is prompting them to add premiums of up to $500,000 per cargo to hedge against risks. With Egypt expecting to buy around 7 million tonnes of wheat in the fiscal year that began in July, these premiums add millions of dollars to the government's food subsidy bill.
The bread supply chain has ground to a halt on several occasions as traders have boycotted tenders. Subsidized bread is a staple for millions of poor Egyptians and the country's leaders are always keen to keep supplies flowing for fear of unrest.
Wheat traders say the only way out of the problem is for the government bodies involved to sit down and thrash out standards all sides can agree on.
'A BREAKFAST PROBLEM'
Getting cargoes passed under the old system often came down to keeping government inspectors comfortable, traders said.
When a $6 million wheat cargo at a port in Ukraine suddenly stopped loading two years ago, its agent found Egyptian inspectors had halted the process because their hotel would not give them a late breakfast, traders said. The delay cost the supply company $8,000 in port fees.
""As soon as we arranged for the hotel to give them a later breakfast, everything went smoothly and the shipment was passed. It wasn't a wheat problem. It was a breakfast problem,"" said a Cairo-based trader responsible for the cargo who asked to remain anonymous.
Six other traders described the system in similar terms, saying shopping for electronics and clothes, expensive dinners, and hotel room upgrades were the cost of keeping their grains moving out of ports from Odessa to Dunkirk.
One trader said the money paid to inspectors could equal their annual salary.
""You're talking about four to five people, and you have to take care of them from A to Z, meaning you are taking them shopping and you are paying,"" said Med Star for Trading President Hesham Soliman.
Soliman said the delegations grew more expensive. ""They began needing more pocket money, the hotels have to be certain hotels, the tickets, the visa,"" he said.
Traders said they would spend about $30,000 on the inspectors, which also typically included a $3,500 pocket money payment per person, according to invoices seen by Reuters.
Agricultural quarantine inspectors who Reuters spoke to on condition of anonymity have quoted the same figures for the trips but say the old system was still cheaper for Egypt.
""I can't deny that I benefited, but the country benefited more. Look how much they're spending now,"" one inspector said, referring to the high risk premiums traders now put on cargoes offered to Egypt.
Traders say the system was a relatively cheap way to win approval for their wheat abroad, which protected a cargo from being rejected at Egyptian ports, something that could mean big losses, or even bankruptcy for smaller firms.
""If they're making it sound like we were spending too much, you have the figures, compare the numbers. They're spending a lot more now on the inspections,"" the inspector said.
ERGOT FALLOUT
The old arrangement unraveled in late 2015, when a French wheat cargo was rejected in Egypt for containing traces of the common grain fungus ergot despite being approved by government inspectors abroad.
As other shipments were rejected and import rules appeared to be tightening, some traders said they no longer found the traveling inspectors a bet worth taking.
""We got to a point where we couldn't deal with this. You have a fixed cost and you still have no guarantee that the shipment will enter the country,"" said Soliman.
A group of traders, including Soliman, persuaded the government to ban traveling delegations, which Egypt did in a prime ministerial decree in late 2016 that handed inspections abroad to private companies and made the agriculture quarantine inspectors subject to the oversight of a trade ministry authority.
In an interview at the offices of the General Organization for Export and Import Control (GOEIC), Ismail Gaber, who heads the agency that now has the final word on wheat inspections, told Reuters the travel regime had raised suspicions of corruption that he would rather keep civil servants away from.
""There is of course the issue of corruption, I want to take my employee away from this suspicion. I don't want the supplier and the employee to have the same self-interest,"" he said.
""If he takes someone with him abroad, the supplier says 'I've already taken him with me ... you gave me a government employee and you inspected there so you can't find a problem with it here (in Egypt) after all of this',"" Gaber said.
STRIKING BACK
But having lost their travel benefits, the inspectors are making their presence felt.
Since January, when the new inspection regime came online, inspectors in Egypt have subjected nearly all shipments to costly processes before being approved at Egyptian ports, which add tens of thousands of dollars in costs.
In June, a group of inspectors won a court case that argued that the new system illegally granted their mandate to GOEIC, which the inspectors said was ill-equipped to protect the country from harmful grain contaminants.
The government has appealed and ignored a court order to restore the old inspection regime, including traveling delegations.
The inspectors, who are still checking cargoes under the new inspection regime, say they are just trying to stop bad wheat getting into Egypt and deny they are trying to get their overseas trips back.
One inspector said checks were now tougher at Egyptian ports because importers were sending poor-quality grains.
Traders however said two big state grain purchases halted for containing poppy seeds demonstrated that inspectors were seeking new ways to show that inspection companies abroad are not up to the task.
As a result, traders hiked prices or stayed away from a recent state tender.
The only way out of the impasse, traders say, is for government agencies to agree on consistent rules. ""Without that, we are just waiting for the next victim,"" said one.

Iraqi forces took control of the Bai Hasan and Avana oil fields northwest of Kirkuk on Tuesday, after seizing the Baba Gurgur, Jambur and Khabbaz fields on Monday, he said.
Oil officials in Baghdad said all the fields were operating normally.
The fields were previously held by Kurdish security forces known as Peshmerga, but they pulled out of the area in the face of an advance by forces of the Iraqi central government.

Tuesday's deployment of Iraqi government forces in Dibis, where Bai Hasan and Avana are located, is part of an operation ordered by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to take control of Kurdish-held areas outside the three provinces that form Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region.

The fighting follows a referendum in which the Kurds, who run their own semiautonomous region in northern Iraq, voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence last month, defying Baghdad, regional powers and the U.S.
Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., held steady at around $57.88 a barrel by 3:30AM ET (0730GMT). It rose to its best level since Sept. 28 at $58.47 on Monday.
Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures was little changed at $51.86 a barrel, after reaching a three-week high of $52.37 in the last session.
Investors looked ahead to weekly data from the U.S. on stockpiles of crude and refined products to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (2030GMT) Tuesday.
Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 4.7 million barrels, which would mark the fourth weekly decline in a row.

Trump is also due to meet with Yellen later in the week as part of his search for a new candidate for her position, a source familiar with plans for the meeting said.
Market watchers are also keeping an eye on current Fed Governor Jerome Powell and former Fed official Kevin Warsh as potential candidates to succeed Yellen when her term ends in February.
The U.S. dollar and bond yields pushed higher, dampening the appeal of bullion. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's strength against a basket of six major currencies, rose to a one-week high of 93.37.
Interest rate futures are pricing in around a 90% chance of a December Fed rate hike according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool. The U.S. central bank has already raised rates twice this year.

Overnight, crude oil prices settled higher on Monday as conflict between Iraqi and Kurdish forces broke out in the oil-rich city of Kirkuk raising concerns over supply disruptions in the region.
Oil prices surged on the back of concerns over supply disruptions in Iraq – the second largest Opec producer – after Iraqi forces marched into the oil-rich city of Kirkuk amid rising tensions between Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).
The show of force from Iraqi forces comes after weeks of unrest in the region which followed the KRG’s vote for independence in a Sept. 25 referendum. Kirkuk accounts for 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of the roughly 600,000 bpd of oil produced in the KRG region.
Also supporting an uptick in crude oil prices were concerns over renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran after President Donald Trump on Friday refuse to certify to Congress that Tehran is complying with the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement.
Under the agreement, Iran agreed to restrict its nuclear programme for at least 10 years in exchange for lighter economic sanctions that had crippled its economy, wiping out nearly 1 million bpd of Iranian oil exports from the market.

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The United States issued a long-awaited permit covering a three-mile segment of  Enbridge  Inc's (TO:ENB) Line 67 crude oil pipeline on Monday, allowing the company to nearly double capacity on the cross-border conduit.
The permit from the U.S. State Department for the so-called Alberta Clipper line will allow Calgary-based Enbridge to ship 890,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Canadian crude from Edmonton, Alberta, to Superior, Wisconsin, up from 450,000 bpd currently.
Enbridge said it welcomed the issuance of the permit after a nearly five-year review process. 
""Line 67 currently operates under an existing Presidential Permit that was issued by the State Department in 2009 and the 2017 permit authorizes Enbridge to fully utilize its capacity across the border,"" the company said in a statement.
All cross-border crude oil pipelines require presidential approval. 
Enbridge first filed for the expanded Alberta Clipper permit in 2012. But like TransCanada Corp's (TO:TRP) Keystone XL, the company ran into delays obtaining the permit from the administration of then President Barack Obama.
In 2014, the company hatched a workaround plan to circumvent the delay. It connected the Alberta Clipper to its existing Line 3 pipeline on each side of the Canada-U.S. border, and put oil from Clipper on Line 3 to cross the international boundary.
The permit from President Donald Trump's pro-business administration, which also approved Keystone XL earlier this year, was widely expected, said AltaCorp Capital analyst Dirk Lever, and will help relieve pressure on other parts of the Enbridge system.
Enbridge's Mainline pipeline network carries the bulk of Canada's 3 million bpd of crude exports to the United States and operates at close to capacity.
""This is great news for Canadian producers because it will effectively allow us to move more volumes on the system,"" said Nancy Berard-Brown, manager of oil markets and transportation at the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. ""Line 67 is the backbone of the Enbridge system.""

Enbridge shares closed up 0.4 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$52.01.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2017 09:07AM ET</span>","Iraq launches advance on Kurdish territory, seizes Kirkuk outskirts","By Maher Chmaytelli and Ahmed Rasheed
BAGHDAD, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq's central government forces launched an advance early on Monday into territory held by Kurds, seizing a swathe of countryside surrounding the oil city of Kirkuk in a bold military response to a Kurdish vote last month on independence.
The government said its troops had captured Kirkuk airport, advanced to the city's gates and taken control of northern Iraq's oil company from the security forces of the autonomous Kurdish region, known as Peshmerga.
Baghdad described the advance as largely unopposed, and called on the Peshmerga to cooperate in keeping the peace. But the Peshmerga said Baghdad would be made to pay ""a heavy price"" for triggering ""war on the Kurdistan people"".
Washington called for calm on both sides, seeking to avert an all-out conflict between Baghdad and the Kurds that would open a whole new front in Iraq's 14-year civil war and potentially draw in regional powers such as Turkey and Iran.
A resident inside Kirkuk said members of the ethnic Turkmen community in the city of 1 million people were celebrating, driving in convoys with Iraqi flags and firing shots in the air. Residents feared this could lead to clashes with Kurds.
The overnight advance was the most decisive step Baghdad has taken yet to crush the independence bid of the Kurds, who have governed an autonomous part of Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 and voted on Sept. 25 to secede.
Kirkuk, one of the most ethnically and religiously diverse cities in Iraq, is located just outside the autonomous Kurdish zone. Kurds consider it the heart of their homeland and say it was cleansed of Kurds and settled with Arabs under Saddam to secure control of the oil that was the source of Iraq's wealth.
Prime Minister Haidar Abadi ordered security forces ""to impose security in Kirkuk in cooperation with the population of the city and the Peshmerga"".
""We call on the Peshmerga forces to serve under the federal authority as part of the Iraqi armed forces,"" he said in a statement read out on state television.
State TV said Iraqi forces had also entered Tuz Khurmato, a flashpoint town where there had been clashes between Kurds and mainly Shi'ite Muslims of Turkmen ethnicity.
The Kurdish regional government did not initially confirm the Iraqi advances, but Rudaw, a major Kurdish TV station, reported that Peshmerga had left positions south of Kirkuk.
The ""government of Abadi bears the main responsibility for triggering war on the Kurdistan people, and will be made to pay a heavy price"", the Peshmerga command said in a statement, cited by Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani's assistant Hemin Hawrami. 
Washington works closely with both the federal forces and the Kurdish Peshmerga to fight against Islamic State.
""We call on all parties to immediately cease military action and restore calm while we continue to work with officials from the central and regional governments to reduce tensions and avoid and futher clashes,"" the U.S. embassy said.
""ISIS remains the true enemy of Iraq, and we urge all parties to remain focused on finishing the liberation of their country from this menace.""
A statement by the U.S.-led international military task force in Iraq described the clashes outside Kirkuk as a ""misunderstanding"".
Bayan Sami Rahman, the Kurdish regional government's representative in the United States, tweeted a plea for Washington to ""use (its) leadership role to prevent war"".
The action in Iraq helped spur a jump in world oil prices on Monday.[O/R]
SECESSION OPPOSED BY NEIGHBORS
Baghdad considers last month's Kurdish independence vote illegal, especially as it was held not just in the autonomous region but outside it, in Kirkuk and other areas the Kurdish Peshmerga occupied after driving out Islamic State fighters.
The Kurdish secession bid was strongly opposed by neighbors Iran and Turkey. Washington, allied with the Kurds for decades, had pleaded in vain for them to cancel the vote, arguing that it could lead to regional war and the breakup of Iraq.
Abadi's government has been under strong pressure from Iran-backed militias from Iraq's Arab Shi'ite Muslim majority to take military action to crush the Kurdish independence bid.
The government said its forces, including the elite U.S.-trained Counter Terrorism Service, had moved almost unopposed into the industrial zone just south of Kirkuk and the oil, gas, facilities located south and west of the city.
Iraqi oil industry officials said there was no disruption to production from the facilities of the North Oil Company, which is based in Kirkuk and one of the two main oil companies that together provide nearly all of Iraq's government revenue.
The city of Kirkuk itself remained under Kurdish control, 12 hours after the start of the Iraqi operation, but two routes in and out were under control of the Iraqi forces.
""We have no orders to enter the city, just to secure the surroundings,"" a military commander involved in the operation told Reuters, adding that the Kurdish forces had pulled out in an orderly manner from the position taken by the Iraqi forces.
Another military commander said: ""Kurdish leaders we consider our brothers have agreed to hand over control of North Oil and North Gas company facilities that belong to the state.""
There were signs of internal conflict among the Kurds, who have been divided for decades into two main factions, the KDP of regional government leader Barzani and the PUK of his longtime rival Jalal Talabani, who served as ceremonial Iraqi President in Baghdad from 2003-2014 and died two weeks ago.
Both parties control their own Peshmerga units. While Barzani's KDP strongly supported the independence referendum, some PUK figures were more circumspect. Monday's Peshmerga statement cited by Barzani's assistant accused a faction within the PUK of ""treason"" for assisting Baghdad's advance: ""We regret that some PUK officials helped in this plot,"" it said.
Although Iraqi officials portrayed the Kurds as retreating without a fight, Kurdish officials said Peshmerga had clashed with the ""Popular Mobilisation"", Shi'ite forces trained and armed by Iran that operate alongside regular Iraqi troops.
The Peshmerga and Popular Mobilisation exchanged artillery fire south of Kirkuk, a Kurdish security official said. The official said the Peshmerga had pushed back two assaults and destroyed several Popular Mobilisation vehicles.
The U.S.-led task force said it was aware of ""a limited exchange of fire during predawn hours"", which it believed was ""a misunderstanding and not deliberate as two elements attempted to link up under limited visibility conditions"".
FATE UNSETTLED
The status of Kirkuk and fate of the Kurds were left unsettled 14 years ago when a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam. During the years of U.S. occupation that followed, Washington leaned on its Kurdish allies to keep their ambitions in check to avoid triggering another war amid an insurgency by Sunni Arabs.
Since Islamic State fighters swept across a third of Iraq in 2014 and were finally driven out of their main Iraqi stronghold earlier this year, the Kurds have found themselves in their strongest position on the ground for generations.
Their leader Barzani said the time had come for an independence referendum. But the vote crossed a red line in the region, where countries say a unilateral redrawing of the borders can never be permitted.
Turkey, which had developed a good working relationship with the Iraqi Kurds and let the landlocked region export oil through its pipes, has swung behind Baghdad, furious at a secession bid that might ignite similar demands from its own Kurds.

1593,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 16, 2017 08:55AM ET</span>",Natural Gas Futures Start the Week on the Backfoot ,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures started the week on a downbeat note on Monday, pulling back from a two-week high, as traders reacted to forecasts showing a return to mild weather after a cold spell in the eastern U.S.
Warm high pressure will return during the second half of this week east of the Rockies through the weekend with highs of upper 60s and 70s across the northern U.S., and upper 70s to near 90°F over the southern U.S.
Bearish speculators are betting that the warmer weather will reduce early-winter demand for the heating fuel.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather weakens demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
U.S. natural gas for November delivery sank 7.5 cents, or around 2.5%, to $2.925 per million British thermal units by 8:55AM ET (1255GMT). It rose to its best level since Sept. 29 at $3.036 on Friday.
Futures saw a gain of about 4.8% last week amid a recent bump in heating demand.
Market participants started to look ahead to this week's storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 52 and 62 billion cubic feet in the week ended October 13.
That compares with a gain of 87 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 77 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 78 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.595 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is 153 billion cubic feet (bcf), or around 4.1%, lower than levels at this time a year ago and 8 bcf, or roughly 0.2%, below the five-year average for this time of year.

1595,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 16, 2017 07:30AM ET</span>",Iraq Seizes Oil Fields as Fighting Flares Over Kurds' State Push,"(Bloomberg) -- Iraqi forces advanced toward the disputed city of Kirkuk, as the government sharply intensified its efforts to stall moves toward a Kurdish state by seizing the oil fields that would underpin its economy. Crude exports from the disputed area were flowing normally on Monday.
State-run Iraqiya television said the military had also captured a refinery, a gas plant and a main road in Kirkuk, which has emerged as a flashpoint in the power struggle between the federal government in Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government. The Associated Press reported that Kurdish fighters had abandoned their positions outside Kirkuk’s airport while civilians were fleeing the city, where sporadic gunfire could be heard.
The military offensive, which Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi had vowed to avoid, follows three weeks of escalating tensions since the Kurds voted overwhelmingly in favor of statehood on Sept. 25. Iran and Turkey, both with their own restive Kurdish minorities, led regional opposition to the referendum and on Monday, Turkey’s foreign ministry issued a statement stressing the need for Iraqi unity.
It remains unclear how far Iraq’s army and its militia partners intend to advance, but the importance of Kirkuk and the complexity of the armed alliances increase the “potential for political and military miscalculations,” said Glen Ransom, Iraq analyst at Control Risks in Dubai. “The U.S. will try to de-escalate the situation to avoid compromising anti-Islamic State operations,” he said. That could lead to agreements on Kurdish withdrawals from some areas and potentially joint administration, he added.
OPEC Producer
There were conflicting reports as the Iraqi campaign began on Sunday. State television reported that Abadi had ordered Iraqi forces to impose security in Kirkuk in cooperation with Kurdish peshmerga forces, adding that government troops had captured areas in the city without a fight. The Kurdish Rudaw news service said at least seven Iraqi militiamen were killed south of Kirkuk, citing an unidentified peshmerga commander.
Iraq is the second-largest producer within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumping most of its 4.47 million barrels a day from fields in the south and shipping it from the Persian Gulf port of Basra. But with Iraq supplying about 14 percent of total OPEC production, a conflict centered in the country’s north could have an immediate impact on oil markets.
Kirkuk’s oil fields and deposits inside the adjacent Kurdish region were exporting about 600,000 barrels a day through a Kurd-controlled pipeline to Turkey, according to a person familiar with the matter, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The KRG included Kirkuk in the vote, despite competing territorial claims to the area. 
Eurasia Group estimates that Iraq taking control in Kirkuk could cut shipments by 450,000 barrels daily until the federal government repairs its own disused pipeline to Turkey or reaches a revenue-sharing deal with the Kurds.
While there was no halt to oil exports in the early stage of the military advance, the potential for disruptions sent Brent crude as much as 1.7 percent higher to $57.84 a barrel in London. The benchmark gained 2.8 percent last week.
Underscoring the potential for a regional spillover, Abadi’s office had late on Sunday accused the Kurds of deploying militants from the Turkish PKK organization, saying that was considered a declaration of war against Iraq.
The PKK has been battling for independence for Turkey’s Kurds for more than three decades, and authorities in Ankara fear Kurdish gains in Iraq and neighboring Syria could fuel further violence at home.
Kurdish Gains in Mideast Chaos Fuel Statehood Dream: QuickTake
The latest dispute between Baghdad and the KRG over the Kirkuk area flared after their combined forces routed Islamic State militants from most of northern Iraq earlier this year. Kurdish forces occupied much of Kirkuk province in June 2014 after Iraqi troops retreated ahead of the then-advancing militants. Baghdad refuses to recognize Kurdish control of the area.
“The war on ISIS is edging to an end and now the real war starts, the war between the regional powers in order to control resources and define their own areas of influence,” said Sami Nader, head of the Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs in Beirut. What’s happening in Kirkuk is not just a local Iraqi conflict but a regional race to establish new boundaries, he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil markets jumped on Monday as Iraqi forces entered the oil city of Kirkuk, taking territory from Kurdish fighters and raising concerns over exports from OPEC's second-largest producer. 
Iraq launched the operation in the multi-ethnic region on Sunday as the crisis between Baghdad and the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) escalated. Tensions have been building since the KRG voted for independence in a Sept. 25 referendum.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $58.10 per barrel at 1053 GMT, up 93 cents from the previous close. U.S. WTI crude was at $52.14 per barrel, up 69 cents. 
""The escalation in Northern Iraq is the main driver,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Carsten Fritsch told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. ""Oil supply from this region is at risk.""
The government said its troops had seized Kirkuk airport and taken control of Iraq's North Oil Company. While an Iraqi oil ministry official said oil and gas production in Kirkuk was ""proceeding normally"", and that Kurdish leaders had agreed to avoid fighting in oil and gas facilities, the action unsettled the market.
Kirkuk accounts for 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of the some 600,000 bpd of oil produced in the KRG region, and Turkey has threatened to shut a KRG-operated pipeline that goes to the Turkish port of Ceyhan at Baghdad's request.
Renewed worries over U.S. sanctions against Iran also drew attention in the market.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday refused to certify that Tehran is complying with the accord even though international inspectors say it is.
Under U.S. law, the president must certify every 90 days that Iran is complying with the deal. Congress now has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Tehran.
During the previous round of sanctions, roughly 1 million bpd of Iranian oil was cut off. Analysts said that while renewed sanctions were unlikely to curtail that level of exports again, they warned that such a move would be disruptive.
U.S. OIL RIG EXPLOSION
Cuts to U.S. drilling rigs, and an explosion overnight at an oil rig in Louisiana's Lake Pontchartrain, also boosted prices.
Drillers cut five oil rigs in the week to Oct. 13, bringing the total count to 743, the lowest since early June, Baker Hughes (N:GE) energy services firm said late on Friday. 

Oil consumption has also been strong, especially in China, where the central bank governor said on Monday that the economy is expected to grow by 7 percent in the second half of this year, defying widespread expectations for a slowdown.

SINGAPORE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asia is set to ramp up crude oil imports from the United States in late 2017 and early next year, with buyers searching out cheap supplies after hurricanes hit U.S. demand for the commodity at a time of rising production in the country. 
As many as 11 tankers, partly or fully laden with U.S. crude, are due to arrive in Asia in November, with another 12 to load oil in the United States later in October and November before sailing for Asia, according to shipping sources and data on Thomson Reuters Eikon. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude benchmark stands at its largest discount in years against the Atlantic Basin's Brent, with local appetite curbed as U.S. refineries are still pushing to get back on track in the wake of hurricanes such as Harvey.
""Between November and January, there is a very big volume of U.S. crude heading to Asia,"" said a Chinese trader who has bought 4 million barrels of medium-sour U.S. oil to arrive in December. He declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with media.
The price-spread between the two crudes had already pushed U.S. crude exports to a record 1.98 million barrels per day by late September, according to the Energy Information Administration in the United States.
Exports in the next two to three weeks could hit 2.2 million bpd, Marco Dunand, chief executive of trading house Mercuria, said last week.
That has also been driven as some Asian governments look to diversify supply sources and reduce trade surpluses with the world's top economy. India joined China, Japan and South Korea when it imported its first U.S. crude in October. 
And high premiums for Middle Eastern grades of crude are also stoking Asian appetite for U.S. supplies. 
""U.S. medium sour grades can replace most Middle East grades and the light sweets may replace some African crude,"" said the Chinese trader.
DESTINATION ASIA
The tankers to arrive in Asia in November include eight Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC), capable of carrying 2 million barrels of oil each, and three Suezmaxes that can load half that volume, according to shipping data in Eikon.
China remains the largest buyer with four tankers, followed by three to South Korea and two to India. The remaining two could head to Singapore, the data shows.
Unipec, the trading arm of Asia's largest refiner Sinopec, dominates the trade with imports set to hit 5.7 million tonnes in 2017, up from 3.6 million tonnes in the first eight months, a source familiar with the matter said. The company buys about 8 million barrels of U.S. crude on average per month, the source said. Reuters could not immediately reach the company for comment.
Another 12 tankers are provisionally chartered to load U.S. oil in October and November, the data showed.
Four of these are supertankers chartered by South Korean buyers to load Mexican and U.S. crude. The country's top refiner SK Energy [SKENGG.UL] has bought 6.5 million barrels of U.S. crude to be delivered between November and January.
Several Indian refiners have also purchased their first U.S. crude for delivery in the fourth quarter, including the country's largest refiner Indian Oil Corp.
Japan's largest refiner JXTG Holdings has provisionally chartered a VLCC to load crude in Mexico and the U.S. Gulf in November. The company declined to comment on individual trades.

Prices jumped as much as 1.6 percent to $1,007.42 on Monday, before trading at $1,005.55 by 8:14 a.m. in London. The metal is one of this year’s best performing commodities, advancing 48 percent, more than three times the increase in gold and about 10 times the gain in its sister metal platinum.
Palladium became more expensive than platinum last month for the first time in 16 years. The latter is used to cut pollutants from diesel vehicles, which are now less popular, particularly in western Europe, after some automakers admitted to cheating in emissions tests.
Things could get worse for platinum. The European diesel-engine market share could halve by 2025, potentially removing 300,000 to 600,000 ounces of platinum demand over the next 10 years, according to Citigroup Inc. Palladium, on the other hand, is expected to remain in deficit, although it will begin to ease over the long term, the bank says.
Citigroup (NYSE:C) sees global surpluses in platinum stretching out to 2020, while the shortfall in palladium is set to widen to more than a million ounces next year before narrowing to 750,000 ounces by 2020, the bank said.
“Despite the PGM spread inversion since the end of September, we remain favorable to palladium over the short term,” Citigroup analysts including Nell Agate wrote in a note dated Oct. 13. “However, ever-looming substitution risks prevent an outright bullish view on palladium over the long-term.”
United Overseas Bank Ltd. said last week that it expects growing demand for gasoline emission-control devices to support palladium and continue to fuel outperformance over platinum.
European car sales growth accelerated in August as an expanding economy encouraged purchases and French manufacturers PSA Group and Renault SA (PA:RENA) won buyers with new SUVs and hatchbacks. Car sales are set to rise further this year as manufacturers offer incentives to trade in older diesel cars for models meeting tighter pollution standards amid German government pressure stemming from Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG’s emissions-cheating scandal.

The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
The cartel's next meeting is set for November 30 in Vienna.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Kurdish Peshmerga fighters rejected a warning from an Iraqi paramilitary force to withdraw from a strategic junction south of Kirkuk, which controls the access to some of the region's main oilfields, a Kurdish security official said on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an Iranian military official arrived in Iraq's Kurdistan region for talks on the growing crisis between the Kurdish authorities and the Iraqi government following last month's Kurdish independence referendum.
Major General Qassem Soleimani is the commander of foreign operations for Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards who provide training and guns to Iraqi paramilitary groups backing the Shi'ite-led government in Baghdad, known as Popular Mobilization.
The top Kurdish leadership met on Sunday to discuss the crisis and rejected the Iraqi government's demand that it cancels the outcome of the independence referendum as a precondition for talks to resolve the dispute.
The vote delivered an overwhelming 'Yes' for independence.
The meeting was attended by Kurdistan Regional Government President Masoud Barzani, Iraqi President Fuad Masum, a Kurd who hold a largely ceremonial position in the Iraqi federal state, and Hero Talabani, the widow of Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani who died this month, a Barzani aide said.
They rejected what they described as ""military threats"" and pledged to defend Kurdish-held territory in case of an attack. 
Popular Mobilization had given the Peshmerga until midnight local time (2100 GMT Saturday) to leave a position north of the Maktab Khalid junction, a security official from the Kurdistan Regional Government said. 
Ali al-Hussaini, a spokesman for the paramilitary groups known as Hashid Shaabi in Arabic, told Reuters the deadline had expired without giving indications about their next move. ""We are waiting for new orders. No extension is expected,"" he said. 
The Kurdish position north of the junction controls the access to an important airbase and Bai Hassan, one of the region's main crude oil fields, the KRG official said. 
The city, the airbase and their immediate surroundings, including the oilfields, are under Kurdish control.
There were no clashes reported 17 hours after the deadline but tension remained high with both sides mobilized.
KURDS SEE IRAQI ""THREATS""
The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Shi'ite-led central government in Baghdad are at loggerheads since the Sept. 25 vote and its loud call for Kurdish independence.
Kurdish authorities said on Friday they had sent thousands more troops to Kirkuk to confront Iraqi ""threats."" Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has repeatedly denied any plans to attack the Kurds. 
Popular Mobilization is a separate force from the regular army and officially reports to Abadi. It is deployed alongside the army south and west of Kirkuk.
Kirkuk, a city of more than one million people, lies just outside KRG territory but Peshmerga forces were stationed there in 2014 when Iraqi security forces collapsed in the face of an Islamic State onslaught. The Peshmerga deployment prevented Kirkuk's oilfields from falling into jihadist hands.
The Baghdad central government has taken a series of steps to isolate the autonomous Kurdish region since its vote for independence, including banning international flights in and out.
Baghdad's tough line, ruling out talks sought by the Kurds unless they renounce the breakaway move, is backed by neighbors Turkey and Iran - both with their own sizeable Kurdish minorities, and in Turkey's case, a long-running Kurdish insurgency.
In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday the situation had the full attention of the United States, which was working to ensure it does not escalate.

The United States has taken the side of the Iraqi government in refusing to recognize the validity of the referendum.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Kurdish authorities said on Friday they had sent thousands more troops to Kirkuk to confront ""threats"" of Iraqi military attack, but also slightly pulled back defense lines around the disputed oil-producing area to ease tensions.
The Baghdad central government has taken a series of steps to isolate the autonomous Kurdish region since its overwhelming vote for independence in a Sept. 25 referendum, including banning international flights from going there.
Baghdad's tough line, ruling out talks sought by the Kurds unless they renounce the breakaway move, is backed by neighbors Turkey and Iran - both with their own sizable Kurdish minorities, and in Turkey's case, a long-running Kurdish insurgency.
Tens of thousands of Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers have been stationed in and around Kirkuk for some time and another 6,000 have arrived since Thursday, Kosrat Rasul, vice president in the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), said.
In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday the situation had the full attention of the United States, which was working to ensure it does not escalate.
""We can't turn on each other right now. We don't want this to go to a shooting situation,"" Mattis said. ""These are issues that are longstanding in some cases ... We're going to have to recalibrate and move these back to a way (in which) we solve them politically and work them out with compromised solutions."" 
The KRG's Security Council expressed alarm late on Thursday at what it called a significant Iraqi military buildup south of Kirkuk, ""including tanks, artillery, Humvees and mortars.""""These forces are approximately 3 km (1.9 miles) from Peshmerga forces. Intelligence shows intentions to take over nearby oilfields, airport and military base,"" it said in a statement. 
Kurdish security sources later said that the Peshmerga had shifted their defense lines by 3 km (1.9 miles) to 10 km south of Kirkuk to reduce the risk of clashes with Iraqi forces, which then moved into some of the vacated positions without incident. 
The area from which the Peshmerga withdrew is populated mainly by Shi'ite Muslim Turkmen, many of whom are loyal to the Shi'ite led-government in Baghdad and affiliated with Iranian-backed political parties and paramilitary groups.
An Iraqi military spokesman said military movements near Kirkuk aimed only to ""inspect and secure"" the nearby region of Hawija recaptured from Islamic State militants a week ago.
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has repeatedly denied any plans to go further and actually attack the territory.
Kirkuk, a city of more than one million people, lies just outside KRG territory but Peshmerga forces deployed there in 2014 when Iraqi security forces collapsed in the face of an Islamic State onslaught. The Peshmerga deployment prevented Kirkuk's oilfields from falling into jihadist hands.
KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani urged the United States, the European Union and the U.N. Security Council ""to rapidly intervene to prevent a new war.""
Germany, which traditionally has good relations with both Baghdad and the KRG, called for measures to defuse tensions.
""We would like to ask them to meet those responsibilities and not to escalate the conflict,"" German government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters in Berlin.
President Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman said on Thursday Ankara would gradually close border crossings with northern Iraq in coordination with the central Iraqi government and Iran.

Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim is expected in Baghdad on Sunday for talks with Abadi.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. power firm Vistra Energy Corp said on Friday that it would shut two coal-fired plants for economic reasons, as closures in the industry continue apace despite the environment regulator saying this week he wanted to end the ""war on coal.""
Vistra's (N:VST) subsidiary Luminant will close two Texas power plants, it said in a statement on Friday. The announcement came just a week after Luminant revealed the closure of a further Texas plant.
Together the three plants will remove more than 4,200 megawatts (MW) of coal-generated power, enough to supply electricity to more than four million homes. 
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said on Tuesday he wanted to ease pressure on the coal industry by scrapping a package of rules put in place under President Barack Obama, known collectively as the Clean Power Plan.
The plan had sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants through a series of emissions caps. Fossil fuel companies and some states have said the regulations were too onerous and the plan was halted before it came into effect by the Supreme Court. 
But the new closures show regulation is not the only pressure on coal. Cheap gas from record shale production over the past decade has made some older coal plants uneconomic, especially those that require costly upgrades to meet increasingly strict environmental rules, often imposed by states.
EPA officials had no immediate comment.
""It's ironic that this news comes the same week the Trump administration chose to roll back the Clean Power rule that would have reduced power plant climate-altering pollution,"" said Ilan Levin, Texas Director of anti-pollution pressure group the Environmental Integrity Project, in a statement on Friday.
The capacity of U.S. coal plants expected to shut in 2018 is now more than 13,600 MW compared with an expected 7,600 MW in 2017 and almost 13,000 MW in 2016. In 2015, power companies shut almost 18,000 MW of coal-fired generation, the most in any year.
Coal served as the primary fuel source for U.S. power plants for a century, but its use has been declining since a peak in 2007, around the same time drillers started pulling gas out of shale formations.

Gas became the leading power plant fuel in 2016 when the amount of coal used to produce electricity fell to its lowest level since 1982, according to federal data.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for November delivery rose 1.7% to settle at $51.45 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 63 cents to trade at $56.88 a barrel.
Chinese crude imports rose by roughly 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to 9 million bpd in September, data showed on Friday. That eased investor concerns that global demand is set to weaken over the next year. 
The International Agency Energy (EIA) on Thursday suggested that global demand for oil in 2018 could come under pressure forecasting demand for Opec oil to fall to 32.5 million bpd next year – roughly 150,000 bpd lower than the group pumped last month. 
Also supporting an uptick in crude oil prices were concerns that political uncertainty in Iran and Iraq could lead to supply disruptions. 
As was expected, President Donald Trump on Friday decided against certifying the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, raising the risk of doing business in the Middle Eastern nation. 
Under the agreement, Iran agreed to restrict its nuclear programme for at least 10 years in exchange for lighter economic sanctions that had crippled its economy. 
Meanwhile, investors continued to monitor ongoing unrest in Iraq as the fallout over an independence referendum in Iraq’s Kurdistan region threatens to disrupt the operation of a pipeline that carries 500,000-600,000 barrels of crude per day. 
In the U.S., oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said Friday its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the United States fell by 5 to 743.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand."

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $6.86, or 0.54%, to $1,303.40 a troy ounce.
Gold prices were on track to snap a four-week losing streak befitting from a weaker dollar and a dip in treasury yields amid data showing inflation remained subdued last month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices firmed on Friday as bullish news from strong Chinese oil imports to turmoil in the Middle East put Brent on track for a nearly 3 percent weekly gain. 
The developments added to other signs that the market was finally rebalancing after years of excess, but analysts warned that the 2018 balance was still shaky. 
Brent (LCOc1) was at $57.20 at 1335 GMT, up 95 cents. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) was at $51.44 per barrel, up 84 cents from its last settlement. 
The contracts were on track for weekly gains of more than 2 percent and 4 percent, respectively. 
Chinese oil imports hit 9 million barrels per day (bpd) in September, data showed on Friday. Imports averaged 8.5 million bpd between January and September, solidifying China's position as the world's biggest oil importer.
""We woke up with the strong data from China. That's on the supportive side,"" said Olivier Jakob, managing director of oil consultancy PetroMatrix. 
China's huge imports have been strongly driven by purchases for its strategic petroleum reserves (SPR). 
The nation has spent around $24 billion on building its crude reserves since 2015 and now holds around 850 million barrels of oil in inventory, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Unrest in Iraq, and possible U.S. action on the Iran nuclear deal, also underpinned prices. 
On Friday, local television reported that tens of thousands of Kurdish fighters had deployed in the Kirkuk oil region to confront possible ""threats"" from Iraqi forces.
Tensions between the two, which traders fear could impinge on oil exports from the region, have been building since Iraq's Kurds overwhelmingly backed independence in a Sept. 25 vote. 
Later on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce that he will not certify the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The deal has to be re-certified every 90 days and is due for renewal on Sunday.
The step would give the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to impose sanctions, but Iran's parliament speaker told the TASS news agency that decertification would ""be the end"" of the deal and cause ""global chaos"".
""U.S. sanctions could cut off a lot of Iranian oil trade finance,"" Jeff Brown, president of energy consultancy FGE, told Reuters this week.
Despite the bullish signals, analysts warned that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries needed to extend its agreement to reduce oil output beyond its current March 2018 expiry date in order to clear stocks.
OPEC, with other producers including Russia, has agreed to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd.

""OPEC-led cuts have breathed new life into oil bulls but unless the organization digs deeper, the drawdown in global oil stockpiles will soon fizzle out,"" broker PVM's Stephen Brennock wrote.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 92 cents, or around 1.77% at $50.38 a barrel by 11:05 a.m. ET (15:05 GMT), off Wednesday's more than one-week highs of $51.41. Prices were at around $50.27 prior to the release of the inventory data.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S. lost 82 cents or about 1.44% to $56.12 a barrel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 2.75 million barrels in the week ended October 6.
Market analysts' expected a decline of around 1.99 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Wednesday reported an unexpected supply-increase of 3.1 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, increased by 1.32 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories rose by 2.5 million barrels, compared to expectations for a decline of 480,000 barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a fall of 1,5 million barrels.
The commodity had strengthened earlier in the week, after Saudi Arabia announced plans on Monday to cut monthly exports in November.
The move is part of ongoing efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with other producers, including Russia, to curb oversupply and stabilize prices by cutting output in a deal which is due to expire in March 2018.
In its monthly report released on Wednesday, OPEC indicated that market rebalancing will continue amid forecasts that global oil demand will rise by around 30,000 barrels a day for this year and 2018.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday as U.S. fuel inventories rose despite efforts by OPEC to cut production.
Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was down 75 cents at $56.19 a barrel by 1340 GMT. U.S. light crude (CLc1) was $1.00 lower at $50.30. Both benchmarks have risen more than 20 percent from their lows in June as world oil markets tightened.
U.S. crude stocks rose by 3.1 million to 468.5 million barrels last week, according to the American Petroleum Institute. 
Official U.S. inventory data was due to be published later on Thursday by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, agreed last year to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to prop up prices.
The cuts have helped deplete global fuel inventories, but stocks are still high and well above the five-year average, a target that OPEC has said it wants to reach in order to balance the market.
High U.S. production is pushing increasing volumes of U.S. crude into world markets, feeding inventories and undermining OPEC's efforts to tighten the market .
The International Energy Agency said on Thursday demand for OPEC oil would be 32.5 million bpd next year - around 150,000 bpd lower than the group pumped last month. 
Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt, said the tone of the IEA report was bearish because it suggested that demand for OPEC crude next year would not be sufficient to absorb all the available supplies.
""This means OPEC must deepen its production cuts to finish its job of bringing oil stocks back to the five-year average,"" Fritsch said.
The OPEC-led deal helped lift oil from below $30 a barrel early last year. But traders say supplies remain ample and OPEC is widely expected to extend its cuts beyond the current expiry date of end-March 2018.
""There is little doubt that leading producers have re-committed to do whatever it takes to underpin the market,"" the IEA said in a report on Thursday.
Many analysts expect Brent to stay between $50 and $60 a barrel as long as global markets stay balanced.
""Our updated global supply-demand balance ... shows peak stock draws in 3Q17,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note to clients.

The U.S. bank said oil supply and demand fundamentals meant it expected Brent to average $58 a barrel in 2018.

 Comex gold futures were up $5.71 or about 0.44% at $1,294.71 a troy ounce by 09:00 a.m. ET (13:00 GMT), after rising to a two-week peak of $1,299.85 earlier in the day.
The greenback strengthened after the U.S. Department of Labor reported on Thursday that initial jobless claims fell more than expected to 243,000 last week.
A separate report showed that producer prices increased 0.4% in September, in line with expectations. Core producer prices, which exclude food and energy also rose 0.4%, beating expectations for a 0.2% uptick.
The data came a day after the minutes of the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting showed that policymakers remain divided on inflation.
Several policymakers believe additional tightening will depend on upcoming inflation data. However, most Fed members said they feel another rate increase this year ""was likely to be warranted,"" the report showed.
Market participants were now looking ahead to the highly-anticipated U.S. consumer price inflation data set to be released on Friday.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.22% at 92.96, a two-week trough of 92.64 hit earlier in the day.
Gold is sensitive to moves in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2017 04:56AM ET</span>","Global oil market seen balanced in 2018, even with rising output: IEA","By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - Global supply and demand for crude oil will be largely balanced next year, as growth in consumption helps erode a three-year-old overhang of unused fuel and should mostly offset a steep rise in output, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday.
In its monthly oil market report, the Paris-based IEA said it continues to see global demand for crude growing by 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, before moderating to 1.4 million bpd in 2018.
""Looking into 2018, we see that three quarters out of four will be roughly balanced -- again using an assumption of unchanged OPEC production, and based on normal weather conditions,"" the agency said.
""Taking 2018 as a whole, oil demand and non-OPEC production will grow by roughly the same volume and it is this current outlook that might act as the ceiling for aspirations of higher oil prices."" 
Commercial oil stocks likely fell in the third quarter of this year, only the second draw since the crude price crashed in 2014, thanks to a drop in the amount of oil held in floating storage or in transit, the IEA said.
Commercial stocks in industrialized countries fell in August by 14.2 million barrels to 3.015 billion barrels, leaving a surplus of 170 million barrels above the five-year average, the IEA said.
However, the IEA said its numbers implied a build of up to 800,000 bpd could take place in the first quarter of next year, meaning the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners cannot afford a slip in adherence to their supply-restraint deal. 
""WHATEVER IT TAKES""
OPEC supply was little changed in September at 32.65 million bpd, but down 400,000 bpd from a year earlier, meaning the group's compliance with its self-imposed 1.2-million bpd output cut stood at 88 percent last month and 86 percent for the year to date, the IEA said.
Together with its partners, which include Russia, Oman and Kazakhstan, the group has agreed to restrain output by 1.8 million bpd until March next year.
""There is little doubt that leading producers have re-committed to do whatever it takes to underpin the market and to support the long process of rebalancing,"" the agency said.
""A lot has been achieved towards stabilizing the market, but to build on this success in 2018 will require continued discipline.""
The IEA said it expects demand for OPEC's crude to rise to 32.98 million bpd in the fourth quarter of this year, above September's output, and then to fall to 31.87 million bpd in the first three months of 2018. 
The IEA said it sees non-OPEC crude supply rising by 700,000 bpd in 2017, and by 1.5 million in 2018 to reach 59.6 million bpd, with the United States being the largest contributor.
""Production likely rebounded in the North Sea and in Brazil, while the continued ramp-up of production from new fields in Kazakhstan, Ghana and Congo also contributed. At 57.9 million bpd, total non-OPEC output stood 975,000 bpd above a year earlier,"" the agency said.
U.S. crude production, aided in large part by resurgent shale output, grew by 550,000 bpd in July compared with a year earlier to 9.24 million bpd, its highest since November 2015.
The impact of Hurricane Harvey, which hit the U.S. Gulf Coast in late August, is expected to have curtailed production in August and September. 

But for 2017 as a whole, the IEA expects U.S. crude output to grow by 470,000 bpd and by 1.1 million bpd in 2018.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2017 08:30PM ET</span>",Trump resists pressure to soften stance on Iran nuclear deal,"By Steve Holland and John Walcott
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump finds himself under immense pressure as he considers de-certifying the international nuclear deal with Iran, a move that would ignore warnings from inside and outside his administration that to do so would risk undermining U.S. credibility.
Trump is expected to unveil a broad strategy on confronting Iran this week, likely on Friday. There was always the chance he could still have a last-minute change of heart and certify Iran's compliance with the 2015 accord, which he has called an ""embarrassment"" and the ""worst deal ever negotiated.""
Senior U.S. officials, European allies and prominent U.S. lawmakers have told Trump that refusing to certify the deal would leave the U.S. isolated, concede the diplomatic high ground to Tehran, and ultimately risk the unraveling of the agreement.
Signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union and Iran, the deal relieved sanctions on Tehran in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons program.
After Trump made clear three months ago he would not certify Iran's compliance, his advisers moved to give him options to consider, a senior administration official said.
""They came up with a plan that protects the things they are concerned about but doesn't recertify, which the president made clear he was not going to do. That ship has sailed,"" according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The official said Trump has been telling foreign leaders and U.S. lawmakers that his refusal to certify the Iran deal would not blow it up.
""He's not walking away from it. The chances of him walking away from it go down if they work with him on making it better,"" the official said.
White House officials said Trump is expected to announce a broad, more confrontational policy toward Iran directed at curbing its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and financial and military support for Hezbollah and other extremist groups.
Trump has said he believes the nuclear deal is too generous toward Iran and would not stop it from trying to develop a nuclear weapon. 
He has criticized the agreement's ""sunset clauses,"" under which some restrictions on Iran's nuclear program would expire over time. He also wants to toughen language on ballistic missiles and inspections. The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran is complying with the agreement.
NO RENEGOTIATION
European officials have categorically ruled out renegotiating the deal, but have said they share Trump's concerns over Iran's destabilizing influence in the Middle East.
Several diplomats have said Europe would be ready to discuss sanctioning Iran's ballistic missile tests and forming a strategy to curb Iran's influence in the region.
Officials have also said there could be room to open a new negotiation for what happens once some of the core terms of the deal begin expiring in 2025, although there is no reason to believe Iran would be ready to enter in such a negotiation. Iran has said it may exit the deal if the U.S. withdraws.
De-certifying would not withdraw the United States from the deal but it would give the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose the sanctions on Tehran that were suspended under the agreement.
One U.S. official involved in administration said that declining to certify Iran's compliance would probably leave all of the parties to the deal on one side and the United States on the other.
""That means that while the French and others are also interested in curbing Iran's destabilizing activities, they may be less likely to follow (the U.S.) lead at the risk of the agreement blowing up,"" the official said.
British Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron both spoke to Trump this week to express their concerns about the potential decision not to recertify the Iran deal.
""If the feeling is that the United States no longer supports the agreement, then the political reality is that the agreement will be in serious jeopardy and its implementation will be very difficult,"" a senior French diplomat said.
Two other U.S. officials, who also requested anonymity, said Trump's bellicose rhetoric on a number of fronts is troubling both many of his own aides and some of America's closest allies, a few of whom have asked U.S. officials privately if Trump's real objective is attacking Iran's nuclear facilities.
One of the officials said that like the heated rhetoric with North Korea on its nuclear program, the Iran discussion has vexed White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson ""who have tried to advise the President that there are significant risks in the course he'd prefer to pursue.""
""At the end of the day, though, everyone recognizes that he's the decider.""
Trump allies who oppose the deal have watched the president closely to see if he might buckle under pressure.

""He's not going to re-certify,"" said Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump national security aide. ""I'm not worried. His gut instinct is absolutely right.""

But an Iraqi military spokesman denied any attack on Kurdish forces was planned and said that government troops were instead preparing to oust Islamic State militants from a border area with Syria in the west of Iraq.
Tensions between the KRG and the Iraqi government have been running especially high since the Iraqi Kurds overwhelmingly voted for independence in a referendum last month.
The Kurdish-held multi-ethnic region of Kirkuk has emerged as a flashpoint in the crisis as it is claimed by both sides.
Iraqi forces and Shi'ite paramilitaries, known as Popular Mobilisation, are deployed south and west of Kirkuk, in areas previously under the control of Islamic State.
""We're receiving dangerous messages that Iraqi forces, including Popular Mobilisation and Federal Police, are preparing a major attack .. on Kurdistan,"" said the KRG's Security Council in a tweet confirmed by a Kurdish official.
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Oct 5 that his government wanted to avoid clashes with the Kurds, but Popular Mobilisation leaders have repeatedly threatened to oust Kurdish forces from Kirkuk.
TARGETING ISLAMIC STATE
An Iraqi military spokesman denied the KRG claim. 
""We are getting ready for the battle in al-Qaim, we're not concerned by confrontations other than with Daesh,"" he said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
The area around the border post of al-Qaim, in western Iraq, is the last Iraqi region still under the control of the militants who overran a third of the country in 2014.
Offensives are being prepared south and west of Kirkuk and north of Mosul, said the KRG's security council.
Iraqi forces captured Mosul from Islamic State in July, after a grueling nine-month U.S.-backed offensive with the participation of Kurdish Peshmerga. Kurdish forces are deployed north of the city, in an area also claimed by Baghdad. 
Abadi's government, seeking to keep the country together, has taken measures to isolate the KRG, including a ban on direct international flights to the region. Neighboring Iran and Turkey back Baghdad's stance, fearing the spread of separatism to their own Kurdish populations.
Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council issued arrest warrants on Wednesday for the chairman of the Kurdish referendum commission and two aides for ""violating a valid (Iraqi) court ruling"" banning the independence vote as against the Constitution.

Libya's goal of boosting oil production to 1.25 million bpd by year-end will be difficult to achieve, the chairman of state oil firm NOC said.
Longer term, Barclays said it expected ""a return to build mode next year"", while PVM's Stephen Brennock said the IMF viewed the economic recovery as being ""on thin ice"".
The United States is not participating in the supply cut, and its crude output has risen 10 percent this year to more than 9.5 million bpd.

Predictions of a colder winter will help spur demand for oil, the report stated.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2017 10:47AM ET</span>","OPEC again raises demand forecast for its oil, points to 2018 deficit","By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC forecast higher demand for its oil in 2018 on Wednesday and said its production-cutting deal with rival producers was getting rid of a glut, pointing to a tighter market that could move into a deficit next year.
In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said the market could find support in winter from low distillate fuel stocks and forecasts of colder weather, which would boost distillates demand for heating.
OPEC said the world would need 33.06 million barrels per day (bpd) of its crude next year, up 230,000 bpd from its previous forecast. That is its third consecutive monthly increase in the projection from its first estimate made in July.
The report illustrates growing confidence among OPEC officials that its supply cut is working. Still, OPEC is not banking on a surge in prices, saying in the report crude is expected to remain at $50 to $55 a barrel in the next year. Brent oil (LCOc1) traded higher near $57 on Wednesday.
""With the market moving into the winter season, distillate fuel supplies are notably tight, representing a change from the excess supplies seen in the last two years,"" OPEC said.
""OPEC and key non-OPEC oil producers continue to successfully drain the oil market of excess barrels.""
In a deal aimed at clearing the glut, OPEC is curbing output by about 1.2 million bpd, while Russia and other non-OPEC producers are cutting half as much, until March 2018.
The 14-country producer group said its oil output in September, as assessed by secondary sources, came in below the 2018 demand forecast, even though production climbed by about 89,000 bpd to 32.75 million bpd.
In a further sign that the supply excess is easing, OPEC said inventories in developed economies declined by 24.7 million barrels in August to 2.996 billion barrels, 171 million barrels above the five-year average. 
OPEC and its allies want to bring stocks down to the five-year average and are discussing extending their supply restraint.
HEADWINDS FOR SHALE
OPEC lowered its estimate of supply growth from non-OPEC countries next year, seeing a rise of 940,000 bpd, down 60,000 bpd from the previous forecast, due to downward revisions to Russia.
The report also cited headwinds in 2018 for an expansion of supplies in U.S. shale, such as lower drilling efficiency and cost inflation. Growth in U.S. shale three years ago contributed to the global excess OPEC's cut is now targeting.
""The supply forecast for next year will be revised downward if higher oil prices and lower costs do not materialize,"" the report said.
""Oil prices are expected to remain at $50-55 in the next year. A rise above that level would encourage U.S. oil producers to expand their drilling activities, otherwise the lower prices could lead to a reduction in their capex.""
The price expectation, given on page 45 of the 96-page report, is an assumption, not a forecast, OPEC sources said. OPEC does not issue price forecasts. 
OPEC raised its forecasts for global oil demand growth in 2017 and 2018, saying consumption would rise by 1.38 million bpd next year, 30,000 bpd more than previously thought.
The report's OPEC production figures mean compliance with the supply cut by the 11 members with output targets remains high at 98 percent, according to a Reuters calculation. 
This is up from 83 percent initially reported in August, as September's rise in overall OPEC output was led by Nigeria and Libya, which are exempt from the cut. 
Should OPEC keep pumping at September's level, the market could move into a deficit next year, the report indicates. 

Top producer Saudi Arabia told OPEC it pumped 9.973 million bpd in September, up about 22,000 bpd from August and still below its OPEC target of 10.058 million bpd.

Spanish political tensions eased after Catalan President Carles Puigdemont on Tuesday signed a document proclaiming the region's independence from Spain, but also suspended the move for the coming weeks to allow for talks with the Spanish government, averting an immediate crisis.
The Spanish government was scheduled to convene in Madrid on Wednesday to shore up its response to the Catalan independence movement.
The precious metal's losses were limited on Wednesday by a softer U.S. dollar after President Donald Trump's public feud with Tennessee Senator and fellow Republican Bob Corker sparked concerns over the vote of a major tax-code reform.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other non-member producers are cutting output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until next March to get rid of a price-sapping supply glut.
OPEC is increasingly confident that the market is rebalancing fast, helped by the cutback as well as by stronger-than-expected growth in global demand.
The chief executive of trading firm Gunvor, Torbjorn Tornqvist, also said the market was rebalancing, citing falling product stocks and crude held in floating storage clearing up.
""We don't see this market being out of balance one way or another,"" he told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit taking place this week. Overall crude stocks ""are still high,"" he added, and OPEC needed to stick to its output curbs.
Short-term price support was coming from the United States, where 85 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production, or 1.49 million bpd, was offline following Hurricane Nate, according to official figures. 
OPEC has managed record-high adherence to its supply cutting deal this year and is considering extending the deal beyond its March 2018 expiry. Some analysts have been concerned that a price recovery could tempt producers to open the taps again.
But analysts at JP Morgan said this was less of an issue, saying ""concerns that OPEC compliance would fade into the fourth quarter now appear unfounded.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Legislators in an Australian state on Tuesday blocked a proposal to raise hundreds of million of dollars in additional taxes on gold mining after the industry warned the step would spark job losses.
The Labor government in the state of Western Australia wanted to lift royalty rates on gold sales to 3.75 percent from 2.5 percent to raise nearly A$392 million ($305 million) over four years and help repair a budget weighed down by a record deficit.
But the bill was effectively killed after Liberal Party members of parliament voted to block the measure in the state's upper house.
""The notion that this increase would not have a negative impact on the sector was nonsense,"" said Ian Kemish, a spokesman for Newcrest Mining Ltd, which employs 1,550 workers at its Telfer mine in the state. 
Miners in the world's second-biggest gold mining nation pumped money into large advertising campaigns against the plan, similar to strategies used against past mining taxes. The Chamber of Minerals and Energy released analysis last week claiming the increase threatened up to 3,000 jobs.
Proponents of the increase countered that mining companies were highly profitable based on today's gold prices of around A$1,650 per ounce.
The state last year accounted for about 80 percent of the 287 tonnes of gold mined in Australia, receiving A$250 million in royalty payments.
After the global financial crisis of 2008, a mining frenzy spurred by demand for Australian ores had miners rushing to fill orders. As companies spent billions on new mines and transport infrastructure, politicians took to calling the state the economic engine of the nation.
But cooling growth in China helped turn the boom to bust, leading to massive layoffs and a dramatic drop in state revenue.

""We urge our friends, in the shale basins of North America to take this shared responsibility with all seriousness it deserves, as one of the key lessons learnt from the current unique supply-driven cycle,"" said Barkindo.
The comments by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries official came during a speech delivered at the India Energy Forum organized by CERAWeek in New Delhi.
""At the moment we (OPEC and independent U.S. producers) both agreed that we have a shared responsibility in maintaining stability because they are also not insulated from the impact of this downturn,"" Barkindo said, referring to a slide in oil prices that spurred OPEC to agree production cuts late last year.
""The call by independents themselves (is) that we need to continue this interaction,"" he said.
While OPEC and some other producers, including Russia have cut supplies this year in order to prop up prices, U.S. production has soared by almost 10 percent this year, driven largely by shale drillers. Barkindo said he hoped that new producers, not just U.S. shale drillers, would join production cuts.
On Monday, Saudi Arabia cut crude oil allocations for November by 560,000 barrels per day (bpd), in line with the kingdom's commitment to the supply reduction pact.
""Demand-supply is returning to rebalance through massive destocking that we have been witnessing of stocks in OECD across regions in a very massive way,"" Barkindo said later, speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the conference.
""In the past four months alone, we have seen destocking to the tune of 130 million bpd,"" he said.
The aim of the OPEC-led cut is to trim the level of oil in OECD industrialized countries compared with the five-year supply average. Barkindo said the stock overhang to the five-year average stood at 171 million barrels in August, against 338 million at the start of the year.
""The speed and pace (of destocking) has accelerated as a result of anticipated and projected demand growth in the second half of 2017 to the tune of 2 million bpd. We are witnessing a fast return to a balanced market,"" Barkindo said.
Still, on Sunday Barkindo said OPEC and other oil producers might need to take ""some extraordinary measures"" next year to rebalance the oil market.

World oil demand growth in 2017 is expected at 1.45 million barrels per day (BPD) and it should stay around 1.4 million bpd in 2018, Barkindo said. He said India's share of global oil demand is expected to rise to over 9 percent by 2040, up from 4 percent now.

1658,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 09, 2017 09:30AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco Plans `Mega Investment' in World's Top Oil Guzzler,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil giant has “mega investment” plans for the world’s fastest growing oil market, according to Saudi Arabian Oil Co.’s chief executive officer.
The company, popularly known as Saudi Aramco, plans to create a fully integrated business in India and is interested in partnering with Indian companies, including in a planned large refinery project on India’s west coast, CEO Amin Nasser said in New Delhi on Monday.
“India has all the signs of a prosperous economy that is on the move. This is a market of investment priority and not a choice anymore,” Nasser said at the Indian Energy Forum by CERAWeek. “We have a number of partners with whom we are going to have serious discussions.”
Saudi Arabia has been edged out as the top oil supplier to India amid an intensifying race among producers to retain their most-prized markets. India, which imports about 80 percent of its crude requirement, has been diversifying its sources of oil supply and is seeking more favorable terms from producers in the Middle East. It received its first oil cargo from the U.S. this month.
Saudi Aramco held talks with India’s state-owned oil companies led by Indian Oil Corp. to discuss participation in the 60 million ton a year refinery being set up in the state of Maharashtra on India’s west coast, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday at the same event.
The oil industry is pinning its hopes on India and China, together home to four of every 10 people in the world, as demand elsewhere remains weak while production stays high, keeping prices low. India’s oil demand is forecast to grow 135,000 barrels a day this year and 275,000 barrels a day in 2018, according to the International Energy Agency.
Saudi Aramco opened an office in India this week primarily to market crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas as well as to provide engineering and technical services in the country. Nasser said Aramco’s plans for India would cover oil supply, refining, marketing, renewables as well as manufacturing petrochemicals and lubricants.
India’s oil consumption surged 11 percent in 2016 to the most on record as rising income levels spurred greater use of cars, trucks and motorbikes.
“By 2040, India is likely to be among the fastest growing oil markets, with demand almost doubling to about 10 million barrels per day. Meanwhile, demand for gas is expected to more than triple over the same period,” Nasser said.

U.S. natural gas for November delivery fell to $2.835 per million British thermal units at one point, its lowest since Aug. 9, before crawling back to $2.867 by 8:35AM ET (1235GMT), little changed on the day.

Bearish speculators are betting on the warm weather reducing early-winter demand for the heating fuel.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather reduces demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.508 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 4.3% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 0.2% below the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 84 and 94 billion cubic feet in the week ended October 6.

The U.S. economy lost 33,000 jobs in September, the Labor Department reported, ending seven straight years of job growth. But the decline was driven by slower hiring due to the effects of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey.
The unemployment rate fell to 4.2%, the lowest since 2001 and average hourly earnings rose 2.9% from a year earlier.
The uptick in wage inflation bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in December.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - State-run oil giant Saudi Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] is in talks with several Indian refiners and hopes to land a joint venture deal by next year, the company's chief executive told Reuters on Sunday.
Aramco, like other major oil producers, wants to tap rising demand growth opportunities and invest in the world's third biggest consumer.
""We are hoping to land on a JV sometime,"" Aramco's CEO Amin Nasser said at India Energy Forum by Cera Week in New Delhi.
Asked if a deal could be finalised next year, he said: ""We hope so. We are in serious discussions.""
Aramco wants to buy a stake in the planned 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) refinery in India's west coast, India's oil minister said in June. 
The world's biggest oil producer is investing in refineries abroad to help lock in demand for its crude and expand its market share ahead of its initial public offering next year.
Aramco plans to float up to 5 percent of its shares in 2018 in what could be the world's largest IPO, raising as much as $100 billion. 
Nasser said Aramco is interested in investing in India's downstream sector - refining, petrochemicals and fuel retailing including lubricants.
Saudi Arabia is competing with Iraq to be India's top oil supplier, with Iraq displacing it for a fifth month in a row in August, data compiled by Reuters showed.
Earlier this year Saudi Arabia pledged billions of dollars of investment in projects in Indonesia and Malaysia to ensure long-term oil supply deals. 
The International Energy Agency estimates India's refining capacity will lag fuel demand going forward, requiring investment in new plants.
Saudi Aramco earlier on Sunday launched a new office in New Delhi as it aims to expands its presence in India.
India's oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who inaugurated Aramco's India unit, said Aramco is interested in investing in refinery projects in the Asian country and ""very soon they will come to India.""
Nasser said Aramco will increase its staff strength in India by four fold compared to now. The company which had 14 employees has now raised staff numbers to around 30.
""India by itself is an important market. The size of India's market is huge. The growth in India last year is 8 percent last year as compared to 1.5 percent globally in energy,"" Nasser said.

""We need to be here.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPEC and other oil producers may need to take ""some extraordinary measures"" next year to rebalance the oil market, the OPEC secretary-general said on Sunday.
""There is a growing consensus that ... a rebalancing process is under way. We are gradually but steadily achieving our common and noble objectives,"" Mohammad Barkindo told reporters at the India Energy Forum organized by CERAWeek in New Delhi. 
""To sustain this into next year, some extraordinary measures may have to be taken in order to restore this stability on a sustainable basis going forward,"" he said, without elaborating.
Saudi Arabia and Russia helped secure a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 rival producers to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of March 2018 in an effort to reduce a glut.
Barkindo said consultations were under way for the extension of the OPEC-led pact beyond March 2018 and that more oil producing nations may join the supply pact, possibly at the next meeting of OPEC in Vienna on Nov. 30.
He also said that Nigeria and Libya, who are exempted from the pact, ""are making progress towards full recovery"" of production, after which they could join the OPEC-led agreement.
Oil futures fell more than 2 percent on Friday, ending Brent crude's longest multi-week rally in 16 months as oversupply concerns reappeared as producers have started hedging future drilling. [O/R]
But Barkindo said he was not worried about the rise in U.S. shale oil and gas output.
""It is a big market and demand is very strong. Between the first half and second half this year, demand growth is almost about 2 million barrels (per day), which is very robust,"" he said. ""So everybody has a role to play.""
On Friday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he hoped to reach a consensus with Russia and other major oil producers on the future of the deal before November's meeting.

Falih was speaking in Moscow two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was possible that the supply reduction deal could run to the end of next year, although Russia has not made any commitment.

1672,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2017 05:23AM ET</span>",Protests test tribal authority on South Africa's platinum belt,"By Ed Stoddard
MOGALAKWENA, South Africa (Reuters) - A new power struggle is unfolding in South Africa's old homelands between global mining giants, traditional leaders and an impoverished rural populace.
Parts of an industry long used to labor unrest are now contending with community protests that have cut production of the country's largest mineral export earner, platinum, and may shut some operations down altogether.
At the heart of the conflict are tribal leaders who have royal titles and feudal-style control over the homelands, poor rural areas designated to South Africa's black majority by its former white minority rulers during apartheid.
Tribal leaders are also key allies of President Jacob Zuma, whose political base has become increasingly rural, and his African National Congress party has drafted a law that would cement their control.
But with protests spreading across the homelands, the communities, mining companies and some within the ANC itself are moving to change what they see as an anachronistic system.
The traditional leaders have acted as intermediaries with companies which have discovered chrome and coal as well as platinum in the homelands and hope to find shale gas. Many locals say they are seeing none of the proceeds.
""If they don’t give us that 175 million rand ($13 million), we are going to shut down the mine,"" said Chippa Langa, a leader of the community around the Mogalakwena platinum mine, referring to a community fund set up by Anglo American (LON:AAL) Platinum (Amplats).
To avoid such an outcome, a leading human rights lawyer is negotiating with the local royal house to allow community representatives more control over the fund. 
""We are renegotiating the agreement to make it more accountable,"" said the lawyer, Richard Spoor, whose work has included spearheading a class action suit against gold producers over the fatal lung disease silicosis which miners contract.
It is a plan that, if copied elsewhere, would dilute the power of the tribal leaders and could do the same to the ANC, which has ruled South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994.
But Spoor says he and his legal team, who are acting for the communities rather than the mine, are not undermining tradition.
""Our view is that this more democratic model is far more aligned with traditional law and custom. We don't regard the current very authoritarian top-down style of chieftanship as consistent with the traditional institution.""
Zolani Mkiva, head of presidency at Contralesa, the umbrella group for South Africa's traditional leaders, agreed that the African way is bottom up, but said what he called isolated cases involving some mining deals were giving the chiefs a bad name. 
""They tend to attract attention and create an impression that this represents the African way of leadership,"" he said.
Chris Griffith, chief executive of Amplats, a unit of Anglo American, said the company was fully behind the restructuring of the community trust and was applying the lessons learned to other deals.
""What we are trying to do is get away from some of the previous structures where we felt obliged to pay the money over to the Kgoshi (chief),"" Griffiths told Reuters, noting a new-style deal on a chrome project in February. At that project, there have been no protests so far.
LAND RIGHTS
Discontent has not been confined to Mogalakwena, the world's largest open-pit platinum mine, where Amplats says protests two years ago cost it 8,600 ounces of its annual 200,000-plus ounces of production.
Impala Platinum's Marula mine says it lost 10,000 ounces of almost 80,000 ounces of production in the last financial year to community protests that included road blocks, vehicle stonings and assaults on people reporting for work.
A nearby chrome project it set up with a tribal council - made up of a chief and his aides - has collapsed and Impala says it may soon have to close Marula, which would be the first such shutdown in South Africa linked purely to social upheaval.
Falling platinum prices have multiplied the pressure.
Implats CEO Nico Muller told Reuters the company would not change the structure itself but wanted the two sides to resolve their differences. ""The way they apply the proceeds is perceived not to benefit the broader community,"" he said.
Around Mogalakwena, set amid rust-tinged rocky outcrops in sweltering latitudes north of Johannesburg, resentment over grinding poverty runs deep.
""I never worked in the mine. I never got benefit, nothing,"" said 57-year-old Leg Phalanea as he walked down a dusty street near the mine.
The bill before parliament formalizes the current political system in the homelands with a clause allowing traditional councils to enter partnerships with any ""body or institution"". It says such deals ""must be beneficial to the community represented by such council"", but does not require consultation.
However, Richard Mdakane, an ANC MP who chairs the parliamentary committee on traditional matters, said villagers should have more say. ""We are amending many clauses that were there just to make sure that the bill allows community participation in these processes,"" he said.
Some in the ANC are seeking to go further by ending the chief's role as custodians of land now regarded as communal by giving villagers title deeds to the land they plough.
ANC Treasurer Secretary Zweli Mkhize - seen as a contender to replace Zuma as party chief at a December conference where policy positions will also be adopted - told Reuters: ""We are discussing this issue. There is a huge discussion about what kind of land tenure we need in the former homelands."" 
Tribal power is already ebbing in places such as Mogalakwena. Villagers there have agreed a new trust structure with four trustees: one from Amplats, one independent, and the other two from the royal Mapela clan, to replace a structure dominated by the tribal council.
Former chief Kgabagare Langa, who has been ousted in a dispute, said he is challenging his removal in court. The new chief, or Kgoshi, Hans Langa, said he could not comment on the restructuring as his lawyers were working on it.
Residents say they have received positive signals from the new chief's camp and Amplats' Griffith said the company was just waiting for him to settle in.
""It's clear the new Kgoshi will want to see peace in Mapela,"" said Jonathon Manamela, 53, treasurer of the Mapela Executive Committee, a community group involved in the talks. ""Our culture believes you are a king because of the people.""

1673,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 08, 2017 05:07AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices - Weekly Outlook: October 9 - 13,"Investing.com - Oil prices plunged on Friday, snapping a multi-week bull run amid renewed oversupply concerns, with investor attention shifting to a potential disruption to crude production and refining capacity in the Gulf of Mexico as Tropical Storm Nate bears down on the region.
The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) estimated that approximately 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil production had been shut-in by operators ahead of the storm, which was expected to become a hurricane by Sunday.
The U.S. Gulf is home to around 17% of the country’s crude oil production, while more than 45% of U.S. oil refining capacity is along the Gulf Coast.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures sank $1.50, or around 3%, to end at $49.29 a barrel by close of trade. It touched its lowest level since Sept. 13 at $49.10 earlier in the session.
For the week, WTI prices slumped about 5%, after posting gains in each of the last four weeks.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., tumbled $1.38, or roughly 2.5%, to settle at $55.62 a barrel, its weakest in nearly three weeks.
The global benchmark ended the week with a loss of approximately 3.5%, snapping a five-week win streak.
Prices were supported earlier in the week as traders weighed the likelihood that OPEC-led production cuts will be extended through next year in the wake of a meeting between Saudi King Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
The original deal, struck nearly a year ago between OPEC and 10 other non-OPEC countries led by Russia, was to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day for six months. The agreement was extended in May of this year for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
The cartel's next meeting is set for November 30 in Vienna.
Elsewhere, gasoline futures declined 5.2 cents, or 3.3%, to end at $1.558 on Friday. It closed down around 3% for the week.
Heating oil slumped 4.2 cents, or 2.4%, at $1.743 a gallon, ending roughly 3.8% lower for the week.
Natural gas futures lost 6.0 cents, or 2%, to settle at $2.863 per million British thermal units. It saw a weekly drop of nearly 5%.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Wednesday and Thursday to further weigh what the impact of recent storm activity was on supply and demand.
The reports come out one day later than usual due to the U.S. Columbus Day holiday on Monday.
Oil traders will also focus on monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency to assess global oil supply and demand levels.
The data will give traders a better picture of whether a global rebalancing is taking place in the oil market.
The market is also waiting on President Donald Trump’s decision on Thursday on whether or not to certify Iran’s compliance with the international nuclear deal. The Persian nation is an OPEC member and key Middle Eastern oil producer.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.

1674,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2017 07:20PM ET</span>",Gas trucks boom in China as government curbs diesel in war on smog,"By Chen Aizhu
YUTIAN, China (Reuters) - On a recent morning in Yutian, a dusty town bisected by the highway that connects Beijing to the sea, Su Meiquan strolled into a dealership packed with hulking trucks and prepared to drive off with a brand new rig.
After years of driving a diesel truck for a trucking company, he had decided to buy his own vehicle – a bright red rig fueled with liquefied natural gas, capable of hauling as much as 40 tonnes of loads like steel or slabs of marble.
Su hopes the LNG truck - less polluting and cheaper to operate than diesel ones - will be the cornerstone of his own business, plying the route to the western fringes of China.
""Everybody says gas is cleaner with nearly no emissions,"" he said after signing a stack of paperwork in the dealer's office. In front of him, photos of proud drivers posing in front of their own new LNG trucks had been taped to the wall.
Sales of large LNG trucks are expected to hit record levels in China this year as the government steps up an anti-pollution campaign that includes curbs on heavy-duty diesel vehicles.
LNG trucks account for about four percent of the more than six million heavy vehicles able to haul 40 to 49 tonnes of goods that are currently on China's roads. The vast majority of the 43 billion tonnes of freight transported across China last year was by highway.
But demand for LNG trucks is soaring as companies and manufacturers shift to vehicles that run on the gas that Beijing sees as a key part of its war against smog.
Sales of LNG heavy trucks surged 540 percent to nearly 39,000 in the first seven months of the year, according to Cassie Liu, a truck analyst with the IHS Markit consultancy.
That was partly fueled by a ban this year on the use of diesel trucks to transport coal at northern ports in provinces like Hebei and Shandong, and in the city of Tianjin.
""We are seeing a blowout in LNG trucks this year, thanks to the government's policy push,"" said Mu Lei, marketing manager for China National Heavy Duty Truck Group [CNHTC.UL], known as Sinotruk, the country's largest manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks.
The shift to gas trucks is helping fuel demand for LNG in China, as are other government measures aimed at clearing the air, especially in the north, which is shrouded in a hazardous coal-fueled smog for much of the winter.
One major project is piping gas to 1.4 million households across the north for heating this winter, shifting away from coal. 
China, already the world's No.3 LNG consumer, has seen imports jump 45 percent so far this year. [O/CHINA7]
Chinese companies like Jereh Group and ENN Energy Holding, which build LNG filling stations, and Zhangjiagang CIMC Sanctum Cryogenic Equipment Co., Ltd, which specialises in LNG tanks, are expected to benefit from the gas boom, analysts said.
OVERLOAD, PORTS 
Government restrictions on cargo overloading last year, for safety reasons, has also driven truck sales as operators rushed to buy bigger trucks. 
Next month, Beijing will also impose restrictions on thousands of northern factories using diesel trucks, forcing many to use more rail and others to consider gas-powered lorries.
Sales of new heavy-duty trucks, including diesel and LNG vehicles, jumped 75 percent in the January-August period to 768,214, according to industry website www.chinatruck.org. 
It did not break down the numbers, but companies say that diesel growth is being dwarfed by that of the LNG trucks.
Last week, Sinotruk netted new orders for 1,371 heavy-duty trucks, 900 of which run on LNG, at an event bringing together coal transport companies from seven northern Chinese cities, Mu said. In the first half of this year, Sinotruk sold 5,200 LNG trucks, up 650 percent year on year.
""Gas trucks are both more environmentally friendly and more economic,"" said Lai Wei, general manager of Tianjin Shengteng Transport Company, a privately-run trucking company. 
Lai is tripling his LNG fleet to more than 100 by the end of this year, adding 65 new trucks made by Shaanxi Heavy Duty Automobile Co. Ltd [WCPOWA.UL], the country's largest LNG vehicle producer.
He is also cutting back his diesel fleet to 30 from 50 previously because of the new emissions rules in Tianjin that come into effect this month.
Only vehicles meeting ""National Five"" emissions standards, similar to Euro V standards for trucks and buses in Europe, will be allowed to operate at the port.
Lai said he was also concerned that there might be further restrictions on diesel trucks in a few years. 
CLEANER, CHEAPER 
China, the world's top energy guzzler, wants gas, which emits half the carbon dioxide as that of burning coal, to supply 15 percent of energy demand by 2030, up from 6 percent currently.
That effort stalled in 2014 as an oil price slump lifted demand for diesel. But as oil prices have risen in the past 20 months, rebounding to above $50, LNG sales, especially from Australia and the United States, have soared.[O/CHINA7]
Diesel costs between 10-30 percent more than gas on average currently at Chinese gas stations, according to truck companies.
For Su, the new truck owner in Yutian, about 140 kilometers to the east of Beijing, price is a major reason for making the switch from diesel.
He plans to hire two drivers to shuttle the 3,500 kilometers between Yutian and Urumqi, in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, to carry steel products west and coal or other goods on the way back.
""It really suits our journeys as the longer the trip, the more you save on fuel on an LNG truck,"" he said. He is paying 390,000 yuan for a Sinotruk rig, about 60,000 yuan more than a diesel truck would have cost.
""On a return trip, we can save 3,000 yuan in fuel,"" he added. ""That means we'll be able to recoup within a year the extra cost on the vehicle.""

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Hurricane Nate had curtailed 92 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output and up to 3 percent of refining capacity on Saturday as it sped toward energy facilities in the central U.S. Gulf Coast that largely were spared by Hurricane Harvey's wrath nearly six weeks ago. 
The fast-moving storm has forced evacuations at more than 300 U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore platforms, far more than the number affected by Harvey, which packed more of a punch when it hit the Texas coast. 
Nate could still become a Category 2 storm, the second-weakest on a five-category scale used by meteorologists, with winds of up to 110 miles per hour (177 kph) before landfall later on Saturday, the National Hurricane Center said. 
The storm was about 50 miles (80 km) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River on Saturday afternoon and moving at 23 mph, according to the NHC. 
Its track has taken it closer to offshore production than Harvey, whose impact was greatest on refining centers. On Saturday, some 1.6 million barrels per day of oil and 2.48 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas output were halted by the storm, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement reported.
Colby Goatley, a meteorologist at Weather Decision Technologies Inc, said his firm is helping about 10 drilling rig operators chart a course away from Nate, which is producing waves of up to 30 feet (9.1 m) near its center.
""Rigs on the eastern side (of Nate) are racing westward to get on that more favorable side,"" he said. 
Weather Decision is expecting tropical storm-force winds to last about 12 hours, Goatley said, a relatively short period that will help offshore producers return to full operations quickly and rigs to return to their drilling sites. 
Nate is converging on refineries that remained in operation during Harvey, with Phillips 66's (N:PSX) Alliance plant,  Valero Energy  Corp's (N:VLO) Meraux facility, and PBF Energy's (N:PBF) Chalmette plant - all in Louisiana - and  Chevron  Corp's (N:CVX) plant in Pascagoula, Mississippi, all within the impact zone. 
Chevron halted production at the Pascagoula plant on Saturday, according to energy intelligence company Genscape. A Chevron spokesman declined to comment. Phillips 66 confirmed that it shut its Alliance refinery on Saturday. 
Combined, the two process 587,000 barrels per day, or 3 percent, of the nation's refining capacity. Hurricane Harvey, which brought intense rains that flooded the Texas Gulf Coast, shut nearly a quarter of U.S. oil refining capacity. 
Valero and PBF Energy were planning to keep running during Nate's passage, according to sources familiar with those operations.
An up to 11-foot (3.4-m) storm surge is expected at the mouth of the Mississippi River in the next few hours, the NHC said at 5 p.m. (0900 GMT). 

Chevron earlier had made preliminary preparations for the storm, including securing loose equipment and positioning standby generators, according to sources.

SABRATHA, Libya (Reuters) - An armed alliance involved in a three-week battle over the Libyan smuggling hub of Sabratha said on Saturday it had taken over protection of the Mellitah oil and gas terminal after expelling a rival group.
An organization called the Operations Room and its allies have been fighting the Anas al-Dabbashi brigade, a major facilitator of migrant smuggling that recently said it had changed tack and struck a deal with the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli to stop boats setting off across the Mediterranean.
The fighting killed 17 and wounded 164, Omar Abduljaleel, commander of the Operations Room, told reporters in Sabratha, a town west of the capital Tripoli.
The Dabbashi brigade had been guarding the facility west of Sabratha since 2015. It is run jointly by Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) and Italian firm Eni.
The setback for the Dabbashi brigade creates new uncertainty over the control of migrant flows from Libya. 
Since a 2016 deal between the EU and Turkey to block crossings in the Aegean, Libya has been the gateway for the vast majority of migrants trying to reach Europe by boat, and the area around Sabratha has been the most common departure point.
From July, the number of crossings dropped sharply, a change attributed to increased activity by Libya's EU-trained coastguard and to the Dabbashi brigade blocking departures in return for offers of amnesty and jobs in the security forces.
Asked whether the Operations Room would stop illegal migration, Abduljaleel said: ""God willing we will work on illegal migration after the biggest smuggler has been eliminated.""
The Dabbashi brigade has confirmed the retreat from Sabratha, where the Operations Room took reporters on a tour. Several houses in the main street had been hit by rockets or were burned out but otherwise the city was calm.
Both the Dabbashi brigade and the Operations Room, which was created last year to force Islamic State from Sabratha, have links to the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA).

Italian officials have visited Sabratha as part of efforts to block migrant flows from there.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Large protests were held across Australia on Saturday against Indian mining giant Adani Enterprises' proposed Carmichael coal mine, which would be the country's largest coal mine but has been delayed for years over environmental and financing issues.
Environment groups say the mine in Queensland state would contribute to global warming and damage the Great Barrier Reef.
The ""Stop Adani"" movement organized 45 protests.
On the sands of Sydney's Bondi Beach more than 1,000 people formed a human sign saying '#STOP ADANI', said organizer Blair Palese from activist group 350.
""I think there's a very real national concern that goes beyond Queensland about the idea of giving this mine a billion-dollar taxpayer-funded loan,"" she said.
The national rallies come as new polling shows more than half of Australians oppose the mine, reported local media.
Analysts have raised doubts about whether Adani can fund the mine, at an initial cost of $4 billion, given a global backlash to investment in fossil fuels.
Adani says the project would pay billions of dollars in royalties and taxes, create jobs and export coal to India help bring electricity to rural regions.
Adani has been counting on a A$900 million ($704 million) loan from the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) for a rail link to the proposed mine.
The company's chief executive officer Jeyakumar Janakaraj, however, has said Adani may not have to borrow from NAIF. ""If the commercial banks take off all the debt then we will not have any need for NAIF as there will be no gap.""
The Australian Conservation Foundation president Geoff Cousins, one of the country's top businessmen, said it was unlikely Adani could proceed without the NAIF loan.
""They've tried hard to secure commercial funding, but no bank will touch them,"" he said.
""Stop Adani is an issues-based campaign, and the rest of the world sees the madness of building one of the world's largest coal mines particularly when Australia has signed the Paris Agreement (on climate change).""

1679,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2017 06:45PM ET</span>","Automakers say U.S. fuel economy standards unrealistic, cite costs and consumers","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Automaker trade groups told U.S. regulators they should revise fuel efficiency mandates approved in the final weeks of the Obama administration because the costs would be onerous and the standards do not reflect how cheap gas prices are affecting consumer demand, but they stopped short of asking for a specific reduction in the requirements for 2025.
The comments to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) set up the next round in a battle between automakers and the state of California and environmental groups, which argue against any retreat from limits to greenhouse gas emissions.
Automakers want changes that would make it easier for them to comply with fuel economy standards, including flexibility in the use of a system of credits under the program.
Automakers have to meet parallel fuel economy standards overseen by the NHTSA and vehicle emissions limits regulated by the EPA. 
President Donald Trump has championed deregulation, saying it is needed to promote economic growth. In March he told auto workers, ""We are going to ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories."" 
The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co (N:GM), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and others, said the EPA understated the costs of technologies needed to meet the 2025 requirements.
The Obama administration finalized rules in 2012 to double the fleetwide average fuel economy to 54.5 mpg by 2025, but the EPA revised it to 51.4 mpg based on a rising number of trucks. The EPA said that would result in a real world average of 36 mpg by 2025, because of credits automakers receive and differences in test procedures versus real-world driving.
Automakers earn credits by producing cars and trucks that exceed the requirements in a given year -- and can then apply credits to deficits in future years. They also earn credits for air conditioning improvements, building electric vehicles and other improvements that may not be captured in testing procedures.
Automakers said the Obama administration finding that the 2025 targets were achievable at reasonable cost was based on errors in modeling the impact of new technology and assumptions about fuel prices and sales trends that have proved wrong.
Global Automakers, a group representing Honda Motor Co (T:7267),  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and others, cited shifting consumer preferences for bigger vehicles as a problem. 
""There is, simply put, a misalignment between the increasing stringency of the standards and the decreasing consumer demand for fuel efficiency,"" the group said in comments filed late Thursday with the EPA.
The two auto groups said the EPA has agreed to develop a new modeling approach after they said a prior model ""caused the agencies to overestimate the role that conventional technologies can play in achieving future"" improvements.
An EPA spokesman declined to comment on its reconsideration, saying it would review all comments.
The risk for automakers is that California, the most populous U.S. state, will withdraw from a 2012 agreement to adhere to the national EPA standard if the current standards are weakened. California's standards are followed by a dozen other states. Automakers have said it is vital to maintain one national regime for emissions regulation to avoid higher costs by having to meet two differing standards.
California on Friday said it would not budge.
“If the federal standards are relaxed despite the overwhelming body of evidence demonstrating they should continue as is, California will maintain its standards. Moreover, we will pursue all available legal remedies to overturn federal actions that are unsupported by the facts and law,” state officials said in a statement.
Environmental groups also oppose the decision to reopen the standards.

The Natural Resources Defense Council said ""automakers can meet the current standards  with known technologies at reasonable cost. ... Rolling them back, however, would increase pollution, raise costs for drivers, slow innovation and put jobs at risk.""

Crude oil prices slumped to a weekly loss for the first time in four weeks as investors braced for a potential disruption to some oil production in the Gulf of Mexico as Tropical Storm Nate is expected to arrive as a Hurricane on Sunday.
Concerns over a potential disruption in the region come amid renewed fears of an uptick in crude supplies as the wide gap between Crude and Brent prices is expected to incentivize US producers to ramp up production and exports.
Meanwhile, investors continue to monitor ongoing geopolitical uncertainty in Iraq as the fallout over an independence referendum in Iraq’s Kurdistan region threatens to disrupt supply.
The independence vote angered Iraq’s central government and neighboring countries including Turkey. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan warned last week that his country could “close the valves” on the pipeline that carries 500,000-600,000 barrels of crude per day from northern Iraq to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Oil prices fell around two percent on Friday, and were set to end Brent's longest multi-week rally in 16 months following profit taking and the return of oversupply concerns.
Benchmark Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were down $1.03 at $55.97 a barrel at 1320 GMT, set for a 1.8 percent loss on the week and snapping a five-week winning streak that was the longest since June 2016.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) was at$49.49, down $1.30 or 2.6 percent on the day. It was set to close the week down more than 4 percent, the biggest weekly loss in four months.
Russia on Friday clarified remarks made by President Vladimir Putin about the oil market earlier this week, saying he did not propose extending a global oil output cut deal but said he recognized it was a possibility.
The prospect of extended oil production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers led by Russia had supported prices in recent sessions.
Saudi Arabia's energy minister said on Thursday he was ""flexible"" about prolonging the production-curbing pact until the end of 2018.
However, concerns linger about growing U.S. crude exports, incentivised by a hefty WTI discount to Brent prices.
""We have a couple of bearish factors like a new record for U.S. crude exports, the reopening of Libya's biggest oilfield, a new year high in U.S. crude production and the recent strength of the U.S. dollar,"" said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW in Stuttgart.
A stronger dollar also led to further losses in the oil market on Friday. The dollar hit a 10-week high after data showing the largest gain in U.S. wages since December 2016 bolstered bets on an interest rate hike by year-end. 
""I expect Brent to drop below $55 a barrel and WTI below $50 in the next couple of days,"" Schallenberger said.
U.S. government data showed this week that crude exports had risen to a record of nearly 2 million barrels per day.
Investors were also wary of tropical storm Nate shutting down some oil production in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of its expected arrival in the area as a hurricane on Sunday.
""The biggest impact (from Nate) could be on gasoline prices, depending on how many refineries are forced to shut down. But I don't think we will see another bull run,"" Schallenberger said.

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 06, 2017 05:21AM ET</span>",Eni bets big on Zohr explorer finding new treasure,"By Stephen Jewkes
MILAN (Reuters) - Italian oil major Eni (MI:ENI) is betting billions on Luca Bertelli being able to achieve something he's been doing since he was nine years old: spotting things others overlook.
The geologist, who heads Eni's exploration team, began collecting rocks as a boy growing up in Tuscany, developing a curious eye that eventually led him to discover two of the world's biggest gas fields this century.
His latest success, the Zohr field off Egypt, sits in an area that Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) pored over for years before Bertelli persuaded his boss to embark on a drilling program that turned up the Mediterranean's largest gas discovery.
Now the 59-year-old and his team are under pressure to show they can keep finding treasures others have missed – this time in waters off Mexico where former state oil monopoly Pemex has been exploring for decades.
""We feel there's room for surprise, even in areas previously explored,"" Bertelli said up in his 12th-floor office in Milan, fingering a specimen of crumbly oil-rich rock from the Amoca field it won, with two other fields, in 2015.
Bertelli is a lynchpin in Eni's corporate strategy which in recent years has seen it break ranks with major rivals and ignore the rush to shale, focusing instead on eking out the world's conventional energy resources.
In recent years weakness in its ""downstream"" businesses like refining and chemicals have dragged on profits and placed more of a premium on securing success in ""upstream"" exploration.
In its new frontier Mexico, Eni has so far targeted shallow waters, close to the coast and Pemex infrastructure facilities - just the kind of target more likely to be picked over already and be on the radar of larger rivals with deeper pockets.
But Bertelli told Reuters that Eni was embarking on a ""more aggressive"" exploration program from 2018 with a special eye on Mexico where it will bid in upcoming tenders in deep and ultra-deep waters.
""We believe Mexico is one of the last major opportunities to access material oil assets in unexplored or under-explored areas,"" he said. ""There aren't many of them left.""
Drilling deepwater wells thousands of meters under the sea is far more costly and risky than exploring shallow water or shale deposits, but potential rewards are much higher. Last year Eni drilled only five deepwater wells from the 15 or so two years before when crude was double current prices.
So the pressure is now on Eni's geologists to identify the right rocks and wells - and the competition is heating up; majors including  BP  (L:BP) and Shell are also bidding for acreage in Mexican waters.
INTUITION + SUPERCOMPUTING
Eni is the first foreign oil major to drill off Mexico since the government broke up Pemex's 80-year-old monopoly in 2013.
The company has not disclosed its investment plans, but Mexico's oil regulator chief, Juan Carlos Zepeda, told Reuters its decision to fast-track Amoca would prompt spending of more than $1 billion.
Eni declined to comment on that figure but is undoubtedly betting big on Bertelli's team extending its record as the industry's most successful conventional explorer, as measured by energy consultant Wood Mackenzie.
Between 2010 and 2015, Eni's reserve replacement ratio - a key metric showing the amount of reserves added compared with the oil and gas produced - was 480 percent, excluding shale. (See graphic: http://reut.rs/2yqAptI)
That was way ahead of other majors with  Statoil  (OL:STL) in second place with 126 percent and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) third with 54 percent.
The story of how Eni discovered the giant Zohr field in 2015 offers a window into how Bertelli and his team operate; geologic intuition and experience, he said, told him there could be something there that other companies hadn't spotted.
Previous discoveries in the East Mediterranean had all been in sandstone. But it soon became clear this was not the case in Zohr, prompting a host of rivals to dismiss the site.
What Bertelli and his team saw instead were the outlines of a different kind of structure beneath a thick layer of salt and he had a hunch it could be a form of limestone - carbonate - that he had seen yielding oil and gas in fields as far flung as Kazakhstan and Venezuela.
""Intuition comes from experience,"" he said. ""In the case of Zohr we'd already seen similar geological features elsewhere.""
Then Eni's supercomputer came in. It is the third most powerful in the industry after those operated by France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Norwegian marine geophysics firm Petroleum Geo-Services, processing 8 million billion operations a second.
It recrunched imaging data hailing from the 1990s to look for signs of carbonate formation, performing the task in a matter of days rather than the months that was once needed.
""The result gave us the confidence to back up our intuition,"" said Bertelli. ""We decided to go for drilling.""
But if Eni, the seventh-biggest major by output, might have an edge in exploration, its downstream business has struggled. The consequent shift of focus away from those areas has raised concerns it might be overly exposed to oil price volatility.
Its heavy presence in Africa, with the risk associated with working in places like Libya and Nigeria, is for some another reason why the company's shares have underperformed peers like BP and Total. (See graphic: http://reut.rs/2yqQEa3)
LOW RISK = SMALL SUCCESS
A decade ago, Eni was all but washed-up as an explorer.
It was struggling to discover as much new oil and gas as it extracted each year. And its ability to run complex projects was in doubt after losing its role as sole operator of the huge Kashagan oilfield in 2008 due to delays and cost overruns.
Since then it has discovered two world-class gas fields, in Mozambique and Egypt, adding 115 trillion cubic feet of resources.
Bertelli attributes the turnaround to a strategy he helped CEO Claudio Descalzi implement – a focus on simple projects majority-owned by Eni to better control costs and time.
The decision not to chase the shale bonanza that reshaped the industry was also key. ""We found a window of opportunity in a field no longer dominated by the super-majors but by smaller independent players.""
In Mexico, Pemex has picked over much of the area, including the Cantarell field in Campeche Bay. But with its relatively small budget, it has not been able to deploy the full range of modern technology and expertise energy majors can bring to bear.
Eni originally estimated its Mexican fields held 800 million barrels, but it raised that to 1.4 billion last month. The aim now is to explore areas in deeper waters carrying greater risk.
""Lowest risk usually means very small success,"" says Woodmac head of exploration Andrew Latham. ""All exploration depends on seeing value that others miss, which requires innovation or original thinking.""
Eni will be counting above all on its chief geologist's intuition and - like all explorers - a little luck to pull off another big discovery.
Bertelli points to a map on his wall of the company's giant Mamba field off Mozambique, calling it one of a kind. Then he pauses for thought. ""But it's probably not unique,"" he adds. ""There's another one out there waiting to be found.""

Nate is expected to strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane by the time it makes landfall on the U.S. Gulf Coast on Sunday, National Hurricane Center (NHC) spokesman Dennis Feltgen said.
Costa Rica's government declared a state of emergency, closing schools and all other non-essential services while emergency officials reported three killed due to the heavy rains, including one child.
Highways were closed due to mudslides and power outages were also reported in parts of Costa Rica, where authorities deployed more than 3,500 soldiers.
In Nicaragua, three people have been reported missing and schools also shut due to the rainfall, which the Miami-based center said could be as much as 30 inches (76 cm) in some isolated areas.
At about 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Thursday Nate was about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, and about 50 miles (80 km) south-southwest of Puerto Lempira, Honduras, moving northwest at a speed of 9 mph (15 kph), the NHC said.
Nate, which had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 kph), was expected to move across northeastern Nicaragua and eastern Honduras on Thursday and enter the northwestern Caribbean Sea Thursday night.
The storm will be ""near hurricane intensity"" when it approaches the Yucatan Peninsula late on Friday, the NHC said.
Nate will dump 15 to 20 inches (38 to 51 cm) of rain over Nicaragua, and both Costa Rica and Panama were to get 5 to 10 inches (13 cm to 25 cm) of rain and 20 inches (51 cm) in some isolated areas, the NHC said.
U.S. officials from Florida to Texas told residents on Thursday to prepare for the storm. A state of emergency was declared for 29 Florida counties and the city of New Orleans.
""The threat of the impact is increasing, so folks along the northern Gulf Coast should be paying attention to this thing,"" Feltgen said.
In Mississippi, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency plans to release as a precautionary measure 40 million gallons (151 million liters) of acidic water from storage ponds at a Pascagoula waste site.
The release to a drainage bayou is intended to prevent a greater spill during the storm, the EPA said, adding there are no anticipated impacts to the environment.
Major Gulf of Mexico offshore oil producers including  Chevron  (N:CVX),  BP  plc (L:BP),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) and  Statoil  (OL:STL) were shutting in production or withdrawing personnel from their offshore Gulf platforms, they said.

About 14.6 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production and 6.4 percent of natural gas production was offline on Thursday, the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 2 percent on Thursday as signs Saudi Arabia and Russia would limit production through next year pushed the U.S. benchmark back above $50 a barrel.
The news outweighed Wednesday's U.S. data showing record U.S. exports and the return of production at a major Libyan oilfield. 
Brent futures (LCOc1) settled at $57 a barrel, up 2.2 percent, or $1.20, while U.S. crude (CLc1) rose 81 cents, or 1.6 percent, to end at $50.79.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week that a pledge by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, to cut oil output to boost prices could be extended to the end of 2018, instead of expiring in March 2018.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday that Moscow would support new countries joining the agreement to restrict oil supply.
The statement came as Saudi Arabia's King Salman visited Moscow.
""Putin and Salman will most likely reach, but not announce, an agreement to extend the OPEC/non-OPEC production deal, though with a commitment to taper the cuts,"" said Eurasia Group. 
President Donald Trump was expected to announce soon that he will decertify the landmark international deal to curb Iran's nuclear program, a senior administration official said on Thursday, in a step that could lead to renewed U.S. sanctions against Tehran and could limit Iranian sales of oil.
""It would make it difficult for barrels to be transacted through U.S. dollars,"" said Bernadette Johnson, vice president of market intelligence at Drillinginfo.com in Denver. ""A lot would continue to flow, but that's probably a million barrels that is at risk."" 
With the increase in prices to above $50, producers have started hedging more heavily, said Johnson. 
That would buffer drillers against losses if the price were to decline, which may spur more U.S. production - partially offsetting the OPEC-led deal to cut supply by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). 
Other factors also weighed on oil prices, including the return to production of Libya's Sharara oilfield on Wednesday after an armed brigade forced a two-day shutdown.
U.S. crude oil exports jumped to 1.98 million bpd last week, surpassing the 1.5 million bpd record set the previous week, the Energy Information Administration said.
The increase followed a widening of the discount for U.S. crude against Brent , making U.S. oil attractive on world markets.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia made no firm pledge on Thursday to extend a deal between OPEC, Russia and other producers on cutting supplies but said it was ""flexible"" regarding Moscow's suggestion to prolong the pact until the end of 2018.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih was speaking in a television interview a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said the supply reduction deal that is due to expire in March could run to the end of next year.
""In the kingdom, we have to keep all options open, President Putin agreed with us on this and expressed his readiness to extend until the end of 2018 if this is agreed, and if this is the best option,"" Falih told Al Arabiya television.
He said he welcomed the ""flexibility"" shown by Russia on the issue and said the Saudi government aimed to ""be flexible in leading the producing countries in and outside of OPEC to a consensus that takes the market to where we want it to be.""
Saudi Arabia and Russia helped secure a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 rival suppliers to cut output until the end of March 2018 in an effort to reduce a glut.
Oil (LCOc1) rose above $56 a barrel on Thursday, supported by expectations of an extension to the supply cut pact. But prices are still half their mid-2014 levels. 
Climbing U.S. shale production has kept a lid on price gains, but Falih said inventories were still falling.
""Shale coming in and happening again in 2018 doesn't bother me at all. The market can absorb it,"" Falih said, speaking alongside Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on a panel at an energy forum in Moscow.
""We have seen a steady reduction in inventories. We see as we enter the fourth quarter that supply is less than demand and inventories are declining around the world,"" Falih said.
Novak said he was satisfied with oil prices and Moscow would welcome other producers joining the deal to curb output.
CLOSER TIES
Falih said this week's visit by King Salman to Russia, the first by a Saudi monarch, showed the high level of mutual trust between the world's two biggest oil producers.
The two nations would continue working to stabilize the market, Salman told Putin. The king also said there were opportunities to expand economic cooperation with Russia.
Falih echoed these comments, saying: ""I see huge opportunities in front of our countries and for the business sector in both nations.""
A slew of investment agreements and memorandums of understanding (MoUs) are due to be signed during the king's trip. Plans for a $1 billion joint fund to invest in energy projects are also expected to be finalised.
Falih said MoUs would be signed with Russia's state nuclear agency Rosatom for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, alongside other deals for military industries and marine development.
State oil giant Saudi Aramco will sign several non-binding MoUs on Thursday with Russian companies Gazprom (MM:GAZP), Gazprom Neft (MM:SIBN), Sibur and Litasco.
Aramco is discussing several investment opportunities with Russian firms, Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser said.

The Russian Direct Investment Fund will sign an MoU with Aramco and the kingdom's Public Investment Fund for investments in energy services and manufacturing.

1698,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 05, 2017 02:40PM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices Settle Higher on Expectations of Output-Cut Extension,"Investing.com – Crude oil prices settled higher on Thursday as concerns over an uptick in U.S. and Libyan production were offset by talks of an extension to the Opec-led deal to curb output. 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for November delivery rose 1.6% to settle at $50.79 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 2% to trade at $56.94 a barrel.
Oil prices recovered from a 1% slump sustained from the previous session as Saudi King Salman’s visit to Moscow fuelled expectations that the two nations would discuss a possible extension to the global pact to curb output.
The uptick in expectations of an extension to supply-cut agreement deal comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the deal between Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other producers could be extended to the end of 2018.
""Putin and Salman will most likely reach, but not announce, an agreement to extend the OPEC/non-OPEC production deal, though with a commitment to taper the cuts,"" said consultancy Eurasia Group.
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8m barrels per day for a period of nine months until March 2018.
Investors weighed the possibility of an extension to the Opec-led deal against expectations that growing output in the U.S. and Libya could weigh on oil prices. 
Libya restarted its largest oil field after a gunmen forced a shutdown of the field over the weekend while U.S. production hit its highest level in more than two-years.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday that U.S. oil production hit 9.56 million barrels a day in the week ended Sept. 29, its highest level since July 2015."

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $3.18, or 0.25%, to $1,273.62 a troy ounce.
An uptick in the dollar on signs that the U.S. economy is strengthening pressured gold prices which were on track for a fourth weekly loss ahead of a nonfarm payrolls due Friday.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims fell 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 60,000 for the week ended Sept. 30, beating forecasts of a 7,000 decline.
The trade deficit — which measures the gap between what the United States imports and what it exports — narrowed to $42.4 billion in August, down $1.2 billion from July. Exports in the August were $195.3 billion, while imports came to $237.7 billion.
The duo of reports come ahead of a nonfarm payrolls update due Friday, expected to show the U.S. economy created 90,000 jobs in September.
“Gold’s bearish tones are largely due to the tightening of monetary policy,” said Adrienne Murphy, chief market analyst at AvaTrade. “A rise in the cost of borrowing, as well as tackling the balance sheet, will put a huge strain on the price of the precious metal.”
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures rose 0.20% to $16.66 a troy ounce while platinum futures tacked on 0.33% to $917.85.
Copper traded at $3.04, up 2.87% while natural gas gained by 0.24% to $2.95."
