 NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday
as data showed the first release of crude from the U.S.
petroleum reserve unexpectedly pushed up domestic inventories
last week, adding to concerns over weak economic data.
 U.S. crude inventories rose 2.3 million barrels, boosted by
the release of 2.268 million barrels of oil from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, part of a coordinated move by members of the
International Energy Agency announced in late June to cover
supply losses due to the conflict in Libya. [EIA/S]
 Jitters over the higher stockpiles piled on top of fears
about the unsettled debate on raising the U.S. debt ceiling
before an Aug. 2 deadline to avoid a disastrous default.
 Further pressure came as data showed new orders for
long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods fell unexpectedly in June,
and a gauge of business spending plans slipped.
[ID:nN1E76Q0BV]
 ""(The inventory report) was clearly a disappointment ...
although we are trading much more off of the problems of the
broader financial market and debt ceiling"", said Bill O'Grady,
chief investment strategist at Confluence Investment Management
in St. Louis, Missouri.
 U.S. crude weakened further against Brent oil, sending the
premium of Brent to U.S. futures  to above $20 a
barrel after ending below $19 on Tuesday, in spread trading,
traders said.
 U.S. crude for September delivery  fell $2.19, or 2.2
percent, to settle at $97.40 a barrel, having slid to a session
low of $97.28.
 In London, ICE September Brent  settled at $117.43,
down 85 cents, dropping from the day's high of $118.50.
 Trading volumes were light, Reuters data showed. By 2:50
p.m. EDT (1850 GMT), U.S. volume was nearly 450,000 contracts,
26 percent below the 30-day average. Brent volume was around
368,000 contracts, 24 percent below the 30-day average.
 GULF OF MEXICO STORM FEARS
 The market eyed the development of a potential tropical
cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico, home to 29 percent of U.S. oil
production, which could impact supplies. [ID:nL3E7IR2EB]
 As a precaution, Royal Dutch Shell  pulled support
personnel in its area platforms while other companies monitored
the development. No production had been shut in. [ID:nWEN6263]
 Near the close, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in its summary of
conditions across the country, said economic growth slowed in
much of the United States in June and early July, raising
doubts of a pickup in activity in the second half of the year.

 ""Should the U.S. default on its debt, the effect on the oil
markets will be bifurcated,"" said Jason Schenker, president and
chief economist of Prestige Economics LLC in Austin, Texas.
 ""For WTI (U.S. crude), prices will fall on economic growth
concerns. For Brent crude, which has a more global benchmark
status than U.S. crude, it will get support from a lower dollar

 LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Oil fell on Wednesday as
wrangling over the U.S. debt limit unnerved investors and sent
them fleeing from assets perceived to be dependent on growth. 
 Brent crude  fell 49 cents to $117.79 a barrel by
1136 GMT, U.S. oil  dropped 74 cents to $98.85, also
pressured by an industry report which showed crude stocks in the
country rose unexpectedly.	
 ""The main factor is the debt situation (in the United
States), there are fears about growth and the country's AAA
rating is under threat,"" Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets
said.	
 A Republican plan to cut the U.S. deficit faced delay and
stiff opposition on Wednesday, piling anxiety onto investors and
ordinary Americans hoping for a late compromise to avoid a
crippling debt default. 
 Analysts polled by Reuters expect the U.S. will probably
lose its top-notch AAA credit rating from at least one major
rating agency, believing the wrangling over the debt ceiling has
already damaged the economy. 
 Also weighing on the price outlook for oil, crude stocks
rose by 4 million barrels confounding analysts' expectations for
a 1.7 million-barrel draw in a Reuters poll. 
 Analysts said this pointed to further potential weakness for
crude as it is often a pointer for data for the more closely
followed U.S. Energy Information Administration, which is due
out at 1430 GMT.	
 ""Over the past 12 months, there have been only 15 weeks in
which API and DoE data pointed in different directions,""
Commerzbank said in a note. 
 ""This means that, contrary to market expectations and for
the first time in nine weeks, the official DoE figures might
also show an increase in stock levels.""	
 U.S. crude oil inventories were forecast down for the eighth
straight time last week as imports leveled off, an expanded
Reuters poll showed on Tuesday ahead of weekly inventory data. 
 Eleven of the 12 analysts polled expect a crude stockpile
draw for the week to July 22, with the average forecast coming
in at 1.7 million barrels on average, 
 Further ahead, analysts are expecting oil prices to retreat
with Brent seen falling to around $110 a barrel, pressured by
sluggish growth and debt worries, a Reuters poll showed.
 
 
 
 An unexpected rise in crude oil inventories also weighed on
prices as data from oil industry group American Petroleum
Institute showed weekly refinery operations fell.

 
 UNCERTAINTY UNNERVES 
 Deeply divided Republican and Democratic leaders in the U.S.
are scrambling to find common ground with less than a week
before the government hits its borrowing limit approved by
Congress, triggering a possible default that would roil global
markets. 
 ""Until the path to global economic growth is ascertained, it
will be difficult for oil markets to focus on much else,
Barclays Capital said in a report. ""After all, economic growth
is one of the biggest drivers of oil prices.""	
 Sovereign debt will remain a key factor capping the upside
in prices in the immediate future, the report said.	
 Debt problems in Europe, notably in Italy and Greece, while
not the main focus of investor concern on Wednesday, were also
keeping investors wary of risky assets, analysts said.	
 The dollar sank to a three-month low against a basket of
major currencies on Wednesday, though it subsequently recovered
slightly.	
 A weak dollar can support dollar-denominated oil by making
it less expensive for consumers using other currencies and by
luring yield-hungry investors to commodities markets. 
 Still, most analysts expect the debt ceiling issue to be
resolved before the deadline and oil prices to be supported by
reduced output amid growing demand from China, India and other
emerging nations.

 NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - Gold fell on Wednesday after
hitting record highs on growing fears of a U.S. default, as
technical weakness, a rallying dollar and a broad sell-off of
riskier assets prompted bullion investors to take profits.
 Gold volatility rose as trading volume hit its highest
since January and marked the second-heaviest trading day of the
year, after option investors exercised a large number of
in-the-money $1,600 calls at Tuesday's option expiry.
 In early trade, gold rose as the fate of Republican and
Democratic deficit-reduction plans remained heavily in doubt as
top lawmakers pursued a behind-the-scenes compromise to avert a
crippling U.S. debt default. [ID:nN1E76P2HJ]
 Bullion could pull back sharply if a deal to cut the U.S.
deficit dampens market fears, analysts said. The metal is up
about 9 percent in July on concerns over the euro zone debt
crisis and uncertainty ahead of the Aug. 2 deadline to raise
the $14.3 trillion U.S. debt ceiling.
 ""It was more of a technical failure combined with a
dramatic bounce of the dollar,"" said David Meger, director of
metals trading at Vision Financial Markets.
 ""The market is vulnerable to further retracement, and now
it's just a matter to see if near-term support levels hold or
we fail further from a technical perspective.""
 Spot gold  was down 0.4 percent at $1,613.05 by 2:53
p.m. EDT (1853 GMT), after rallying to a record $1,628 an
ounce. U.S. gold futures  for August delivery settled
down $1.70 an ounce at $1,615.10, after trading between
$1,608.90 and $1,628.80.
 Silver  lost 1.5 percent at $40.23 an ounce.

 Meger said bullion prices were pressured by back-and-fill,

 OPTION VOLATILITY RISES
 By 3:30 p.m. EDT, U.S. gold futures trading volume had
topped 380,000 lots, the second-highest this year after the
2011 peak of about 410,000 lots set on Jan. 27.
 The CBOE Gold ETF Volatility Index <.GVZ>, often referred
to as the ""Gold VIX"" and based on SPDR Gold Trust 
options, rallied more than 3 percent.
 Option traders said around 20,000 contracts of in-the-money
calls with strike prices near $1,600 were exercised at
Tuesday's option expiration.
 More investors are using option strategies to lock in
profits made in the underlying gold futures.
 ""The dealers are definitely buying puts and selling calls,""
COMEX gold options floor trader Jonathan Jossen said. ""When you
see these dealers are doing this ... they are looking for a
move down or just locking in their risks.""
 Sharp losses in the U.S. equity markets and industrial
commodities such as crude oil amid U.S. debt fears prompted
investors to take profits in the gold market to cover losses
elsewhere, analysts said.
 Gold's safe-haven appeal fell after the president of
Standard and Poor's, Deven Sharma, said the rating agency did
not think the United States would default. [ID:nWEN6265]
 A sharp dollar rally against the euro amid risk aversion
also increased volatility and weighed down bullion prices. The
euro came under pressure after Standard & Poor's cut Greece's
sovereign credit rating further into junk territory.
 Supply concerns underpinned gold as tens of thousands of
South African gold miners will down tools on Thursday. South
Africa is the world's fourth-largest gold producer.
 Platinum  was up 0.1 percent at $1,803 an ounce, and

 By Manash Goswami	
 SINGAPORE, July 27 (Reuters) - Oil fell on Wednesday as a
stalemate in the United States over raising the debt ceiling
dragged on, with analysts saying the wrangling had already
damaged the economy.	
 Lawmakers have one week left to hash out a deficit-cutting
plan without which Republicans in Congress have said they will
not raise the legal $14.3 trillion debt limit. That uncertainty
helped drive gold to an all-time high for the sixth time in two
weeks on Wednesday, while stock markets and base metals fell.	
 Brent  slipped 4 cents to $118.24 a barrel by 0238
GMT, after settling 34 cents higher on Tuesday. U.S. oil 
slumped 33 cents to $99.25, as an industry report showed crude
stocks in the country rose unexpectedly.	
 ""The debt saga in the U.S. is weighing on both the futures
contracts, and prices will remain rangebound till the time this
issue is resolved,"" said Victor Shum, an analyst at Purvin &
Gertz. ""Weighing on U.S. prices in particular is the increase in
crude stocks.""	
 Shum expects U.S. oil to trade between $95 and $100 and
Brent between $115 and $120 till the time the debt ceiling issue
is resolved in the world's biggest consumer.	
 
 
 Both the benchmarks are technically neutral, according to
Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. Brent will be within
$115-$120 per barrel, and is due for a fierce move, while U.S.
oil is expected to be within $97.96-$100.62 per barrel, and
needs to move out of the range before its next move can be
evaluated. 
 U.S. crude stocks rose unexpectedly last week, as refinery
operations fell, weekly data from oil industry group American
Petroleum Institute showed. Crude stocks rose by 4 million
barrels confounding analysts expectations for a 1.7
million-barrel draw in a Reuters poll. 
 
 DEBT CEILING	
 The U.S. Congress faced more uncertainty as Republican
leaders delayed action on a plan to raise the ceiling, narrowing
the chances for a deal to avert a debt default. 
 A small majority of economists -- 30 out of 53 -- said the
United States will lose its AAA credit rating from one of the
three big ratings agencies -- Standard & Poor's, Moody's or
Fitch, according to a Reuters poll that also found wrangling
over the debt ceiling has already damaged the economy.	
 ""Until the path to global economic growth is ascertained, it
will be difficult for oil markets to focus on much else,
Barclays Capital said in a report. ""After all, economic growth
is one of the biggest drivers of oil prices.""	
 Sovereign debt will remain a key factor capping the upside
in prices in the immediate future, the report said. 
 Still, most analysts expect the debt ceiling issue to be
resolved before the deadline and oil prices to rise due to
reduced output amid growing demand from China, India and other
emerging nations.	
 Libya being away from the oil market has already reduced the
OPEC's spare capacity, and concerns of disruptions from other
countries will boost prices for the rest of the year, analysts
said.	
 ""Supply tightness going forward is a reality and will
support prices at elevated levels,"" Shum said.	
 Oil prices edged up in choppy trading on Tuesday, lifted by
a weak dollar. U.S. crude briefly jumped back above $100 a
barrel to a six-week high after seesawing with Brent, testing
technical resistance and support.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, July 27 (Reuters) - Spot gold hit an all-time
high on Wednesday, for the sixth time in two weeks, as worries
grew whether the United States could avert a debt default while
its two key political parties were still locked in stalemated
talks to raise its debt ceiling.	
 Spot gold rose as high as $1,625.24, before easing to
$1,624.19 by 0709 GMT. It was up in 16 of this month's 19
trading sessions so far.	
 U.S. gold  also hit an all-time high at $1,625.8.	
 The U.S. House of Representatives decided to postpone a vote
on a plan to raise the debt ceiling until Thursday at the
earliest, narrowing the chances for a deal to avert a debt
default. 
 ""The same arguments about potential government bond fallout
are still being made,"" said a Singapore-based trader, ""but
people are on the sidelines ahead of the August deadline waiting
to see whether or not the U.S. is going to avoid a technical
default.""	
 Investors have become increasingly cautious as great
volatility is seen ahead of the Aug. 2 deadline however, he
added.	
 
 
 
 Turmoil in the currency market also helped gold attract some
interest. The dollar sank to a three-month low against a
basket of major currencies. 
 ""It's ambiguous what currencies are the so-called haven in
the middle of all the problems in the West,"" the trader said.	
 A small majority of economists polled by Reuters said the
United States would lose its top-notch AAA credit rating from at
least one major rating agency. 
 Dealers reported muted reaction on Asia's physical market to
gold's rally, as buyers and sellers alike cautiously watch the
outcome of the U.S. debt talks.	
 ""There has been some selling and very small volume of
buying, and people wait to see if the U.S. will default,"" said
Ronald Leung, physical dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong
Kong, adding that premiums for gold bars have fallen a little
from last week to 50 cents to $1.1 per ounce over spot prices.	
 Platinum group metals scored multi-month highs, tracking
strength in gold. Spot platinum hit $1,812.5, its highest
since June 13. It eased to $1,808.45, up 0.4 percent.	
 Spot palladium reached a five-month high of $842 an
ounce, and was trading at $839.97.	
 ""As gold is at such lofty levels, we might see some
substitute effect (in PGM). There is very strong potential that
platinum group metals continue to move north,"" said the
Singapore-based trader.	
 Spot palladium had risen 11.5 percent so far this month, the
second-best performer after silver, which had gained nearly 19
percent in July. Platinum lagged behind other precious metals
with a 5-percent month-to-date rise.

 NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - Gold held steady on Tuesday
after the last session's record high, as investors stayed on
the sidelines, watching the stalemate in Washington's budget
talks to avert a ratings downgrade or default.
 Selling related to an option expiration Tuesday pressured
gold prices and boosted futures volume, even as the U.S.
government appeared inching closer to a devastating default.
President Barack Obama's Democrats and Republicans were
deadlocked over competing plans to raise the debt ceiling.
 Bullion remained up nearly 8 percent in July on euro zone
debt fears and uncertainty ahead of the Aug. 2 deadline to
raise the U.S. debt ceiling. Gold could retreat if a deal to
cut long-term U.S. deficit is perceived as deflationary,
analysts said.
 ""I think gold will come back below $1,600 an ounce ... And
the upside is becoming more and more limited because of the
higher supply from scrap sales,"" said Phillip Streible, senior
market strategist with Lind Waldock, a unit of futures broker
MF Global.
 Spot gold  edged up 0.2 percent at $1,617 by 2:47
p.m. EDT (1847 GMT), after hitting a record $1,622.49 on
Monday.
 Spot silver  was up 1.1 percent at $40.74, after
hitting a two-month high of $41.05 in the previous session.
Silver hit a record $49.51 on April 28.
 Holdings in iShares Silver Trust , the world's biggest
silver ETF, rose 42.44 tonnes to 9,891.61 tonnes, their largest
gain since June 10.
 U.S. COMEX gold futures for August  settled up $4.60
an ounce at $1,616.80, trading between $1,607.80 and $1,619.
 Heavy futures trading related to the COMEX August option
expiration on Tuesday boosted trading volume to above 280,000
lots, one of the busiest sessions of the year.
 Streible said that a test downward at $1,600 an ounce is
not out of the question on Tuesday due to heavy positioning of
August call and put options near $1,600. Bullion prices should
find support near $1,580 an ounce, he said.
 On weekly charts, gold is targeting a multiyear channel top
near record $1,670 an ounce as a break above $1,610 an ounce
eliminated the downward bias toward $1,560, said BarCap
technical analysts.

 A broadly lower U.S. dollar due to investor frustration
about the debt talks failed to boost gold.
 The correlation between gold and the dollar also appears
broken, indicating gold to decouple from the U.S. currency in
the short term as the failed debt talks fanned default fears
and dimmed the greenback's prospects.
 Meanwhile, the correlation between gold and Swiss franc
strengthened to around 0.9, as both benefited from safe-haven
buying.
 GOLD COULD RETREAT ON U.S. DEAL
 Some analysts said that a deal would eventually be agreed
between Democrats and Republicans to avoid a debt default for
the world's largest economy, in a move likely to put some
short-term pressure on bullion's recent gains.
 ""How much of a correction there may be and for how long
will in large part depend on the specifics of the agreement and
whether it will be enough to support the U.S. dollar and reduce
investment demand for safe-haven instruments such as gold,""
said James Steel, HSBC chief commodity analyst.
 A small majority of economists -- 30 out of 53 -- surveyed
over the past two days said the United States will lose its AAA
credit rating from one of the three big ratings agencies --
Standard & Poor's, Moody's or Fitch, a Reuters poll found.

 By Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up in choppy
trading on Tuesday, lifted by a weak dollar while markets were
buffeted by the continued stalemate over the U.S. debt ceiling
that hemmed in Wall Street.
 U.S. crude prices briefly jumped back above $100 a barrel
to a six-week high after seesawing with Brent, testing
technical resistance and support. Before rallying near midday,
oil gave up gains near the start of open-outcry trading in New
York as U.S. stock futures turned lower ahead of a weak open.
 ""U.S. crude found support among technical traders, with
support coming in at $98. Small buyers are going in, but the
big ones are still biding their time,"" said Richard Ilczyszyn,
senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.
 Brent September crude  rose 34 cents to settle at
$118.28 a barrel, trading from $116.53 to $119.05.
 U.S. September crude  rose 39 cents to settle at
$99.59 a barrel, trading from $97.76 to $100.62 which marked
the highest since June 10. Prices for two-weeks have been
lodged between the $93.55 low on July 12 and Tuesday's intraday
peak.
 Both U.S. and Brent total crude futures trading volumes
surpassed Monday's levels, but stayed below their 30 day
averages as they have for more than a week.
 U.S. OIL INVENTORIES
 Brent crude pared losses and U.S. prices turned lower in
post-settlement trading after industry group American Petroleum
Institute's weekly report showed U.S. crude stocks jumped 4.0
million barrels last week, against expectations for a drop.
 Gasoline stocks fell 639,00 barrels and distillate
stockpiles rose 2.9 million barrels, the API said.
 Ahead of the API report, U.S crude stocks were forecast to
have fallen 1.7 million barrels, according to a Reuters survey
of analysts. [EIA/s]
 Gasoline stocks were expected to be up 400,000 barrels,
with distillates estimated to be up 1.9 million barrels.
 The government's inventory report from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration follows on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m.
EDT (1430 GMT).
 The API report's surprise crude stocks build came after a
Valero Energy Corp  executive told a conference call
earlier that maintenance on the Mars oil platform has cut
medium sour crude output in the Gulf of Mexico. [ID:nWEN6145]
 Mars platform operator Royal Dutch Shell  did not
immediately respond to a request to confirm the Valero
information.
 DOLLAR SLUMPS
 The dollar hit a record low against the Swiss franc, a
traditional safe haven, and it also dropped to a four-month
trough versus the yen and a three-week low versus the euro.
 A weak dollar can support dollar-denominated oil by making
it less expensive for consumers using other currencies and by
luring yield-hungry investors to commodities markets.
 As the Aug. 2 deadline to raise the debt ceiling
approached, the United States is expected to lose its top-notch
AAA credit rating from at least one major rating agency,
according to a Reuters poll that also found wrangling over the
issue has already damaged the economy. [ID:nN1E76P12Q]
 ""A breakdown and possible default scenario would possess
the bearish aspect of a further slide in the stock market and
implications for another recession,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president
at Ritterbusch & Associates said in a note.
 ""But, on the other hand, a bullish case could be presented
in which a weakening dollar could prove supportive to energy
should a default scenario unfold,"" he added.

 By Florence Tan	
 SINGAPORE, July 26 (Reuters) - Oil prices held steady as
President Barack Obama urged Republican and Democratic leaders
to reach a fair compromise on raising the debt ceiling to avoid
the first default in the history of the U.S.	
 Obama warned that failure to act could cost jobs and do
serious damage to the world's biggest economy. The U.S. would
not be able to pay bills that include monthly Social Security
checks if the debt ceiling is not raised, and that may lead to a
drop in energy consumption. 
 Brent  crude was unchanged at $117.95 a barrel at
0330 GMT, after sliding as low as $117.32. U.S. oil  was
21 cents higher at $99.42, after earlier dipping to $98.80.	
 ""Each side thinks the other will compromise and the clock is
ticking,"" said Tony Nunan, a risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp.
""If the clock keeps ticking and nothing gets done, people get
worried.""	
 A temporary six-month extension of the ceiling does not
solve the problem and might not be enough to avoid credit
downgrade, Obama also said. 
 Asian shares edged higher on Tuesday with investors showing
few signs of panic even as the U.S has failed to bridge their
differences with just a week to go to the Aug. 2 deadline to
raise the debt ceiling. 
 
 Gold, which has rallied in the past few days hitting
successive records as investors poured in to the safe asset,
held steady below its all-time high on Tuesday. 
 ""At the end of the day if the Republicans do not make any
further move toward a bigger compromise, President Obama will
simply have to sign the shorter-term deal to avoid a default,""
said David Cohen, director of Asian forecasting at Action
Economics. ""A default is still unlikely to happen."" 
 
 STEADY DEMAND 
 Ratings agencies have warned that even if Congress raises
the debt ceiling and averts a default, they may still strip the
United States of its AAA credit rating if lawmakers fail to
agree on deeper long-term budget cuts. 
 A lower credit rating could raise borrowing costs not only
for the U.S. government but also for other countries, companies
and consumers because U.S. Treasuries are the benchmark by which
many loans are measured.	
 Failure to act on the debt limit could push the United
States back into recession and hurt oil demand at the world's
largest consumer.	
 Still, analysts expect that the world's top oil consumer
U.S. to reach an agreement soon and prices to recover, driven by
expectations of steady demand amid reduced global output. 
 ""By the end of this week we'll see a deal and the markets
will recover,"" Nunan said. 
 Brent is poised to rise within a range of $116-$120 a barrel
while U.S. oil could trade sideways between $97 and $103 a
barrel, he said.	
 Investors will watch weekly oil stocks data from the
American Petroleum Institute due later on Tuesday to gauge the
country's demand following disappointing macroeconomic data that
showed a slowdown in the nation's recovery.	
 U.S. crude oil inventories were forecast to have fallen for
the eighth straight week last week, as the import level is
likely to have leveled off, a preliminary Reuters poll showed
ahead of weekly inventory data. 
 Mitsubishi's Nunan expects further drawdowns in oil
inventories in the second half of this year as demand will hold
up despite sluggish macroeconomic data.	
 Oil fell on Monday, with participants staying on the
sidelines awaiting the outcome of U.S. efforts to raise the debt
ceiling. Both U.S. and Brent total crude futures trading volumes
were under 300,000 lots traded in afternoon trading in New York,
with both more than 55 percent below their 30 day averages.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, July 26 (Reuters) - Gold held steady below its
record high on Tuesday as investors waited to see if President
Barack Obama's appeal for lawmakers to break a deadlock in U.S.
debt talks would succeed, while the euro zone debt crisis lent
support.	
 Spot gold was little changed at $1,615.36 an ounce by
0634 GMT, slightly firmer after Obama warned that failure to
reach agreement to avert default could cause a deep economic
crisis and urged Republican and Democratic leaders to reach a
compromise. 
 U.S. gold  edged up 0.2 percent to $1,615.60.	
 ""President Obama tried to add some confidence on the debt
talks, but people still have doubt,"" said Peter Fung, head of
dealing at Wing Fung Precious Metals in Hong Kong.	
 An agreement on raising the U.S. debt ceiling beyond $14.3
trillion could take some heat off gold and trigger a correction
to the $1,560 to $1,570 level, Fung said.	
 ""But over the medium- to long-term, gold is still going to
be on the upside as people will still be seeking a safe haven in
gold with the problems around the world.""	
 Spot gold hit a record high of $1,622.49 on Monday, and is
likely to reach $1,644 in the short term on the chart, Reuters
market analyst Wang Tao said. 
 The dollar lost more than 0.6 percent against a basket of
currencies , and hit a record low against the Swiss franc
and a four-month trough versus the yen, as investors were
sceptical the U.S. talks would see a swift breakthrough. 
 
 
 
 Last week Standard & Poor's warned there was a 50-50 chance
the U.S. AAA credit rating could be cut within three months.

 ""There is an increasing chance of downgrading, even if the
debt ceiling is raised in the last minute,"" said Ong Yi Ling, an
analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.	
 ""Unless a long-term, more credible deficit reduction plan
comes along, rating agencies will keep the U.S. on negative
watch, which will benefit gold.""	
 Underpinning sentiment in bullion, Moody's cut Greece's
credit rating further into junk territory on Monday and said it
was almost certain to slap a default tag on its debt as a result
of a new EU rescue package. 
 India, the world's largest gold consumer, raised interest
rates by a higher-than-expected 50 basis points on Tuesday to
fight against stubbornly high inflation. Investors in major
emerging economies, such as India and China, have shown growing
interest in gold, seen as a good hedge against inflation.

 South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said on
Monday wage talks with the country's big gold miners had broken
down and it would give them a 48-hour strike notice on Tuesday.
South Africa was the world's fourth-largest gold producer in
2010, after China, Australia and the United States, Reuters data
show. 
 Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest
gold-backed exchange-traded fund, remained unchanged at
1,241.769 tonnes, while holdings in iShares Silver Trust ,
the world's biggest silver ETF, rose 42.44 tonnes to 9,891.61
tonnes -- their highest since June 10.	
 Spot silver gained half a percent to $40.51. It hit
$41.05 in the previous session, its highest since May 4 when
prices were tumbling from a record high of $49.51 set on April
28.	
 Silver could rise towards $42 to $43 if gold strengthens
further, as investors look for a cheaper alternative to gold,
Ong of Phillip Futures said.

 By Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday as
the inability of the U.S. Congress to reach agreement on
raising the government debt limit kept investors wary of risky
assets and concerned about the global economy.
 Low trading volumes boosted volatility. Brokers and
analysts expected some market participants to be sidelined
awaiting the outcome of U.S. efforts to avoid default.
 Concerns about a potential U.S. credit rating downgrade or
even default kept markets worried about the global economy and
energy demand, after a new bailout deal for Greece helped boost
U.S. crude prices to a six-week high on Friday.
 Brent September crude  fell 73 cents to settle at
$117.94 a barrel, having traded from $116.92 to $118.45.
 U.S. September crude  fell 67 cents to settle at
$99.20 a barrel, recovering from an earlier low of $98.52.
 Total crude trading volumes were well below 30-day
averages, with Brent crude nearly 50 percent under and U.S.
volumes more than 40 percent under with less than an hour of
post-settlement trading remaining.
 Oil prices bounced off early lows, staying within sight of
last week's highs, and some analysts maintained that chances of
a U.S. default remained remote and were unlikely to translate
into a real economic crisis.
 ""The political circus over the U.S. debt level will
probably last until the last hours before Aug. 2,"" Olivier
Jakob of Petromatrix said in a note.
 ""There are enough demand uncertainties to maintain
speculators on the sideline of the oil trade,"" he concluded.

 SINGAPORE, July 25 (Reuters) - Crude slipped more than $1 on
Monday as investors exited riskier assets on concerns a default
by the U.S. may derail growth in the economy and pare oil demand
in the world's biggest consumer. 
 From U.S. stock index futures to the Nikkei and base metals,
markets have slipped as the U.S. government failed to win an
agreement on raising the country's debt ceiling. Gold has
benefited from the uncertainty, hitting another record on
Monday, as investors piled into the safer asset. 
 Brent  crude futures for September fell 76 cents to
$117.91 a barrel by 0359 GMT. U.S. crude  for September
was down 95 cents to $98.92 a barrel, after earlier slipping to
a low of $98.74. The contract settled at a six-week high of
$99.87 on Friday.	
 ""The most significant influence on the oil market is the
concern that failing to raise the debt ceiling would mean the
U.S. could either default or have to cut spending on a variety
of social services,"" said Ben Westmore, a commodities economist
at the National Australian Bank. 
 ""If either of these happens it would have a negative impact
on U.S. oil demand, hence lower prices."" 
 Lawmakers missed a self-imposed deadline to settle a
deficit-reduction deal by the time Asian markets opened on
Monday, as a sharply divided Congress pursued rival budget plans
that appeared unlikely to win broad support. 
 
 
 
 Rating agency Standard & Poor's last week reiterated that
there was a 50:50 chance the U.S. AAA credit rating could be cut
within three months. 
 Still, analysts expect the debt crisis to be resolved before
the Aug. 2 deadline as a default by the world's biggest economy
would rattle financial markets and threaten the nascent recovery
being seen around the world. 
 ""The debt issue will be resolved by the Aug. 2 deadline. The
economic fallout of not resolving it is too significant for the
political parties to risk it,"" Westmore said. ""It's just a bit
of posturing at the moment by the Republicans and the
Democrats.""	
 Expectations of steady demand from emerging nations such as
China and Indian amid reduced output would put a floor under
oil, and prices will recover once the situation is resolved, he
said.	
 On Friday, Brent crude jumped 1 percent to top $118 in light
trade, buoyed by Europe's latest agreement to bail out Greece
and by spread buying that widened the gap between London and
U.S. crude. 
 U.S. products, including heating oil and gasoline, rose
alongside Brent, helping push U.S. crude to six-week highs,
though gains were tempered by uncertainty over talks to avert
the unprecedented U.S. default. 
 Investors will be scouring U.S. data on new home sales and
consumer confidence due on Tuesday to assess the economic
outlook for the United States. 
 Investors' concern about the euro zone debts ""is absolutely
not going to totally go away, but for the time being, it seems
to be less of a concern,"" Westmore said.

 NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - Gold rose to record highs
above $1,620 an ounce on Monday, as a stalemate in budget talks
in Washington prompted investors to buy the metal as a safe
haven against the looming risks of a U.S. ratings downgrade or
default.
 Bullion has gained nearly 8 percent in July, hitting five
all-time highs in the past nine sessions, as U.S. lawmakers
were locked in a standoff over dueling debt plans that offered
little prospect for compromise, increasing the threat of a
ratings downgrade and default that could sow chaos in global
markets.
 Gold option volatility spiked almost 9 percent, its biggest
gain in a week, amid frantic negotiations to raise the $14.3
trillion debt ceiling ahead of an Aug. 2 deadline. A fund
manager said bullion prices could pull back sharply if the deal
to cut the long-term U.S. deficit is perceived as highly
deflationary.
 ""You can see gold up another $200 to $1,800 by the end of
the year just based on renewed fear of devaluation of
currencies,"" said Jeffrey Sherman, commodities portfolio
manager at DoubleLine Capital, which oversees $13 billion in
assets.
 Spot gold  hit a record at $1,622.49 an ounce and was
up 0.8 percent at $1,611.75 an ounce by 2:27 p.m. EDT (1827
GMT).
 U.S. August gold futures  settled up $10.70 at
$1,612.20 an ounce, after trading between $1,603.80 and
$1,624.30. Trading volume near 240,000 lots, one of the busiest
days in July.
 The CBOE Gold ETF Volatility Index <.GVZ>, often referred
to as the ""Gold VIX"" and is based on SPDR Gold Trust 
options, rallied for a second day to over 18, near its highest
level in over a month.

 Bullion is up over 7 percent in July, on track for its
biggest monthly gain since April on concerns over euro zone
debt levels as well as the U.S. budget talks.
 DoubleLine's Sherman said that gold could pull back sharply
if the final U.S. budget deal involves heavy spending cuts and
tax increases, or both.
 ""If you get a balancing of the budget or working toward
that direction, that's extremely deflationary for the U.S.
economy. Under that scenario, I would think that you would not
want to be holding gold,"" Sherman said.
 US LAWMAKERS SPLIT AS DEADLINE LOOMS

 An unprecedented debt default in the world's largest
economy would likely send shock waves through global markets.
 Rating agency Standard & Poor's last week reiterated that
there was a 50-50 chance the U.S. AAA credit rating could be
cut within three months. [ID:nN1E76K0P1]
 While most investors believe a deal will be done,
nervousness about a ratings downgrade is pressuring the dollar,
hurting long-dated U.S. Treasuries and benefiting gold.
 ""There are ultimately two options -- you either have
monetization of debt, or you have a move towards fiscal
consolidation, and a move towards fiscal sustainability. Until
we get the latter, the market will assume the former. That is
just a great bid for the gold market,"" said Natixis analyst Nic
Brown.
 Also underpinning gold is Moody's decision to cut Greece's
credit rating further into junk territory. Moody's said it was
almost certain to slap a default tag on Greek debt as a result

36,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2011 07:20PM ET</span>",NYMEX-Crude falls after settling at 6-week high," TOKYO, July 25 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures fell on Monday
after settling at a six-week high on Friday, taking their cue
from a decline in U.S. stock futures amid uncertainty over talks
to avert an unprecedented U.S. default. 
 
 FUNDAMENTALS	
 * NYMEX crude for September delivery  was down 61
cents at $99.26 a barrel by 2300 GMT, after settling up 74 cents
at a six-week high of $99.87 on Friday.	
 * London Brent crude for September delivery  was down
55 cents at $118.12 a barrel, after settling up $1.16 at $118.67
on Friday.	
 * U.S. highway travel fell for the third consecutive month
in May, reflecting higher gasoline prices, the U.S.
Transportation Department said on Friday. 
 Overall, highway travel for the first five months of the
year was down 1 percent from the same period in 2010, the
department said.	
 * Hedge funds and other large investors increased their bets
on higher oil prices for a third straight week up to July 19,
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday.

 The speculator group upped its net long futures and options
position in New York by 13,453 to 182,285 during the period, an
increase of almost 8 percent. 
 * North Korea has proposed restarting stalled six-party
talks on nuclear disarmament, without preconditions and as soon
as possible, China's official Xinhua news agency said on
Saturday. 
 
 MARKETS NEWS	
 * U.S. stock index futures fell more than 1.0 percent on
Sunday as the failure by the government to come to an agreement
on the debt ceiling made the prospects for a default -- once
considered an impossible outcome -- more likely. 
 Wall Street is set to close its worst three months in a
year as July draws to an end after a roller-coaster
ride for markets.	
 On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost
43.25 points or 0.34 percent to 12,681.16. The Standard & Poor's
500 Index added 1.22 points or 0.09 percent to 1,345.02. 
 * The dollar slipped in early Asia-Pacific trade on Monday
as investors looked for signs of progress to break the deadlock
that will avert a U.S. debt default. 
White House officials and Republican leaders scrambled to
give assurances that the United States would avert a debt
default, but the two sides did not appear to be moving closer to
a deal.

 NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil jumped 1
percent to top $118 in light trade on Friday, buoyed by
Europe's latest agreement to bail out Greece and by spread
buying which widened the gap between London and U.S. crude.
 U.S. products, including heating oil and gasoline, rose
alongside Brent, helping push U.S. crude to six-week highs,
though gains were tempered by uncertainty over talks to avert
an unprecedented U.S. default.
 The spread buying was a reversal from the selling seen late
the previous session, when Brent fell after an aggressive sell
off in gasoline and spreads fed by U.S. demand concerns, market
players said.
 ""A lot of what we are seeing today is spread related. From
the WTI perspective you will see that Brent and U.S. products
are strong and that is pulling U.S. crude up,"" said Tim Evans,
analyst, Citi Futures Perspective, New York
 The Brent  futures contract for September rose $1.16
to settle at $118.67 a barrel. U.S. crude  rose for a
fourth straight session, settling up 74 cents at $99.87 a
barrel, its highest close in six weeks.
 As during Thursday's session, oil briefly rose above $100
but failed to retain those gains.
 For the week, U.S. crude futures rose $2.63, a fourth
straight week of gains, while Brent rose $1.14, rebounding from
the previous week's losses.
 Trading volumes were thin. At 4.38 p.m. EDT, U.S. crude
traded contracts were 37 percent below the 30-day average,
while Brent volume was down 57 percent from the 30-day
average.
 With markets watching the debt ceiling debates, President
Barack Obama said any deficit-cutting deal must be crafted to
avoid denting economic growth, warning another recession would
be ""the worst thing"" for U.S. fiscal health. [ID:nWNA4439]
 ""The U.S. debt ceiling crisis hasn't been solved and there
has been mixed economic data, so that might not be enough to
keep crude above $100,"" said Gene McGillian, analyst at
Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Analysts and traders said the preliminary solution to the
euro zone debt crisis presented in Brussels on Thursday was
still providing some support for Brent.
 The oil market shrugged off weakness on Wall Street and a
stronger dollar which can pressure curde prices.
 The Dow fell on Friday after poor results from Caterpiller
and Microsoft, while the euro slipped against the dollar as
investors focused on how the second rescue package for Greece
and measures to stop the European debt crisis from spreading
will be implemented. [.N] [USD/]

 NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - Gold rose about 1 percent on
Friday, having neared its all-time peak as reservations over a
bailout plan for Greece and concerns about a lack of agreement
on the U.S. debt ceiling spurred safe-haven buying.
 ""Gold is drawing strength from the European bailout plan
and investor nervousness about whether this is going to result
in a real resolution. The gold market is voting no,"" said
Sterling Smith, a Country Hedging analyst in St. Paul,
Minnesota.
 Adding to the uncertainty and to investor interest in

 ""Norway was a bit supportive to gold and it will keep the

 Spot gold  reached $1,607.01 an ounce, its highest
since setting a record of $1,609.51 on Tuesday, and steadied
around $1,602.76 an ounce by 3:46 p.m. EDT (1946 GMT) from
$1,587.90 late on Thursday.
 In New York, benchmark August gold futures , which
trade on the COMEX exchange, gained $14.50 to settle at
$1,601.50 an ounce, a 0.91 percent rise. Prices increased
slightly in after-hours trade.
 COMEX gold activity was healthy with volume about 20
percent greater than the 30-day average, according to
preliminary Thomson Reuters data.
 Gold prices have risen more than 12 percent so far this
year.
 Analysts, on average, increased their forecasts for the
gold price both this year and next, given debt concerns on both
sides of the Atlantic, though platinum and palladium may
struggle to make major gains.

 SINGAPORE, July 22 (Reuters) - Brent crude futures rose on
Friday, as Europe's sweeping new action on the debt crisis and
signs of progress on a U.S. deficit reduction deal offset weak
economic data from the world's second largest oil consumer,
China.	
 The International Energy Agency's decision to not release
more oil from emergency reserves also supported prices.	
 Brent  for September rose 29 cents to a low of

an extra 109 billion euros ($157 billion) of government money,
plus a contribution by private sector bondholders estimated to
total as much as 50 billion euros by mid-2014. 
 ""Sentiment is positive today because of the news out of
Europe. The euro zone leaders managed to keep expectations low
before the summit, the announcement of package gave the market a
boost,"" said Chen Xin Yi, a commodities analyst with Barclays
Capital.	
 The news of the euro zone rescue package pushed Asian stocks
and the euro to a two-week high on Friday, while demand for
safe-haven assets weakened. Gold fell to around $1,590 an ounce,
about $20 below a record high of near $1,610 set on Tuesday.

 
 
 
 Oil prices dipped on Thursday after data showed China's
manufacturing contracting for the first time in a year in July,
as monetary tightening and sluggish global demand weighed on the
economy, according to HSBC flash PMI. 
 Commodity markets are focused on the economy of China as a
major source of future demand growth.	
 ""We expect a slowdown in China's demand growth, but actual
apparent consumption is still expected to remain high with the
latest June data release indicating apparent consumption still
at a high level of 9 million barrels per day ,"" said
Chen.	
 China's apparent oil demand gained only 1 percent from a
year earlier to 8.99 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, the
slowest growth in more than two years, Reuters calculations from
official data showed. 
 According to technical charts, Brent oil is biased to rise
to $120.82 a barrel while U.S. crude has an upside target of
$101.53 a barrel, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 U.S. DEBT, IEA DECISION	
 Oil prices also received support from signs of progress on a
U.S. deficit-reduction deal that would stave off a devastating
default, and news that IEA members decided against releasing
more oil stockpiles despite the threat of high prices to
economic recovery. 
 With the clock ticking toward an Aug. 2 deadline to raise
the U.S. debt ceiling, President Barack Obama and the senior
Republican in Congress, House Speaker John Boehner, worked
toward a budget plan that would include deep spending cuts but
might leave tax reform for later, congressional aides said on
Thursday. 
 The world's top oil consuming countries decided against
releasing more stocks into the market even though high prices
still weigh on the global economy, saying they believed
producers have started pumping more.

(Recasts, updates throughout, adds quotes, background)
 By Matthew Robinson
 NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell on Thursday,
dragged down in an aggressive late sell off in gasoline and
spreads due in part to U.S. demand concerns.
 After trading positive for most of the day, Brent tumbled
in late afternoon activity as crude and gasoline trading
volumes jumped.
 Market players said growing concerns about U.S. gasoline
demand, which has been lagging year-ago levels by 2.2 percent
over the last four weeks in the midst of the summer driving
season, helped spark the sell off.
 ""I think part of what we are seeing here is a recognition
of where we are in the summer driving season -- we don't have
that much driving season demand in front of us,"" said Tim
Evans, energy analyst for Citi Futures Perspective in New
York.
 Brent, considered a better benchmark of market conditions
globally and in the giant U.S. Gulf Coast refining region than
U.S. crude, had been traded up for most of the U.S. trading
session on optimism about a possible deal to bail out Greece
and news that the world's biggest oil consuming nations would
not release more crude. [ID:nL6E7IL1SI]
 Gasoline futures  tumbled 1.5 percent and the RBOB
crack spread  fell 13 percent. Brent crude 
fell 64 cents to settle at $117.51 a barrel.
 U.S. crude  held on to gains to settle up 73 cents at
$99.13 a barrel, after earlier rising above $100 a barrel and
breaking out of the $93 and $99 a barrel trading range seen for
most of July.
 U.S. crude traded volume was around 703,200 contracts,
almost 23 percent below the 30-day average, as of 4:50 p.m. EDT
(2050 GMT) while Brent volume hit 437,000 lots, down almost 34
percent from the 30-day average.
 (Graphic: http://link.reuters.com/jen72s )
 Additional pressure came from spread selling between the
two futures contracts, with the premium of Brent to U.S. crude
 narrowing $1.15 to $18.50 a barrel in late
activity, traders said.
 The recent drawdowns in inventories at the Cushing,
Oklahoma delivery point for the U.S. contract, which last week
hit the lowest level since Dec. 24, helped prompt the sell off,
according to market participants.
 The premium of Brent to U.S. crude hit a record over $23 a
barrel earlier this month, supported by rising flows of
Canadian crude into Cushing and other parts of the Midwest.
 EARLY SUPPORT FROM IEA, GREECE HOPES
 Crude earlier found support from news euro zone leaders
were set to give their financial rescue fund new powers to help
Greece overcome its debt crisis that eased concerns that have
weighed on oil and other markets in recent weeks.
[ID:nL6E7IK2VL]
 Further support came from upbeat data showing factory
activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region bounced back in July,
as well as news members of the IEA decided against releasing
more oil stockpiles despite the threat of high prices to the
economic recover. [ID:nL6E7IL1SI]
 The IEA shocked oil markets in June, announcing it would
release 60 million barrels of oil to help replace disruptions
of Libyan supply and bring down prices. Prices initially
plunged, but in the month since the announcement, Brent prices
have climbed back more than $10 a barrel.
 But on Thursday, the energy watchdog for the industrialized
nations confirmed what many analysts had expected, saying not a
single one of its 28 members had asked for more oil to be
released, including the United States, one of the architects of
the first release a month ago.
 In addition, the United States has no plans to do a
unilateral release of its own strategic reserves right now, the
Department of Energy said. [ID:nWNA4302]
 In Asian trading, crude prices fell on news that
manufacturing in China contracted for the first time in a year
in July, as monetary tightening and sluggish global demand
weighed on the economy. China is seen as a major source of
future oil demand growth. [ID:nL3E7IL0D4]

 * Sentiment supported by euro zone, U.S. debt talk hopes

 By Seng Li Peng	
 SINGAPORE, July 21 (Reuters) - Brent crude reversed early
gains on Thursday to drop below $118 after news that China's
factory sector contracted at its fastest pace in 28 months, but
hopes of solutions to sovereign debt woes on either side of the
Atlantic could keep a floor under prices. 
 Brent  fell 41 cents to $117.74 a barrel by 0341 GMT
after reaching an intraday high of $118.46 a barrel. U.S. crude
 for September, which became the front-month contract on
Thursday, fell 23 cents to $98.17 a barrel. 
 The HSBC flash PMI, the earliest available indicator of
industrial activity in China, the world's No 2 oil consumer,
fell to 48.9 in July, its lowest since March 2009, as monetary
policy tightening and slack global demand weighed on the
economy. The index was last below 50 in July 2010.

 The 50-point level in the PMI demarcates expansion from
contraction, with a reading above 50 indicating growth.	
 ""The knee-jerk reaction is to sell off assets like oil.
Something is always going to take a bit of a hit, or a blow
somewhere, and it looks like it is going to start in the
manufacturing sector,"" said Ben Le Brun of CMC Markets in
reference to the fall in PMI. 
 ""This is not official data. It's from HSBC although the
official rating will show contractions when released,"" he said.	
 ""The fall is a cause of concern but it should not be
completely unexpected. The Chinese government's attempt to cool
the economy is starting to work."" 
 But the mood is not all sour as temporary solutions to
tackle debt problems in the euro zone and the United States
could support prices in the short term, analysts said. 
 ""We have the euro summit tonight and there's a good
sentiment flying out of that between Germany and France,"" said
le Brun. ""If we get some good dialogue, then certainly oil
traders will focus on that."" 
 
 
 
 Germany and France have reached a common position on a
second bailout of Greece in their bid to keep the country's debt
crisis from spreading through Europe, officials said on
Thursday, in news that set the euro rallying against the
dollar. 
 In the United States, the White House signaled it could
support a short-term increase in the U.S. borrowing limit for ""a
few days"" if lawmakers agreed to a broad deficit reduction deal
but needed more time to pass it. 
 The move, a shift from President Barack Obama's previous
position, reflects the growing political reality that time is
short for Congress to pass a massive deficit-cutting deal before
the United States runs out of money on Aug. 2. 
 ""Market sentiment has been on a roller coaster. There is
still going to be a lot of nervousness about the ongoing
situation in the U.S. and Europe, but the market is certainly a
little more confident than a week ago,"" said economist David
Cohen of Action Economics. 
 
 CRUDE STOCKS, JAPAN DATA SUPPORTS	
 ""The Japanese trade numbers for June reported this morning
offer some encouragement that the Japanese economy is rebounding
nicely from the quake. In that context, commodity prices would
be supported,"" said Cohen.	
 Japan's exports rose in June from the prior month and the
pace of annual declines slowed, bringing the trade balance back
into surplus as factory output and sales recover steadily from
the March earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown.

 A drawdown in U.S. stocks and hopes that the International
Energy Agency was unlikely to release more oil from reserves
should also support prices.	
 U.S. crude stocks dropped 3.73 million barrels last week,
more than twice the volumes analysts had expected in a Reuters
poll. The drawdown came as refiners stepped up utilization to
90.3 percent of capacity, the most in almost a year. 
 Developed nations are unlikely to release more oil on to the
market in coming days, a month after the first release failed to
curb oil prices to help protect the global economic recovery,
officials and analysts said.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - Gold fell on Thursday,
extending its drop from a recent record high as signs of
progress on debt deals in Europe and the United States drew
investors to riskier assets at the expense of safe havens.
 Bullion came under pressure after the White House said it
saw momentum for a ""balanced"" deficit deal, but denied that
U.S. President Barack Obama and the House of Representatives
speaker were close to a pact. Gold is up 6 percent in July
largely due to uncertainty over the U.S. debt talks.
 Silver tumbled more than 2 percent as draft conclusions of
Thursday's emergency summit showed euro zone leaders were set
to give their financial rescue fund new powers to fight debt
contagion. The S&P 500 rallied 1.5 percent.
 ""Any kind of normalization, either economic or financial
policy, is going to have an adverse effect on the gold price,""
said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney
Montgomery Scott, which oversees $54 billion in assets.
 ""However, there are still those elements of uncertainty
that leave a wrinkle out there for those who are already long
gold to not abandon it,"" he said.
 Spot gold  fell 0.7 percent to $1,588.54 an ounce as
of 3:18 p.m. EDT (1918 GMT), around $20 below its record
$1,609.51 set on Tuesday.
 U.S. gold futures  for August delivery settled down
$9.90 an ounce at $1,587, after trading between $1,584.90 and
$1,605. Trading volume topped 220,000 lots, set for one of the
market's busiest days since late May.
 Spot silver  dropped 2.3 percent to $39.17 an ounce.
 Precious metals fell as riskier assets rallied after the
draft conclusions from the European emergency summit. U.S.
crude oil futures briefly rose above $100 a barrel.
 On charts, gold faces considerable difficulty moving back
toward $1,600 an ounce, and sterling-priced gold is having even
more resistance toward rising above 1,000 pounds, said
independent investor Dennis Gartman.
 A decline toward 955-970 pounds would be reasonable, he
said.

 UNCERTAINTY OVER DEBT DEALS
 The draft summit statement suggested the euro zone bailout
fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, would be
allowed for the first time to help states earlier with
precautionary loans. Euro zone leaders also signaled they were
willing to let Greece default temporarily. [ID:nL6E7IK2VL]
 Minds have been concentrated by the danger that Europe's
debt crisis could engulf the much bigger economies of Spain and
Italy. Greece, Portugal and Ireland have already succumbed.
 ""There are a lot of unsolved issues for the time being, and
gold reacted really marginally after the draft EU summit
conclusions. There was no real profit-taking,"" said Bayram
Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital Management.
 ""There is no shift in risk perceptions, which is really
important for gold market participants,"" Dincer said.
 The euro rose to a two-week high after French President
Nicolas Sarkozy said the EFSF would be able to intervene on
primary and secondary debt markets when the European Central
Bank deemed it necessary. [FRX/]
 Bullion investors continue to pay close attention to the
U.S. debt talks. U.S. lawmakers have struggled to break their
impasse as an Aug. 2 deadline looms for raising the
government's $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.
 There were some signs of progress as White House and
congressional leaders worked furiously to craft a
deficit-reduction deal to avert a catastrophic default and
downgrades to the United States' top-notch credit quality.
 A U.S. default would likely reduce the safe-haven appeal of
U.S. Treasuries and the dollar, lifting gold. [ID:nN1E76J292]

 NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - Gold resumed its rise on Wednesday after
the last session's drop from record highs, as investors focused on economic
uncertainty despite progress in talks on raising the U.S. debt limit and
ahead of a euro zone summit aimed at resolving the region's debt crisis.
 Gold is about 1 percent below its record high of $1,609.51 a day after
the metal snapped an 11-day winning streak, the longest in four decades.
 Lingering anxiety about the debt crises, however, underpinned gold
buying. Bullion remained higher after White House said it is open to a
short-term deal extension to avert a U.S. default
 ""The deal is not done, even it seems like everyone is somewhat
optimistic about what is being implemented. And no one knows what's going
to happen to Greece and Europe,"" said Phillip Streible, senior market
strategist with Lind Waldock, a unit of futures broker MF Global.
 ""I can see another healthy correction before fresh buying comes in if
there are some form of resolutions, as the need for safety will come off
for the time being,"" he said.
 Spot gold  was up 0.5 percent at $1,596.09 an ounce by 2:49 P.m.
EDT (1849 GMT).
 U.S. gold futures  for August delivery settled down $4.20 an
ounce at $1,596.90, reflecting Tuesday's decline after the contract's
settlement. August traded between $1,581.10 and $1,600.80. Trading activity
was about one-third below its 30-day average

 DUE FOR CORRECTION
 One analyst, however, said the metal is long overdue for a correction
given its failure to rise further even as open interest in U.S. gold
futures hit its highest since January.
 ""That seems like a crack in the structure of the market and sets the
stage for the inevitable and very long overdue correction,"" independent
investor Dennis Gartman said.
 Latest exchange data showed U.S. gold futures' open interest, a gauge
of market liquidity, rose 2 percent this week to top 540,000 lots as of
Tuesday, the highest since January.
 Bullion has gained around 6 percent this month due to uncertainty over
whether politicians will reach a deal to raise the $14.3 trillion U.S.
borrowing limit before an Aug. 2 deadline.
 Despite signs of progress, bullion investors instead paid attention to
the uncertain outcome in U.S. debt talks that have threatened the United
States' top-notch credit rating.
 The White House shifted gears on Wednesday and signaled that President
Barack Obama could support a short-term extension of the U.S. borrowing
limits as long as it was part of a broader long-term deficit reduction
deal.
 The switch came a day after the so-called Gang of Six senators produced
an ambitious deficit reduction plan that Obama latched onto as a way to
help break through an impasse in an increasingly grim standoff.

 Gold was also supported after the head of the European Commission Jose
Manuel Barroso said EU leaders must find a convincing solution to Greece's
debt crisis at a summit on Thursday or the global economy will pay the
price. [ID:nL6E7IK1QO]
 The European Union was said to be considering enabling the euro zone
bailout fund to recapitalize banks, according to reports. The news boosted
the euro and weakened gold's safe-haven appeal.
 Silver  was up 2.1 percent at $39.76 an ounce.
 Platinum group metals also rose, with platinum  up 0.5 percent at
$1,770.99 an ounce, while palladium  was up 0.7 percent at $790.72 an

 NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Wednesday,
bolstered by optimism on the eve of a euro zone summit and U.S.
government data that showed a drawdown in crude inventories.
 Euro zone leaders will convene in Brussels for an emergency
meeting that could forge a rescue plan for debt-ravaged Greece.
This led to the euro's rise against the dollar Wednesday which
often lifts dollar-denominated commodities like oil.
 U.S. government data also gave oil a boost, showing a
3.73-million-barrel draw in crude inventories, more than twice
what analysts had expected in a Reuters poll.
 The drawdown came as refiners stepped up utilization to
90.3 percent of capacity, the most in almost a year. [EIA/S]
 ""This is currency speculation as reflected in the oil
market. The dollar-euro relationship continues to be on the
front burner and that pushed oil prices higher,"" said Joseph
Arsenio, managing director of Arsenio Capital Management in
California.
 U.S. crude briefly turned negative and Brent pared gains on
Wednesday following a dip in U.S. equities as the looming
deadline to raise the country's debt ceiling canceled out
blowout earnings reported by technology companies.
[ID:nN1E76J1Q3]
 Brent crude < LCOc1> held just above Tuesday's settlement
through the trading day and rallied towards the end. It settled
up $1.09 at $118.15 a barrel after reaching a session high of
$118.86.
 U.S. crude < CLc1> for August delivery expired and settled
at $98.14 a barrel, up 64 cents, or 0.66 percent, after trading
from $96.64 to $99.02.
 The September crude contract  settled at $98.40 a
barrel, up 54 cents, or 0.55 percent, after trading from $96.93
to $99.37.
 Trading was light, as it has been over the past few days.
U.S. crude volumes were 32 percent below the 30-day average and
Brent crude volumes were 40 percent below the 30-day average.
 CHURNING PROFITS
 Midwest refineries led last week's jump in utilization
rates after they operated at 96.6 percent of capacity to take
advantage of high margins created by U.S. benchmark crude's
deep discount against European Brent, government data showed.
 The region's refiners get crude supplies priced against
U.S. West Texas Intermediate, which was as much as $23.57
cheaper than European Brent last week. The spread narrowed to
$19.65 on Wednesday as the August contract expired.
 Higher refinery output last week overwhelmed the fledgling
demand, which led to the 3.4 million barrel build in distillate
stocks and the 757,000 barrels rise in gasoline inventories,
the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) data showed.
 Traders will be eyeing a possible second release of
petroleum reserves by the developed world over the coming days
although this met with opposition from a few European
countries. [ID:nL6E7IK1YQ]
 The U.S. Energy Department recently sold 30.6 million
barrels of oil from the nation's strategic reserves as part of
a coordinated injection of 60 million barrels from government
stocks held by the 28 member nations of the International
Energy Agency to cover the supply shortfall due to the conflict
in OPEC member Libya.
 Traders will also watch U.S. president Barack Obama's
meeting with Republican House leaders at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT)
which could pull equities higher since the White House
indicated it would accept a debt extension for a few days.

 By Randy Fabi	
 SINGAPORE, July 20 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Wednesday,
supported by hopes of a U.S. debt deal, a weakening dollar
against the euro and tightening crude stocks in the world's
largest oil consumer.	
 Brent crude  climbed 57 cents to $117.63 a barrel by
0228 GMT, adding to gains of more than a dollar in the previous
session. U.S. crude  for August delivery, which expires at
the end of trading on Wednesday, jumped 85 cents to $98.35 a
barrel.	
 ""Any positive news on either the U.S. debt ceiling and the
Greek second bailout will push up the market,"" said Tony Nunan,
a risk manager with Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Corp.	
 ""Traders are just waiting for some confirmation that things
are progressing so they can put these two economic issues behind
them.""	
 According to technical charts, Brent must rise past $120 to
break through its current tight trading range, while U.S. oil
may continue to rise towards $100.59, Reuters analyst Wang Tao
said. 
 A group of Democratic and Republican senators offered an
ambitious plan on Tuesday that could revive stalled U.S. debt
talks and the prospect of a long-term deficit reduction deal to
avert a default by the United States. 
 With just two weeks left until the federal government runs
out of money to pay all of its bill, President Barack Obama
seized on the plan by the so-called Gang of Six as a ""very
significant step"" and urged congressional leaders to start
discussing it.	
 On the other side of the Atlantic, German Chancellor Angela
Merkel doused expectations of any comprehensive solution to
Greece's debt crisis at an emergency euro zone summit on
Thursday, saying ""further steps will be necessary and not just
one spectacular event which solves everything."" 
 Despite the bleak outlook, investors remained hopeful
policymakers would eventually reach a deal to provide further
aid for Greece, helping to lift the euro against the dollar.

 Oil also found support from a larger-than-expected drop in
U.S. crude inventories and expectations that the International
Energy Agency will not tap into more of its emergency reserves.	
 Industry group American Petroleum Institute reported a 5.2
million barrel drop in domestic crude stocks, surpassing
expectations for a 1.7 million barrel fall, as refinery runs
rose. 
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration will issue its
own weekly data later on Wednesday. 
 IEA's executive director said the agency has yet to decide
whether another release from emergency stocks was needed,
although the French energy minister said there were no plans for
another release. 
 The IEA in June announced the release of 60 million barrels
from emergency stockpiles for one month -- the third such move
in the agency's history -- in a temporary measure to fill a
supply gap caused by disruptions in Libyan output.	
 In other news, Goldman Sachs , long renowned as one of
the largest and savviest commodity derivatives traders, on
Tuesday blamed its commodities trading desk for much of the
massive drop in trading profits in the second quarter, even
after its own analysts correctly called for a pull-back in
prices.

 NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) Crude oil rallied on Tuesday on
strong U.S. housing data and a positive outlook on the
unfolding events of the euro zone debt crisis.
 U.S. housing starts rose to a six-month high in June, up
14.6 percent from a month ago, pointing to a resilient economic
recovery, data from the Commerce Department showed.

says
 * Price has exceeded 161.8 pct Fibonacci level, heading for

 SINGAPORE, July 19 (Reuters) - Spot gold could rise
as much as 21 percent in a sharp rally by the end of the year to
stand around $1,940 per ounce, technical analysis shows, Reuters
commodities analyst Wang Tao forecast on Tuesday.	
 ""The strong bullish momentum built in the past two weeks is
likely to snowball into the future,"" said Wang Tao, naming the
herd instinct of investors as the reason why gold prices have
surged along with other commodities in a big bull cycle that is
expected to last the next several years.	
 His conclusion is based on Elliott wave theory, a powerful
technical analysis tool that studies patterns on price charts,
which are believed to reflect social or crowd behavior trends,
and Fibonacci ratio analysis, a method market technicians use to
predict future movement of a trend based on preceding events.	
 Technical outlook chart: http://link.reuters.com/rab72s	
 Wang Tao's interpretation of the chart pattern shows a big
bull cycle could have originated from a 1970 low at $34.95, from
which a subsequent rise to a high of $835 in 1980 only completed
a big wave ""A"", the first part of an ""A-B-C"" wave cycle.	
 The next 20 years of retracement from the 1980 high to a
1999 low of $251.70 is labeled as the wave ""B"", with the current
rally interpreted as a wave ""C"".	
 In a long-term outlook in April, Wang said gold might peak
around $1,545 per ounce or rise sharply towards $1,941 by the
end of this year. 
 The two prices represent two 161.8 percent Fibonacci
projection levels, based respectively on the length of the wave
""A"" and the rise from the wave ""I"" to the wave ""III"" peak of
$1,030.80 in 2008, Wang explained.	
 Signals turned bearish after gold touched a high of
$1,575.79 in May, about $31 above the projected $1,545 target,
and the following consolidation over one month ended with a
sharp fall to $1,478.01 in July. 
 ""But the signals were too short-lived, and were totally
reversed by a quick recovery of the drop,"" Wang added.	
 That's because once the 161.8 percent Fibonacci level is
broken above, gold is theoretically heading towards the 261.8
percent level at $2,345 over the longer term.	
 There are several explanations about the factors that are
driving this crazy bull run, ranging from the weaker dollar to a
disappointing interest rate level, but Wang says group
psychology stands out over the rest.	
 For example, the charts of spot gold and the yield of the
U.S. 10-year treasury note do not show a strong correlation:	
 http://link.reuters.com/jeb72s	
 While a comparison chart illustrates that the weaker U.S.
dollar does contribute to stronger gold, that may not be the
only force propelling gold to record highs:	
 http://link.reuters.com/beb72s	
 From a technical point of view, almost all markets are
emotion-driven, Wang said, adding, ""The most critical factor
behind the bull run could be the herd instinct, or so-called
group psychology.""

 But with Europe's debt woes largely unresolved and a U.S.
deal to raise the debt ceiling facing an Aug. 2 deadline,
dealers cast gold's pull-back as a healthy correction in a
market that had become technically overextended after its best
two-week rally in 2-1/2 years.
 ""I think when all is said and done, the market will focus
on the other factors. This is going to be nothing more than a
knee-jerk reaction rather than a sell-off,"" said Bill O'Neill,
partner of commodity investment firm LOGIC Advisors.
 Bullion is still up nearly 6 percent this month due to
uncertainty over whether politicians will reach a deal to raise
the $14.3 trillion U.S. borrowing limit before the deadline. A
European debt crisis engulfing Greece that may spread to Italy
and Spain also underpinned the metal.
 Spot gold , which hit a new record $1,609.51 an ounce
earlier in the day, fell 1.2 percent to $1,584.76 as of 3:35
p.m. EDT (1935 GMT).
 U.S. gold futures for August delivery  settled down
$1.30 at $1,601.10 an ounce, but fell by more than $12 in
after-hours trading following Obama's comments. Volume topped
200,000 lots, one of the busiest days in more than two months.
 Silver  was down 4.2 percent at $38.81 an ounce.
 Obama said the ambitious budget plan brought forward on
Tuesday by the ""Gang of Six"" group of senators could provide
new ideas for breaking the impasse in Congress over raising the
credit limit, one of the first major signs of progress in a
months-long saga that has recently begun to wear on markets.
 While gold prices could fall by hundreds of dollars in the
short term, the rally will likely last for years as
policymakers use every available tool to shore up fragile
economies, said Sandy McGregor, a portfolio manager for South
African investment firm Allan Gray Ltd, the third-largest
shareholder of the world's biggest gold ETF. [ID:nN1E76I1KE]

 EUROPEAN DEBT WORRIES SUPPORT
 Still, jitters remained in the financial markets given
divisions among policymakers ahead of Thursday's euro zone
summit, with few expecting a permanent solution to the region's
debt crisis. [ID:nL6E7II0FP]
 A tax on euro zone banks and cheaper, longer-dated official
loans are the least risky way to provide extra funding for
debt-stricken Greece, a confidential paper drafted ahead of the
European summit showed. [ID:nL6E7IJ0PP]
 ""People are just stepping back ... we are going to end the
week with the same concerns that we came into the week with,
and people realize that,"" said Zachary Oxman, managing director
with TrendMax.
 Physical demand rose, with investors looking to hoard gold
and cash as a perfect storm brews in equity and credit
markets.
 Data published by EPFR Global, which tracks flows in and
out of funds, showed a thirst for gold helped drive the biggest
inflows into commodity funds in 14 weeks during the week to
July 15. [ID:nL6E7II03]

 NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - Crude oil rose on Tuesday as
investor confidence rose on strong U.S. housing data and
renewed hope for an agreement in Washington on thorny budget
issues.
 U.S. housing starts rose to a six-month high in June, up
14.6 percent from a month ago, pointing to a resilient economic
recovery, data from the Commerce Department showed, giving
crude a lift in early U.S. trade. [ID:nN1E76I0AD]
 Markets gained momentum later in the day after President
Barack Obama suggested progress was being made toward a $3.75
trillion deficit reduction deal centered around entitlement
reform. [ID:nN1E76H1Y0]
 September Brent crude  settled $1.01 higher at
$117.06 a barrel. Trade volumes were light, with Brent about 25
percent below the 30-day average and U.S. crude about 21
percent below that average.
 U.S. crude for August delivery  ended $1.57 higher at
$97.50 a barrel, a day before the contract is set to expire,
before trading up to $98.02 in post settlement activity
 U.S. crude extended gains in late activity after data from
the American Petroleum Institute showed a steep drawdown in
crude oil inventories for the week to July 15, as refinery runs
rose. [API/S]
 The late gains for U.S. crude pushed down the premium of
September Brent to September U.S. futures by 84 cents to
$18.95.
 ""Fundamentally, nothing much has changed, but the strength
in the housing starts and the strength in the euro helped find
new length this morning,"" said Carl Larry, Director of Blue
Ocean Brokerage in New York.
 ""We could also see some pressure on Brent crude because of
the heavy West African market. There is still a lot of cargoes
out there looking for homes,"" he added.
 Traders said several Nigerian cargoes for August had not
been sold, although availability of some crude streams from the
OPEC nation could tighten in September. [ID:nL6E7IJ2LU]
 The euro rose against the dollar on hopes policymakers may
reach a deal to provide further aid for Greece at a summit
later this week, though a lack of a long-term solution for the
country's debt crisis could keep the single currency
vulnerable. [USD/] The weaker dollar often lifts
dollar-denominated commodities.
 RANGEBOUND
 Even with Tuesday's gains Brent crude futures prices held
within the range it traded over the course of the past week and
failed to break through resistance around $118.90 a barrel.
 Along with the upbeat economic news, oil found support
support expectations the International Energy Agency (IEA)
would not release emergency stocks for a second time.
 IEA executive director said the IEA had not decided yet on
whether another release was needed, and French Energy Minister
Eric Besson said there were no plans for another release.

 The IEA in June announced a release of 60 million barrels
from emergency stockpiles for one month - the third such move
in the agency's history - in a temporary measure to fill a
supply gap caused by disruptions in Libyan output.

 By Seng Li Peng	
 SINGAPORE, July 19 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose 15 cents to
$116.20 a barrel on Tuesday, reversing the previous session's
losses, as the dollar weakened and on expectations oil stocks in
the world's top consumer U.S. fell for a seventh week.	
 Brent  rose as high as $116.50 a barrel after
settling at $116.05 in the previous session. U.S. crude 
edged up 4 cents to $95.97 at 0553 GMT, after losing $1.31 to
settle at $95.93 on Monday. 
 The twin factors helped divert investor attention away from
a sovereign debt default in the U.S. and Europe that partly led
to Brent settling $1.21 a barrel lower on Monday. The weaker
dollar also helped boost prices of commodities such as copper.

 ""The weakening dollar is pretty much all I can say"" is the
reason for the rise in Brent, said Benson Wang of Commodity
Broking Services in Sydney. 
 The dollar softened versus the euro and a basket of
currencies on Tuesday as the single currency regained
some ground after losses in the previous session on worries that
the euro zone debt crisis will worsen. 
 The White House said on Monday it was pursuing a last-ditch
plan with Congress to raise the U.S. debt ceiling and avert a
default that could plunge global financial markets into chaos. 
 
 ""Eventually, the U.S. will achieve a resolution to lift the
debt ceiling, which will further weaken the dollar,"" said Wang.

 A weaker dollar makes oil and other commodities more
affordable for holders of other currencies, and gold rose
further after the 1 percent rise overnight. 
 Brent is biased to fall to $110 per barrel as a bearish
double-top is likely to be confirmed, while U.S. oil will be
neutral in $94.50-$97.90 per barrel, according to Reuters
technical analyst Wang Tao. 
 
 IEA, OIL STOCKS	
 Oil was also supported by expectations that the
International Energy Agency (IEA) would not release
emergency stocks for the second time so soon. 
 This was because there was no sign yet of the kind of
shortage to mandate another dip into the West's emergency oil
reserves when a 30-day deadline for assessing the impact of a
first release expires at the end of this week, traders and
analysts said. 
 For another IEA release to take place, it would have to be
endorsed by all 28 members of the energy consumer body. Germany
and Italy are likely to resist any plans for a second release
for now, a French government source told Reuters last week.

 Investors were also focusing on a decline in crude
stockpiles in the U.S., where inventories are likely to have
fallen by 1.3 million barrels last week due to higher refinery
utilization and a slide in imports, a Reuters poll showed ahead
of weekly reports. 
 Participants were also watching China, where
refined oil product stocks at the end of June increased nearly 1
million tonnes from a year earlier and were at a normal level,
after fuel consumption slowed down since mid-April, a government
report showed on Tuesday. 
 ""China demand will have quite an impact on Brent as it buys
a lot of Brent related crude oil. Chinese refiners usually need
sweet crude from West Africa,"" said a North Asian trader. 
 
 EURO ZONE	
 Governments and banks in Europe struggled to reconcile
competing proposals for a second bailout of Greece on Monday,
three days before leaders meet to prevent the crisis from
spreading through the region. 
 The euro zone summit scheduled for Thursday in Brussels is
likely to agree on a rescue of Greece, supplementing a 110
billion euro ($154 billion) bailout launched in May last year, a
French government spokeswoman said. 
 But after three weeks of preparatory talks, it was unclear
how a consensus could be reached for private owners of Greek
government bonds -- banks, insurers and other investors -- to
contribute by taking cuts in the face value of their holdings.

 The dollar softened versus the euro and a basket of

some ground after losses in the previous session on worries that
the euro zone debt crisis will worsen. The dollar index fell
more than 20 percent to around 75.316. 
 The White House said on Monday it was pursuing a last-ditch

 SINGAPORE, July 19 (Reuters) - Gold held steady below its
record high on Tuesday, on course for a 12th straight day of
gains, as growing sovereign debt worries on either side of the
Atlantic continued to support sentiment.	
 Gold's safe-haven appeal is likely to be extended, as euro
zone's debt crisis is far from being solved, while the White
House was pursuing a fallback plan with Congress to raise the
U.S. debt ceiling and avert a default that could plunge global
financial markets into chaos. 
 Spot gold rose to as high as $1,606.70 an ounce, just
a hair off the record high of $1,607.01 hit on Monday. It was
trading at $1,605.16 by 0606 GMT, up 0.1 percent.	
 U.S. gold  edged up 0.2 percent to $1,606.10.	
 ""If we do see some progress in the debt ceiling talks, it
could encourage profit-taking by short-term investors,"" said Ong
Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures.	
 The markets were also closely monitoring developments in
Europe, where governments and banks struggled to reconcile
competing proposals for a second bailout of Greece on Monday,
three days before leaders meet to prevent the crisis from
spreading through the region. 
 For the longer term gold's outlook remained bright,
targeting $1,650 to $1,700 by the end of the year, Ong added.	
 Gold was on course for a 12th session of gains, its longest
winning stretch in at least four decades. But technical analysis
suggested that gold could face a sharp correction once hitting a
short-term target of $1,613, Reuters market analyst Wang Tao
said.

 Investment interest in bullion grew as prices pushed higher.
Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's biggest
gold-backed exchange-traded fund, gained 1.1 percent to
1,249.352 tonnes by July 17, highest in six months. 
 On Asia's physical market, scrap sellers took advantage of
record prices and buyers stood on the sidelines, dealers said.	
 ""Buyers are hesitant and waiting for a correction to
re-enter the market,"" said a Singapore-based dealer, adding that
premium for gold bars had halved from a week earlier to around
50 cents an ounce over London spot prices.	
 Spot silver was little changed at $40.54 an ounce,
off Monday's high of $40.70 -- its loftiest level since May 4.
U.S. silver  gained 0.6 percent to $40.58.	
 The gold-silver ratio, used to measure how many ounces of
silver can buy an ounce of gold, dropped to 39.58 on Monday, its
lowest since May 10. It was hovering near the level on Tuesday.

 NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - Gold marched to a record above $1,600 on
Monday, stretching its rally to an unprecedented eleventh day on fears that
U.S. lawmakers could fail to raise the debt ceiling to avert a default.
 Gold rallied even as the U.S. dollar strengthened, helping the precious
metal hit record highs versus the euro and sterling. The precious metal has
been on a solid footing since Europe started struggling to put together a
second bailout for Greece and contain the euro zone debt crisis.
 Bullion has gained 8 percent in 11 days as President Barack Obama and
Congress have failed to reach an agreement to raise the $14.3 trillion U.S.
borrowing limit with less than three weeks before the Aug. 2 deadline.
 Technical charts indicate gold should rise above $1,700 an ounce in the
next few months. [ID:nN1E76E1BR]
 ""What's coming out of these debt talks is that you are seeing a lot of
people focusing on the numbers and to understand the ramifications of debt
burden on countries,"" said Robert Lutts, chief investment officer of Cabot
Money Management, which manages more than $500 million in assets.
 ""A move to $2,000 in the next six to nine months is not that crazy in
gold,"" Lutts said.
 Spot gold  rose as high as $1,607.01 an ounce and was up 0.7
percent at $1,603.89 an ounce by 2:20 p.m. EDT (1820 GMT). It has now set
record highs in three out of the last four sessions. It rallied 10 straight
days in 1970.
 U.S. gold futures  for August delivery settled up $12.30 at
$1,602.40 an ounce after trading between $1,591.40 and $1,607.90. Volume
came to 130,000 lots, sharply lower than turnover during last week's
rallies to then-record highs.
 While gold has increased over sixfold from just $250 in 2001, the metal
remains one of the few commodities which has not surpassed its
inflation-adjusted records -- with bullion's adjusted all-time high at
above $2,300 set in 1980.
 The relative strength index for gold rose above 70, often seen as a
sign of overextension. Some said that gold's extreme valuation is hindering
its ability to rise further and perform as a safe haven.
 ""If there is a plan put in place for the reduction of the U.S. deficit,
gold's going to get knocked hard on that,"" said Jason Pride, director of
investment strategy at Glenmede, a wealth management firm with $20 billion
in assets.

 Gold rose to record highs across a number of major currencies, namely

 With the United States and Europe not yet resolving their debt

crude oil futures also fell sharply.
 With five days until President Barack Obama's deadline for a deal to
raise the U.S. debt ceiling, two ratings agencies already have warned of a
credit rating downgrade in the event of a U.S. default.
 Market watchers fear such a move could send interest rates soaring and
erode the U.S. dollar's reserve currency status, which would be a huge
boost for gold.
 Michael Cuggino, portfolio manager of Permanent Portfolio Funds with
$14 billion in assets, however, said that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke's comment on possible more market stimulus last week and the euro
zone debt fears are lifting gold more than the U.S. debt talks.
 Among the platinum group metals, spot platinum  was up 1.3
percent at $1,771 an ounce, while spot palladium  was up 2.8 percent
at $792.47 an ounce.

 * Gold rallies to record highs in five key currencies
 * Investors fret over euro zone, U.S. debt
 * Silver climbs to highest since early May

 By Jan Harvey	
 July 18 (Reuters) - Gold prices rallied to record highs
above $1,600 an ounce in Europe on Monday as investors spooked
by the euro zone debt crisis and the threat of a U.S. default
bought into the metal as a haven from risk.	
 Risk aversion swept the markets after euro zone stress test
results failed to address the potential for a Greek sovereign
debt default before a summit in Brussels on Thursday, and as a
deadline to raise the $14.3 trillion U.S. debt ceiling loomed.	
 Stock markets, peripheral euro zone debt, oil prices and the
euro came under pressure, while the Swiss franc -- often seen as
a safe haven -- and precious metals climbed.	
 Spot gold rose as high as $1,602.86 an ounce and was
up 0.4 percent at $1,600.26 an ounce at 1310 GMT. Gold rose more
than 3 percent for a second straight week to Friday, a feat it
has not achieved since February 2009.	
 ""Gold has room to go up. The smouldering debt crisis in the
euro zone peripheral countries and the uncertainty over the debt
limit in the United States are currently supporting prices,""
said Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann.	
 ""It seems gold will stay well supported unless we get a real
and convincing solution from the extraordinary EU summit that
takes place on Thursday.""	
 European shares fell sharply as long-awaited bank stress
test results only intensified worries about the regional debt
crisis, while U.S. stock index futures slumped. 
 Sovereign default fears are growing in both Europe and the
United States. The United States is struggling with deficit
reduction talks ahead of the White House's July 22 deadline on a
deal to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.	
 Gold prices backed off from the $1,600 an ounce level only
briefly after U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner expressed
confidence that Congress would raise the debt ceiling and said
Republicans had taken ""default off the table."" 
 On the foreign exchange markets, the euro slid 0.5 percent
against the dollar. Gold rallied across a number of major
currencies, also hitting record highs in euro, sterling, South
African rand and Canadian dollar terms. 
 But while it has risen 12.5 percent in dollar terms this
year and 7.2 percent in euros, gold has fallen 1.4 percent when
priced in Swiss francs. 
 ""Investors are increasingly looking to gold as a safe haven
as the U.S. dollar, pound sterling and the euro continue to
devalue against stronger currencies such as those of Canada,
Australia, Norway and Switzerland,"" said Angelos Damaskos, chief
executive of Sector Investment Managers.

 PERIPHERAL DEBT YIELDS RISE	
 The cost of insuring peripheral euro zone debt against
default jumped to record highs as contagion spread on investor
concern over the failure of policymakers to quickly resolve the
region's debt crisis. 
 Meanwhile data from U.S. futures regulator the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission showed on Friday that managed money
sharply raised bullish bets in U.S. gold futures and options in
the week ended July 12 as bullion prices rallied.	
 ""CFTC data shows a surge into gold, so despite the higher
levels the professionals have returned to gold with a
vengeance,"" said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen.

 U.S. gold futures  for August delivery were up $10.90
an ounce at $1,601.00, having peaked at $1,603.80.	
 Other precious metals tracked gold higher, with silver
rising above $40 an ounce for the first time since early May.
The grey metal rallied to a record $49.51 an ounce in April
before correcting sharply.	
 It has rallied more than 15 percent in the last two weeks,
however, as gold prices have risen.	
 Silver peaked at $40.44 an ounce and was later bid at
$40.37 an ounce against $39.27. Spot platinum was bid at
$1,766.24 an ounce versus $1,748, while spot palladium
was at $788.22 an ounce against $771.

 By David Sheppard
 NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices fell on
Monday due to growing fears of a sovereign debt default on
either side of the Atlantic and on the possibility of another
emergency stock release from the International Energy Agency.
 Policymakers in Europe and the United States have offered
no clear solutions to their respective debt problems, forcing
investors into perceived 'safe havens' like gold, which rallied
to a record high above $1,600 an ounce. [GOL/]
 ""People are cautious about what's happening, especially in
Europe where some see the debt crisis worsening,"" said Joachim
Azria, analyst at Credit Suisse in New York.
 ""The oil market has been volatile over the past month and
with the focus on the debt problems in Europe traders are
moving into 'wait and see' mode during the summer lull.""
 Brent crude futures  touched a low of $114.66 but
pared just under half those losses to settle down $1.21 at
$116.05 a barrel. U.S. crude , meanwhile, tracked
weakness on Wall Street, losing $1.31 to settle at $95.93 a
barrel, off an earlier low of $94.69.
 Brent crude oil slipped below the 100-day moving average at
$116.29, a key technical indicator for traders that supported
the market throughout last week. Technical analysts said U.S.
crude looked even weaker, falling to within touching distance
of the 200-day moving average at $94.15 a barrel.
 Trading volumes were light at 30 and 41 percent below the
30-day average for U.S. crude and Brent respectively.

Thursday at a summit in Brussels would agree on a rescue of
Greece, supplementing a 110 billion euro ($154 billion) bailout
launched in May last year. [ID:nLDE76H071]
 But after three weeks of preparatory talks, it was unclear
whether a consensus could be reached on a way for private
owners of Greek government bonds -- banks, insurers and other
investors -- to contribute to the bailout by taking cuts in the
face value of their holdings.
 In the United States, Republican and Democratic lawmakers
scrambled to avoid a government debt default as the Treasury
approached the statutory $14.3 trillion limit on borrowing
 But while there were few signs of concrete progress as the
Aug. 2 deadline draws dangerously close, most analysts still
say they expect a deal to be struck in time. [ID:nUSBUDGET]
 ""The lingering debt ceiling crisis in the U.S. is not as
serious (as in Europe), as in a worst case scenario politicians
will make only marginal cuts and run for cover, thus providing
themselves with 'the out' they need in order to raise the debt
ceiling,"" analysts at MF Global said in a note to clients.
 The euro  fell back toward $1.40 against the dollar
while the dollar index was up by 0.3 percent against a basket
of currencies <.DXY>. A stronger dollar tends to weigh on
commodities priced in the greenback.
 However, the spread between Brent and U.S. crude
 rose to about $20 a barrel, with exchange and
regulator data showing hedge funds and other large investors
taking a more bullish view of Brent in the week to last
Tuesday. [CFTC/]
 Speculators increased net-long futures and options
positions in both contracts but by only 2 percent in U.S. crude
compared with 20 percent in Brent. [ID:nL6E7II1ZP]
 EMERGENCY STOCK RELEASE II?
 The International Energy Agency (IEA), the West's oil
watchdog, is expected to confer with its member countries by
July 23 to decide whether to draw further on emergency oil
stocks, a move that requires the backing of all 28 members.
Last month, member countries agreed to release 60 million
barrels, only the third such move in the IEA's history, in a
bid to calm the near 20 percent in Brent prices since the start
of the civil war in Libya.
 The IEA stock release drove Brent down to $102.28 on June
27, but now prices are at a similar level to where the
front-month contract was trading when the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) failed to agree on a
collective output increase on June 8.
 ""Another release might not be imminent but they could
decide on another release by the beginning of September,"" said
Azria at Credit Suisse.
 ""The full take up of the 30 million barrels offered in the
United States could provide the incentive for a further
release."" [IEA/M]

 By Seng Li Peng	
 SINGAPORE, July 18 (Reuters) - Brent crude dipped below $117
a barrel on Monday as the ongoing debt crises in Europe and the
United States kept skittish investors away from risky assets,
while the possibility of a second IEA oil release also weighed
on sentiment.	
 Policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic have offered no
clear solutions to markets on their respective debt problems,
keeping investors risk averse.	
 Brent  fell 31 cents to $116.95 a barrel at 0354 GMT,
while U.S. crude eased 22 cents to $97.02 a barrel. 
 The International Energy Agency, which needs the backing of
all 28 members if it is to pour more oil on a volatile crude
market, is expected to confer with its member countries by July
23 to decide whether to draw further on emergency oil stocks.
Last month, member countries released 60 million barrels, only
the third such move in the IEA's history. 
 The IEA stock release had driven Brent prices down to
$102.28 on June 27, but now prices are at a similar level to
where the front-month contract was trading when the Organization
of the Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to agree on a
collective output increase on June 8. 
 ""It is too early for the IEA to release stocks for the
second time within such a short time,"" said Serene Lim of ANZ
bank. ""In the previous release, there were some countries that
were not producing or releasing the stipulated amount."" 
 Republican and Democratic senators sought on Sunday to craft
a plan that could avert an unprecedented default by the top oil
consumer Unites States while making modest cuts in the deficit. 
 But there were few signs of progress as the Aug. 2 deadline
to avoid a default drew dangerously close.	
 
 In Europe, 8 of 90 banks failed ""stress tests"" performed to
determine if they could withstand a long recession. Expectations
were for up to 15 banks to fall short. 
 But the better-than-expected results of the stress test
failed to dispel the broader gloom sweeping across markets.

 Global consumer confidence fell in the second quarter to its
lowest level in a year and a half as an uncertain economic
outlook, a deepening euro zone debt crisis and rising inflation
made people more cautious, a survey showed. 
 But confidence was lowest in euro zone countries engulfed by
the debt crisis with Greece coming bottom of the global ranking,
it said. 
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Sunday for private
investors to make a major contribution to bailing out Greece, as
pressure rose for radical action to cut the country's debt
burden. 
 
 SYRIA, YEMEN UNREST	
 With debt issues at the forefront, investors put the
persisting political unrest in Syria and Yemen behind them.	
 Syrian tanks had surrounded a town near the border with
Iraq's Sunni heartland on Sunday after thousands of people,
emboldened by defections among security forces, took to the
streets there denouncing President Bashar al-Assad.

 In Yemen, forces backed by armed tribesmen launched an
offensive to retake Zinjibar, capital of southern Abyan
province, officials said on Sunday, after months of fighting
with Islamist militants who seized the city. 
 Dozens have been killed and some 54,000 civilians have fled
Abyan, which has descended into daily bloodshed as the army
confronts militants the government says have ties to al Qaeda.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, July 18 (Reuters) - Spot gold touched a record
high on Monday, on track for its longest winning run in at least
four decades, reflecting persistent worries about the euro zone
debt crisis and a growing threat of a U.S. government default.	
 Spot gold rose to an all-time peak of $1,598.41 and
U.S. gold  hit a record high of $1,599.20.	
 The appetite for bullion as a safe storage of value
increased, as Republicans and Democrats sought to craft a plan
that could avert an unprecedented government default, which
might wreak havoc in global markets and send the world's top
economy back to recession. 
 Adding to worries about the economic growth, U.S. consumer
confidence hit a near 2-1/2-year low in early July and
manufacturing output stalled in June. 
 ""The political uncertainties in the United States and Europe
will be an ongoing theme and safe-haven demand will continue,""
said Natalie Robertson, a commodities analyst at ANZ.	
 Robertson expected gold to reach $1,650 in the short term on
macro concerns and chart strength, but added that volatility may
increase as the deadline for the U.S. debt ceiling talks on Aug.
2 draws close.	
 
 Spot gold edged up 0.2 percent to $1,596.20 an ounce by 0612
GMT, on course for an 11th straight session of gains, its
longest winning stretch in at least four decades.	
 U.S. gold  gained 0.4 percent to $1,596.70.	
 Results of stress tests of 90 banks across the European
Union were better than expected, but failed to impress investors
who continue to worry about the possibility of contagion of debt
crisis in the region.	
 ""This move in gold still has momentum, as Europe is burning
to the ground,"" said a U.S.-based trader.	
 Technical analysis also pointed to a bullish picture. Spot
gold has resumed its medium-term uptrend and would rise towards
$1,613, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 Indicating increased appetite in bullion, speculators
sharply raised their bullish bets in U.S. gold futures and
options last week as prices rallied, data from the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed. 
 Holdings at the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest
gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose nearly 1 percent to
1,236.013 tonnes, highest since late January. 
 ""Gold prices have hit fresh highs across several currencies
on macro unease, the dollar weakening and the escalation of
European sovereign debt uncertainty creating a favourable
backdrop,"" said Barclays Capital in a research note.	
 ""We expect prices to test new highs despite the seasonal
weakness in demand.""	
 Spot silver hit $39.95, its highest since May 4. It
was trading at $39.84, up 1.5 percent, leading the year-to-date
performance in the precious metals complex with a 29-percent
gain .	
 U.S. silver  gained 2 percent to $39.87.	
 The gold-silver ratio, used to measure how many ounces of
silver can buy an ounce of gold, declined to 40.10, its lowest
since end of May.

 NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - Gold eked out a tenth
straight gain on Friday, matching a record winning streak set
four decades ago, as some began to seek a hedge against the
growing threat of a catastrophic U.S. government default.
 A rally that ignited two weeks ago when euro zone debt
fears revived has extended its run into record territory this
week as President Barack Obama and Republicans traded demands
for a serious deficit plan, deepening a stalemate in
negotiations to raise the U.S. debt limit before Aug. 2.
 Gains in crude oil, a plunge in U.S. consumer confidence
and concerns about euro zone debt contagion also helped the
metal to its largest two-week gain in over two years, rising
more than 7 percent since the start of July.
 ""The longer the debt talk drags on, the more you would want
to own a safe haven like gold. The crude oil market is also
rallying quite nicely, and that's a big element in support for
gold,"" said James Steel, chief commodity analyst at HSBC.
 Spot gold  was up 0.3 percent at $1,591.50 an ounce
by 3:10 p.m. EDT (1910 GMT). It failed to hit a new peak after
rallying to all-time highs in the previous two sessions, but
stayed near the record of $1,594.16 hit on Thursday.
 U.S. gold futures  for August delivery settled up 80
cents at $1,590.10 an ounce, after trading between $1,576 and
$1,592.80. Trading volume reached 120,000 lots, sharply lower
than turnover in the previous two sessions.
 Spot silver  gained 2.2 percent to $39.02 an ounce,
near a two-month high of $39.34 set on Thursday.
 Gold should rise to record highs above $1,700 an ounce in
the next few months, based on technical charts. One analyst
said that in theory, it could reach a shocking $5,000 an ounce
should equity markets correct sharply.

 UNTHINKABLE
 Most financial markets have thus far shown few signs of
preparing for the once-unthinkable scenario under which
Washington would be unable to pay its bills beyond August.
 But a series of rating warnings this week has focused minds
on the possibility -- though still deemed remote -- of a
default that could jeopardize the dollar's reserve-currency
status and increase bullion's safe-haven appeal.
 Republicans in the House of Representatives said they would
vote next week on a bill to raise the debt ceiling by the $2.4
trillion Obama has requested as long as Congress adopts a
balanced-budget amendment -- an unlikely prospect.
[ID:nN1E76D26R]
 Bullion prices held onto small gains after an industry
health check aimed at reviving investor confidence showed that
eight European banks are not strong enough to withstand a
prolonged recession and need to raise 2.5 billion euros in
capital. [ID:nL9E7G9005]
 Gold's gains appeared limited after U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday the central bank was
prepared to act if the recovery faltered, but made clear the
Fed was not at that point. [ID:nN1E76D0LM]
 GOLD CHARTS POINT TO OVER $1,700
 Gold should rise to record highs above $1,700 an ounce in
the next few months based on the size of its past rallies and
Fibonacci number projections, technical analysts said.
 Gold could rise to an area between $1,870 and $5,000, with
the top end of the forecast based on a ratio of bullion's
performance to the Dow Jones industrial average if there were
another shock similar to the Great Depression, research firm
Capital Economics said in a note.
 Growth in the bullion holdings of SPDR Gold Trust ,
the largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), has lagged
the price gain of the metal. During gold's 10-day rally, the
ETF was up less than 20 tonnes to 1,225.4 tonnes, or below 1.5
percent, far from a record 1,320.4 tonnes set in June 2010.
 HSBC's Steel said the rate of increase in bullion holdings
often slows as an ETF is maturing in its product cycle. The
SPDR Gold Trust was launched in 2004.
 Spot platinum  fell 0.4 percent to $1,754.24 an ounce
and palladium  rose 0.6 percent to $777.47 an ounce.

early July to its lowest level in more than two years and

 Oil prices rose on Wednesday after U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman told a U.S. House congressional panel that the central
gbank stood ready to ease monetary policies if the economy
weakens further.
 But on Thursday prices fell back after Bernanke, in a
separate testimony to a Senate panel, doused expectations of a
new round of easing, dubbed QE3, saying the Fed was not yet
ready to do so and citing recent inflationary pressures.
 With Friday's crop of unfavorable economic data, however,
some market pundits have raised the argument that those bleak
reports precisely could be the fodder for QE3.
 ""In my view, the disappointing economic data, the Empire
Manufacturing Index and Consumer Confidence, would seem to
support and give the Federal Reserve cover for another round of
quantitative easing and its commoditiy inflation effects,"" said

 By Pratima Desai	
 LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - Gold slipped on Friday
undermined by growing perceptions further stimulus measures from
the United States were unlikely and by a higher dollar against
the euro, which was under pressure from concern about the
results of European bank stress tests.	
 Spot gold was bid at $1,581.10 a troy ounce at 1126
GMT from $1,586.75 an ounce late in New York on Thursday when
the precious metal hit a record high of $1,594.16.	
 U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday
the central bank is prepared to act if the recovery falters. But
Bernanke also made clear the Fed was not at that point.

 ""We're of the view that the U.S. doesn't need (further
monetary easing), that U.S. growth will accelerate and that QE3
won't be needed,"" said Dan Smith, analyst at Standard Chartered.	
 ""Strong demand growth in Asia, high inflation in Asia and a
dollar under pressure will support gold in the medium term.""	
 Gold is also used to protect investment portfolios against
inflation, which could be fuelled by excess liquidity.	
 The Fed's $600 billion bond purchase programme that ended in
June -- dubbed QE2 -- pumped large amounts of cash into the
global financial system, much of which found its way to
commodities sparking a sharp price rally.	
 
 SCRAP SUPPLY MORE THAN NORMAL	
 ""The biggest risk to gold at current record prices is not
just investors banking profits - as some did after Fed Chairman
Bernanke poured a little cold water on QE3 expectations
yesterday - but also the threat of a sizeable upswing in scrap
supply,"" UBS said in a note.	
 ""For the past 12 months or more, scrap sales have been
moderate, never reaching a level to significantly impact rising
gold prices. But feedback from our refining contacts this week
indicates that current scrap flow is noticeably above normal
levels.""	
 The euro fell against the dollar as investors worried that
European bank stress tests may reveal things that could further
sour sentiment towards the single currency. 
 The European Banking Authority at 1600 GMT publishes the
results of its stress tests of 91 lenders along with measures to
bolster capital for those that failed and for those that nearly
failed. 
 ""There's been some profit-taking, using the dollar, euro and
stress tests as an excuse,"" a gold trader said. ""The market
seems to be ignoring the chances of a U.S. debt default.""	
 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's warned there is a
one-in-two chance it could cut the United States' prized AAA
credit rating if a deal on raising the government's debt ceiling
is not agreed soon. 
 Holdings of the largest gold-backed exchange-traded-fund
(ETF), New York's SPDR Gold Trust and that of the largest
silver-backed ETF, New York's iShares Silver Trust
remained unchanged. 
 Spot silver was bid at $38.09 an ounce from $38.18 late on
Thursday when it saw $39.34 an ounce, its highest since May 11.	
 ""We see the silver market as being very vulnerable to swings
in risk appetite as the primary silver market is in surplus,""
Credit Suisse private banking said in a note.	
 ""In light of persisting sovereign debt woes, we consider
gold as a safer place to be compared to silver.""

 LONDON, July 15 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday after
ratings agency Standard & Poor's warned it may cut the credit
rating of top energy consumer the United States, capping a
volatile week marked by concern about the country's deficit and
the euro zone's debt.	
 Brent crude for September  was down 58 cents to
$115.68 a barrel by 1001 GMT, after the expiry of the August
contract on Thursday at $118.32.	
 U.S. crude  was down 11 cents at $95.58, after falling
more than $2 on Thursday.	
 S&P joined Moody's Investors Service in putting the U.S. on
negative watch, warning that there was a one-in-two chance it
could cut the prized triple-A rating within the next 90 days if
a deal to raise the government's debt ceiling is not struck by
the White House and Republicans. 
 In addition, mid-week comments by Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke had raised hopes the U.S. central bank would embark
on a third round of economic stimulus, but on Thursday he said
the Fed was not yet ready to take action because inflation was
higher than in late 2010.	
 ""It is overall economic concerns that are driving the oil
price this morning,"" said Eugen Weinberg, a senior commodity
analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.	
 ""The prospects of quantitative easing III were put on ice
for some time and we also had a warning from S&P that if the
debt ceiling isn't agreed over the next few days a downgrade of
U.S. debt is likely."" 
 Thorbjorn Bak Jensen, oil analyst at Global Risk Management
said he believed a solution would be found, ""otherwise there is
still the possibility that Obama can veto his way through
Congress with only one third of the votes"".	
 President Barack Obama has given congressional leaders a
weekend deadline to find a way to raise the U.S. debt ceiling,
but a divide over spending and taxes remains a huge hurdle to a
deficit-cutting deal.

 With another busy day ahead for U.S. economic data, Weinberg
said the market would be looking for signs of weakness that
might increase the likelihood of further quantitative easing.	
 In Europe investors awaited the results of the stress test
for 90 banks due at 1600 GMT, which could force some to seek
state aid. .	
 Policymakers and bankers are also examining radical
proposals to rescue Greece such as a sharp cut in its debt
burden, ways to prop up banks and a new emphasis on boosting
Greek growth, official and banking sources say. 
 However, Olivier Jakob, oil analyst at Petromatrix argued it
was difficult to find enough inputs in the oil fundamentals to
put a position on, and he expects to see a slower trading day
today. 
 The market is also weighing the possibility of a second
round of strategic oil reserve releases, after the U.S. was
reported to be considering it.	
 Germany and Italy are likely to oppose a second release a
French government source said on Friday. 
 Analysts like Commerzbank's Weinberg believe the market is
well-supplied, a view reiterated by Iran's caretaker oil
minister, who said there is plenty of oil to satisfy global
demand and no need to increase production. 
 Britain's largest oilfield, Buzzard, should return to full
output in August, its operator Nexen said on Thursday, boosting
supply of the North Sea crude that helps to set the global Brent
oil benchmark.

weaker dollar after Standard & Poor's warned it may lower the

volatile week marked by concern about the U.S. deficit and the
euro zone's debt.	
 U.S. crude , up 58 cents at $96.27 a barrel by 0229
GMT, fell more than $2 on Thursday and was poised to end the
week little changed after tumbling below $94 on Tuesday and
topping $99 on Wednesday.	
 Brent crude for September  added 29 cents to $116.55
after the expiry of the August contract on Thursday at $118.32.
The dollar weakened by about 0.3 percent against a basket of
currencies.

Informa Global Markets in Singapore.	
 ""At this point, there won't be another round of stimulus
because the U.S. is still growing. I believe the impasse in the
debt ceiling is not going to last very long. Politicians play
hard ball until the last minute, but there will be a
resolution.""	
 President Barack Obama concluded a round of U.S. debt talks
on Thursday by sending lawmakers back to Congress to gauge
support for a deal. 
 The U.S. Treasury has warned that it will run out of money
to pay the country's bills after Aug. 2 if the $14.3 trillion
borrowing limit is not raised. Failure to seal a deal by then
could cause turmoil in global financial markets and plunge the
U.S. into another recession.	
 Bernanke warned on Thursday that overzealous cuts to
government spending in the short term could derail a shaky
recovery and said a U.S. debt default could wreak financial
havoc. 
 The number of Americans claiming initial unemployment
benefits dropped last week but remained elevated and retail
sales barely rose in June, suggesting the economy will struggle
to regain speed in the second half.

 NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell for the first
time in three days on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke said the central bank was not ready yet to take
more monetary easing measures, dashing hopes that energy demand
would get a boost from fresh economic stimulus.
 Bernanke, in a second day of congressional testimony,
repeated his statement that the Fed stood ready to take more
action should the economy weaken further. But he also said that
inflation was higher now than it was late last year, so the Fed
is not ready yet to take action.
 That caveat boosted the dollar, which erased losses against
most major currencies. This, in turn, prompted selling of oil
futures as a stronger greenback encourages investors to cut
down on holdings of risky assets. [USD/] <.DXY>
 ""The big headline today for the oil market is Bernanke's
qualification of what some expected to be QE3,"" said David
Kirsch at PFC Energy. Many had expected the Fed to boost the
economy with a third round of government bond buying, or
quantitative easing, QE3 in market shorthand.
 ""But we're also looking at a market with very weak economic
prospects, as well as concerns about the US debt limit talks
and the euro zone situation,"" Kirsch added.
 Wall Street also extended a decline after Bernanke's latest
comments and a broad array of commodities fell as the dollar
recovered, although gold hit another record on safe-haven
buying. [.N] [MKTS/GLOB]
 U.S. crude for August delivery  settled at $95.69 a
barrel, falling $2.36, after rising to $98.88 early.
 In London, ICE Brent August crude  expired at
$118.32, falling 46 cents, well off a session high of $119.40.
 The ICE September contract  closed at $116.26, down
$1.59, with a $2.06 discount against August, the widest spread
Brent front-month spread since June 15. .
 Brent's premium over U.S. crude, also known as West Texas
Intermediate, stood at $22.63, after soaring to a record
$23.57, erasing the previous high of $23.34 hit on June 15,

733.364 contracts, up 6 percent from the 30-day average. In
London, Brent crude volume was at 421,895 lots, down 23 percnt
from the 30-day average.
 ECONOMIC WORRIES HURT U.S. CRUDE MORE
 Crude slid on economic pessimism after Moody's Investor
Service warned late Wednesday that it might strip the United
States of its gold-plated credit rating in coming weeks if the
$14.3 trillion limit on America's borrowing was not raised.
 Investors were jittery as negotiations between the White
House and Congress remained heated over a deal that would allow
the borrowing limit to be raised by Aug. 2.
 In London, North Sea supply issues beset Brent in recent
days, but price pressure eased on Thursday after news that the
200,000-barrels-per-day Buzzard oilfield, Britain's largest,
should turn to full output in August. [ID:nL6E7IE0SX]
 Oil prices rebounded early Thursday after U.S. data showed
a drop in initial jobless claims last week and a surprise
retail sales rise in June, shoring up hopes for oil demand.
[ID:nN1E76D0PA]
 First time filings for state unemployment insurance fell
22,000 last week to 405,000, better than expected, but above
the 400,000 benchmark for a stable labor market.
 Retail sales rose slightly, thanks to higher auto dealers
receipts.
 On other market factors, lingering worries about the euro
zone debt crisis continued to keep investors cautious.
 Despite the day's losses, crude futures still retain a big
portion of gains recouped after prices fell to four-month lows
following the June 23 announcement from the International
Energy Agency of a coordinate move to release 60 million
barrels from members' emergency reserves.
 U.S. crude was still up 5 percent while Brent crude
retained gains of about 10 percent after rebounding following
the IEA action.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Gold hit a second consecutive
record high on Thursday as mounting concerns over a worsening
euro zone debt crisis and fears of U.S. default powered the
metal's longest winning streak in five years.
 Bullion notched a ninth straight day of gains, the longest
since October 2006, and one shy of its best streak in over four
decades. The precious metal has risen more than 7 percent since
its winning streak began.
 Analysts forecast gold would extend its rally further, with
one saying it could reach $2,000 an ounce. A Reuters poll
showed gold prices should average $1,550 an ounce in 2012.
 Gold pared gains after hitting a record near $1,600 as the
dollar reversed losses after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke crushed speculation that another round of monetary
easing was on the way.
 ""The dollar, which is so oversold ... went through a
reversal against every currency, and gold is caught up with
that,"" said James Dailey, portfolio manager of the TEAM Asset
Strategy Fund, which oversees $200 million in assets.
 Spot gold  touched a record $1,594.16, and was up 0.3
percent at $1,586.11 an ounce by 3:05 p.m. EDT (1905 GMT).
 U.S. gold futures  for August delivery settled up
$3.80 an ounce at $1,589.30, after trading between $1,579.40
and $1,594.90.
 U.S. futures trading volume topped 200,000 lots for a
second day, in line with its 30-day average and one of the
busiest days since May, as investors switched their focus back
to gold from equities.
 Tom Fitzpatrick, chief technical strategist at CitiFX, said
gold could rise to a record between $1,700 and $1,750 in the
next two to three months based on momentum and past rallies.
 The metal's next technical resistance comes at $1,660, near
a channel top dating from its rally that started in August
2010.

 The metal was underpinned by safe-haven demand as euro zone
countries grappled with the issue of involving the private
sector in tackling Greece's debt pile. Investors fear the
crisis could hit Italy, one of the region's largest economies.
 Gold was weakened with commodities and other risk assets
after Bernanke reiterated that the Fed would be ready to inject
more money into the system should the U.S. economy worsen, but
said the time had not come yet.
 The metal may surge to $2,000 if the Fed starts a third
round of U.S. debt purchases, Michael Pento, a senior economist
at Euro Pacific Capital Inc, said. ""People will be forced into
buying gold,"" Pento said.

growing pressure at home and from the United States' biggest
foreign creditor, China, on Thursday to stop deficit talks from

 The dollar's reserve-currency status would be severely
undermined and that would boost gold if the country defaults on
Aug. 2, the U.S. imposed deadline to raise the debt limit.
 Looking forward, a poll of 15 analysts conducted by Reuters
in the past two weeks has returned a median forecast that gold
prices will average $1,550 an ounce in 2012. [ID:nL6E7ID2BV]
 Silver  rose 0.8 percent to $38.55 an ounce, building
on the previous session's near 6 percent rise, its best one-day
performance in over two months.
 The gold:silver ratio -- the number of silver ounces needed
to buy an ounce of gold -- eased to its lowest since late May
at around 40.
 Among platinum group metals, spot platinum  rose 0.7
percent to $1,763.74 an ounce, while spot palladium  rose
0.1 percent to $773.25 an ounce.

(Update after U.S. jobs, retail sales data)	
 By Ikuko Kurahone	
 London, July 14 (Reuters) - U.S. crude ticked up and Brent
pared losses in choppy trading on Thursday due to a weak dollar
and better-than-expected U.S. jobs and retail data.	
 By 1318 GMT, U.S. crude for August  was up 55 cents to
$98.60 a barrel, bouncing from an earlier low of $97.54.	
 August Brent , which expires later on Thursday, was
18 cents lower at $118.60 a barrel.	
 ""Especially in the United States, jobs data and retail data
have an impact on oil prices, because the U.S. is the largest
oil consumer,"" Andy Sommer, oil market analyst with EGL, said.	
 ""(The data) is not showing a deteriorating situation. Retail
sales were better than expected and jobless claims fell
slightly.""	
 New claims for U.S. unemployment benefits fell last week,
the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims dipped to 405,000
in the week ended July 9 from 427,000 the previous week.
Economists polled by Reuters had been looking for a smaller
decline to 415,000. 
 Still, the figure has remained above 400,000 for 14 straight
weeks, and the number of Americans still receiving unemployment
benefits rose slightly in the week. 
 
 The dollar fell broadly as Moody's Investors Service jolted
White House debt talks on Wednesday with a warning the U.S.
might lose its top credit rating in the coming weeks, piling
pressure on Washington to lift its debt ceiling.
 
 That followed comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke that the U.S. central bank was ready to ease monetary
policy further in what would be a third round of so-called
quantitative easing if economic growth and inflation slowed much
more. 
 ""The markets remain well supported. Bernanke's comment
yesterday alluding to possible QE3 will encourage people to hold
commodities if they believe in a weaker dollar,"" said Mark
Thomas, head of energy Europe with brokerage Marex Financial.

 BP PLATFORM FIRE	
 Trade volumes in European benchmark North Sea Brent crude
futures were thinner than in U.S. crude ahead of the August
contract expiry and because the credit warning dampened investor
sentiment in Europe over the United States, the world's largest
economy.	
 The euro zone has already been hit by a spate of downgrades.

 EGL's Sommer said Brent was under pressure also because of
an expected rise in output from UK's largest Buzzard oilfield
after months of underproduction. 
 However, the premium on Brent crude for August versus the
September contract has risen to around $1 a barrel this week as
North Sea oil supply might still remain tight due to a shut BP
oil platform.	
 BP halted oil output from the Valhall field in the
North Sea on Wednesday after a fire on its production platform
forced the evacuation of hundreds of workers, but the company
said there was no risk of an oil spill. 
 Valhall, which has pumped oil since the 1980s, has produced
around 31,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) in 2011, according to
the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.	
 Late in June, the August Brent contract was at a discount to
September after the International Energy Agency (IEA) announced
plans for the release of 60 million barrels of crude oil and oil
products into the market.

 By Alejandro Barbajosa	
 SINGAPORE, July 14 (Reuters) - Oil paused on Thursday after
Moody's placed the credit rating of top consumer the United
States under review for a downgrade, putting the brakes on a
rally sparked by the possibility of a new round of economic
stimulus. 
 U.S. crude for August  added 2 cents to $98.07 a
barrel by 0241 GMT, up almost 2 percent this week, while Brent
 advanced 12 cents to $118.90, about $8 below this year's
peak near $127.	
 Moody's Investors Service jolted White House debt talks on
Wednesday with a warning that the U.S. may lose its top credit
rating in the coming weeks, piling pressure on Washington to
lift its debt ceiling. 
 Earlier, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S.
central bank was ready to ease monetary policy further in what
would be a third round of so-called quantitative easing if
economic growth and inflation slowed much more. 
 ""People are still skeptical about Bernanke's comments,"" said
Tony Nunan, a risk manager with Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Corp.	
 ""With their hands tied by the budget, it seems to me they
would have a hard time pushing through with another round of
quantitative easing. If there is one, investors would come back
and there would be more financial demand for oil futures.""	
 The Fed's second round of quantitative easing, or looser
monetary policy to stimulate job creation and economic growth,
concluded at the end of June. A continuation of last week's
disappointing U.S. employment data may raise the need for a
third one.	
 ""Bernanke is making a brave statement,"" Nunan said. ""It's
important for him to come out and say they want to keep the
focus on job growth.""	
 Higher employment boosts fuel consumption. Average U.S.
gasoline demand in the last four weeks was down 0.9 percent from
year-ago levels, the Energy Information Administration said on
Wednesday.
 
 
 
 Oil prices on Wednesday also rose after government figures
showed U.S. crude inventories fell a bigger-than-expected 3.12
million barrels in the week to July 8. 
 Gasoline stocks fell by 840,000 barrels, the Energy
Information Administration said, compared with projections for a
200,000-barrel rise, while distillates, including heating oil
and diesel, rose 2.97 million barrels, more than seven times as
much as expected.	
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude widened to $22.74 on Wednesday
after closing at $20.32 a day earlier.  
 
 DEMAND GROWTH	
 World oil demand growth will accelerate next year, adding to
the pressure on available supplies, the International Energy
Agency said on Wednesday, contradicting a more conservative
outlook from producer group OPEC. 
 In its first 2012 forecast in a monthly report, the IEA said
oil use would grow by 1.47 million barrels per day (bpd) to 91
million bpd. The agency also trimmed its estimate of demand
growth this year to 1.20 million bpd.	
 ""As long as demand in developed nations doesn't tank or
crash, the market can still have good support because of demand
from emerging markets,"" Nunan said.	
 BP halted oil output from the Valhall field in the
North Sea on Wednesday after a fire on its production platform
forced the evacuation of hundreds of workers, but the company
said there was no risk of oil spills. 
 In other markets, the dollar fell on Thursday, sending gold
to a record high and offering some relief to the beleaguered
euro, while Asian stocks softened. 
 Euro zone plans for a leaders' summit on a second Greek
rescue were thrown into doubt by Germany on Wednesday, raising
fears markets may exploit the policy vacuum with a new onslaught
on the bloc's high debtors.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, July 14 (Reuters) - Spot gold hit a record high
above $1,589 on Thursday, buoyed by a sharp drop in the dollar
after Moody's warned the U.S. may lose its top credit rating,
the possibility of more Federal Reserve stimulus and Europe's
deepening debt crisis.	
 Spot gold rose to a record of $1,589.56 an ounce,
before easing to $1,584.51 by 0609 GMT. Gold was on course for
its ninth consecutive day of gains, matching a similar winning
streak in 2006.	
 U.S. gold  also hit a record at $1,590.80 an ounce.
It was trading at $1,585.30, little changed from the previous
close.	
 Sovereign debt concerns spread from the euro zone to the
United States, as Moody's threatened to cut the U.S. sovereign
credit rating as debt talks stalled in
Washington. 
 ""There is a lot of capital flight,"" said a Singapore-based
trader.	
 ""Lacking a really reliable destination, a lot of the funds
leaving the bonds market are going into precious metals on the
notion that their value will be retained even if policymakers
are pressured to go to further extremes to work against
contagion.""	
 
 Uncertainties around the U.S. debt talks, together with
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's comment on the potential
for further monetary easing, battered the dollar, helping
support commodities. 
 The ongoing euro zone debt crisis added to gold's lustre.
Fitch Ratings on Wednesday downgraded Greece deeper into junk
territory, citing the absence of a new and fully funded
financing program for the country. 
 ""Gold flourishes when there is uncertainty on the macro
side, and across the globe there are quite a few problematic hot
spots,"" said Xinyi Chen, an analyst at Barclays Capital.	
 Gold prices are likely to refresh the record highs in the
short term, with the immediate target at $1,600 within a stone's
shot, traders and analysts said.	
 ""There is so much disquiet about bond market that it is
likely to keep investors interested in precious metals,"" said
the Singapore-based trader, while warning that a price breakout
could trigger greater volatility.	
 The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, on spot gold hovered
around 70, seen as a technical sign that the market is
overbought.	
 Technical analysis suggested a bullish picture. Spot gold is
likely to rise to $1,613 an ounce, said Reuters market analyst
Wang Tao. 
 Spot silver rose to $38.61 per ounce, the highest
since May 31, before trading up 0.7 percent at $38.52, tracking
gains in bullion and extending the 5.6 percent rise in the
previous session.	
 U.S. silver  gained 1 percent to $38.56.

 NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - Oil futures rose for a second
day on Wednesday, as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
signaled more stimulus coming if the economy weakens, and U.S.
crude inventories fell more than expected last week.
 The dollar fell sharply, making oil and other commodities
more attractive, after Bernanke said the U.S. central bank was
ready to ease monetary policy further if the economy slows
further and inflation moves lower. [ID:nN1E76COKZ] [USD/]
 ""Bernanke's comments plus the EIA's crude stock draw pulled
up crude futures,"" said Chris Dillman, analyst at Tradition
Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
 In London, ICE Brent crude for August delivery 
settled at $118.79 a barrel, rising $1.03.
 U.S. August crude  closed at $98.05 a barrel, paring
gains to 62 cents, on a bout of profit-taking after hitting a
session high of $99.21.
 Brent's premium against U.S. crude widened to $22.74 after
closing at $20.32 on Tuesday. 
 Prices rose back up after earlier losses on worries about
euro zone debt and despite supportive data from China and a
forecast of strong demand growth from the Paris-based
International Energy Agency.
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic
crude inventories fell 3.1 million barrels last week, far more
than the forecast for a 1.8 million drawdown in a Reuters poll
and extending a supply decline to six straight weeks. [EIA/S]
 The U.S. dollar was down 0.78 percent against a basket of
currencies in late trading. <.DXY>
 BERNANKE COMMENTS RALLY MARKETS
 Wall Street rallied after a three-day sell-off as investors
cheered Bernanke's comments before a congressional panel while
an array of commodities gained after the dollar's hefty drop.
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> jumped
1.5 percent as oil and other commodities rose.
 In New York, U.S. gasoline futures  climbed to a
two-month high of $3.1750 a gallon, before settling at $3.1516,
gaining 5.34 cents, or 1.7 percent, pacing the energy markets.
 Gasoline soared after U.S. EIA's data showed an 800,000
barrel stocks drawdown, contrary to forecasts for a small
200,000 barrel rise.
 ""Prompt barrels on the New York Harbor have remained tight,
and that is what's pushing gasoline up, not necessarily
demand,"" said Tom Knight, trader at petroleum marketers Truman
Arnold in Texarkana, Texas.
 Euro zone plans for a leaders' summit on a second Greek
rescue were thrown into doubt by Germany on Wednesday, raising
fears markets may exploit the policy vacuum with a new
onslaught on the bloc's high debtors. [ID:nLDE76C0EI]

 Since falling to four-month lows after the IEA announced on
June 23 a coordinated move among its members to release 60
million barrels of emergency oil stocks, U.S. crude has bounced
back nearly 8 percent while Brent crude has rebounded almost 11
percent.
 China's second-quarter gross domestic product rose 9.5
percent from a year earlier, exceeding economists' forecasts
for 9.4 percent growth.

(Updates after IEA data, Bernanke comment)	
 By Ikuko Kurahone and Simon Falush	
 LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Crude futures turned positive on
Wednesday due to a larger than expected drop in U.S. crude
inventories and comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke that the central bank was ready to ease monetary policy
further.	
 Brent futures for August delivery  rose $1.35 to
$119.10 a barrel by 1514 GMT, rebounding from a low of $116.71
earlier.	
 U.S. crude  was trading $1.01 up at $98.44, after
touching a low of $96.53.	
 Analysts said crude oil futures pared losses, primarily
responding to Bernanke's remarks, and extended gains as weekly
data from the U.S. government showed a 3.12 million barrel drop
in crude oil stocks for the week to July 8. 
 The fall was larger than analysts' forecast of a 1.8 million
barrel drop and contrasted with Tuesday's data from the industry
group American Petroleum Institute (API), which reported a 2.3
million barrel build in crude stocks for the same week.	
 ""The numbers look bullish. The draws are a little
surprising, especially given last night's API numbers,"" said
Mark Kellstrom, senior analyst with Strategic Energy Research &
Capital in New Jersey.	
 Major U.S. stock indexes rose more than 1 percent and gold
hit a fresh record high following Bernanke's comment about more
monetary stimulus if a sluggish U.S. economy weakens further.
The dollar tumbled. 
 Worries about euro zone debt concerns kept oil prices in
negative territory earlier in the session, despite supportive
data from China and a forecast of strong demand growth from the
International Energy Agency. 
 Euro zone plans for a leaders' summit on a second Greek
rescue were thrown into doubt by Germany on Wednesday, raising
fears markets may exploit the policy vacuum with a new onslaught
on the bloc's high debtors.

 The IEA, the West's energy watchdog, predicted global oil
demand would rise next year to a hefty 91 million barrels per
day (bpd), outpacing a more conservative prediction by OPEC.

 SINGAPORE, July 13 (Reuters) - Spot gold was flat on
Wednesday, holding on to its 5-percent gain of the past seven
sessions and hovering near its record high as growing fears of a
euro zone debt contagion burnished its safe-haven appeal.	
 European Union leaders are poised to hold an emergency
summit after finance ministers acknowledged for the first time
that some form of Greek default may be needed to cut Athens'
debts and to stop contagion spreading to Italy and Spain.

 ""Investors are really fearful that the debt crisis will
spread to nations beyond Greece,"" said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst
at Phillip Futures.	
 ""We are in the climate of uncertainty -- there is the debt
crisis in Europe and the United States have not come to an
agreement on raising the debt ceiling while the August 2
deadline is approaching -- these will keep gold prices
supported.""	
 Spot gold was flat at $1,565.81 an ounce by 0617 GMT,
after hitting $1,572.96 in the previous session, barely $3 off
the all-time high of $1,575.79 set on May 2.	
 U.S. gold  edged up 0.3 percent to $1,566.60.	
 Technical analysis suggested signals for spot gold were
mixed, with the focus now on a resistance zone of
$1,575.79-$1,579, Reuters market analyst Wang Tao said.

 
 ""I can't see any reason for gold to stop being bullish,""
said a Singapore-based trader. ""Bullish and bearish economic
conditions both lead to plausible argument to buy gold.""	
 ""The main risk in the short term is that it might dip as
part of the commodities basket.""	
 Oil prices drifted lower after a surprise gain in U.S. crude
inventories and as concerns on Europe's fiscal conditions
weighed. Industrial metals and agricultural commodities held
steady.	
 Suggesting a return of investment appetite, holdings in the
SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest gold-backed
exchange-traded fund, jumped 1.7 percent to 1,225.41 tonnes by
July 12, their highest in more than two months. 
 Investors will watch Italy's bond auctions later in the week
after yields on Spanish and Italian government bonds hit highest
levels in 14 years on Tuesday, reflecting nervousness among
investors about these country's fiscal conditions. 
 ""If investors think the crisis will spread further and we
see bond yields hit another record high, gold could do pretty
well,"" said Ong of Phillip Futures.	
 Spot silver gained 0.4 percent to $36.21 an ounce,
recovering from a one-week low of $34.76 hit in the previous
session. U.S. silver  rose 1.7 percent to $36.25.

 By Alejandro Barbajosa	
 SINGAPORE, July 13 (Reuters) - Oil dropped on Wednesday,
after a surprise gain in U.S. crude inventories and the
downgrade of Ireland's credit rating to junk status reinforced
views of a well-supplied market amid a deteriorating demand
outlook.	
 Brent for August  fell 51 cents to $117.24 a barrel
at 0228 GMT, while U.S. crude  fell 48 cents to $96.95.	
 U.S. stockpiles of distillates including heating oil and
diesel posted a larger-than-expected increase last week, the
American Petroleum Institute (API) said late on Tuesday, while
Europe's debt crisis is prompting forecasters to trim their
predictions for demand growth.	
 ""The oil supply-demand balance is not really tight,"" said
Tetsu Emori, a fund manager at Tokyo-based Astmax Co Ltd.	
 ""But in the current market, people are too pessimistic,
looking at the weakness in the U.S. economy and the European
debt crisis. I am quite confident that the soft patch in the
economy should be over in a few months, with support for Brent
at $110.""	
 Annual gross domestic product growth in China, the world's
second-largest oil user, eased to 9.5 in the second quarter from
9.7 percent in the first, the National Bureau of Statistics said
on Wednesday, but the growth rate was stronger than market
expectations of 9.4 percent. 
 Crude inventories in top consumer the United States rose 2.3
million barrels last week, the API said, compared to
expectations for a decline of 1.8 million. 
 Distillates climbed 4.8 million barrels, 12 times as much as
forecast, while gasoline stocks unexpectedly fell by 1.6 million
barrels. Government statistics from the Energy Information
Administration will follow on Wednesday at 1430 GMT.	
 On Tuesday, U.S. crude futures posted stronger gains than
Brent, narrowing the spread between the contracts  to
below $21 a barrel. The previous session, Brent's premium had
pushed to within pennies of its June 15 record of $23.34.	
 
 EUROPEAN CRISIS 
 A deepening European debt crisis and slowing economic growth
in China are prompting reductions in forecasts for growth in
global oil consumption. 
 Demand will grow less than previously forecast this year and
in 2012 due to a more moderate economic recovery and higher fuel
prices, the top U.S. energy forecasting agency said on Tuesday.

 In its new monthly outlook, the EIA cut its forecast for
2011 world oil demand growth by 270,000 barrels per day (bpd) to
a 1.43 million-bpd increase this year. Oil demand in 2012 will
rise 1.58 million bpd, about 10,000 bpd lower than the agency
forecast last month.	
 The forecast came after OPEC also said that world oil demand
would grow more slowly in 2012 because of a fragile global
economy and deepening decline in consumption in Europe.

 Fears of escalating euro zone sovereign debt crisis
heightened on Tuesday, after Moody's cut Ireland's credit rating
to junk and warned the country might need a second bailout.

 European Union leaders are poised to hold an emergency
summit after finance ministers acknowledged for the first time
that some form of Greek default may be needed to cut Athens'
debts and to stop contagion spreading to Italy and Spain.

 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
predicted world oil consumption would rise by 1.32 million bpd
in 2012, slightly lower than the growth of 1.36 million bpd
expected this year.	
 Royal Dutch Shell  said on Tuesday it had lifted a
force majeure on its Nigerian Bonny Light crude oil loadings
which was declared on June 13 due to leaks and fires on its
Trans-Niger Pipeline. 
 In other markets, the yen and Swiss franc held most of their
recent strong gains in Asia on Wednesday after Moody's cut
Ireland's credit rating to junk, while stock markets edged up
following two days of losses sparked by fears that Europe's debt
crisis could soon engulf Italy and Spain.

 NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - Gold rallied to near its
all-time high on Tuesday, as investors sought a safe haven on
fears that European officials were failing to stop a debt
crisis from spreading and uncertainty related to frantic U.S.
talks to raise its debt limit.
 After trading flat for most of the day, bullion suddenly
spiked at the end of the U.S. pit session to extend its rally
for a seventh day, as crude oil and other commodities rallied
and as the euro pared gains.
 Bullion has gained over 6 percent this month on fears about
a deepening euro zone crisis, now trading less than $5 below
its all-time high of $1,575.79 set on May 2. Gold priced in
euro and sterling hit record highs for a second consecutive
day.
 ""With the euro zone debt crisis and the U.S. debt ceiling
talks, there is a tremendous flight to quality. Gold is the
commodity to invest in because the currencies aren't doing
well,"" said Mihir Dange, COMEX gold options floor trader for
Arbitrage LLC.
 Spot gold  was up 1 percent at $1,568.89 an ounce by
2:43 p.m. EDT (1843 GMT). U.S. COMEX August gold futures 
settled up $13.10 at $1,562.30, after trading between $1,541.10
and $1,574.30.
 U.S. trading volume was around 170,000 lots, one of the
heaviest since the start of June, as investors switched their
focus back on the gold market as equities have slumped
 Financial markets hammered European assets after euro zone
finance ministers opened the door to a possible Greek default
and failed to prevent contagion spreading to Italy and Spain.
[ID:nL6E7IC097]
 Gold in euros  rose for a third day, climbing 1.5
percent to hit a record above 1,123 euros.
 Gold priced in higher-yielding currencies, which also
suffered the brunt of investor distaste for risk, such as the
Australian dollar , the South African rand 
or the Canadian dollar , also rallied.
 ""If you live in Greece, you are going to buy gold because
that's the hard money you still trust,"" said Axel Merk,
portfolio manager who oversees $700 million in mutual fund
assets at Merk Investments.
 DENNIS GARTMAN PARES EURO GOLD TRADE
 Independent investor Dennis Gartman, who has called for
buying gold in non-U.S. currency terms, however, has trimmed
his euro-priced gold positions on worries about an overbought
trade.
 ""Everywhere we turned yesterday the talk was of the
gold/euro trade. In that environment it is perhaps wise if we
remove ourselves quietly from the party, reducing our exposure
by one-third...,"" Gartman said in a note.
The euro hit a four-month low against the dollar and another
record low against the Swiss franc on fears euro zone leaders
were failing to prevent a debt crisis from spreading. [FRX/]
 Fears that the debt crisis is spilling over the other
European countries have boosted gold. The main measure of
Italy's borrowing costs broke above 6 percent for the first
time in 14 years as the euro zone's third-largest economy was
sucked into the bloc's debt crisis. [ID:nLDE76B1C2]

 Also underpinning gold is growing uncertainty over a deal
to raise the U.S. debt ceiling to preserve the good faith and
low borrowing costs for the world's largest economy.
[ID:nN1E76A1V4]
 The U.S. dollar's reserve currency status would also be
severely undermined and that would boost gold, if the country
defaults on Aug. 2, the U.S. imposed deadline to raise the debt
limit.
 The next two key risk events for gold will be U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's semi-annual testimony on
monetary policy to Congress on Wednesday.

 NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Tuesday, shaking
off two days of losses to turn positive on the dollar's
intraday weakness and supportive technicals.
 U.S. crude futures posted stronger gains than Brent,
narrowing the spread between the contracts  to below
$21 a barrel. The previous session, Brent's premium had pushed
to within pennies of its June 15 record of $23.34.
 The day's choppy trading continued into post-settlement
when Moody's Investor's Services cut of Ireland's credit rating
to junk status pressured the euro and caused U.S. equities to
end lower a third straight session. [ID:nN1E76B1I8] [.N]
 Prior to the Ireland downgrade, the dollar index <.DXY> had
weakened and the euro trimmed losses as risk aversion tied to
the European debt crises eased slightly. A weaker dollar is
usually supportive to dollar-denominated oil prices.

post-settlement trading after industry data showed a surprise
build in U.S. crude oil inventories last week. [API/S]
 Brent crude futures for August  rose 51 cents to
settle at $117.75 a barrel, having swung between $114.95 and
$117.83. The August Brent crude contract expires on Thursday.
 U.S. crude  rose $2.28 to settle at $97.43 a barrel,
having moved back above the front-month 200-day moving average
of $93.76 after an earlier slip to $93.55.
 ""Today's oil trade hitched a ride on the strong rebound in
the euro and U.S. stock market,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president at
Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Illinois, said in a note.
 ""An additional feature was provided by the unwinding of the
Brent-WTI spread positions ahead of Thursday's August Brent
expiration,"" he added.
 U.S. crude trading volumes outpaced Brent and both finished
below their 30-day averages.
 ""(U.S. crude) had a bounce off the 200-day moving average
and the S&P 500 (index) has held above the 1,300 level, helping

president, energy futures at MF Global in New York.
 Oil and U.S. stocks also got a brief lift after the Federal
Open Market Committee's minutes from its June meeting said some

easing if the recovery was too sluggish to cut unemployment.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, July 12 (Reuters) - Spot gold held steady around
$1,550 on Tuesday, as investors fled from risky assets on fears
of a spreading euro zone debt crisis, but a stronger dollar and
weak equities weighed on sentiment.	
 Euro zone finance ministers promised cheaper loans, longer
maturities and a more flexible rescue fund on Monday to help
Greece and other EU debtors in a bid to stop financial contagion
engulfing Italy and Spain. 
 Ministers from the 17 countries that share the European
currency on Monday also vowed to safeguard stability in the euro
area and promised new measures ""shortly"", but set no deadline. 
 ""We'll probably see a lot of support for gold from rising
risk aversion due to concerns of escalating debt in Europe,""
said Natalie Robertson, a commodities analyst at ANZ.	
 ""Although the rising dollar could pare back some of the
interest in gold.""	
 The dollar hit its highest against a basket of currencies in
more than three months , as the euro sank to a four-month
low against the greenback after comments from the new IMF head
added to uncertainties about Greece's debt crisis. 
 The International Monetary Fund is not yet ready to discuss
conditions or terms of a second Greek bailout, the fund's new
managing director, Christine Lagarde, said on Monday, adding
that Italian economic growth had to improve, in addition to
fiscal consolidation, to restore confidence?. 
 Spot gold edged down 0.2 percent at $1,549.90 per
ounce by 0556 GMT, off $1,556.59 hit in the previous session --
its highest since June 22.	
 U.S. gold  inched up 0.1 percent to $1,550.70.	
 Gold priced in sterling and euro both
hit record highs. 
 Gold has potential to reach for its all-time high of
$1,575.59 hit on May 2, but rapid sell-off in equities and other
commodities could spread to gold as investors sell bullion to
cover losses elsewhere.	
 Asian stocks suffered sharp losses on Tuesday on escalating
worries about the euro zone's debt crisis. 
 Technical analysis suggested that gold might be due for a
correction as it approaches a resistance at $1,557.75, the June
22 high, said Wang Tao, a Reuters market analyst. 
 
 China, the world's largest gold producer, said its gold
output in the first five months of the year grew 3.67 percent
from a year earlier to 132.02 tonnes. The country produced
340.88 tonnes of gold in 2010, up 8.6 percent on the year.

 Stubbornly high inflation in China has driven investors to
bullion, seen as a safe storage of value. 
 China's inflation quickened to a three-year high in June,
and investors are watching out for further tightening measures
from Beijing, who vowed to fight rising prices as its top
priority. 
 ""Worries that China could continue raising rates after the
stronger-than-expected CPI figures over the weekend may also
weigh on gold in the near-term,"" said Tom Pawlicki, an analyst
at MF Global in a research note.	
 Spot silver pared early gains to $35.71, barely
changed from the previous session. It hit a one-month high of
$36.89 in the previous session.	
 U.S. silver  gained 0.2 percent to $35.79.

euro

 By Alejandro Barbajosa	
 SINGAPORE, July 12 (Reuters) - Oil slipped for a third day
on Tuesday as pledges to contain the spread of the euro zone's
debt crisis failed to dispel unease among investors about
slowing energy demand growth.	
 Ministers from the 17 countries that share the European
currency on Monday vowed to safeguard stability in the euro area
and promised new measures ""shortly"", but set no deadline after
another day of turmoil across financial markets.	
 Brent crude  shed 89 cents to $116.35 a barrel at
0223 GMT, while U.S. crude for August  dipped 76 cents to
$94.39. Both contracts fell more than $1 on Monday.	
 ""Any continued contagion, including in Spain and Italy, or
any of the larger economies, could certainly drive oil prices
lower,"" Anthony Danaher, President of Los Angeles-based Guild
Investment Management, said from Singapore.	
 ""The risk-off play can persist for a few days, until it gets
to a point where investors have liquidated short-term positions
and value seekers step in,"" said Danaher, adding that a new
global round of monetary easing may send Brent prices towards
records near $150 later this year.	
 Disappointing U.S. employment data and falling crude imports
in China soured the mood in the oil market over the past two
trading sessions. This has dented Brent's rally from about $102,
a low reached after the June 23 announcement by the
International Energy Agency (IEA) of a coordinated emergency
stockpile release.	
 Now Brent's price is at a similar level to where the
front-month contract was trading when the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) failed to agree on a
collective output increase on June 8.	
 The IEA on Monday said the amount of oil made available from
emergency stocks would be slightly less than earlier stated
after sales by member-countries met with mixed demand.	
 Oil available under the plan will amount to 59.83 million
barrels, down 784,000 barrels from an earlier estimate, said the
IEA, an adviser to 28 industrialised countries, in a statement
on its website. 
 
 U.S. OIL STOCKS SEEN DOWN	
 U.S. crude oil inventories probably fell for a sixth
straight week as imports declined, analysts forecast on Monday
in a preliminary Reuters poll ahead of weekly reports. 
 All 10 analysts polled forecast a drawdown in crude stocks,
with the average at 2 million barrels, for the week to July 8.
Gasoline stockpiles were projected to have risen by 400,000
barrels, on average, after a drawdown the week before.	
 Distillate stockpiles, which include heating oil and diesel,
were expected to have risen by 600,000 barrels.	
 Crude imports by China will recover in July from a downward
blip as refiners crank up production to meet rising demand after
a heavy maintenance program led to the first decline in six
months in June. 
 But demand growth at the world's second-largest oil consumer
is expected to slow this year from last, as higher interest
rates pare consumption.	
 In other markets, Asian equities suffered sharp losses on
Monday while the euro remained under pressure on escalating
worries that the threat of contagion from the Greek debt crisis
could lead to more countries requiring financial aid.

 Euro zone finance ministers promised cheaper loans, longer
maturities and a more flexible rescue fund on Monday to help
Greece and other EU debtors in a bid to stop financial contagion

 By Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, July 11 (Reuters) - Oil fell for a second
consecutive day on Monday as fears of a widening euro-zone debt
crisis and a drop in Chinese crude imports rekindled concerns
about a demand slowdown.
 Fears of Europe's sovereign-debt contagion spreading to
Italy affected risk assets, pushing the euro lower and boosting
the dollar index <.DXY> more than 1 percent and helped U.S.
equities suffer their worst day in nearly a month. A stronger
dollar can pressure dollar-denominated oil prices. [USD/] [.N]
 China's crude oil imports fell in June and inflation in the
world's No. 2 oil consumer accelerated to a three-year high,
raising the probability of more monetary tightening and slowed
economic and oil demand growth. [ID:nL3E7IA01B] [ID:nL3E7IB01U]
[ID:nL3E7I901B]
 ""Concerns about Europe keep getting ratcheted up and demand
expectations lower, and China's inflation and worry about
slowing growth add to worries about demand,"" said Phil Flynn,
analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago.
 Brent futures for August  fell $1.09 to settle at
$117.24 a barrel. Brent's two-session loss of 1.14 percent was
the biggest two-day percentage drop since the period to June
24, when prices dropped almost 8 percent.
 The August Brent contract expires on Thursday.
 U.S. August crude  fell $1.05 to settle at $95.15 a
barrel, having fallen as low as $94.14. The 3.57 percent lost
in the last two sessions is the biggest two-day percentage loss
since the 4.5 percent drop for the two sessions to June 24.
 Both crude contracts were pressured on Friday after the
disappointing U.S. June employment data that cast doubts about
any quick rebound for the nation's sputtering economic growth.
 Brent and U.S. crude trading volumes were both at just over
half a million lots traded and on track to finish just below
their 30-day averages.
 The Chicago Board Options Exchange's  Oil
Volatility Index <.OVX> jumped 10 percent to 33.98 percent,
pushing above its 200-day moving average of 33.13.
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude  rose to $23.28 a
barrel intraday on Monday, as news of reduced North Sea
loadings pushed Brent's premium to within pennies of its June
15 record of $23.34. [ID:nN1E76A0MZ]
 Crude oil output from nine key North Sea grades is set to
fall by 7.7 percent in August from July as summer maintenance
work reduces supplies. [ID:nL6E7IB0FJ]

 U.S., FRENCH EMBASSIES IN DAMASCUS ATTACKED
 Investors also kept a wary eye on the Middle East,
particularly Syria, after the U.S. and French embassies were
attacked.
 Several loyalists to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad broke
into the U.S. embassy in Damascus and security guards used live
ammunition to prevent hundreds from storming the French
embassy, diplomats said. [ID:nLDE76A0I6]
 ""This storming of the embassy raises the Syrian and overall
Middle East risk premium,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again
Capital LLC in New York.
 IEA TRIMS RELEASE VOLUME
 The International Energy Agency said it will release
slightly less oil from reserves than initially expected under
its emergency release plan. The amount for release is now set
at 59.83 million barrels, down 784,000 barrels from an earlier
estimate. [ID:nL9E7I703O]
 The Department of Energy hopes to begin delivering crude
from the U.S. reserve to some companies as early as this month
after selling all 30.6 million barrels of crude oil initially
set for release.
 Saudi Arabia's offer of additional crude in August drew
little interest from refiners in northeast Asia who declined
supplies beyond contracted volumes, though one buyer each in
India and Southeast Asia accepted extra barrels.

 SINGAPORE, July 11 (Reuters) - Oil fell for a second day on
Monday after a drop in China's crude imports and disappointing
U.S. employment data rekindled concerns of a demand slowdown at
the world's top two energy consumers.	
 Worries that the sovereign debt crisis in Europe may spread
to Italy, the region's third largest economy, also made
investors edgy, keeping them away from risky assets.	
 Brent crude for August  slid 62 cents to $117.71 a
barrel at 0608 GMT, still less than $10 from this year's peak
above $127, while U.S. crude benchmark  West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) shed 60 cents to $95.60.	
 China's crude imports tumbled by 11.5 percent in June from a
year earlier to 4.8 million barrels per day (bpd), their lowest
in eight months. 
 Fears that Beijing may raise interest rates further to
contain the fastest inflation in three years dampened risk
appetite, said Ben Le Brun, market analyst with CMC Markets.	
 Brent on Friday dipped 0.2 percent after data showed U.S.
jobs growth ground to a near halt in June as employers hired the
fewest workers in nine months. 
 ""It's a combination of both pieces of news, the world's two
biggest consumers with not good economic data,"" Le Brun said
from Sydney.	
 ""The drop in China's imports probably has to do with the
tightening of rates in the past six to 12 months and the U.S.
jobs report was a very bad miss. Considering all the headwinds
that we have had recently, the market has held quite well.""	


 Reduced loadings of North Sea crude were also supportive for
Brent on Friday, while front-month WTI plunged by almost $2.50.	
 WTI's discount to Brent  hovered close to $22 on
Monday after it widened to as much as $22.45 in the previous
session, the highest since the intraday record of $23.34 on June
15, on news that output from the North Sea Forties oil stream
will slip to a two-year low in August. 
 Last week's gains in Brent pushed prices well above the
level prior to the release of global emergency stockpiles
coordinated by the International Energy Agency, as traders bet
the extra 60 million barrels of oil would be insufficient to
stop markets tightening later this year.	
 Money managers raised their net-long U.S. crude futures and
options positions in the week to July 5, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission said on Friday. 
 Iran's caretaker oil minister said on Saturday that OPEC was
opposed to any increase in output ceilings in the absence of
""well-studied justifications"". 
 
 SAUDI BARRELS	
 Saudi Arabia's offer for additional crude in August met
scant interest from refiners across northeast Asia who are just
taking their full contractual volumes, while one buyer in India
and one in Southeast Asia accept extra barrels. 
 Limited demand for extra barrels from Asia, the world's
fastest-growing market, would leave the Saudis with few options
to find homes for additional cargoes. Top exporter Saudi Aramco
was expected to have raised output to near 10 million barrels
per day (bpd) in June.	
 In the currency market, the euro fell back close to a record
low versus the Swiss franc, hurt by renewed jitters over the
euro zone's debt crisis ahead of an emergency meeting of
European officials. 
 European Council President Herman Van Rompuy over the

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, July 11 (Reuters) - Spot gold was steady on
Monday, as the dimmed outlook for the U.S. economy and
persistent worries about euro zone nations' debt problem
supported sentiment.	
 The weaker-than-expected payrolls data last Friday dampened
hopes that the U.S. economy would bounce quickly from a slowdown
in the first half of the year, and helped gold stage a
3.9-percent weekly rise, its best week since November 2009.

 A spate of data from the United States, including trade,
retail sales, industrial production and consumer price index, is
expected this week. 
 ""If we see something that confirms further the weakness of
U.S. economy we may see gold benefit from that,"" said Darren
Heathcote, head of trading at Investec Australia.	
 Spot gold was little changed at $1,544.10 an ounce by
0257 GMT. It rose to a two-week high of $1,544.46 earlier in the
day.	
 U.S. gold  edged up 0.2 percent at $36.62.	
 Ongoing worries about euro zone nations' sovereign debt and
uncertainties around the debt ceiling talks at the U.S. Congress
also helped buoy the safe-haven demand in bullion.	
 President Barack Obama and Republican leaders failed on
Sunday to mend rifts over tax increases and social spending cuts
in talks aimed at cutting the U.S. budget deficit and averting a
debt default. 
 Meanwhile European Council President Herman Van Rompuy has
called an emergency meeting of top officials dealing with the
euro zone debt crisis for Monday morning, reflecting concern
that the crisis could spread to Italy, the region's third
largest economy. 
 ""If we start to see more pressure on Italy, such as talk of
debt default, gold will look to test the previous high,"" said
Heathcote of Investec.	
 Gold rose to an all-time high of $1,575.79 on May 2.	
 On the physical market, buyers have moved to the sidelines
after prices advanced nearly $60 in the previous week while
scrap sales remained subdued.	
 ""If prices move higher, we may some see scrap selling
trickle in,"" said a Singapore-based dealer. ""For now we are not
seeing much activity.""	
 Physical demand is low during summer months when India, the
world's largest gold consumer, goes through the monsoon season
during which farmers are busy sowing and gold sales slows. Rural
areas account for about 70 percent of India's annual gold
consumption.	
 Spot silver inched down 0.3 percent to $36.56 an
ounce, off the one-month high of $36.82 reached last Friday.
U.S. silver gained 0.2 percent to $36.62.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, July 11 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Monday, ending
at its highest point since setting a record in May, as
investors sprinted for safer havens on mounting worries that
the euro zone debt crisis might spill into Italy.
 Bullion rallied for a sixth day of gains, shaking off some
midday selling as traders opted to focus on its safe-haven
appeal rather than lump it in with other commodities which were
caught in a sell-off across risk assets. Gold also hit record
highs in both euro and sterling terms.
 Silver notched its biggest one-day loss in a week, hurt by
fears that investors cut their exposure to Italian government
bonds due to fears that the country could be the next after
Greece to get dragged into the crisis.
 The S&P 500 fell 2 percent.
 Gold is used as a safe haven in times of global economic
uncertainty. At times, however, the metal is seen as a risk
asset moving in tandem with equities and commodities.
 ""I think the sovereign debt crisis in Europe is going to be
with us for some time. It will attract interest in gold and
will hurt other commodities because some of these factors in
Europe will be so dire,"" said Bill O'Neill, partner of
commodities investment firm LOGIC Advisor.
 Spot gold  was up 0.4 percent at $1,550.10 an ounce
by 2:42 p.m. EDT (1841 GMT). Earlier in the session, it hit a
low of $1,541.40 an ounce as its latest run toward May's record
high ran into heavy technical selling pressure near its
three-week high of $1,557.75 an ounce.
 U.S. gold August futures  settled up $7.60 at
$1,549.20 an ounce, after trading between $1,542.10 and
$1,557.60.
 COMEX futures open interest rose 2 percent to near 510,000
lots on Friday, helped by interest by overseas investors in the
December contract, traders said.

 Silver fell 2.5 percent to $35.74 an ounce, taking a
beating along with other industrial commodities, as investors
opted for safe havens such as U.S. Treasuries. The dollar index
gained over 1 percent.
 Global stocks and the euro sank on worsening worries over
Italy, which has the highest sovereign debt ratio relative to
GDP in the euro zone after Greece. Problems in Italy come amid
efforts to help Greece with its debt problems. [ID:nLDE76A07W]
 GOLD IN EUROS, STERLING HIT RECORDS
 A lack of investor confidence in the euro zone lifted the
price of bullion priced in euros and sterling to record highs
earlier on Monday.
 Euro-denominated gold  hit record highs above
1,110.48 euros an ounce, while sterling-priced gold 
rose for a sixth day to a record 979.89 pounds an ounce.
 EU finance officials discussed options for resolving
Greece's intractable debt crisis on Monday, galvanized by the
growing threat of contagion to Italy, the euro zone's
third-largest economy. [ID:nLDE76A08F]
 ""If we start to see more pressure on Italy, such as talk of
debt default, gold will look to test the previous high,"" said
Darren Heathcote, head of trading at Investec Australia.
 Also underpinning gold is uncertainty over a deal to
preserve the top-notch debt rating of the United States.
 U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday increased pressure on
Republican lawmakers to make concessions for a deal to avoid an
Aug. 2 debt default and said both sides must ""pull off the
Band-aid"" and make sacrifices. [ID:nN1E7690AM]
 Platinum  and palladium  were both lower on the
day. Platinum was down 0.8 percent at $1,718.95 an ounce, while
palladium fell 1.2 percent at $763.18.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, July 8 (Reuters) - Gold prices on Friday
posted their biggest weekly rise since November 2009, achieved
after a weak U.S. labor market report renewed fears about the
health of the world's biggest economy and spurred safe-haven
buying.
 U.S. payrolls growth ground to a near halt in June, as
employers hired the fewest workers in nine months, frustrating
hopes that economic growth would pick up pace in the second
half of the year. [ID:nN1E7670C0]
 Instead, some analysts and investors began speculating
about how quickly a next government stimulus plan might be
enacted in the United States, triggering safe-haven purchases.
 ""I think some people are looking at the jobs data as
encouraging the next level of stimulus,"" said Tom Pawlicki,
precious metals analyst at MF Global in Chicago, noting that it
sent gold futures up towards their next resistance level at
$1,550 per ounce.
 Spot gold  rose to a two-week high of $1,545.30 an
ounce, then held around $1,543 for the rest of the session, up
from $1,531.85 late in New York on Thursday.
 Spot gold prices remained near the highs into late trade,
gaining 3.8 percent, the most since early November 2009.
 U.S. gold futures  for August delivery extended their
gains to a fresh two-week high at $1,546, and settled $11.0
higher at $1,541.60, and added to gains in after-hours trade.
 The weaker-than-forecast June U.S. employment report dashed
hopes that economic growth was picking up pace. Nonfarm
payrolls rose by a mere 18,000, well below economists'
expectations for a 90,000 rise. The unemployment rate rose to
9.2 percent, its highest in six months. [ID:nOAT004829]
 Adding to the weak tenor of the report, the department said
the economy created 44,000 fewer jobs in April and May than
previously thought.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 Peter Fertig, a metals consultant at Quantitative Commodity
Research noted that disappointing public-sector employment
after Thursday's ADP report showing a strong increase in
private-sector payrolls sparked safe-haven flows into gold.
 The dollar dropped against several currencies as the U.S.
jobs data strengthened expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve
would leave interest rates low into next year, prompting
investors to embrace alternate safe-haven assets like gold.
[USD/]
 A weaker dollar also often boosts dollar-denominated
assets, such as gold, because of the advantage it provides
buyers outside the United States.
 Analysts said they thought the dollar would likely trend
lower in the week ahead in the aftermath of an abysmal U.S.
jobs report and without clear signs of progress on the
approaching U.S. debt ceiling deadline.
 Both factors were also likely to spur further gold buying.
But, analysts said, several other factors on the week's
calendar could keep a lid on gains or, depending on their
results, push the yellow metal through the upper end of its
2-1/2-month trading band, on its way towards all-time highs.
 On the inflation front, China releases its producer and
consumer price indexes on Saturday, and the United States
reports the same next Thursday and Friday, respectively.
 Gold received a couple of boosts this week when the Bank of
China and European Central Bank each raised key interest rates
to stave off potential inflation.
 On Wednesday, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will testify before
Congress in his semi-annual report. Investors will be listening
carefully for any hints of further stimulus plans, though he is
unlikely to reveal anything specific.
 That said, spot gold will likely remain in the range that
has defined its path since early May, when it hit a record peak
at $1,575.79 per ounce.
 ""I'm thinking sideways to higher over the next several
weeks, before it rallies and maybe even retests the highs in
the next couple of months,"" said Pawlicki.
 Among other precious metals, silver  hit a four-week
peak at $36.82 an ounce, and remained around $36.71 against
$36.41 on Thursday.
 Spot platinum  eased to $1,734 an ounce from
$1,739.85 on Thursday. Spot palladium  edged down to
$775.50 an ounce against $781.55 previously.
 The platinum:palladium ratio -- the number of ounces of
palladium needed to buy an ounce of platinum -- held at its
lowest in more than four months at 2.23.

 By Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - Oil ended a strong week on a
downbeat note on Friday as a dismal U.S. jobs report cast a
pall on the economic outlook.
 Benchmark Brent crude pared losses by mid-afternoon,
closing near flat on the day as news of reduced North Sea
production helped drive prices up nearly 6 percent this week.
Brent's premium  to U.S. crude pushed above $22 a
barrel, within $1 of its all-time record three weeks ago.
 Trading was volatile while volume picked up from recent
weak levels, with raw materials faring better than stock
markets after news that U.S. jobs growth ground to a near-halt
in June. Nonfarm payrolls rose only 18,000, the weakest reading
since September and well below expectations. [ID:nN1E7670C0]
 ""The employment data has weighed mightily on oil prices.
Employment trends are key to future demand, and this is now two
months of poor data,"" said John Kilduff, partner at hedge fund
Again Capital LLC in New York.
 ""The (market's) only supportive feature is further declines
in North Sea loadings. These outages coupled with Libya and
Nigeria issues are increasingly meaningful,"" he said.
 Brent futures for August  fell 26 cents to settle at
$118.33 a barrel, off their $119.87 peak reached ahead of the
U.S. jobs report but well above the $116.88 low. Brent posted a
second straight weekly gain, rising 5.87 percent, after gaining
6.33 percent the previous week.
 A second week of strong gains has pushed prices well above
the level prior to the release of global emergency stockpiles
as traders bet the extra 60 million barrels of oil would be
insufficient to stop markets tightening later this year.
 U.S. crude  fell $2.47 to settle at $96.20 a barrel,
below front-month crude's 30-day moving average of $96.84, but
off its $95.60 intraday low. For the week, U.S. crude rose 1.33
percent, also a second straight weekly gain.
 Money managers raised their net-long U.S. crude futures and
options positions in the week to Tuesday, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commision said on Friday. [ID:nEMS1CU1T5]
 After lagging early, U.S. crude trading volumes outpaced
Brent's, though Brent surpassed its 30-day average, while U.S.
volumes were on track to fall just short.
 ""Brent seems to have more speculative interest in it, along
with the North Sea problems and missing African barrels, and
the demand in Asia for similar barrels,"" said Gene McGillian,
analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.

 TIGHT GLOBAL SUPPLY
 Output from the North Sea Forties oil stream will slip to a
two-year low in August, further reducing supply of the crude
that helps to set the Brent benchmark. [ID:nL6E7I80WI]
 Brent's strength indicates the need for sweet crude like
Libya's, even though ""an expected increase in (U.S.) Gulf Coast
supply should theoretically reroute some African light sweet
crude toward the higher-priced European market"", Jim
Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a
research note.
 Thursday's government inventory report showed U.S. crude
and refined product stocks fell last week. [EIA/S]
 Oil prices have rebounded from four-month lows following
the International Energy Agency's (IEA) surprise announcement
on June 23 that member nations would release 60 million barrels
of oil reserves. The IEA said it would consider later this
month whether to release more reserves. [ID:nN1E75S11T]
 JP Morgan said in a report the timing of the IEA release
threw a spotlight on tightness in global oil supply.
 ""Politics aside, the main reason we can see for the precise
timing of the IEA stock release was that it coincided with
clear indications from tanker traffic data that OPEC output
would fall short of prior pledges,"" the bank said in a report
on Thursday.
 ""As such, it is difficult to conclude anything except that
there is little or no spare capacity in the oil market.""

 SINGAPORE, July 8 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell on Friday,
after sharp gains a day earlier prompted investors to book
profits ahead of a key U.S. jobs report that will provide
insight into the pace of economic recovery of the world's
biggest oil consumer.	
 ICE Brent crude  was down 35 cents at $118.24 a
barrel by 0629 GMT, after falling as low as $117.62 earlier.
U.S. crude  was at $98.67 a barrel, down 1 cent. Oil
prices are headed for their second straight weekly gain, with
Brent poised to rise more than 5 percent this week.	
 Brent jumped on Thursday by the biggest percentage in two
months, hitting a three-week high as U.S. data on jobless claims
and retail sales came in stronger than expected.	
 That prompted several economists to raise forecasts for the
government's non-farm payrolls count due later on Friday.

 ""Traders usually turn cautious before a key data release
like non-farm payrolls. The market needs a consistent flow of
good news to support prices,"" said Benson Wang, an analyst with
Commodity Brokers in Sydney.	
 ""There is still uncertainty over whether the IEA will

 Oil prices have rebounded about 10 percent after plunging to
four-month lows following the International Energy Agency's
(IEA) shock announcement on June 23 that member nations would
release 60 million barrels of oil reserves. 
 The IEA said it would consider later this month whether to
release more reserves, but does not see the program extending
for longer than a month or two. 
 China this week raised interest rates for the third time
this year in a bid to tame rising inflation, raising hopes the
government's monetary tightening cycle may be nearing its end.	
 The country's annual inflation in June is expected to hit a
near three-year peak of 6.3 percent, according to a Reuters poll
of 28 economists. 
 China's central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said on Friday
the country's monetary policy needed to support economic growth
and keep inflation under control. 
 In separate comments published on Friday, a senior Chinese
banking regulator said the government's monetary policy tools
needed innovation as the market had become immune to the
standard moves taken by the central bank to curb excess
credit. .	
 
 U.S. INVENTORIES	
 Government data showing a smaller than expected decline in
U.S. crude stocks also weighed on prices. 
 Crude inventories fell 889,000 barrels to 358.6 million
barrels in the week to July 1, below average forecasts of a 2.3
million barrel drawdown, U.S. Energy Information Administration
data showed Thursday. . 
 Gasoline stocks unexpectedly fell 634,000 barrels to 212.5
million barrels, versus analyst projections for a 100,000-barrel
build. 
Distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, likewise
posted a surprise 191,000-barrel fall to 142.05 million barrels,
compared with a forecast rise of 700,000 barrels.	
 
 BULLISH FORECASTS	
 JP Morgan became the latest bank to raise its oil price
forecasts, citing the impact of the IEA decision to release
strategic crude stocks together with shifts in Middle East Gulf
crude oil exports. 
 ""Politics aside, the main reason we can see for the precise
timing of the IEA stock release was that it coincided with clear
indications from tanker traffic data that OPEC output would fall
short of prior pledges,"" the bank said in a report on Thursday.	
 ""As such, it is difficult to conclude anything except that
there is little or no spare capacity in the oil market."" 
 Investment banks Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley
and Barclays Capital had also this week published upbeat
forecasts on the outlook for oil fundamentals, with similar
warnings of shrinking spare capacity. 
 In the short term, U.S. crude's bullish target of $99.68
remains intact, while Brent oil is expected to rise to $121.47,
according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. 
 The spread between the two benchmarks widened by $3 to top
$20 a barrel on Thursday, the widest since June 20 ,
as production problems plagued North Sea oil supplies. It was
trading at $19.49 a barrel by 0621 GMT, up 22 cents.

 SINGAPORE, July 8 (Reuters) - Spot gold was steady in thin
trade on Friday, ahead of a key U.S. employment report that is
expected to show improvement in the labour market and boost
optimism on prospects for the world's largest economy.	
 But stronger-than-expected payrolls data could ease fears
that the U.S. economy remains in a prolonged soft patch,
potentially undermining safe-haven demand for bullion.

 Spot gold moved within a narrow $3 range and was
little changed at $1,531.61 an ounce by 0616 GMT. Prices were
headed for a weekly gain of 3 percent, its strongest week since
the end of April.	
 U.S. gold  edged up 0.1 percent to $1,532.30.	
 Inflation concerns in the euro zone and China remain
supportive, after the European Central Bank and China's central
bank both raised rates this week in a bid to tackle rising
prices. 
 In addition, the ongoing debt crisis in some euro zone
nations is expected to underpin gold's sentiment.	
 ""The euro zone debt crisis is certainly one factor
supporting gold going forward,"" said Peter Fung, head of dealing
at Wing Fung Precious Metals in Hong Kong.	
 ""Last week we saw some long positions liquidated but now the
market is looking at the upside again. We see buying in gold,
silver and palladium.""	
 Last week's price dip below $1,480 has prompted
much fresh buying interest, pushing gold up about $50 over the
past four sessions.	
 Technical analysis remained bullish, suggesting spot gold
prices could rise towards $1,550 in the short term, said Reuters
market analyst Wang Tao. 
 A strike at Freeport-McMoRan's massive Grasberg copper and
gold mine in Indonesia may extend into next week, if talks with
management on Friday do not reach a deal. But so far gold market
has shrugged off the news. 
 ""Although gold has resumed its upward trend, the metal has
faced increased fundamental headwinds, for instance through a
gradual removal of monetary expansion in many nations,"" said
BofA Merrill Lynch in a research note.	
 The bank expected limited upside during the summer months
but maintained its price target of $1,650 for late 2011,
supported by the low real interest rates in key countries such
as the United States and central banks buying gold.	
 Spot silver was flat at $36.39, on course for a
7.2-percent weekly ascent, it best week since end of May.	
 Spot palladium edged up 0.1 percent to $782.47,
poised for a 3.7 percent rise from a week earlier, its second
consecutive week of gains.

 Gasoline stocks unexpectedly fell 634,000 barrels to 212.5
million barrels, versus analyst projections for a 100,000-barrel
build. 
Distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, likewise
posted a surprise 191,000-barrel fall to 142.05 million barrels,
compared with a forecast rise of 700,000 barrels.	
 
 BULLISH FORECASTS	
 JP Morgan became the latest bank to raise its oil price
forecasts, citing the impact of the IEA decision to release
strategic crude stocks together with shifts in Middle East Gulf
crude oil exports. 
 ""Politics aside, the main reason we can see for the precise
timing of the IEA stock release was that it coincided with clear
indications from tanker traffic data that OPEC output would fall
short of prior pledges,"" the bank said in a report dated
Thursday.	
 ""As such, it is difficult to conclude anything except that
there is little or no spare capacity in the oil market."" 
 Investment banks Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley
and Barclays Capital had also this week published upbeat
forecasts on the outlook for oil fundamentals this week, with
similar warnings of shrinking spare capacity. 
 In the short term, U.S. crude's bullish target of $99.68
remains intact, while Brent oil is expected to rise to $121.47,
according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. 
 The spread between the two benchmarks widened by $3 to top
$20 a barrel on Thursday, the widest since June 20 ,
as production problems plagued North Sea oil supplies. It was
trading at $19.41 a barrel by 0233 GMT, up 34 cents.

 By Carole Vaporean and Jan Harvey
 NEW YORK/LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - Gold prices firmed on
Thursday, but stayed around $1,530 an ounce, as most investors
held onto current positions ahead of the next day's
much-anticipated U.S. June jobs report.
 Two U.S. labor market reports released on Thursday came in
stronger than expected, but neither would necessarily translate
into bigger-than-forecast payrolls growth for June.
 ""Prices will stay in range ahead of payrolls. Because, at
this point, I don't think people want to get themselves too
heavily involved in a position if they're not already in it,""
said Fred Schoenstein, precious metals trader at Heraeus
Precious Metals Management in New York.
 ""We're going to sit tight until we see Friday's report.""
 Spot gold  was at $1,531.86 an ounce by 3:00 p.m. EDT
(1900 GMT) against $1,527.50 late in New York on Wednesday. In
futures, U.S. gold  for August delivery settled at
$1,530.60, a $1.40 gain.
 Spot gold climbed as far as $1,534.20 an ounce, its highest
since June 23, though surpassing the previous high by less than
$1. Still, it continued to recover from two consecutive weeks
of losses.
 Earlier, U.S. payrolls processor ADP reported that
private-sector employment increased by 157,000 jobs in June, a
rise more than double economists' expectations.
 A drop in the number of Americans filing last week for
unemployment benefits also offered hope for the labor market,
though they remained too high to signal robust growth.

 For Friday's June U.S. employment figures, economists on
average forecast 50,000 new jobs were created. [ECI/US]
 An upside surprise in payrolls, however, would strengthen
the view that the U.S. economy was emerging from the doldrums
of the first half of the year, undermining the safe-haven bid
that had sent gold to two-week highs.
 Similarly, a weaker-than-forecast jobs report could push
gold further toward the upper end of the range that has held
since April, en route to all-time highs.
 ""If you see something that's unexpected (in payrolls),
we'll see it (gold) move in either direction. I'm just not sure
which way that will be,"" Schoenstein said.
 Gold is also caught by other competing influences,
including signs that inflation is heating up, as with the
European Central Bank and Bank of China interest rate
increases, and euro zone debt troubles that provide a
safe-haven underpinning.
 Bullion prices were down for much of the day, slipping
after the ECB raised interest rates again and offered to help
Portugal stay solvent. The news did little to dispel concern
about the euro zone's debt problems, which provided underlying
price support to the yellow metal.
 The ECB raised its benchmark refinancing rate by 25 basis
points to 1.50 percent, as markets had widely anticipated, and
President Jean-Claude Trichet signaled in the post-meeting news
briefing the bank would continue to tighten policy to prevent
inflation from undermining economic growth. [ID:nECBNEWS]
 ""The rate hikes we see -- a slow gradual increase in the
future -- aren't nearly enough to drive people out of gold and
into higher-yielding assets,"" RBS analyst Daniel Major said.
 The euro gained against the dollar, snapping two days of
declines, after Trichet said the ECB would relax rules and
continue to provide liquidity to Portugal. [USD/]
 Broader concerns over debt levels in some smaller euro zone
economies, including Greece, Portugal and Ireland, were a key
factor pushing gold prices to record highs above $1,575 an
ounce in May.

 By Gene Ramos
 NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - Oil jumped on Thursday by the
biggest percentage in two months, hitting a three-week high as
U.S. data on jobless claims and retail sales came in stronger
than expected, raising hopes that economic recovery was gaining
traction.
 Independent data showing U.S. private hiring surged in June
set the stage for a possible upside surprise in Friday's U.S.
non-farm payrolls report, traders said.
 After weekly U.S. data showed a surprisingly small decline
in oil stocks, ICE Brent crude extended its rally while the
U.S. benchmark faltered.
 The Brent/WTI spread blew out by $3 to top $20 a barrel,
the widest since June 20 , as production problems
plagued North Sea oil supplies and as traders bet that European
governments would release fewer barrels than expected under a
global injection of emergency stocks that has failed to tame
prices.
 In London, ICE Brent crude futures for August delivery
 settled at $118.59 a barrel, gaining $4.97, or 4.4
percent, their biggest one-day gain since May 9. It hit a
session high of $118.70, the highest intraday since June 15.
 U.S. August crude  lagged, rising by just $2.02, or
2.1 percent, to settle at $98.67, off its session high of
$99.42 -- the highest intraday price since June 15.
 Traders focused on the jobs-related data even after U.S.
government data showed crude oil inventories fell by just
889,000 barrels last week. That decline was less than forecast
and well below the 3.2 million barrel drawdown in an industry
report on Tuesday. [EIA/S] [API/S]
""Prices are still up, with investors minding pundits' views
that the economy will pick up in the second half,"" said Mark
Waggoner, president of Excel Futures in Bend, Oregon.

 U.S. equities rallied on the economic data while the euro

 Economists polled by Reuters prior to the ADP figures
expected the report, due at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT) on Friday,
to show employers added 90,000 jobs in June.
 ""It's generally a confirmation that the weakness we saw in
the May data was more in the way of a bump in the road rather
than falling off into some abyss,"" said David Resler, chief
economist at Nomura Securities International in New York.
 ""The soft patch will prove to be a temporary one, but that
doesn't mean we'll be roaring ahead with growth,"" Resler said.
 The European Central Bank's widely expected interest rate
hike had little impact on prices, traders said.[ID:nL6E7I70VC]
 RECOVERY AFTER IEA STOCKS RELEASE SHOCK
 Oil prices have rebounded about 10 percent after plunging
to four-month lows following the International Energy Agency's
shock announcment on June 23 that member nations would release
60 million barrels of oil reserves.
 The IEA said it would consider later this month whether or
not to release more reserves, but does not see the program
extending for longer than a month or two. [ID:nN1E75S11T]

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, July 7 (Reuters) - Gold prices edged higher on
Thursday, building on three days of gains, supported by
inflation concerns that are pushing central banks to raise
rates, while an ongoing debt crisis in the euro zone also
underpinned sentiment.	
 China hiked rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, and the
European Central Bank is expected to follow suit later on
Thursday. 
 ""The rate move reignited the inflation issue and people
started to think that it is more of an issue than expected,""
said Jonathan Barratt, managing director at Commodity Broking
Services in Sydney.	
 ""We can safely agree that the $1,480 to $1,500 level has
been established as a medium-term support and chances that we
break below it towards the end of the year are pretty rare.
We've found the bottom.""	
 Spot gold dipped briefly below $1,480 an ounce on
July 1 to a one-and-a-half month low of $1,478.01, but had risen
3.7 percent from this level to $1,532.61 an ounce by 0609 GMT. 
 It hit a two-week high of $1,533.45 in the previous session,
just over $40 below the record high above $1,575 seen at the
start of May.	
 U.S. gold  edged up 0.3 percent to $1,533.20.	
 Investors are also watching the weekly initial jobless
claims and ADP employment reports from the United States, which
will shed light on the key monthly non-farm payrolls data due on
Friday. 
 Technical analysis showed a supportive picture. Spot gold is
targeting $1,550, riding on the strong momentum built up in the
past few sessions, said Wang Tao, a Reuters market analyst.

 Silver prices also pushed higher. Spot silver rose to
a two-week high of $36.26, before easing to $36.16. U.S. silver
 rose 0.8 percent to $36.20.	
 Supporting sentiment, a strike by about 8,000 workers at
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold's Grasberg mine in
Indonesia, the world's top gold mine, entered its fourth day.
Negotiations over pay have broken down and mining has halted, a
government official said. 
 Physical buyers have moved to the sidelines after prices ran
up about $55, or nearly 4 percent, in the past three sessions.	
 ""We may see the market rest a little at the current level,
as people wait for further development in the euro zone's debt
crisis,"" said a Hong Kong-based dealer, adding that fund
activity in gold has been limited, making it difficult to stage
a rapid rally.	
 Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest
gold-backed exchange-traded fund, remained unchanged at
1,205.809 tonnes, their lowest since mid-June. 
 Holdings in the iShares Silver Trust , the world's
biggest silver ETF, dropped to 9,532.4 tonnes, the lowest since
Sept. 22, 2010.

 SINGAPORE, July 7 (Reuters) - Brent crude climbed above $114
on Thursday, supported by a more-than-projected drop in U.S.
crude stocks and expectations that China's monetary tightening
cycle may be nearing its end. 
 ICE Brent crude  climbed 49 cents to $114.11 a barrel
by 0229 GMT. U.S. crude  was at $97.29 a barrel, up 64
cents.	
 Oil and other commodities fell on Wednesday after China
raised interest rates for the third time this year in an attempt
to tame rising inflation, but recouped its losses to settle
almost flat. Gold was the exception, hitting a two-week high as
investors sought safety in the precious metal. 
 ""There is a general consensus that there will be one more
rate hike in August and that will be the end of China's
tightening for the year, which is positive for oil demand,"" said
Gordon Kwan, head of energy research at Mirae Asset Securities
in Hong Kong. 
 ""With U.S. economic data not as bad as expected and some
resolution to the Greek debt crisis, the way is clear for oil
prices to hit new highs this summer.""	
 China's annual inflation in June is expected to hit a near
three-year peak of 6.3 percent, according to a Reuters poll of
28 economists. 
 In the U.S., crude stocks fell 3.2 million barrels last
week, more than a projected 2.3 million-barrel drawdown,
industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) said on
Wednesday. 
 Product inventories registered unexpected declines, the API
data showed. Gasoline stocks fell 1.9 million barrels against
expectations for an increase of 100,000 barrels. Distillate
stocks shed 1.6 million barrels, compared with forecasts for a
700,000 barrel gain.	
 The inventory report from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration's will follow on Thursday at 1500 GMT.

one more trading session before rising towards $120, while U.S.
crude could hit $99.68, according to technical analyses by
Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 The market will be watching key U.S. jobs data on Friday for
evidence that the world's largest oil consumer had regained its
economic footing. U.S. nonfarm payrolls likely rose modestly in
June after suffering a setback the prior month.	
 Growth in the U.S. economy's vast services sector remained
sluggish in June as new orders fell, but economists said a
steady employment reading pointed to job growth later in the
year. 
 Concerns over a potential U.S. government debt default,
which could lead to higher borrowing costs and tip the economy
back into recession, raised fears of weaker demand. 
 U.S. Treasury officials are discussing options to stave off
default if Congress fails to raise the debt limit by the Aug. 2
deadline, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

 A default would undermine confidence in Treasuries, the
world's safest asset and the benchmark for the global bond
market, particularly if ratings agencies were to cut the United
States' prized AAA credit rating.

 MENA TENSIONS PERSIST	
 Libya's ongoing conflict and turmoil in Yemen and Syria
continued to support oil prices. 
 Much of Libya's state-owned oil tanker fleet remains
anchored because of cash flow issues and rebels took control of
the village of Al-Qawalish, south-east of Tripoli, after a
six-hour battle. 
 Pirates fired a rocket-propelled grenade into a fuel oil
tanker near the Yemeni port of Aden, but the vessel and its
cargo were recovered, the ship manager said. 
 In Syria, forces rounded up dozens of people around Hama, a
day after killing 22 people, activists said.

Thursday below a two-week high hit in the previous session,
supported by inflation concerns after China raised rates for the
third time this year.	
 
 FUNDAMENTALS

 By Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - Oil prices settled near flat
on Wednesday, buffeted in low-volume trade as an interest rate
hike by China and Europe's debt woes kept demand concerns in
focus ahead of weekly reports expected to show a drop in U.S.
crude stocks.
 China's rate rise, the third in 2011, reinforced concerns
about demand, especially in the short term, and the late
Tuesday cut of Portugal's credit rating by Moody's underlined
worries over the sputtering global economy.
 ""I think the market accepts that China is making a
concerted attempt to rein in inflationary forces through use of
interest rates, so it's short-term bearish for commodity usage
but medium-term, it's supportive if controlled growth is
managed,"" Mark Thomas, head of energy Europe at Marex, said.
 Brent futures for August  ended near flat, gaining 1
cent to settle at $113.62 a barrel, having recovered from an
earlier $111.91 low.
 U.S. crude  fell 24 cents to settle at $96.65 a
barrel, having bounced off a $95.90 low to finish above the
August contract's $96.26 200-day moving average.
 Trading volume remained weak after Monday's U.S.
Independence Day holiday, helping cause volatility, and Brent
and U.S. crude stayed on pace to trail 30-day averages.
 U.S. OIL INVENTORIES
 U.S. crude prices turned higher and Brent extended gains in
post-settlement trade after the industry group American
Petroleum Institute reported crude stocks fell 3.2 million
barrels last week in the United States. [API/S]
 Gasoline stocks fell 1.9 million barrels and distillate
stocks fell 1.6 million barrels, the API said.
 Crude stocks were forecast to be down, but only 2.3 million
barrels, according to a Reuters survey of analysts completed
earlier on Wednesday. [ID:nN1E7651FO]
 Gasoline stocks were expected to be little changed, up
100,000 barrels and distillate stocks were expected to have
posted a 700,000-barrel gain.
 The government's inventory report from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration's will follow on Thursday at 11 a.m.
EDT (1500 GMT).
 Earlier, a MasterCard report showed U.S. retail gasoline
demand fell last week from a year ago as prices remained above
where they had been in the same period in 2010. But demand was
up versus the previous week. [ID:nN1E7651AO]
 Growth in the U.S. services sector slipped in June, but the
report from the Institute for Supply Management's steady
employment reading was viewed favorably ahead of Friday's key
U.S. June jobs report that is expected to show nonfarm payrolls
rose modestly. [ID:nN1E7650H8] [ID:nN1E7640U2]
 Supportive to oil, according to brokers and analysts, was
Tuesday's news of an unexpectedly mild reduction in Saudi
official selling prices, viewed as an indication that OPEC's
top exporter was not moving to push prices lower.
 The International Energy Agency's coordinated release of
consuming nations' oil reserves also was being viewed as
insufficient and an ineffective tool to pull prices lower.
 Worries about inflation increased gold's attraction as a
safe-haven play, pushing it to a two-week high. [GOL/] Analysts
and brokers said oil's appeal as a store of value against shaky
currencies limited its losses.
 ""While China's rate hike and Europe's problems are bearish,
oil gets caught up in the flight-to-quality trade and, like
gold or silver, oil is used to hedge against inflation,"" said
Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago.

 By Simon Falush	
 LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell over $1 on
Wednesday, pressured as China raised its interest rates, and
after Moody's cut Portugal's credit rating to ""junk"" status,
fuelling fears about the sustainability of global economic
recovery. 
 ICE Brent crude  fell $1.46 to $112.15 a barrel by
1200 GMT after touching a session low of $111.91. The benchmark
rose more than $2 on Tuesday, its first gain in three sessions. 
 U.S. crude  was down 74 cents at $96.15 a barrel. 
 China's central bank increased interest rates for the third
time this year on Wednesday, stoking fears that growth in the
key energy consumer may slow more rapidly. 
 ""I think the market accepts that china is making a concerted
attempt to rein in inflationary forces through use of interest
rates, so it's short term bearish for commodity usage but medium
term, it's supportive if controlled growth is managed,"" Mark
Thomas, head of energy Europe at broker Marex said.	
 Others were also upbeat about longer term prospects in
China. ""Absolute demand in China is going to continue growing.
Gas oil demand is still going to go up at a steady pace,"" said
Priya Balchandani, an oil analyst at Standard Chartered Bank in
Singapore said.	
 The China news came after a further worrying development on
European debt which had already pushed energy prices lower.	
 Moody's became the first ratings agency to cut Portugal's
credit standing to junk, warning the country may need a second
round of rescue funds before it can return to capital markets.	
 This ended a seven day winning streak for European equities
and commodities lower after they had been stronger in Asian
trading.	
 Moody's also warned its credit outlook on Chinese banks may
turn negative as China's local government debt may be
understated by as much 3.5 trillion yuan ($540 billion).

 Caution on the outlook for China was also heightened after
Singapore's Temasek, a sovereign wealth fund, sold part of its
stake in two of the so-called ""Big Four"" Chinese banks.	
 
 BARCLAYS BULLISH	
 However, a bullish longer term view from banks on oil prices
helped prevent sharper losses. 
Barclays Capital raised its 2012 forecast for Brent on
Tuesday by $10 to $115 per barrel, and upgraded its 2012
forecast for U.S. crude by $4 to $110.	
 The bank left its Brent forecast for 2011 at $112 but cut
its U.S. crude 2011 forecast by $6 to $100.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
Market players said prices were also dented by a 60 million
barrel release of emergency stocks by the International Energy
Agency, though there was still uncertainty as to how the oil
would be released and the extent of its overall impact.	
Top exporter Saudi Arabia earlier said it would pump enough
oil to meet global supply after an OPEC meeting failed to reach
agreement on increasing quotas. 
 However, traders said Asian refiners may skip taking extra
volumes of crude being offered by Saudi Arabia as it failed to
cut prices deeply enough to lure buyers. 
The Saudis have effectively signalled that they believe the
market is well supplied at current prices and they see no need
to offer bigger discounts, said Clyde Russell, a Reuters market
analyst. 
An oversubscribed sale of U.S. crude reserves last week also
had oil analysts and investors assessing whether it reflected
tighter global oil supplies than recent assessments. 
Crude oil inventories in top consumer United States are
expected to have dropped last week for a fifth straight time,
according to a Reuters poll.	
Industry group American Petroleum Institute will release its
weekly report later in the day, while the U.S. Energy
Information Administration will issue its own data on Thursday.

 In the Middle East, violence and unrest in Yemen and Iraq
continues to provide a supportive geopolitical premium as a
factor lifting oil prices, analysts said.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - Gold prices climbed for
a third day on Wednesday, rising to a two-week high after a
rate hike in China put inflation concerns back in the spotlight
and as worries over euro zone debt stoked safe-haven buying.
 After rising in tandem with oil and grains on Tuesday, gold
broke away from a lackluster commodities complex and shrugged
off a stronger dollar as risk-aversion pushed prices toward the
top of the market's two-month trading range.
 ""People are choosing gold right now looking for some
safe-haven investment and I think that might continue for a
while,"" Michael Daly, gold specialist, at PFGBest in Chicago.
 Spot gold's  rose to $1,529.94 an ounce by 2:50 p.m.
EDT (1850 GMT) from $1,515.70 late in New York on Tuesday.
Earlier, it reached a two-week peak at $1,533.45.
 U.S. gold futures  for August delivery added $16.50
an ounce to settle at $1,529.20 an ounce, a 1.09 percent
increase, after rising earlier to a two-week peak at $1,534.50.
 ""With China raising rates, and normally when a bank of that
size raises rates it's negative for gold and silver, but I
think savvier investors are more concerned about inflation,
because higher cost of living is going to trickle down
globally,"" Daly said.
 Overnight, China's central bank increased interest rates by
25 basis points, its third increase this year, making clear
that taming inflation is a top priority even as economic growth
slows modestly. [ID:nL6E7I60ZH]
 ""In real terms, you are not making any money by just
holding cash. A lot of new middle-class Chinese have cottoned
on to this, and there is a lot of demand for gold as a store of
wealth under these circumstances,"" said VM Group analyst Carl
Firman.
 The euro slid for a second straight day against the U.S.
dollar as the Chinese interest rate hike raised global growth
concerns in a market already unnerved by the downgrade of
Portugal's debt to junk. [USD/]
 Often this would weigh on dollar-denominated gold in
overseas markets. But the risk aversion trade has drawn
investors to both assets.
 <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Gold vs. EUR/USD correlation: http://r.reuters.com/kuj52s
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 The metal was also lifted by concerns over euro zone debt
after Moody's cut Portugal's credit rating to junk status, and
an upcoming debate on raising the U.S. debt ceiling.
 ""The issues surrounding the euro zone are going to last for
quite some time. So, they are something that markets are going
to have to be dealing with on an ongoing basis,"" said Macquarie
analyst Hayden Atkins.
 Bonds issued by the euro zone's weaker countries came under
intense pressure after the Moody's cut, which raised fears
Portugal would also eventually be pushed into a debt
restructuring. [GVD/EUR]
 Gold also received a nudge up from safe-haven buyers eyeing
a report showing sluggish growth in the U.S. services sector in
June. [ID:nEAPA60DMO]
 ECB MEETING AWAITED
 Traders will be watching the European Central Bank's policy
meeting on Thursday. The bank is set to lift euro zone interest
rates to 1.5 percent and to show no softening of its stance
that Greece must not default on its debts. [ID:nLDE7631D1]
 Expectations that the ECB will hike rates more quickly than
the U.S. Federal Reserve have helped lift the euro more than 7
percent against the dollar so far this year, supporting gold.
 Also on Thursday, U.S. weekly jobless claims are seen
coming in at levels that continue to show a weak jobs sector,
anticipating a tepid U.S. employment report for June on Friday.
Economists, on average, look for payrolls growth of 90,000.
 From a technical perspective, the precious metal is facing
tough resistance after its latest break higher.
 ""We see resistance at $1,528, representing a 61.8 percent
retracement of our June drop from $1,558 to $1,479,"" said
ScotiaMocatta in a note.
 Other analysts predict a longer period of sideways
consolidation roughly between $1,475 and $1,550 an ounce.
 On the supply side, investors were awaiting fresh
developments in a strike in Freeport-McMoran's Indonesia mine,
as well as the threat of a strike in South Africa's main gold
mines. [ID:nL3E7I61WX] [ID:nLDE7641D0]
 Silver  was up at $35.98 an ounce from $35.45 on

after a sovereign fund unloaded a stake in two banks, flashing a
cautious signal about risk even after the euro clawed back
losses endured on Moody's downgrade of Portugal to junk status.

China and euro zone debt woes kept a lid on gains. 
 * European shares were set to rise for an eighth straight

shares could succumb to pressure after Moody's downgraded
Portugal's credit rating to ""junk"", in a move which is likely to
prompt further worries over the region's debt crisis.

214,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2011 01:40AM ET</span>",UPDATE 3-Oil pressured by Europe debt worries," * Brent touches low of $112.35
 * Portugal ""junk"" rating adds to market jitters
 * Bullish outlook from banks lends some support

 By Simon Falush	
 LONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell around $1 on
Wednesday as Moody's decision to cut Portugal's credit rating to
""junk"" status revived investor concerns about Europe's debt
problems and saw investors retreating from riskier assets.	
 ICE Brent crude  fell 84 cents to $112.77 a barrel by
0840 GMT after touching a session low of $112.35. The benchmark
rose more than $2 on Tuesday, its first gain in three sessions.
U.S. crude  was down 24 cents at $96.65 a barrel. 
 Moody's became the first ratings agency to cut Portugal's
credit standing to junk, warning the country may need a second
round of rescue funds before it can return to capital markets.	
 This ended a seven day winning streak for European equities
and pushed both Brent and U.S. light crude lower after they had
been stronger in Asian trading.	
 ""It looks a bit sketchy in Europe, there are a few worries
about debt,"" said Rob Montefusco, oil trader at Sucden
Financial. ""(Gains in Asia time) did look a bit overdone, I
think we were seeing some funds coming back in at the start of
the quarter after they lightened the previous week.""	
 Moody's also warned its credit outlook on Chinese banks may
turn negative as China's local government debt may be
understated by as much 3.5 trillion yuan ($540 billion).

 Caution on the outlook for China, a major energy consumer,
was also heightened after Singapore's Temasek, a sovereign
wealth fund, sold part of its stake in two of the so-called ""Big
Four"" Chinese banks.	
 
 BARCLAYS BULLISH	
 However, a bullish longer term view from banks on oil prices
helped prevent sharper losses. 
Barclays Capital raised its 2012 forecast for Brent on
Tuesday by $10 to $115 per barrel, and upgraded its 2012
forecast for U.S. crude by $4 to $110. The bank left its Brent
forecast for 2011 at $112 but cut its U.S. crude 2011 forecast
by $6 to $100.

Market players said prices were also dented by a 60 million
barrel release of emergency stocks by the International Energy
Agency, though there was still uncertainty as to how the oil
would be released and the extent of its overall impact.	
Top exporter Saudi Arabia earlier said it would pump enough
oil to meet global supply after an OPEC meeting failed to reach
agreement on increasing quotas. 
 However, traders said Asian refiners may skip taking extra
volumes of crude being offered by Saudi Arabia as it failed to
cut prices deeply enough to lure buyers. 
The Saudis have effectively signalled that they believe the
market is well supplied at current prices and they see no need
to offer bigger discounts, said Clyde Russell, a Reuters market
analyst. 
An oversubscribed sale of U.S. crude reserves last week also
had oil analysts and investors assessing whether it reflected
tighter global oil supplies than recent assessments. 
Crude oil inventories in top consumer United States are
expected to have dropped last week for a fifth straight time,
according to a Reuters poll.	
Industry group American Petroleum Institute will release its
weekly report later in the day, while the U.S. Energy
Information Administration will issue its own data on Thursday.

 In the Middle East, violence and unrest in Yemen and Iraq
continues to provide a supportive geopolitical premium as a
factor lifting oil prices, analysts said.

 * Coming Up: API oil data/wkly, 2030 GMT

 By Francis Kan	
 SINGAPORE, July 6 (Reuters) - Brent crude edged up on
Wednesday, rising for a second straight session on expectations
of higher demand in the months ahead and tighter U.S.
inventories, but concerns about moderating economic growth in
China and euro zone debt woes kept a lid on gains.	
 ICE Brent crude  climbed 27 cents to $113.88 a barrel
by 0311 GMT. The benchmark rose more than $2 on Tuesday, its
first gain in three sessions. U.S. crude  was at $97.39 a
barrel, up 50 cents.	
 Soft manufacturing data from China and ongoing worries about
Europe's economy have weighed on sentiment, but the prospect of
tightening global oil supplies propelled Brent oil to a two-week
high on Tuesday.	
 ""We expect strong demand growth in China, India, Saudi
Arabia and Brazil, while non-OPEC supply increases are unlikely
to keep up,"" said Chen Xinyi, a commodities analyst with
Barclays Capital. ""Our demand forecast for China already takes
into account the moderation in GDP growth in 2012."" 
 Barclays Capital raised its 2012 forecast for Brent by $10
to $115 per barrel, and upgraded its 2012 forecast for U.S.
crude by $4 to $110. The bank left its Brent forecast for 2011
at $112 but cut its U.S. crude 2011 forecast by $6 to $100.

 Citigroup said Brent will fall to $90 a barrel by September
because of the International Energy Agency's move to release oil
reserves and an increase in Saudi Arabia's production, before
bouncing for the longer term. 
 However, an unexpectedly mild reduction in Saudi official
selling prices may make it difficult for the world's biggest
exporter to boost shipments further. 
 The oversubscribed sale of U.S. crude reserves last week
also had oil analysts and investors assessing whether it
reflected tighter global oil supplies than recent assessments.	
 Crude oil inventories in top consumer United States are
expected to have dropped last week for a fifth straight time,
according to a Reuters poll. Industry group American Petroleum
Institute will release its weekly report later in the day, while
the U.S. Energy Information Administration will issue its own

 Brent is expected to trade between $112.40 to $114.48 per
barrel for one trading session before resuming its rally, while
U.S. crude will consolidate between $96.28 and $97.48 before
heading towards $100 a barrel, according to technical analyses
by Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 Renewed euro zone debt worries after Moody's slashed
Portugal's credit rating into junk territory, however, were
keeping a cap on oil prices. 
 Moody's said there was a great risk the country will need a
second round of financing before it can return to capital
markets.

may turn negative as China's local government debt may be

 SINGAPORE, July 6 (Reuters) - Spot gold rose to a 1-1/2-week
high on Wednesday, supported by a weaker dollar and renewed
worries about the euro zone's debt problem after Moody's slashed
Portugal's credit rating to junk.	
 Moody's also warned that Portugal may need a second round of
rescue funds, cutting into risk appetite in financial markets
and pushing gold to a 1-1/2-week high of $1,516.49 on Tuesday.

 ""Portugal was certainly the trigger, and the mood in the
financial markets has turned a bit cautious,"" said a
Singapore-based trader.	
 The dollar edged lower against a basket of currencies
, as the euro regained some lost ground with short-term
players covered short positions ahead of a European Central Bank
policy meeting. 
 Investors were also watching the ongoing strike in
Freeport-McMoran's Indonesia mine as well as the threat of a
strike in South Africa's main gold mines, which could spur price
rally should any serious production disruption occur.

 Spot gold rose to $1,518.44, its highest since June
24, before easing to $1,516.94 by 0626 GMT, up $1.24 from the
previous close.	
 U.S. gold  edged up 0.3 percent to $1,517.50.	
 The short-term technical picture has turned positive, with
spot gold expected to rebound further towards $1,550 per ounce,
said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 
 Brokerage MF Global expects gold to remain rangebound
between $1,490 to $1,550 in July, supported by expectations that
global monetary policy will remain supportive even though recent
manufacturing data has improved.	
 ""The rebound in global manufacturing will simply return the
economy to a sub-par rate of recovery, which should create an
environment of slow but stable growth, volatility in inflation,
and accommodative monetary policy,"" the firm said in a research
note.	
 ""Such ingredients should maintain a favorable environment
for the gold market this month.""	
 Spot silver led the precious metals complex with a 1
percent gain. It rose earlier to $35.92, highest since June 23.	
 Spot platinum hit $1,739.50, its highest in nearly
two weeks, in an attempt to cross above the 20-day moving
average at $1,740.70. It was last quoted at $1,736.50.	
 Spot palladium rose to a three-week high of $775.25,
building on gains in the past six consecutive sessions on back
of strong equity performance, before easing to $773.20.

 By Carole Vaporean and Jan Harvey
 NEW YORK/LONDON, July 5 (Reuters) - Gold prices shot up to
a 1-1/2-week high on Tuesday , as risk-averse investors bought
the precious metal on concerns about the Chinese economic
outlook, the Greek debt crisis and a Moody's downgrade of
Portugal's debt.
 Spot gold  rose to $1,515.19 an ounce by 3:26 p.m.
EDT (1723 GMT), against $1,495.54 late in New York on Monday.
U.S. gold futures for August delivery  settled $30.10 an
ounce higher at $1,512.70, a 2.03 percent increase.
 Gold futures rose further in after-hours trade, as
investors digested a Moody's Investors Service downgrade of
Portugal's credit rating by four levels to Ba2, two notches
into junk territory.
 Moody's said it saw a great risk that Portugal will need a
second round of official financing before it can return to
capital markets. [ID:N1E764185]
 ""When the deal was made with Greece last week, people who
sold gold as a safety play started to question whether a
similar deal would get cut with Portugal, Ireland and other
countries with debt trouble. And, they put the safety trade
back on a bit today,"" said Jeffrey Friedman, senior market
strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.
 ""The downgrade of Portugal reinforced the notion that we
still need safety. Really, gold's up on a safety concept. Those
are the people who came in the market today,"" Friedman added.
 Weak euro zone data and concerns on China also weighed on
risk sentiment, which gave a safe-haven boost ot the dollar
too. [USD/]
 A stronger dollar usually would weigh on gold, but the
precious metal's value as a haven from risk trumped that
concern.
 Investors fretted about China due to media reports about a
possible rate rise and a Moody's report saying the scale of
problem loans at local governments there may be much bigger
than previously thought. [ID:nL3E7I507Y]
 Concerns about Greece have not faded despite the country's
passage of austerity measures and approval of a 12 billion-euro
loan by euro zone finance ministers. Moody's downgrade of
Portugal added to risk aversion purchases.
 ""We have seen a bit of buying coming back in from some of
the institutional names that have been absent for a while, and
positioning in gold is a lot less from shorter-term players
than it has been,"" said Credit Suisse analyst Tom Kendall.
 U.S. Treasury futures, another safe-haven asset, also
rebounded, paring some heavy losses seen last week. [US/]
 ""If you're talking about the gold market, they beat about
$60 out of it last week. Why can't you have a reasonable
rebound today, even with a stronger U.S. dollar. We shouldn't
be surprised by this,"" said Dennis Gartman, publisher of The
Gartman Letter.
 Some analysts look for gold to next target $1,550 per ounce
as technical and fundamental factors align to send gold
higher.

 ASIAN GOLD BUYING PICKS UP
 Asian gold demand firmed overnight after prices slid below
$1,500 an ounce, with buying picking up in Thailand after
Sunday's election and premiums rising in Singapore. Indian and
Chinese buyers -- the world's top gold consumers -- were also
seen in the market, though seasonal factors muted buying.
[GOL/AS]
 ""Gold will need to search for new sources of inspiration to
move higher, in our view, as the markets contemplate a world
without quantitative easing,"" said Deutsche Bank in a note.
 ""However, we expect a weak U.S. dollar, negative real
interest rates and ongoing central bank diversification into
gold will sustain a constructive outlook for the sector.""
 Data released by the International Monetary Fund showed on
Tuesday that Greece and Tajikistan marginally increased their
gold reserves by 0.03 tonnes and 0.05 tonnes respectively in
May, while Mexico sold 0.19 tonnes. [ID:nL6E7I5069]

 By Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose to their
highest in two weeks on Tuesday, aided by a broad rush back
into battered commodities at the start of the third quarter and
forecasts for a tighter market in the months ahead.
 Crude prices pared gains late in the session after Moody's
Investors Service cut Portugal's credit rating by four levels
to Ba2, two notches into junk territory, reinforcing the
precarious state of euro zone finances.
 Commodities gained broadly in spite of a stronger dollar
and weaker stock markets, extending their rebound from a nearly
six-month low as investors bet the sell-off in the second
quarter -- when the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> dropped
6 percent, the biggest fall since late 2008 -- was overdone.
 The CRB rose about 1.5 percent on Tuesday.
 ""We may be seeing some running to commodities as a safe
haven. When in doubt about all the currencies, move into
commodities. And the sector was a little oversold coming out of
the holiday,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in
Chicago, referring to U.S. Independence Day on Monday.
 Oil was also aided by an upgraded price forecast from
Barclays Capital, upbeat U.S. factory orders and an
unexpectedly mild reduction in Saudi official selling prices
that may make it difficult for the world's biggest exporter to
boost shipments further.
 Brent futures for August  rose $2.22 to settle at
$113.61 a barrel, having moved above 20- and 40-day moving
averages intraday.
 U.S. crude  rose $1.95 to settle at $96.89 a barrel,
pushing intraday above front-month crude's 20-day moving
average and ending above the August contract's 200-day moving
average of $95.99.
 Light trading volumes after Monday's U.S. holiday helped
allow for the price swings. Brent and U.S. volumes both hovered
under half million lots traded and both ran below their 30-day
averages. U.S. volumes were 30 percent below.
 The oversubscribed sale of U.S. crude reserves last week
also had oil analysts and investors assessing whether it
reflected tighter global oil supplies than recent assessments.
 Weekly reports on U.S. oil inventories were expected to
show crude stocks fell, while gasoline stockpiles steadied and
distillate stocks edged up last week, according to a Reuters
survey of analysts on Monday. [ID:nN1E76411F]

 ECONOMIC HORIZON BRIGHTENING?
 New orders received by U.S. factories bounced back in May,
although by less than expected, but the report added to data
suggesting manufacturing is normalizing after being dampened by
supply chain disruptions from the March earthquake in Japan.
[ID:nN1E7640H0]
 Investors shrugged off a ratings agency comment questioning
whether debt held by China's local governments was higher than
previously estimated and the ongoing concerns about Europe's
economy and the struggle to solve Greece's debt problems.
 But oil pulled back from highs after Moody's slashed
Portugal's credit rating into junk territory, saying there is
great risk the country will need a second round of financing
before it can return to capital markets. [ID:nN1E764185]
 Barclays Capital raised its 2012 forecast for Brent by $10
to $115 per barrel, and upgraded its 2012 forecast for U.S.
crude by $4 to $110. The bank left its Brent forecast for 2011
at $112 but cut its U.S. crude 2011 forecast by $6 to $100.
 ""The increase in expectations is due to a forecast further
reduction in global spare capacity in 2012, together with a
significant intensification of the geopolitical background to
the oil market,"" Barclays Capital said in a note.
 Violence and unrest in Yemen and Iraq helped keep a
supportive geopolitical premium as a factor lifting oil prices,
traders and analysts said. [ID:nLDE7640WO] [ID:nL6E7I50B3]

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, July 5 (Reuters) - Spot gold edged down on
Tuesday, under the weight of a stronger dollar as a short
squeeze boosted the greenback, and a weak technical picture cast
a shadow on gold's short-term outlook.	
 The dollar was bought back broadly on a flurry of stop-loss
buying and short-covering by macro funds, while the euro was set
to snap a six-day winning streak. 
 A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated gold more
expensive for buyers who hold other currencies.	
 The technical picture suggested a lack of momentum in
bullion, although physical buying by Asian countries, including
Thailand and Indonesia, helped support prices.	
 Spot gold inched down 0.1 percent to $1,493.70 an
ounce by 0617 GMT.	
 ""We have seen a lot of interest below $1,500, but it is not
enough to bring prices back above the level,"" said Dominic
Schnider, an analyst at UBS Wealth Management.	
 Schnider said that gold's short-term technical picture
looked sluggish after prices broke an uptrend from 2008.	
 ""A lot of people have cleared positions after the uptrend
was broken and we are still in a consolidation phase. Gold could
move towards $1,445 from a technical perspective,"" he said.	
 In the short term, gold's technical signals were seen
neutral after prices failed to drop in the previous session, and
prices were expected to range between $1,479 and $1,514, said
Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 Since June 27, spot gold has traded in a range of $1,478.01
to $1,513.71 an ounce.

 
 
 THAIS BUY ON STRONG BAHT	
 The lower prices have attracted buying on the physical
market from Thailand and Indonesia, dealers in Singapore and
Hong Kong said. 
 ""The election strengthened the baht, encouraging the
purchase of gold from jewelers and bullion traders alike in
Thailand,"" said a dealer based in Singapore.	
 The Thai currency rose more than 1 percent against
the dollar on Monday as Sunday's general election eased worries
about the country's political uncertainty. 
 In Indonesia, jewellers are stocking up gold ahead of the
Ramadan which falls in August this year, during which consumers
traditionally purchase gold jewellery.	
 Interest from India, the world's top gold consumer, remained
muted as the country goes through the monsoon season when
farmers are busy sowing and gold sales is slow.	
 Investors are eyeing a spate of data out of the United
States later this week, including the key non-farm payrolls data
to gauge the health of the world's largest economy.

230,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2011 11:20PM ET</span>","Brent falls on economic concerns, stronger dollar"," * Concerns remain over Greece bailout, U.S. debt ceiling
 * Coming Up: Euro zone Markit Services PMI June, 0758 GMT

 By Francis Kan	
 SINGAPORE, July 5 (Reuters) - Brent crude was lower on
Tuesday, weighed down by lingering concerns over the health of
the global economy, the Greek debt crisis and a stronger dollar.	
 ICE Brent crude  fell 31 cents to $111.08 a barrel by
0241 GMT. U.S. crude  was at $94.80 a barrel, down 14
cents.	
 The market's optimism over efforts by European policymakers
to approve an emergency bailout for Greece was tempered by
Standard & Poor's negative view on the private sector
involvement in a second Greek bailout package. 
 ""There's been a good flow of economic data that has helped
oil prices and if that can continue this week we can expect more
upside,"" said Ben Le Brun, market analyst with CMC Markets in
Sydney. ""But there are concerns still there, including the U.S.
debt ceiling and also the softer Chinese data.""	
 
 DATA, RISKS, TECHNICALS 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has warned of huge risks
if Congress fails to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling by
Aug. 2, potentially triggering a default that could send shivers
through an already-fragile banking system. 
 Signs of a slowdown in China, after data last Friday showed
the country's factory sector grew at its slowest pace in 28
months, is adding to the market's nervousness.	
 China's fledgling services sector also fell slightly in
June but still pointed to solid business expansion as new order
growth quickened to an eight-month high, a report on Tuesday
showed. 
 The market will be closely watching the key U.S. non-farm
payrolls due out this Friday for signs that economic growth in
the world's top oil consumer has regained traction.	
 Weekly U.S. oil inventory data from industry group the
American Petroleum Institute and the government's Department of
Energy will be delayed by a day to Wednesday and Thursday,
respectively, due to Monday's Independence Day holiday.	
 The greenback rose 0.32 percent against a basket of
currencies by 02512 GMT, making dollar-denominated oil more
expensive when purchased in foreign currencies. 
 The euro slipped from one-month highs against the dollar
after Standard & Poor's said a debt rollover plan being
considered for Greece may put the country into selective
default. 
 According to technical charts, Brent crude needs to clear
resistance at $113 a barrel before developing a decent rally
towards a short-term resistance target at $121.47, while U.S.
crude is expected to rise to $98.13 a barrel, says Reuters
market analyst Wang Tao. 
 The U.S. economic data sparked a rally in Asian equities,
with Japan's Nikkei rising near the 10,000 level for the
first time in two months while Australian stocks gained
1 percent. 
 
 IEA RELEASE	
 The International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Monday it
hoped a very sizeable portion of its oil stock release will be
taken up by the market and the move was already adding to
supplies of light, sweet crude. 
 The IEA, adviser to 28 industrialised countries, on June 23
said it would release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic
inventories to fill the gap in supplies left by the disruption
to Libya's output.	
 The tender to sell crude oil from U.S. strategic petroleum
reserves (SPR) as a part of the IEA stock release was
oversubscribed by active bids. 
 But analysts pointed out a lack of coordination and
transparency outside the United States and that the full volume
of 60 million barrels may not be absorbed due to globally weak
demand. 
 Goldman Sachs said it had become clear that the
impact of the IEA's 60-million-barrel oil release would be much
smaller than the initial announcement suggested.	
 The bank expected 2011 Brent crude oil prices to fall by
$6-$8 per barrel, from an earlier estimate of $10-12/bbl, it
said on Friday. 
 In Libya, early hope that peace talks could soon end a
five-month conflict that has halted the OPEC member's oil
exports, and in part sparked the IEA oil stocks release,
appeared to fizzle as both sides stuck to entrenched positions
on the fate of Muammar Gaddafi. 
 Uncertainty over pan-Arab protests and Libya's conflict
pushed Brent to a 32-month peak earlier this year, analysts
said.

 LONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - Gold rose more than half a
percent in very thin volume on Monday after its drop to a
six-week low attracted buyers, and as a credit agency warning
stoked new jitters over the Greek rescue plan.
 Spot gold  rose nearly $10 an ounce or 0.7 percent to
$1,495.45 by 3:38 p.m. EST (1938 GMT), recovering from losses
last week that followed Greece's approval of austerity measures
needed to access another tranche of EU and IMF funding.
 U.S. gold futures for August delivery rose $13.90 an ounce
or nearly 1 percent to $1,496.50, with trading volume at only
around 12 percent of the 30-day average due to the U.S.
Independence Day holiday.
 Gold fell more than 5 percent or nearly $80 an ounce from a
near-record $1,557 less than two weeks ago, but has attracted
some bargain hunters at lower levels.
 ""Sentiment on gold is still far from ideal,"" said Andrey
Kryuchenkov, an analyst at VTB Capital. ""This is buying on the
lows (after) Friday's retreat.""
 Comments from Standard & Poor's that Greece would likely be
in default if it follows a debt rollover plan pushed by French
banks also stoked lingering concerns over the stability of the
euro zone. [ID:nL3E7I40H3]
 The euro retreated from one-month highs against the dollar
after the report from S&P, while the cost of insuring Greek
government debt against default rose. [FRX/] [GVD/EUR]
 ""The debt crisis in Greece has eased somewhat for the time
being, but that does not mean it is solved,"" said Commerzbank
analyst Daniel Briesemann. ""The problem is still there -- the
EU and Greece have only gained some time.""
 The euro is expected to draw support, however, from market
expectations that the European Central Bank will raise key
lending rates at a policy meeting later this week.
 A weaker dollar would tend to benefit gold by making
dollar-priced commodities cheaper for other currency holders as
well as boosting the metal's appeal as an alternative asset.

 By Jan Harvey	
 LONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose 0.5 percent in
Europe on Monday as investors took advantage of the metal's dip
to six-week lows last week to buy into the market, on
expectations that the euro will extend gains versus the dollar.	
 Comments from Standard & Poor's that Greece would likely be
in default if it follows a debt rollover plan pushed by French
banks also stoked lingering concerns over the stability of the
euro zone. 
 Spot gold was bid at $1,494.59 an ounce at 1138 GMT,
against $1,485.80 late in New York on Friday. U.S. gold futures
for August delivery rose $12.60 an ounce to $1,495.20.	
 Trade is likely to be thinned on Monday by the U.S.
Independence Day holiday.	
 Greece last week approved austerity measures needed for it
to access another tranche of funding from the European Union and
IMF, sparking a relief rally in some assets seen as higher risk,
and weighing on gold.	
 But fears that the euro zone debt crisis may have longer to
run have sparked bargain hunting on Monday.	
 ""Market players are using the opportunity to get into gold
at a cheap price after the sharp fall last Friday,"" said
Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann. 
 ""The debt crisis in Greece has eased somewhat for the time
being, but that does not mean it is solved. The problem is still
there -- the EU and Greece have only gained some time.""	
 The euro retreated from one-month highs against the dollar
after the report from S&P, while the cost of insuring Greek
government debt against default rose. 
 The euro is expected to draw support, however, from market
expectations that the European Central Bank will raise interest
rates at a policy meeting later this week.	
 A consequently weaker dollar would tend to benefit gold, as
it makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for other currency
holders, and boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset.

exchange-traded fund, New York's SPDR Gold Trust , fell
nearly 78,000 ounces on Friday, data from the fund showed.	
 ETFs, which issue securities backed by physical stocks of a
precious metal, have accounted for a significant proportion of
gold investment in recent years.	
 Among other precious metals, silver was bid at $34.08
an ounce against $33.94. Spot platinum was bid at
$1,717.74 an ounce versus $1,734.95, while spot palladium
was at $754.97 an ounce against $754.

(Rewrites first paragraph, updates prices)
 By Ikuko Kurahone
 London, July 4 (Reuters) - Oil was little changed in paltry
trade on Monday as a sixth day of gains in European shares
boosted hopes for stronger growth, supporting last week's
rise.
 With ICE Brent crude volume at around one-fifth its 30-day
average due to the U.S. Independence Day holiday, markets
showed little reaction to renewed anxiety over Greece stemming
from a Standard & Poor's warning, or tenuous signs of peace
talks between the Libyan government and rebels.
 ICE Brent crude  slipped 38 cents to $111.45 a
barrel by 2:27 p.m. EDT (1807 GMT), maintaining its poise after
rebounding last week from a four-month low as the initial
impact of a global emergency stockpile release wore off. Brent
rose 6.6 percent last week, the biggest gain since February.
 U.S. crude  rose 6 cents to $95 a barrel, with total
trading volume at less than 5 percent its 30-day average. All
New York Mercantile Exchange transactions on Monday will be
registered as Tuesday trades because of the July 4 holiday.
 Oil prices have been supported by gains in global equity
markets since last week, said Christopher Bellew, oil trader
with Jefferies Bache. ""I think the stock market rebound
indicates some confidence in growth,"" he said.
 The MSCI world equity index <.MIWD00000PUS> rose 0.5
percent to its highest since June 1, gaining more than 5.6
percent in six days, its best such run in a year.
 European shares rose on expectations that U.S. economic
recovery remained on track, although banks fell on Standard &
Poor's negative view on the private sector involvement in a
second Greek bailout package. [.EU]
 The euro dipped from a one-month high against the dollar.
[FRX/]
 While S&P's warning that it would treat a French bank plan
for a rollover of privately held debt as a default did not deal
a death blow to the complex plan, it highlighted the difficulty
of arranging private sector involvement in a second rescue
package. [ID:nL6E7I408N]
 In Libya, early hope that peace talks could soon end a
five-month conflict that has halted the OPEC member's oil
exports appeared to fizzle as both sides stuck to entrenched
positions on the fate of Muammar Gaddafi. [ID:nL6E7I4040]
 The Libyan government said on Monday it was in talks with
opposition figures, but the leader's son Saif al-Islam told a
French newspaper there was no question of negotiating an end to
his father's 42-year rule. The rebels, stepping back from a
hint of a concession, renewed their demand that he go now.

 U.S. GASOLINE DEMAND
 Analysts also pointed out that oil's fundamentals remained
relatively weak.
 The Independence Day holiday is traditionally seen by oil
traders as marking the height of U.S. gasoline demand. However,
U.S. travel group AAA said in late June road travel at the
weekend would fall 2.5 percent from a year ago as expensive
gasoline eats at driving demand. [ID:nN1E75K1CX]
 ""U.S. refiners will be praying that plenty of drivers hit
the road over the holiday weekend to give a boost to weary
gasoline demand fundamentals. However, projections are not very
hopeful,"" JBC Energy said in its research note.
 The International Energy Agency's (IEA) emergency stock
release continued to be a focus for oil markets.
 The tender to sell crude oil from U.S. strategic petroleum
reserves (SPR) as a part of the IEA stock release was
oversubscribed by active bids. [ID:nN1E76014L]
 But analysts pointed out a lack of coordination and
transparency outside the United States and that the full volume
of 60 million barrels may not be absorbed due to globally weak
demand. [ID:nN1E76014L]
 The IEA told a news briefing on Monday that it hoped a very
sizable portion of its oil stock release will be taken up by
the market. [ID:nL6E7I41RJ]
 ICE DATA
 Speculators betting on oil reduced net-long positions in
the week to June 28 in a continuation of the previous week's
trend, data from the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) showed on
Monday.
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) on Friday also showed that hedge funds and other large
speculators cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options
positions in New York and London last week to the lowest level
since November as prices slid. [ID:nN1E7601MR]
 U.S. oil inventory data from industry group the American
Petroleum Institute and the government's Department of Energy
will be delayed by a day to Wednesday and Thursday,
respectively, due to the Independence Day holiday. [EIA/S]

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, July 4 (Reuters) - Gold regained some lost
territory from the previous session on Monday supported by a
weaker dollar, but easing concern about Greece's debt crisis has
diminished gold's appeal as a safe haven in the short term.	
 Euro zone finance ministers have approved a 12 billion euro
instalment of Greece's bailout, sending the euro to a one-month
high against the dollar in Asia on Monday. The dollar
edged down around 0.7 percent against a basket of
currencies. 
 Gold dipped below the key support level of $1,500 in the
last session, and faces strong headwinds in the short term,
traders and analysts said.	
 ""After Greece passed the austerity measures, market
participants will need to find another reason to buy into gold,""
said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures.	
 ""But right now it's hard to find a catalyst for gold prices
to push higher.""	
 
 The price outlook for the rest of the year however remains
bullish, supported by the wobbly economic recovery in the United
States, uncertainties in the euro zone's fiscal health, and high
inflation in major fast-growing economies like China and India,
analysts said.	
 Spot gold gained half a percent to $1,492.89 an ounce
by 0559 GMT, after losing 1 percent in the previous session.	
 U.S. gold  rose 0.7 percent to $1,493.40 an ounce.	
 Technical analysis also pointed at lack of momentum,
suggesting that gold may end its weak rebound below $1,500 and
resume a preceding fall towards $1,472, said Wang Tao, Reuters
market analyst. 
 ""There is small buying interest in Asia, but nothing
game-changing,"" said a Hong Kong-based dealer, ""The gold market
will be taking cues from the euro and oil, which are giving some
upside support to bullion.""	
 Gold is likely to be rangebound between $1,470 and $1,520 in
the next few days, he added.	
 Managed money sharply cut their bullish bets in COMEX gold
futures and options, as bullion prices tumbled, futures
regulator Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed
Friday. 
 Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest
gold-backed exchange-traded fund, dropped to two-week low of
1,205.809 tonnes by July 1.	
 Activity was thin as the U.S. financial markets are closed
for a public holiday on Monday.	
 Supporting market sentiment, about 8,000 workers at
Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold Inc's Indonesian unit
started a seven-day strike, although Freeport said the strike
would not impact production at Grasberg mine, which it claims to
contain the world's largest single gold reserve.

 SINGAPORE, July 4 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose above $112 a
barrel on Monday, after Eurozone policy makers approved an
emergency bailout for Greece and strong U.S. economic data
calmed fears of weakening demand in the world's largest oil
consumer. 
 Euro zone finance ministers on Saturday approved a 12
billion euro installment of Greece's bailout and said details of
a second aid package for Athens would be finalised by
mid-September. 
 The news followed the release of data on Friday showing the
pace of growth in U.S. manufacturing picking up for the first
time in four months. 
 ICE Brent crude  rose 13 cents to $111.90 a barrel by
0245 GMT, after rising as high as $112.08 earlier. U.S. crude
 was at $95.15 a barrel, up 21 cents.	
 ""The US data and the eurozone news is helping oil prices
today, although with U.S. markets closed for a holiday, trading
will be thin and based very much on technicals, "" ANZ Bank oil
analyst Serene Lim said. 
 
 According to technical charts, Brent crude needs to clear a
resistance at $113 a barrel before developing a decent rally
towards a short-term resistance target at $121.47, while U.S.
crude is expected to rise to $98.13 a barrel, says Reuters
market analyst Wang Tao.	
 The U.S. economic data sparked a rally in Asian equities,
with Japan's Nikkei rising near the 10,000 level for the
first time in two months while Australian stocks gained
1 percent. 
 Oil markets will be looking for further signs of economic
recovery to counter demand fears, after China's factory sector
grew at its slowest pace in 28 months, data released on Friday
showed. 
 The key U.S. non-farm payrolls report this Friday will be
keenly watched by participants for evidence that the economy may
be regaining traction, analysts said. 
 Any signs of a slowdown in China add to investor nervousness
because of recent indications of sluggish U.S. economic growth
and Europe's struggles with its debt crisis.	
 Oil prices were also boosted by a weaker dollar ,
which lost ground against a basket of currencies as the euro
traded near a three-week high. 
 The single currency is rallying after Greece avoided a
near-term default and on expectations that the European Central
Bank will raise interest rates by 25 basis points when it meets
this Thursday, analysts said. 
 The successful sale of 30 million barrels of crude by the
U.S. Department of Energy also eased concerns over how the
market would absorb the release of emergency oil stocks by the
International Energy Agency. 
 ""This is positive news as it implies the market's readiness
to absorb the additional barrels,"" said Lim.	
 Some traders and analysts said the agency's planned 60
million barrel crude and oil product release has been badly
coordinated outside the United States. 
 Weekly U.S. oil inventory data from the industry group the
American Petroleum Institute and the government's Department of
Energy will be delayed by a day to Wednesday and Thursday,
respectively, due to Monday's Independence Day holiday.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - Gold fell around 1 percent on
Friday to record its second straight weekly loss, dragged down
by fund selling amid commodity weakness and as safe-haven
buying faded after Greece's approval of an austerity package.
 Bullion came under pressure as Wall Street rallied after a
surprising jump in U.S. manufacturing data eased concerns about
a tepid economic recovery. Slipping crude oil and grain prices
also diminished gold's appeal as an inflation hedge.
 ""Gold clearly is not getting a lift from the global
economic picture or from the sovereign debt front, and
commodities as an asset class is not attracting the same level
of fund buying like they were a month or two months ago,"" said
Bill O'Neill, of commodities investment firm LOGIC Advisors.
 The metal has shed 5 percent in the past seven sessions,
partly due to technical selling as gold dived below $1,500 an
ounce and fell toward its 100-day moving average.
 Spot gold  fell as low as $1,478.01 an ounce, its
weakest since May 17, and was down 0.9 percent at $1,486.51 by
2:50 p.m. EDT (1850 GMT).
 U.S. gold futures for August delivery  settled down
$20.20 at $1,482.60, after trading between $1,478.01 and
$1,502.19.
 Gold fell 1 percent for the week.
 Silver  was down 2.5 percent at $33.77 an ounce.
Holdings of the world's largest silver-backed exchange-traded
fund, the iShares Silver Trust , fell 1.4 million ounces
or 0.5 percent on Thursday, the fund's website showed.
[GOL/ETF]
 The trust saw its biggest quarterly outflow since its
launch in the three months to end June, data on its website
showed, as investors turned their backs on silver amid fears
the metal's rally to record highs had been overdone.
 SAFE-HAVEN BUYING EBBS, GREECE EYED
 The Greek parliament's acceptance this week of a package of
austerity measures needed to obtain further funding from the
European Union and International Monetary Fund has tempered
some risk aversion in the market, curbing demand for gold.

 ""Without a Greek default or something similar, it is
difficult to think of a catalyst that would send gold to new
record highs,"" said Robin Bhar, an analyst at Credit Agricole.
 ""The other factor that could is more quantitative easing
out of the United States, which is unlikely at the moment,"" he
added. ""We think the dollar is probably in for a rebound, so
that provides a bit of a headwind for gold.""
 The dollar index rose for the first time in the last five
days, and is likely to gain further against the euro given
investors' belief that Greece's debt crisis is far from over.
[FRX/]
 Investors' attention focused on the equity markets as July
started on a positive note for U.S. stocks with Wall Street
notching its fifth day of gains after an encouraging
manufacturing report.
 ""We have clearly seen a relief rally across the board in
all risk assets, and gold, (which benefits from) fear of
default, is coming off,"" said Credit Agricole's Bhar.
 Platinum group metals have outperformed gold this week,
with platinum rising 2 percent and palladium up 4 percent, as a
risk-on trade benefited industrial metals more than gold.
 Spot platinum  was down 0.4 percent at $1,713.49 an

 By Jan Harvey	
 LONDON, July 1 (Reuters) - Gold fell to six-week lows below
$1,490 an ounce on Friday, hurt by a drop in oil prices and
gains in the dollar against a basket of currencies, and as
Greece's approval of a key austerity package cut the metal's
appeal as a haven from risk.	
 Spot gold fell as low as $1,489.86 an ounce, its
weakest since May 20, and was bid at $1,492.00 an ounce at 0927
GMT, against $1,499.60 late in New York on Thursday. U.S. gold
futures for August delivery  fell $9.20 to $1,493.60.	
 U.S. crude futures  fell $1 to $94.42 a barrel on
Friday after disappointing economic data from China, where
factory output in June grew at the slowest pace in 28 months.	
 Gold's relationship with oil prices has been patchy of late,
with the risk aversion that typically lifts the precious metal's
safe-haven appeal often hurting industrial commodities, but the
two assets moved together early on Friday. 
 ""We have crude oil weaker, which is reducing inflation
fears, we have a slightly stronger or well-maintained U.S.
dollar and weakness in stock markets, which all argue for weaker
precious metals,"" said Peter Fertig, a consultant at
Quantitative Commodity Research.	
 The dollar index firmed a touch on Friday as some investors
covered shorts ahead of the long U.S. holiday weekend, with all
eyes on U.S. manufacturing data due later in the day. 
 Analysts on average are expecting the index to slip to 51.8
from 53.5 in May.	
 UBS analyst Edel Tully, noting that gold prices have dropped
sharply on this day for the last two years, said in a report:
""Whether today will bring a hat-trick July 1 pullback could well
depend on this afternoon's US ISM manufacturing print.""	
 ""While there is some concern that this could come in below
50, upside surprises from the Chicago PMI and NAPM-Milwaukee
data over the past few days bode well for the ISM numbers."" 
 European shares meanwhile turned negative early on Friday,
giving back some gains after a four-day rally, with miners
giving up some gains as metals prices levelled off. 
 
 DEBT BURDENS	
 Gold has remained largely within a narrow $1,490-1,515 range
this week, but is on track for a second consecutive weekly loss,
of around 0.4 percent.	
 In the world's biggest gold consumer, India, physical buying
edged up as traders continued to see gold below the keenly
watched $1,500 an ounce level as a bargain, but buying was muted
due to a seasonal lull in demand.	
 News that the Greek parliament has accepted a package of
austerity measures needed for it to access further funding from
the European Union and International Monetary Fund has tempered
some early risk aversion, curbing demand for gold as a haven.

 Concerns over the stability of the euro zone as some smaller
economies struggle with heavy debt burdens were a crucial factor
driving gold to record highs above $1,575 an ounce earlier this
year.	
 ""The Greek vote was broadly positive for base metals,
negative for precious metals, which are still richly priced,""
said RBS Global Banking & Markets analyst Nick Moore.	
 ""We prefer platinum and palladium, (which are set) to
benefit from automotive manufacturing boosting output later on.""	
 The white metals have outperformed gold this week, with
platinum rising 1.5 percent and palladium up 3.3 percent, as a
retreat in risk aversion benefited industrial metals more than
safe-haven gold. 
 Spot platinum was bid at $1,701.49 an ounce versus
$1,720.15, while spot palladium was at $750.47 an ounce
against $752.25.	
 Silver was bid at $34.17 an ounce against $34.65.
Holdings of the world's largest silver-backed exchange-traded
fund, the iShares Silver Trust fell by 1.4 million ounces
or just under 0.5 percent on Thursday, the fund said.

 By Robert Gibbons and Antonita Devotta
 NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - Oil fell on Friday on signs of
slower growth in China and weaker U.S. consumer sentiment,
offsetting a supportive report showing an improving
manufacturing sector in the United States.
 An intraday bounce by the dollar against the euro and the
strength of the dollar index <.DXY>, measuring the greenback
against a basket of currencies, also helped pressure
dollar-denominated oil.
 ""Crude futures fell today on the soft factory data from
China and the stronger dollar,"" said Gene McGillian, analyst at
Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The U.S. Department of Energy announced the list of offers
it had received for for 30 million barrels of crude it will
release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. [ID:nN1E7600OJ]
 The sale attracted more interested buyers than barrels
offered and investors continued to try to gauge the effect on
the market from the new supply of crude and products that will
enter the market as part of the International Energy Agency's
coordinated release announced on June 23.
 Both Brent and U.S. crude posted weekly gains despite
Friday's price slips, with volatility aided by slim volumes
ahead of Monday's U.S. Independence Day holiday. Volumes for
both U.S. and Brent crude were well below 30-day averages.
 Brent futures for August  fell 71 cents to settle at
$111.77 a barrel, after falling as low as $109.50 intraday. But
front-month Brent rebounded to post a weekly gain of 6.33
percent.
 U.S. crude  fell 48 cents to settle at $94.94 a
barrel, having recovered from an earlier $93.45 low. For the
week, front-month crude gained 4.15 percent.
 China's factory sector grew at its slowest pace in 28
months in June as new orders expanded less quickly as weaker
global demand and tight monetary policy at home pinched
production. [ID:nL3E7I104E]
 U.S. consumer sentiment worsened in June, a Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan survey showed. Falling gasoline
prices stabilized consumers' view of current conditions, but
longer-term expectations remained subdued. [ID:nN1E7600JI]
 The dollar got a boost and crude prices pared some losses
intraday after data from the Institute for Supply Management
showed the U.S. manufacturing sector expanded in June more than
expected, sparking some optimism that the sputtering economy
may be regaining some traction. [ID:nN1E7600H5]
 Any signs of a slowdown in China add to investor
nervousness because of recent indications of slowed U.S.
economic growth and Europe's struggles with its debt crisis.
 Although the Greek parliament voted for an austerity
package this week, there is skepticism about the government's
ability to deliver on promised cuts.
 Some analysts expect investor caution until next week's
June nonfarm payrolls report arrives on July 8.

 IEA oil stocks release PDF: http:/link.reuters.com/jac42s
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 Oil was not the only commodity feeling pressure. The 19
commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> fell nearly half a
percent, extending its weak trend from June and the second
quarter.
 ""I'm hearing from hedge funds that there is a potential for
a big unwind in commodities. At the very least they will start
having to trade more on supply and demand fundamentals and less
on outside factors,"" said Richard Ilczyszyn, senior market
strategist, Lind-Waldock in Chicago.
 ""Longs (in oil) are wary that pushing prices too high will
trigger another reserves release.""
 Money managers sharply cut their net-long U.S. crude
futures and options positions in the week to last Tuesday, the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in a report released
after oil prices settled on Friday. [ID:nEMS075RP9]

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, July 1 (Reuters) - Spot gold held steady on
Friday, set to cap a week marked by a narrow trading range as
Greece's approval of austerity measures diminished safe-haven
demand for bullion in the short term.	
 Greece's parliament passed the final austerity measures on
Thursday, to secure emergency funding from international lenders
and avert a debt default. 
 Just as investors watch how Greece will implement these
unpopular measures, troubling signs from the U.S. economy are
likely to help retain gold's appeal over the longer term.	
 The latest U.S. data painted a mixed picture, with factory
activity in the Midwest accelerating in June, but initial
jobless claims last week higher than expected, just as the
Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond purchase programme ended.

 Spot gold was little changed at $1,498.70 an ounce by
0602 GMT, nearly flat from a week earlier.	
 U.S. gold  edged down 0.3 percent to $1,499.10	
 ""The seeming resolution of the Greece crisis has probably
hurt gold, but I think there's enough interest from the Chinese
and central banks to sustain it at around $1,500 for now,"" said
David Thurtell, an analyst at Citigroup.	
 Gold has been trading in a range between $1,490 and $1,514
this week, off last week's peak of $1,557.75. Interest in the
physical market grew when prices fell below $1,500, but demand
alone is unlikely to lift prices above the current range,
traders said.	
 Gold was the best-performing metal in the second quarter,
during which commodities posted the largest quarterly loss since
the 2008 financial crisis led by steep sell-offs in grains and
oil. 
 
 Spot silver inched down 0.4 percent to $34.51, headed
for a 0.6-percent weekly rise, snapping two consecutive weeks of
decline.	
 ""Silver fundamentals remain weak and heavily dependent on
investor interest to plug the gap,"" said Barclays Capital in a
research note.	
 Interest in exchange-traded products has diminished.	
 Holdings in the iShares Silver Trust , the world's
largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund, dipped to 9,536.65
tonnes by June 30, marking the third month of consecutive
outflow with a monthly drop of 404.68 tonnes.	
 Platinum group metals, used in various industrial
applications, outperformed gold and silver this week, boosted by
the global stock market which rallied to a one-month high as
Greece's debt crisis eases.	
 Spot platinum lost 0.6 percent to $1,710.24, on
course for a 1.8 percent weekly gain. 
 Spot palladium edged down 0.2 percent to $750.75,
poised for a gain of more than 3 percent on the week.

 By Florence Tan	
 SINGAPORE, July 1 (Reuters) - Brent and U.S. oil fell on
Friday after manufacturing in China hit a 28-month low, raising
concerns that fuel demand at the world's second largest oil
importer may slow with the market also watching the progress of
reserve oil stocks sales by IEA member nations.	
 Chinese factory output expanded in June at its lowest pace
in 28 months, a survey showed, indicating the world's
second-largest economy is feeling the pinch of monetary policy
tightening and slack global demand. 
 ICE Brent crude  fell 81 cents to $111.67 a barrel by
0240 GMT, after falling nearly $1 earlier. Brent is on track to
post a rise this week after two straight weekly losses. U.S.
crude  was at $94.82 a barrel, down 60 cents.	
 ""The data is just showing a recurring theme in China.
Manufacturing continues to slow but it is still growing above
the 50 threshold,"" CMC Markets analyst Ben Le Brun said.	
 ""It depends on whether you see the glass half empty or half
full,"" he said, adding that investors were either waiting to see
data showing contraction at some stage or that tighter policies
have successfully tamed inflation, promoting growth.	
 China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to
50.9 in June from 52 in May, weaker than market expectations of
51.3, based on a Reuters poll. But it was the 28th straight
month that the official PMI has stood above the threshold of 50
that demarcates expansion from contraction.	
 Global investors are unnerved by any signs of a slowdown in
China, a key global growth engine as the U.S. economic recovery
loses momentum and Europe struggles with a sovereign debt
crisis.	
Still, most economists believe the world's second-largest
economy, underpinned by the country's relentless urbanisation,
is in no danger of a hard landing. [ID: nL3E7HL0ID]	
 
 
 IEA STOCKS RELEASE	
 Investors are also watching how well the market can absorb a
release of emergency oil stocks by the International Energy
Agency as Germany, the Netherlands and the United States sought
bids for their crude supplies in tenders.

 ""We did experience that low point after the announcement of
the stocks release, but 60 million barrels is not huge in terms
of world consumption,"" Le Brun said.	
 ""Analysts have started talking about oil (WTI) at $100 again
and it's very interesting to see prices at just under the
200-day average at the moment.""	
 WTI prices could hit $100 within this month if they go
through a key resistance at $97.27 a barrel, Le Brun said.	
 The International Energy Agency has sent conflicting signals
to the market this week. Some traders and analysts said the
agency's planned 60 million barrel crude and oil product release
has been badly coordinated outside the United States.
 
 OPEC's Secretary General Abdullah al-Badri on Monday
demanded an immediate halt to the IEA action designed to force
down crude prices. 
 ""With that in mind, it's possible that OPEC may cut some
output,"" Le Brun said. ""This remains to be seen.""	
 OPEC oil output is expected to remain lower in June than
before the conflict in Libya largely shut down its oil industry,
extra supply from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf members.

 Supply from all 12 members of the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to average 29.45
million barrels per day (bpd) this month, up from a revised 29.1
million bpd in May, a Reuters survey showed.	
 But output may be lower than expectations. Industry sources
said earlier in June that Saudi Arabia would boost production to
almost 10 million bpd this month, but analysts said there was no
sign yet of that much demand in the market.	
 Markets in the United States are shut on Monday for a
national holiday.	
 ""There is plenty of economic data ahead of the U.S. holiday
on Monday. If they are positive, we would see another uptick in
oil prices,"" Le Brun said.

257,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2011 03:00PM ET</span>",US crude ends Q2 with biggest loss since Q4 2008," NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures ended
higher on Thursday, but closed the month down 7 percent and the
quarter slumping more than 10 percent, the biggest quarterly
loss since the fourth quarter of 2008.
 The day's trade was volatile as end-of-quarter
book-squaring mingled with worries about violence in Greece and
a consumer nations' plan to release government-held crude.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for August
delivery  rose for a third day and settled at $95.42 a

$93.88 to $95.82.
 For the month, front-month crude fell $7.28, or 7.1

slumped $11.23, or 9.9 percent.
 For the quarter, front-month crude skidded $11.30, or 10.6
percent. That marked the biggest quarterly loss since the last
quarter of 2008, at the height of the financial crisis
following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, when prices fell

 NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - Gold fell on the last day of
the quarter on Thursday, as hopes that Greece would avoid a
debt default eroded safe-haven interest, but secured an 11th
consecutive quarterly gain on global economic uncertainty.
 Gold snapped a two-session winning streak even as the euro
rose against the dollar after Greece passed a crucial austerity
plan to secure international aid.
 David Meger, director of metals trading at Vision Financial
Markets, said that safe-haven bids in gold fell as Greece
appeared to avoid imminent bankruptcy. ""However, the whole
European sovereign debt issue is far from behind us,"" he said.
 The metal is down almost 4 percent in the last six
sessions.
 Bullion was the quarter's top performer in the metals

retained in the aftermath of the Greek debt crisis, but prices
may be range-bound in the short run due to lack of speculative
interest.

SINGAPORE)	
 By Amanda Cooper	
 LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - Gold buckled under the weight of
growing investor appetite for risk on Thursday after Greece
looked increasingly likely to push through austerity measures,
which offset the potentially bullish impact of a weaker dollar.	
 The price of gold is on course for an eleventh consecutive
quarterly gain during the second three months of 2011.	
 Gold has over the past three months been a major beneficiary
of the investor anxiety over Greece's potential to affect the
rest of the euro zone economy, of the triple disaster in Japan
and over the outlook for global economic growth.	
 The precious metal is set for a quarterly rise of 5.5
percent, compared with declines of 1.4 percent in the S&P 500
, 4.8 percent in crude oil  and 2.8 percent in
emerging equities in this time. 
 Greece's parliament passed the first of two austerity
measures on Wednesday despite escalating street violence. It is
expected to vote in favour of the final austerity bill later on
Thursday. 
 Spot gold was down 0.1 percent at $1,509.20
an ounce by 1000 GMT, after rising for two straight sessions.
U.S. gold  was flat at $1,510.40.	
 ""Gold has got to stay supported, however this plays out. The
fact is Greece is bankrupt and some restructuring is
inevitable,"" said Credit Agricole analyst Robin Bhar.	
""We are going into the summer season...but I can
see gold holding and consolidating. With all these issues still
to be addressed and what to do with Greece, I can't see any
other way but to remain generally in a broad range.""	
 The dollar lost a quarter of a percent against a
basket of currencies, as the euro rallied after Greece moved a
step closer to securing international aid. 
 Normally, weakness in the dollar would give gold a lift
as it cuts the cost of buying it for non-U.S. investors. But
this inverse link to the currency can sometimes erode. 
 ""If Greece passes the bill, we may see gold test
higher tonight,"" said a Hong Kong-based trader, but added that
the upside could be limited at $1,520, around the 50-day moving
average.	
 
 SAFE SAFE-HAVEN	
 Gold's safe haven appeal is likely to be retained in the
aftermath of the Greek debt crisis, but prices may be trapped in
a range in the short run due to lack of speculative interest.	
 ""We need to see if fund buying is coming back, which will
largely depend on whether there will be more stimulus plans in
the United States after the current round of quantitative easing
ends,"" said Ronald Leung, a physical dealer at Lee Cheong Gold
Dealers.	
 So far in the second quarter of the year, investors buying
of physical gold, as reflected by changes in holdings of the
metal in exchange-traded funds, has picked up relative to the
first quarter of the year.	
 Between March and June so far, some 2.101 million
ounces of gold have flowed into the major ETFs, according to
Reuters data, compared with an outflow of 2.271 million ounces
in the first three months of the year. 
 Spot silver was last up 0.4 percent at
$34.90 an ounce , on course for a 7 percent quarterly
loss, its first after nine straight quarterly gains and its
worst since the third quarter of 2008 , when the global
financial crisis was approaching its most
intense . 
 Spot palladium outperformed
the precious metals complex with a
1. 4 -percent rise, but on course for its
second straight month of loss es . Palladium
remained the worst-performing precious metal this year, down
more than 5 percent so far. 
 Platinum was last down 0.2 percent at
$1,720.00 an ounce, having hit three-month lows this week and
set for its first quarterly decline in a year, down 2.7 percent
in the second three month of 2011.

 By Antonita Devotta
 NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - Brent crude futures finished
slightly higher in seesaw trading on Thursday, with investors
concerned about violence in Greece and uncertainty surrounding
the IEA's emergency oil release plan.
 Brent  rose 8 cents on Thursday to $112.48 a barrel.
But Brent ended June down 3.6 percent for its second monthly
decline. It ended the second quarter down 4.9 percent, the
biggest quarterly decline in a year as investors worried about
demand amid signs of a slowing global economy.
 U.S. crude  settled at $95.42 a barrel, up 65 cents
for the day but down 10.6 percent in the last three months, its
biggest quarterly slump since the crash in the fourth quarter
of 2008.
 Volumes were thin, with U.S. crude trading 30 percent off
and Brent crude dealings 9 percent off their 30-day averages.
 ""With U.S. trade winding down for the end of the quarter
and the July 4th holiday coming up, we may be seeing some pause
in frantic activity, with traders less willing to open new
positions,"" analyst Tim Evans of Citi Futures Perspective
said.
 U.S. crude futures fell for the second straight month,
ending June down 7.4 percent amid evidence of an economic
slowdown in the Unites States, the world's largest oil
consumer.
 But for the year so far, crude prices remain up as the
civil war in Libya has disrupted exports. Brent is up 18
percent so far in 2011, with U.S. crude up 4 percent.
 On Thursday, oil drew some support from U.S. data showing
factory activity in the Midwest picked up in June, fostering
hopes for third-quarter economic growth. [ID:nN1E75T07N]
 For the day, crude also drew support from higher product
prices. The front-month heating oil contract  expired and
settled at $2.93, up 1.25 cents. The front-month RBOB future
also expired, settling at $3.0316, up 2.19 cents.
 ""Products went off very strong, and lent support, and the
dollar was weak all day. We settled just above the close on the
day before the IEA action,"" said Stephen Schork, president at
the Schork Group in Villanova, Pennsylvania
 ""The IEA challenged speculators to a game of chicken and
they may make the U.S. administration pay.""
 The International Energy Agency (IEA) announced last week
that it was releasing emergency stockpiles of oil last week to
fill the gap left by the disruption to Libya's output.
 WEIGHING OIL DOWN
 Oil's gains during Thursday's session were capped by a
steep decline in the broader commodities complex, which tumbled
when a report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture put
domestic corn supply way above estimates, adding that a bumper
crop could be on the way. [ID:nN1E75T0AR]
 The report shocked forecasters and shoved grain markets
sharply lower, sending the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>,
a commodities benchmark, down as much as 1 percent for the day.
Oil represents about 25 percent of the index.
 Violence worsened in Athens after the Greek Parliament
approved an implementation bill for a 28-billion euro package
of austerity measures required under a European
Union/International Monetary Fund bailout. [ID:nL6E7HT0Z7]
 Lawmakers voted by a clear margin for the five-year
framework of spending cuts, tax rises and state asset sales,
handing a 155-138 vote victory to Prime Minister George
Papandreou.
 Comments from European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude
Trichet reinforced expectations of an interest rate hike next
week. The euro hit a three-week high against the dollar,
triggering oil's early jump.
 ""The eubilience from the resolution of the Greek debt
crisis is yielding to the realities of a challenged demand
landscape given the recent economic data,"" said John Kilduff,
partner at Again Capital LLC.
 ""While there may be some signs that current economic soft
patch has hit bottom, a real upswing is not near either.""
 IEA RELEASE PLANS CLOUDED BY UNCERTAINTY
 Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency has sent
conflicting signals to the market this week. Some traders and
analysts said the agency's planned 60 million barrel crude and
oil product release has been badly coordinated outside the
United States. [ID:nL6E7HU13F]
 The Netherlands will hold a tender for sale of up to
700,000 barrels of crude oil on Friday, as part of the IEA
stock release programme, while Germany has said its 2.1 million
barrels of crude sales offered will be mostly Iranian heavy
crude. [ID:nnLDE75T0US]
 JP Morgan analyst Lawrence Eagles said the varying auction
methods in Europe and Asia may see less than a third of 30
million barrels earmarked for release in those countries taken
up by traders, though he expected the vast majority of the 30
million barrels from the United States to be sold.
 ""The difference in the way oil is supplied to the market
not only makes the release less effective, but also acts as a
political barrier to a further emergency release by the IEA,""
Eagles said.
 The U.S. Energy Department said it received more than 90
offers to purchase oil from the SPR, adding the offering of
30.2 million barrels of light, sweet crude oil was
substantially oversubscribed. [ID:nWNA2640]
 All contracts with the winning companies will be completed
by July 11, at which time the department said it would provide
details about the companies and the prices they paid for the
oil.

 By Jessica Donati	
 LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - Oil prices held close to $112 a barrel on
Thursday as worries about inflation and an impending rate rise from the European
Central Bank balanced against a weaker dollar.	
""We are in a state of strong vigilance,"" Jean-Claude Trichet told the
European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in Brussels, using
a phrase that has become synonymous with a rate hike. 
The ECB meets for a policy meeting next week. 
Euro zone data, due at 0900 GMT, are forecast to show inflation ticked up to
2.8 percent this month, well above the ECB's target of close to but below 2.0
percent. 
ICE Brent crude  was down 41 cents to $111.99 a barrel at 0815 GMT
after jumping more than 3 percent on Wednesday. 
U.S. crude  was at $94.52 a barrel, down 25 cents, after gaining 2
percent in the previous session. 
Trichet blamed high commodity and energy prices for the bulk of the increase
in inflation.	
 ""We are observing continued upwards pressure of prices. Inflation rates over
the last few month largely reflects higher energy and commodity prices. 
A weaker dollar supported oil prices. The dollar index , which measures
the greenback against a basket of currencies, slipped 0.36 percent as the euro
rallied on Trichet's address. 
 ""It's not finished for Greece yet, there is a last vote... and Trichet has
said inflation is on the upside primarily on energy prices which is hawkish. If
the system tightens up well, Greece doesn't need a rate rise,"" Thorbjorn Bak
Jensen, an oil analyst at Global Risk Management.	
 
UNCERTAINTY 
The International Energy Agency has sent conflicting signals to the market
this week saying on Wednesday it is up to operators to decide whether to release
crude oil or oil products as part of the emergency release plan.	
""There is a huge misunderstanding on this point,"" the agency's head of energy
markets and security told Reuters. 
 The table provided by the International Energy Agency on Monday, which
showed the breakdown of crude and products on its website, was purely
indicative, the IEA's Didier Houssin said. 
 But the agency could decide whether to repeat the release around the third
week of July, Richard Jones, deputy executive director of the IEA, said late on
Wednesday. 
""The market is still assessing the release of emergency stocks by the IEA,""
said Ben Westmore, commodities economist at the National Australia Bank. 
 ""The IEA has shown that it is ready to step in to meet coverage."" 
 
 
U.S. STOCKS TIGHTEN 
In the United States, oil stocks tightened as crude imports fell while
gasoline inventories fell unexpectedly. 
U.S. crude stockpiles fell for a fourth straight week, government data
showed, dropping 4.4 million barrels, much more than forecast, to 359.5 million
barrels. Gasoline inventories declined 1.4 million barrels to 213.2 million
barrels, against the forecast for a small increase. 
""The long and sustained whittling away of surplus commercial inventory has
continued,"" analysts at Barclays Capital led by Paul Horsnell said. ""The
overhang of U.S. crude oil and oil product inventories above their five-year
average ... now stands only 1.3 million barrels above a 30-month low.""

 SINGAPORE, June 30 (Reuters) - Brent held above $112 on
Thursday, buoyed by tighter U.S. oil stocks and a weaker dollar
after an initial favourable vote on austerity measures by
Greece's parliament, but concerns that the IEA may decide to
release more oil next month capped gains.	
 ICE Brent crude  rose 20 cents to $112.60 a barrel by
0600 GMT after jumping more than 3 percent on Wednesday.	
 U.S. crude  was at $95.16 a barrel, up 39 cents, after
gaining 2 percent in the previous session. Both grades are
headed for their first quarterly drop in a year.	
 Brent's premium to U.S. light sweet crude stayed wide at
more than $17.  
 A weaker dollar supported oil prices. The dollar index
, which measures the greenback against a basket of
currencies, slipped 0.47 percent as Greece moved a step closer
to securing international aid. 
 But the International Energy Agency has sent a bearish
signal to the market by releasing emergency oil stocks in a
""fairly well-supplied market"", said Ben Westmore, commodities
economist at the National Australia Bank.	
 The agency could decide whether to repeat the release around
the third week of July, Richard Jones, deputy executive director
of the IEA, said late on Wednesday. 
 ""The market is still assessing the release of emergency
stocks by the IEA,"" Westmore said. ""The IEA has shown that it is
ready to step in to meet coverage.""	
 The energy watchdog shocked the oil markets last week when
it announced a plan to release 60 million barrels from emergency
stockpiles over an initial 30 days to fill the gap in supplies
left by the disruption to Libya's output. 
 
 
 U.S. STOCKS TIGHTEN	
 In the United States, oil stocks tightened as crude imports
fell while gasoline inventories fell unexpectedly.	
 U.S. crude stockpiles fell for a fourth straight week,
government data showed, dropping 4.4 million barrels, much more

product inventories above their five-year average ... now stands
only 1.3 million barrels above a 30-month low.""	
 Investors will also be watching the North Atlantic hurricane
season more closely than last year when inventories were still
high, Westmore said. 
 ""Any sort of disruption would have a bigger impact that a
year ago,"" he said.	
 Tropical storm Arlene, the first in the Atlantic hurricane
season, will probably not hit major offshore oil fields
directly, according to forecasts from the U.S. National
Hurricane Center (NHC).

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, June 30 (Reuters) - Gold held ground on Thursday
after rising for the past two days, as an initial favourable
vote on austerity measures by Greece's parliament weighed on the
dollar, but low speculative interest and physical demand may cap
gold's upside in the short term. 
 Greece's parliament passed the first of two austerity
measures on Wednesday despite escalating street violence. It is
expected to vote in favour of the final austerity bill later on
Thursday. 
 The dollar lost half a percent against a basket of
currencies, as the euro rallied after Greece moved a step closer
to securing international aid. 
 ""If Greece passes the bill, we may see gold test higher
tonight,"" said a Hong Kong-based trader, but added that the
upside could be limited at $1,520, around the 50-day moving
average.	
 Spot gold was little changed at $1,511.86 an ounce by
0555 GMT, after rising for two straight sessions. U.S. gold
 gained 0.1 percent to $1,512.50.	
 Spot gold was headed for a second monthly fall with a 1.4
percent decline, but still on course for 5.7-percent quarterly
rise. Gold has posted 11 consecutive quarterly gains.	
 Gold's safe haven appeal is likely to be retained in the
aftermath of Greece's debt crisis, but prices may be trapped in
a range in the short run due to lack of speculative interest.	
 ""We need to see if fund buying is coming back, which will
largely depend on whether there will be more stimulus plan in
the United States after the current round of quantitative easing
ends,"" said Ronald Leung, a physical dealer at Lee Cheong Gold
Dealers.	
 U.S. President Barack Obama called on Wednesday for new
steps to spur job growth and tax hikes on the rich, hardening a
stance that will likely complicate deficit reduction talks with
Republicans. 
 Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest
gold-backed exchange-traded fund, dipped to 1,208.233 tonnes.
Holdings dipped nearly 3 tonnes in the second quarter, posting a
loss for the fourth consecutive quarter.	
 Physical buying from earlier in the week has fizzled after
prices climbed above $1,500.	
 Spot silver gained 0.8 percent to $35.03, on course
for a 7 percent quarterly loss, its first in the red after nine
straight quarterly gains and its worst since the third quarter
of 2008.	
 Spot palladium led the precious metals complex with a
1.5-percent rise, but on course for its second straight month of
loss. Palladium remained the worst-performing precious metal
this year, down more than 5 percent so far.

barrel, by 0255 GMT after jumping more than 3 percent on
Wednesday.	
 U.S. August crude  was at $95.10 a barrel, up 33
cents, after gaining 2 percent. Both contracts reached their
highest close since June 22 and are headed for their second
straight monthly decline.	
 Brent's premium to U.S. light sweet crude stayed wide at
more than $17.  
 The International Energy Agency has sent a bearish signal to
the market by releasing emergency oil stocks in a ""fairly
well-supplied market"", said Ben Westmore, commodities economist
at the National Australia Bank.	
 ""The market is still assessing the release of emergency
stocks by the IEA,"" he said. ""The IEA has shown that it is ready
to step in to meet coverage.""	
 The energy watchdog shocked the oil markets last week when
it announced a plan to release 60 million barrels from emergency
stockpiles over an initial 30 days to fill the gap in supplies
left by the disruption to Libya's output. 
 The agency could decide whether to repeat the release around
the third week of July, Richard Jones, deputy executive director
of the IEA, said late on Wednesday. 
 
 U.S. STOCKS TIGHTEN	
 In the United States, oil stocks tightened as crude imports
fell while gasoline inventories fell unexpectedly.	
 U.S. crude stockpiles fell last week for a fourth week,
government data showed, dropping 4.4 million barrels, much more
than forecast, to 359.5 million barrels. Gasoline inventories
declined 1.4 million barrels to 213.2 million barrels, against
the forecast for a small increase. 
 Oil stocks are now 10.86 million barrels below the seasonal
peak in the five-year average on May 6, MF Global analysts said
in a note.	
 ""That compares to a decline of 6.84 million barrels in the
five-year average and reverses a point of fundamental weakness
which has been applied to oil prices in recent weeks,"" they
said.	
 Investors will also be watching the North Atlantic hurricane
season more closely than last year when inventories were still
high, Westmore said. 
 ""Any sort of disruption would have a bigger impact that a
year ago,"" he said.

 NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Wednesday after
the Greek parliament approved debt austerity measures, that
fueled investor appetite for commodities and other riskier
assets and boosted the euro against the dollar.
 Also underpinning gold was President Barack Obama's call
for new market stimulus including job creation measures, which
are likely to further complicate talks with Republicans on an
agreement to raise the U.S. debt ceiling.
 ""There is a lot of concern whether or not we can justify
the debt ceiling and also talking about a stimulus program at
the same time. That's going to continue to weaken the dollar
and that's why we have the rise in gold,"" said Bruce Dunn, vice
president of trading at bullion dealer Auramet.
 Bullion's second straight day of gains partially offset
weakness from risk aversion and technical selling. The metal is
still down 3 percent in the last five sessions, as fears that
debt-laden Greece may yet default dented gold's appeal as an
inflation hedge.
 Spot gold  was last up 0.5 percent at $1,508.49 an
ounce by 3:15 p.m. EDT (1915 GMT), countering losses seen
earlier in the week that took the price below $1,500.
 U.S. August gold futures  settled up $10.20 to
$1,510.40, after trading between $1,500.8 and $1,513.80.
 U.S. COMEX volume was below 100,000 lots for a second
straight day, preliminary Reuters data showed, and open
interest also fell to around 495,000 lots -- near a three-month
low as investors focused on the resurgent equity markets.
(Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/jyp42s)
 Silver  was up 2.5 percent at $34.72 an ounce.
 Gold was largely lifted as part of the risk-on
trade--buying equities and commodities in light of dollar
weakness. Crude oil rallied over 3 percent and Wall Street
extended gains for a third day, as Greek parliament favored a
five-year austerity plan, clearing a major hurdle in the
country's bid to avoid defaulting on its debt. [ID:nLDE75S16H]
 Gold, at times, rises in periods of greater investor
aversion, but the Greek debt crisis, and its impact on the
euro, have caused bullion to act less as a safe haven asset and
more like a commodity. The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB
index <.CRB> rose sharply for a second day.
 The euro rose 0.5 percent against the dollar, after
Greece's parliament approved deeply unpopular austerity
measures. [USD/]
 ""You do see gold and silver go up when you get that kind of

TEAM Asset Strategy Fund with $200 million of fund assets.

indicated investors have been buying gold, pushing up global

 UNCERTAINTY SUPPORTS
 Economic uncertainty should underpin gold prices in the
longer run, given low interest rates in the United States,
uncertainties in euro zone's fiscal situation, and worries over
talks to raise the U.S. debt ceiling, analysts said.
 Obama's call for new job-creation measures came on a day
when the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Treasury
Department urged Washington to reach a deal soon. His push for
new construction loans and an extension of a payroll tax cut
could further alienate Republicans already incensed by
Democratic demands for new tax revenue. [ID:nN1E75S0UN]

 By Amanda Cooper	
 LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - Gold rose for a second day on
Wednesday as confidence grew that Greece would avoid a sovereign
debt default by approving steep budget cuts, which boosted the
euro and other risk-related assets such as commodities and
higher-yielding currencies. 
 Gold often declines in periods of greater investor appetite,
but any flickers of optimism over a solution to the Greek debt
crisis have also resulted in a rise in the euro against the
dollar, which has cushioned the bullion price. 
 As voting got underway in Athens, the euro rose to
session highs against the dollar after a member of the
Greek opposition broke ranks with her party and said she would
support the austerity package, which in turn helped gold and
other commodities extend gains. 
 Spot gold was last up 0.5 percent at
$1,508. 51 an ounce by 1104
GMT, having risen by as much as 0.63 percent
to an intraday peak of $1,509.96, countering losses
seen earlier in the week that took the price below $1,500, while
COMEX gold  rose 0.6 percent to $1,509.20. 
 ""If you take a look at gold over the last few days we were
very surprised that the price couldn't profit from the higher
risk aversion among market participants and we would have
expected the gold price go higher, instead of falling below
$1,500,"" said Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann.	
 ""By now we think (the Greek vote) should be priced and the
gold price shouldn't react to a large extent if the austerity
package is really approved later in the day.""	
 Greece remains in focus, as its parliament is scheduled to
vote on an austerity package demanded by international lenders
as part of a massive bailout later on Wednesday. 
 The outcome of the vote is expected between
1100 GMT and 1400 GMT on Wednesday. 
 
 MARKETS WARY OF GREECE	
 Market activity has been thin as a result of combination of
sluggish seasonal demand and lack of market-moving factors on
the macroeconomic picture.	
 ""There are still reasons to buy gold, but just not any new
reason for now,"" said Yingxi Yu, an analyst at Barclays Capital.	
 ""Market participants are generally positive on gold, but it
is a question whether now is the right time to enter the market
given the volatility in risky assets such as equities and oil in
particular.""	
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index rose 1.7
percent on Tuesday, its biggest daily rise in nearly six weeks,
as investors bet that Greece will approve the austerity plan and
avoid defaulting its debt.	
 HSBC said in a note that the Greek debt crisis has prompted
some flight-to-quality flows, but these have been directed more
into other perceived safe-haven assets such as the Swiss franc
and U.S. Treasuries , rather than gold.	
 ""The gold market may not have dropped enough to invite
substantial emerging market and safe haven buying to emerge.
Longer term, we remain bullish. The strength of the CHF shows
there is still plenty of nervous safe haven buying that could
easily shift into gold,"" said HSBC analyst James Steel.	
 Judging by the inflows into exchange-traded funds backed by
physical metal, investors have been buying gold, pushing up
global ETF holdings of bullion by nearly half a million ounces
in the last two weeks, according to Reuters data. 
 So far this year, ETF holdings of gold are down by about 0.2
percent or 185,000 ounces, in contrast to last year, when the
burgeoning euro zone debt crisis fed strong demand for gold
ETFs.	
 Analysts said that in spite of the current uncertainty, the
longer-term outlook for gold prices remained positive, as low
interest rates in the United States, uncertainties in euro
zone's fiscal situation, and high inflation in major emerging
economies are likely to retain its appeal.	
 Platinum group metals rose for a second day, following
strength in global equities, which were lifted by optimism over
a positive outcome for the Greek austerity vote. 
 Concerns over power supply in South Africa, the world's top
producer of platinum, also helped support prices, which fell to
three-month lows earlier in the week.	
 The National Union of Mineworkers in South Africa on Tuesday
called its members for a strike at power firm Eskom, which
supplies 95 percent of the country's power.

 NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - Oil jumped as much as 3
percent on Wednesday, ending at the highest level in a week,
as sharp drawdowns in U.S. crude and gasoline stocks fed a
rally spawned when Greece passed an austerity plan to avoid a
sovereign debt default.
 Oil's surge mirrored movements across commodities and
equities markets, as the euro rose while the dollar weakened,
encouraging investors to put funds into riskier assets.
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> rose
1.3 percent, hitting a two-week high.
 U.S. crude inventories fell last week for a fourth week,
government data showed, dropping 4.4 million barrels, much more
than forecast, to 359.5 million barrels. Gasoline stockpiles
declined 1.4 million barrels to 213.2 million barrels, against
the forecast for a small increase. [EIA/S]
 ""The oil market has been wrong-footed by the crude
withdrawal, which is at least twice as big as people had
expected,"" said Addison Armstrong, market research senior
director at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""The stats are too big to ignore, so I would not be
surprised if prices rise again in the coming days,"" he added.
 ICE Brent crude for August  jumped $3.62, or 3.3
percent, settling at $112.40 a barrel, its highest close since

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, June 29 (Reuters) - Gold edged higher on
Wednesday, as investors are optimistic that Greece's parliament
will approve an austerity plan later in the day, likely to help
underpin sentiment in bullion and other commodities.	
 Light physical buying in Asia also helped support prices,
although the limited volume was seen as insufficient to push
gold out of its trading range, dealers said.	
 Greece remains in focus, as its parliament is scheduled to
vote on an austerity package demanded by international lenders
as part of a massive bailout later on Wednesday.

 ""There are still reasons to buy gold, but just not any new
reason for now,"" said Yingxi Yu, an analyst at Barclays Capital.	
 ""Market participants are generally positive on gold, but it
is a question whether now is the right time to enter the market
given the volatility in risky assets such as equities and oil in
particular.""	
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index rose 1.7
percent on Tuesday, its biggest daily rise in nearly six weeks,
as investors bet that Greece will approve the austerity plan and
avoid defaulting its debt.	
 Spot gold inched up 0.2 percent to $1,502.70 an ounce
by 0336 GMT, building on gains from the previous session. COMEX
gold  was also up 0.2 percent to $1,503.60.	
 Gold has been trading around $1,500 in the past few
sessions, with bargain hunters waiting to buy below that level,
while sluggish seasonal demand caps upside potential.	
 ""People are not keen to go short, but we don't see a rush to
buy gold either because it is the low season,"" said a
Singapore-based dealer.	
 In the long term, the outlook for gold prices remain intact,
as low interest rates in the United States, uncertainties in
euro zone's fiscal situation, and high inflation in major
emerging economies are likely to help gold retain its appeal.	
 Platinum group metals gained for the second session,
following strength in global equities, which were lifted by
optimism on the Greek vote outcome. 
 Concerns on power supply in South Africa, the world's top
producer of the metals, also supported market sentiment.	
 The National Union of Mineworkers in South Africa on Tuesday
called its members for a strike at power firm Eskom, which
supplies 95 percent of the country's power. 
 Spot platinum gained 0.9 percent to $1,704, up from a
three-month low of $1,661.24 hit earlier in the week.	
 Spot palladium rose 0.7 percent to $741.49.	
 Platinum and palladium have wide industrial applications,
and are key ingredients in autocatalysts.

 * Coming Up: EIA oil data, 10:30 a.m. EDT

 SINGAPORE, June 29 (Reuters) - Brent crude steadied on
Wednesday above $108 a barrel on growing optimism that the debt
crisis in Greece will be resolved and underpinned by a tropical
storm in the Gulf of Mexico.	
 U.S. crude held steady near $93 after industry data showed
tighter supply at the world's largest oil consumer.	
 News that tropical storm Arlene continued to head northwest
from the Bay of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico also underpinned
oil prices. 
 ICE Brent crude for August  fell 10 cents lower at
$108.68 a barrel by 0306 GMT. U.S. August crude  rose 8
cents to $92.89 a barrel. Both contracts rose more than 2
percent on Tuesday.	
 ""Investors are taking profits after big gains last night,""
Tetsu Emori, commodities fund manager at Astmax Investments in
Tokyo, adding that once Brent breaks a short-term resistance at
$110 a barrel, $115 should be easy to reach.	
 Brent's premium to U.S. light sweet crude 
narrowed to $15 a barrel after rising above $17 on Tuesday.	
 Growing market confidence that the Greek parliament will
approve the austerity programme, and that a French plan to
rollover Greek sovereign bonds will help avert a default, lifted
Asian stocks and the euro. 
 Greek lawmakers will vote Wednesday and Thursday on a
five-year package of spending cuts, tax increases and
privatisation in order to secure the next 12 billion euro slice
of aid in July.	
 ""Any positive compromise within Europe, with Greece willing
to make some sacrifices, will cause the euro and oil to rally,""
said Jeremy Friessen, a commodity strategist at Societe
Generale.	
 
 
 U.S. CRUDE STOCKS	
 Oil also gained support after industry data showed a
larger-than-expected drop in crude stocks and a surprise fall
gasoline inventories. 
 Investors are looking to government data due later on
Wednesday for confirmation that oil supply is tightening in the
United States. 
 Yet, concerns about the release of emergency stocks from
consumer countries, that caused oil to tumble 7 percent last
week, hovered.	
 ""There is still some heaviness in the market in relation to
the increase in supply from strategic reserves,"" Societe
Generale's Frissen said.	
 ""The increase in reserves is mostly coming from the United
States, which is the most oversupplied market in the world right
now.""	
 The country is expected to move away from global
fundamentals where supply is expected to tighten in the second
half of the year on strong demand, he said.

 NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - Gold edged higher on Tuesday,
rising past $1,500 an ounce and snapping three sessions of
declines, as hopes that Greece would pass unpopular austerity
measures boosted the euro and fueled investor risk appetite for
commodities.
 Gold has come under pressure from risk-averse selling and
technical weakness. Worries of economic slowdown and fears that
debt-laden Greece may default also dented gold's appeal as an
inflation hedge. Even after Tuesday's gain, the metal remained
down nearly 4 percent in the past four days.
 ""There are days on which gold benefits because the risk-on
trade comes back into vogue and it doesn't matter what
commodity you look at, they're all going up,"" said Natixis
commodities strategist Nic Brown.
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> was poised for its
biggest one-day gain in six weeks, with crude oil jumping
nearly 3 percent. Wall Street also rallied for a second day as
hopes of a solution to the Greek debt problem spurred investor
appetite for risky assets. [O/R] [.N]
 Spot gold  was up 0.2 percent at $1,499.40 an ounce
by 3:09 p.m. EDT (1909 GMT).
 U.S. gold futures for August delivery  settled up
$3.80 an ounce at $1,500.20, after trading between $1,495.50
and $1,507. Volume was less than 100,000 lots, about 55 percent
below the 30-day average. Gold volume has been thin lately as
investors have focused on equities markets.
 The euro rose 0.6 percent versus the dollar, recovering
from a decline in recent weeks on worries that Greece's debt
crisis could destabilize the euro zone. If these concerns are
allayed the euro could recover. This could help gold rise on
dollar weakness even though the precious metal would lose some
of its safe-haven bid as fears about Greece waned. [FRX/]
 ""If there is any slight marginal improvement in Europe, and
if the European Central Bank is going to be starting to raise
rates in September and December, you might have a currency
story that could be quite positive for gold,"" said Michael
Lewis, head of commodities research at Deutsche Bank.
 On charts, gold could meet resistance at $1,520 an ounce
near the convergence of its 55-day moving average and a
two-month rising trend line, CitiFX analysts said.
 ""A weekly close through $1,462 if it happens, would suggest
a danger of a further corrective move lower,"" according to the
Fibonacci retracement model, CitiFX said in a note.

 EYES ON GREECE
 Greece's parliament is set to vote on Wednesday and
Thursday on an austerity program required for Athens to receive
more aid from the European Union and International Monetary
Fund.
 Investors grew more hopeful that the Greece debt crisis
could be contained as heavily exposed French banks agreed to
roll over Greek debt. There was also talk that European Union
officials are working on a contingency plan in case Greece's
parliament rejects an austerity package. [ID:nL6E7HR2SK]
[ID:nLDE75P0BM]
 Also underpinning gold prices was news that up to one in
six European banks is set to fail an EU-wide financial health
check, according to euro zone sources close to the
stress-testing. [ID:nLDE75R120]
 But traders noted that physical buying of gold remained
soft during the seasonally weak summer months and as the U.S.
Federal Reserve's second round of market stimulus, the $600
billion bond-buying program comes to an end on June 30.
 Among other precious metals, silver  was up 0.7
percent at $33.76 an ounce, while platinum  rose 1.2
percent to $1,691.25 an ounce and palladium  was up 1.5

 By Jan Harvey	
 LONDON, June 28 (Reuters) - Gold rose back above $1,500 an
ounce in Europe on Tuesday, recovering in line with oil prices
as hopes that Greece's debt crisis may be contained tempered
risk aversion, and after the euro regained some ground.	
 Prices remain rangebound, however, as traders seek clarity
on the euro zone debt crisis and the subsequent direction of the
euro. Gold is closely linked to foreign exchange moves, as it is
often traded as a currency.	
 Spot gold was bid at $1,501.39 an ounce at 1108 GMT,
against $1,496.20 late in New York on Monday. U.S. gold futures
for August delivery  rose $5.90 an ounce to $1,502.30.	
 The euro has suffered in recent weeks from worries Greece's
debt crisis could destabilise the euro zone. If these concerns
are allayed the euro could recover, benefiting gold despite the
fact that it would lose some of its safe-haven bid. 
 ""Even with the events going on in Europe, the euro-dollar
has still been at $1.40-1.42 -- still quite an undervalued level
for the dollar, despite what is going on in Europe,"" said
Michael Lewis, head of commodities research at Deutsche Bank.	
 ""If there is any slight marginal improvement in Europe, and
if the European Central Bank is going to be starting to raise
rates in September and December, you might have a currency story
that could be quite positive for gold.""	
 Greece's parliament is set to vote on Wednesday and Thursday
on a new austerity programme required for Athens to receive more
aid from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.	
 An agreement by heavily exposed French banks to roll over
Greek debt and talk that European Union officials are working on
a contingency plan if Greece's parliament rejects an austerity
package lifted hopes its debt crisis may be contained.

 OIL RECOVERS	
 Oil rose on Tuesday as the agreement by France to roll over
holdings of mature Greek debt supported appetite for riskier
assets like commodities. 
 Gold's correlation with oil has been patchy in recent years,
turning negative in early 2009 as the credit crunch hit economic
growth while lifting risk aversion, and in early 2010 when the
euro zone debt crisis fuelled interest in gold as a haven.	
 Gold prices could see further short-term weakness, as
physical buying remains soft during the seasonally weak summer
months and as the U.S. Federal Reserve's $600 billion
bond-buying programme comes to an end on June 30.	
 But in the longer term low interest rates, prospects for
dollar weakness and better consumer appetite for gold at lower
prices are likely to support the precious metal.	
 ""This is typically a quiet time of year for physical buyers,
and the buying we've seen on this dip have not so far been of
the magnitude that would be required for a proper bounce,"" said
UBS in a note. ""Should prices fall far enough, however, the
physical market will react, summer notwithstanding.""	
 ""Indian buying has picked up since late on Friday, but a
move down to $1,485, where many orders are sitting, is likely
required to bring this market out in force. Chinese physical
interest has also been tweaked by recent price action.""	
 Among other precious metals, silver was at $33.93 an
ounce versus $33.54, platinum at $1,689.75 against
$1,671.55, and palladium at $735.50 against $724.98.	
 The white metals have come under significant pressure from
recent falls in industrial commodity, with platinum touching
3-1/2 month lows and palladium near six-week lows on Monday.

 * Dollar weakness helps lift crude prices
 * Eyes on impact of IEA stock release, OPEC reaction

 By Simon Falush	
 LONDON, June 28 - Oil rose on Tuesday as an agreement by
France to roll over holdings of mature Greek debt boosted
appetite for riskier assets like commodities and helped lift the
euro against the dollar. 
 President Nicolas Sarkozy said French banks had reached a
draft agreement with the authorities on a voluntary rollover of
maturing bonds.	
 This settled investor nerves as markets anxiously awaited
the outcome of a vote in Greece to approve unpopular fiscal
austerity measures. 
ICE Brent crude for August  was up 68 cents to $106.67
a barrel by 0942 GMT after hitting an intraday high of $107.50.
U.S. crude  added 35 cents to trader at $90.96.	
 Oil was also supported as the euro gained and the
dollar index fell as a weaker U.S. currency makes it more
attractive to holders of other currencies.	
 ""If there's a resolution to the situation in Greece, it will
boost the euro and that will support oil as there's such a
strong FX component,"" Harry Tchilingurian, oil analyst at BNP
Paribas said.	
Investors were still watching to see if Greece's parliament
will approve austerity steps that are a precondition for
international aid that the country needs to avoid a default. 
 
Prices were expected to remain volatile as some investors
were still worried about the result of the Greek vote, said Ken
Hasegawa, a commodity sales manager at Newedge Japan. 
""WTI (West Texas Intermediate, or U.S. crude futures) may be
supported around $90, but any upside will be limited because of
concerns about the economy in the euro zone,"" he said. 
 
 DEFAULT FEARED 
Without approval, the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund say they will not disburse the fifth trance of
Greece's 110 billion-euro bailout programme. Athens needs the
aid to pay its bills next month and avert the euro zone's first
sovereign default. 
 Investors are closely watching the impact of the release of
60 million barrels of oil from International Energy Agency
reserves.	
 South Korea will start to release 3.46 million barrels of
oil, including 2 million barrels of crude and 1.46 million
barrels of products by ""today at the earliest,"" a source at the
economy ministry said. 
Reactions from members of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries, many of whom oppose the release, are also
under scrutiny, analysts said.	
 BP's chief economist told Reuters Insider TV on Monday oil
consuming nations risk a long conflict with a trenchant OPEC by
challenging the producers' club on its own turf with a supply
response to high prices, and the strategy could backfire.

 Iran said on Tuesday there was no need for an OPEC emergency
meeting as the oil market is balanced, the Oil Ministry website
quoted Iran's OPEC governor Mohammad Ali Khatibi as saying.

 The market is also gearing up for crude inventories data in
the United States in industry data due late Tuesday. Analysts
are expecting stocks to shrink for the fourth week in a row.
 
Investors were also watching events in Libya, after the
International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant on Monday
for leader Muammar Gaddafi, and rebels trying to oust him said
their forces had advanced to within 80 km (50 miles) of the
capital.

 SINGAPORE, June 28 (Reuters) - Brent traded above $106 a
barrel on Tuesday, rising for a second straight session, after a
radical French proposal to roll over Greek debt strengthened the
euro and eased concerns of the debt crisis spreading across
Europe.	
 President Nicolas Sarkozy said that French banks had reached
a draft agreement with the authorities on a voluntary rollover
of maturing bonds, as markets anxiously awaited an outcome of a
vote in Greece to approve unpopular fiscal austerity measures.

 ICE Brent crude for August  gained 25 cents to
$106.24 a barrel by 0231 GMT after hitting an intraday high of
$106.84. U.S. crude  rose 36 cents to $90.97 barrel,
staying above the front-month 250-day moving average of $89.45.	
 ""The market is slightly optimistic thanks to comments from
the French President last night,"" said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity
sales manager at Newedge Japan.	
 A stronger euro makes dollar-denominated oil more
affordable.	
 Investors are still watching if Greece's parliament will
approve austerity steps that are a precondition for
international aid the country needs to avoid a default.	
 


 ""WTI may be supported around $90, but any upside will be
limited because of concerns about the economy in the euro zone,""
Hasegawa said.	
 This could keep Brent's premium to WTI  in a
range between $13 and $15 a barrel, he added. 
 
 EURO GAINS	
 The euro inched higher on Tuesday, but stalled just below
chart resistance, as investors awaited the Greek vote. 
 Without approval, the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund say they will not disburse the fifth trance of
Greece's 110 billion-euro bailout programme. Athens needs the
aid to pay its bills next month and avert the euro zone's first
sovereign default.	
 ""If they fail to get an agreement, oil prices will fall,""
Hasegawa said.	
 A surprise announcement by the International Energy Agency
to release oil from strategic reserves has likely been priced in
after Brent fell 7 percent last week, he added.	
 ""Fundamentally, I don't think that will have a big impact on
the market ... as the 60 million barrels of oil can be absorbed
easily,"" he said.	
 South Korea will start to release 3.46 million barrels of
oil, including 2 million barrels of crude and 1.46 million
barrels of products by ""today at the earliest,"" a source at the
economy ministry said. 
 A drop in prices may lift gasoline consumption in the United
States, Hasegawa said, easing concerns of demand destruction at
the world's largest oil user.	
 The market is also gearing up for a fall in crude
inventories in the United States in industry data due late
Tuesday. Analysts are expecting stocks to shrink for the fourth
week in a row.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, June 28 (Reuters) - Spot gold held steady on
Tuesday as investors watched moves in the currency market while
waiting for a vote by Greece's parliament later this week on an
unpopular austerity plan needed to avoid a sovereign debt
default.	
 Gold had traded in a narrow range of barely $6, as the euro
steadied and the dollar index weakened slightly as
Greece's parliament debates the austerity plan ahead of an
expected vote on Wednesday.  
 The euro had strengthened in early trade on Tuesday after a
radical French proposal to have French banks voluntarily
rollover Greek debt was put forward, but lost the gains as
worries over the outcome of Greek vote returned, showing how
quickly sentiment can change on the expected outcome for the
debt crisis. 
 ""Gold is facing more downside pressure in the short run, as
the dollar is still looking strong in the face of the euro zone
debt crisis,"" said Hou Xinqiang, an analyst at Jinrui Futures in
China.	
 Hou expected $1,470 to be a strong support level, which gold
hit in May during the commodity rout that knocked the precious
metal off its record high of $1,575.79.	
 Spot gold barely changed at $1,496.71 an ounce by
0611 GMT, off a five-week low of $1,490.30 in the previous
session. U.S. gold  was little changed at $1,497.70.	
 Over the long run, analysts said gold's prospects will
remain intact, as economic and fiscal uncertainties on both
sides of the Atlantic are expected to continue boosting the
appeal of the metal, seen as a safe haven during times of
financial distress.	
 In the latest sign of a weakening U.S economy, consumer
spending failed to rise in May, breaking 10 straight months of
gains. 
 Interest in gold-backed exchange-traded funds has stalled.
Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest gold
ETF, remained at 1,209.142 tonnes for the past six sessions --
the longest stretch of unchanged holdings since April, 2010.

 Spot silver edged up 0.2 percent to $33.59 an ounce,
rebounding from a near six-week low of $33.37 reached in the
previous session.	
 U.S. silver  also gained 0.2 percent to $33.65.	
 ""Technically silver is in a falling channel, looking to test
the key support level around $33,"" said a Tokyo-based trader,
adding that once that level is effectively breached silver could
fall further.	
 ""Some industrial users have been buying silver, but it is
not enough to push prices back up because investors are not
buying.""	
 Investment frenzy helped silver stage a stellar rally
earlier this year, before prices crashed more than 30 percent in
just six sessions from a record high at $49.51 hit on April 28.	
 Silver remained the best-performing precious metal, up 9
percent so far this year. Gold gained 5.4 percent, and palladium
was the worst performer with a 9-percent decline.

 By Zaida Espana	
 LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - Brent crude futures dipped again
in a volatile session on Monday ahead of a vote in Greece to
approve an unpopular austerity plan vital to securing a new
bailout. 
 Brent crude futures were 17 cents lower at $104.95 a barrel
by 1514 GMT, having plumbed earlier lows of $102.28. U.S. light
crude futures fell 56 cents to $90.60 a barrel, after touching
lows of $89.61 earlier.	
 Prices dipped again after a weaker dollar supported a brief
rally, with the focus firmly on Greece's fiscal woes.	
 A Greek minister warned of a ""catastrophe"" as the country's
parliament started the debate on Monday to discuss the 28
billion-euro austerity package ahead of the ballot Wednesday if
the measures are not approved. 
 Worries about a slowdown in China also resurfaced after
Premier Wen Jiabao signalled for the first time the country
would struggle to meet its 4 percent inflation target this year.

 Oil prices have lost around 10 percent over the last three
sessions since the International Energy Agency surprised the
market with a 60 million barrels release to rein in prices.	
 The IEA issued details of the breakdown of the stocks
release with the United States making available 30 million
barrels of crude; Japan and South Korea releasing 7.4 million
barrels of crude and 3.96 million barrels of refined oil
products and Europe releasing 4.2 million barrels of crude and
15 million barrels of products.

 
 IEA, OPEC SUPPLY	
 Brent crude prices fell after the IEA surprised the market
with a decision to release oil from strategic reserves for the
third time in history to replace Libyan supply. 
 
The IEA's decision to release 2 million barrels per day over
30 days is more than the daily loss of Libya's 1.2 million bpd
exports, and may help ease concerns that the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will struggle to meet
demand as consumption from emerging nations surges.	
 ""The near-term impact of the availability of these reserves
is bearish crude flat price and structure, with the light-sweet
grades getting hurt the most, Brent crude in particular,"" Morgan
Stanley analysts led by Hussein Allidina said in a note. 
 Analysts said the relations between OPEC and the IEA seem
progressively more tense, which could add volatility to prices.	
 ""The increasingly strained relationship between OPEC and the
IEA also represents major uncertainty to the oil market, which
could support a medium-term and long-term bullish outlook for
the oil market,"" James Zhang from Standard Bank said. 
Gulf oil exporters are unlikely to cut production in response
to the IEA's stock release because demand for their crude is
strong, two Gulf OPEC delegates said on Sunday. The group failed
to agree on raising output on June 8. 
 On Monday Iran meanwhile said it saw no need to supply the
oil market with extra crude, caretaker oil minister Mohammad
Aliabadi told reporters on Monday, adding he was concerned about
the principle of consumer nations' releasing strategic reserves.

""The market is under normal conditions. Supply and demand are
desirable. There is no additional need for supply in the
market,"" he told reporters before an OPEC meeting with European
Union officials for their annual exchange on energy issues.

 NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - Brent crude prices rose on
Monday, bouncing off lows as the euro rallied against the
dollar on firmer hopes Greece will pass an austerity program as
Europe fashioned a solution to Athens' debt woes.
 Worries about the sluggish global economy and slower growth
in China kept U.S. crude hemmed in negative territory, but both
contracts were lifted off lows as the euro rallied against the
dollar in a volatile session ahead of the Greek parliament's
key vote on austerity measures this week. [USD/]
 ""The market is very receptive to foreign exchange moves and
the euro's rally against the dollar and the dollar index
weakness helped bring crude off its lows,"" said Richard
Ilczyszyn, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in
Chicago.
 ICE Brent crude for August  rose 87 cents to settle
at $105.99 a barrel, having swung between an early $102.28 low
and the intraday peak of $106.40.
 U.S. August crude  fell 55 cents to settle at $90.61
barrel, above that key $90 handle after dropping to $89.61,
just above the front-month crude 250-day moving average of
$89.45.
 Brent trading volumes were above the 30-day average and
outpaced U.S. crude, though both contracts slumped from
Friday's volumes. U.S. volumes were below the 30-day average.
 Brent's premium to U.S. light sweet crude benchmark West
Texas Intermediate  narrowed to below $13 a barrel
intraday on Monday before bouncing back above $15.
 The spread was above $19 last Wednesday, the day before
consuming nations announced a release of oil reserves.

 ""We started the day worrying about Greece's debt problems
and impact on markets, but the news that French banks have an
outline agreement to roll over maturing Greek bonds helped lift
the euro and aided in stabilizing crude futures from early
lows,"" Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago
said.
 But Flynn and others said the concerns persist about slowed
growth and the global economic recovery.
 Fears of a slowdown in China resurfaced after Premier Wen
Jiabao signaled for the first time the country would struggle
to meet its 4 percent inflation target this year, raising the
specter of more measures to cool the economy. [ID:nL3E7HR064]

 Crude oil prices slumped last week after Thursday's
decision by the International Energy Agency to release 2
million barrels per day of oil reserves over 30 days to address
the loss of Libya's 1.2 million bpd of crude oil exports.
 The IEA issued details of the breakdown of the stocks
release. The United States is making available 30 million

a mix of crude and refined products stocks. [ID:nL6E7HR1O8]
 Analysts and traders see the reserves release helping ease
concerns that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting

emerging nations rises.
 OPEC continued to express its dismay at that IEA action.
 The IEA order to release reserves should be halted

 LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - Brent crude futures fell under
$104 a barrel on Monday as the dollar inched up ahead of a key
vote in Greece to approve an unpopular austerity plan. 
 By 0945 GMT, Brent crude futures traded down $1.15 to
$103.97 a barrel after plumbing earlier lows of $102.28 a
barrel. U.S. light crude futures fell 55 cents to $90.61 a
barrel, having touched lows of $89.82 a barrel earlier.	
 ""The price of Brent could fall further to around $100 a
barrel this week,"" UniCredit research analysts said in a note.
""We currently have a soft-patch scenario for the economy, but
risks have clearly increased.""	
 A parliamentary ballot on Greece's framework austerity
package is expected on Wednesday, with lawmakers due to vote on
Thursday on a bill containing specific steps to implement it.	
 Investors also took punts ahead of economic data from the
United States that is expected to show slowing growth, while
worries about a slowdown in China resurfaced after Premier Wen
Jiabao signalled for the first time the country would struggle
to meet its 4 percent inflation target this year.

 Oil prices have lost around 10 percent over the last three
sessions since the International Energy Agency surprised the
market with a 60 million barrels release to rein-in prices.

 
 IEA, OPEC SUPPLY 
Brent crude prices fell 2 percent on Friday, dropping 7
percent for the week. The contract's premium to U.S. crude
 fell below $13, down from a record of over $23 hit
on June 15, after the IEA surprised the market with a decision
to release oil from strategic reserves for the third time in
history to replace Libyan supply. 
The IEA's decision to release 2 million barrels per day over
30 days is more than the daily loss of Libya's 1.2 million bpd

Stanley analysts led by Hussein Allidina said in a note. 
 ""It also releases pressure on OPEC,"" said Jonathan Barratt,
managing director of Commodity Broking Services in Sydney. ""It's
more of a genuine consensus to lower import prices to avoid
economic slowdown."" 
Gulf oil exporters are unlikely to cut production in response
to the IEA's stock release because demand for their crude is
strong, two Gulf OPEC delegates said on Sunday. The group failed
to agree on raising output on June 8. 
Still, the impact of additional supply on oil markets is
likely to be limited unless Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi steps
down, allowing the country to resume production, Barratt said. 
""The only way for oil to get lower is Gaddafi,"" he said. ""The
market will trade into support and is expected to pick up, but
the context is weak."" 
The U.S. Institute for Supply Management is expected to
release on Friday data showing a slower rate of growth for
factory activity in June after it grew at its slowest pace in
May since September 2009. 
China, the world's second-largest oil consumer, recently
released a string of disappointing readings on factory activity
and exports. Premier Wen's comments on Monday underlined
expectations that interest rates will rise further even as
economic growth slows down.

 SINGAPORE, June 27 (Reuters) - Brent slipped below $103 on
Monday, sliding 10 percent in the three sessions since the
emergency oil stocks release by consumer countries, as
the U.S. dollar gained ahead of a vote by Greece to clear
unpopular fiscal austerity measures.	
 The market is positioning itself ahead of economic data from
the United States that is expected to show slowing growth.
Investors are also concerned about China's economy slowing down
more sharply than expected after Premier Wen Jiabao signalled
for the first time the country would struggle to meet its 4
percent inflation target this year.	
 ICE Brent crude for August dropped $2.43 to $102.69
a barrel by 0719 GMT, after hitting an intraday low of $102.28.
U.S. crude  fell $1.21 to $89.95 a barrel.	
 ""You've got oversupply caused by the Saudis pushing more
crude into the market and, on top of that, the SPR release,""
said Tony Nunan, a risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp. ""It's hard
for crude to go up as an asset play.""	
 Investors' anxiety ahead of a Greek vote on austerity
measures this week pushed the U.S. dollar higher for a fourth
consecutive session. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the
greenback's value against a basket of major currencies, was up
0.13 percent by 0719 GMT to 75.76 , having risen 4 percent
since May. 
 Athens will vote on Wednesday the framework austerity
package on tax increases and spending cuts, and then on its
implementation on Thursday. It is critical for the country to
pass the package to secure funding from international lenders to
avert a sovereign default.

managing director of Commodity Broking Services in Sydney. ""It's
more of a genuine consensus to lower import prices to avoid
economic slowdown.""	
 Gulf oil exporters are unlikely to cut production in
response to the International Energy Agency (IEA) releasing
emergency stocks because demand for their crude is strong, two
Gulf OPEC delegates said on Sunday. The group failed to agree on
raising output on June 8. 
 Still, the impact of additional supply on oil markets is
likely to be limited unless Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi steps
down, allowing the country to resume production, he said.	
 ""The only way for oil to get lower is Gaddafi,"" Barratt
said. ""The market will trade into support and is expected to
pick up, but the context is weak.""	
 The U.S. Institute for Supply Management is expected to
release on Friday data showing a slower rate of growth for
factory activity in June after it grew at its slowest pace in
May since September 2009. 
 China, the world's second-largest oil consumer, recently
released a string of disappointing readings on factory activity
and exports. Premier Wen's comments on Monday underlined
expectations that interest rates will rise further even as
economic growth slows down.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, June 27 (Reuters) - Gold prices held steady on
Monday, aided by active buying on the physical market in Asia,
while a stronger dollar weighed and investors awaited a Greek
parliament vote this week that is crucial to securing a
sovereign debt bailout.	
 Greece's parliament begins on Monday to debate a deeply
unpopular austerity plan which international lenders are
demanding to see approved this week to avert the threat of
bankruptcy. 
 A parliament vote is expected on Wednesday, which will be
closely watched by participants in the global financial markets.	
 ""If Greece's parliament passes the austerity measures, it
could be positive for risk assets such as commodities,"" said Ong
Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures, noting that gold could
be a beneficiary as it has closely correlated with moves in
other commodities recently.	
 Although gold is seen as a safe-haven during times of
economic stress, the increasingly grave debt crisis in the euro
zone has done little to buoy appetite in gold recently. A
weakening euro and stronger dollar have weighed on gold instead.	
 Spot gold was nearly flat at $1,498.45 an ounce by
0627 GMT, after falling 3 percent in the past two sessions,
during which the 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index
declined more than 2 percent.	
 U.S. gold  was little changed at $1,499.70.	
 The dollar rose to its highest since June 16 against
a basket of currencies, as the euro stayed under pressure ahead
of the Greek parliament vote. 
 Gold is likely to weaken in the short term due to weak
technical indicators and sluggish seasonal demand, but over the
long run the outlook remains bright, analysts said.	
 ""Towards the six-month horizon, prices should keep the
uptrend we have seen since 2008,"" said Dominic Schnider, an
analyst of UBS Wealth Management, adding that prices could
target $1,600 in the second half of the year.	
 ""Real interest remains in negative territory -- I think this
remains quite supportive. And if you look at emerging markets,
inflation remains stubbornly high.""	
 Gold hit a record of $1,575.79 on May 2.	
 
 STRONG PHYSICAL BUYING IN ASIA	
 Asian buyers are snatching up bullion after prices fell to a
five-week low of $1,491.90, pushing up premiums in Singapore and
Hong Kong, dealers said.	
 ""Prices have fallen $50 in the past few days and some people
think it is an opportunity to buy, although we don't know
whether prices have bottomed out,"" said a Hong Kong-based
dealer, adding that premiums in Hong Kong increased 20 cents to
between $1 and $1.50 per ounce over spot prices.	
 In Singapore, premiums have also gone up 20 cents to between
80 cents and $1, dealers said.	
 Spot silver dropped to $33.52, its lowest in more
than a month, before recovering slightly to $33.67.	
 U.S. silver  fell 2.7 percent to $33.70.	
 Platinum group metals, used widely in industrial
applications, fell in tandem with base metals. 
 Spot platinum fell to $1,662.24, its lowest since
mid-March after a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit Japan.
It recovered slightly to $1,669.74, down 0.2 percent.	
 The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, on spot platinum dipped
below 30 for the first time since May 2010, suggesting the metal
had been oversold.	
 Spot palladium declined to a one-month low of
$720.88, before recovering slightly to trade at $721.28 -- down
0.8 percent.

 By Florence Tan	
 SINGAPORE, June 27 (Reuters) - Brent slipped under $105 on
Monday, extending the previous week's losses, as the U.S. dollar
gained ahead of a vote by Greece to clear unpopular fiscal
austerity measures.	
 The market is positioning itself ahead of economic data from
the United States that is expected to show slowing growth.
Prices are also under pressure on expectations Gulf exporters
would keep crude supplies steady despite a surprise release of
emergency stocks. 
 ICE Brent crude for August fell 73 cents
to $104.39 a barrel by 0236 GMT, after the contract posted two
straight weeks of losses. U.S. crude  declined 55 cents to
$90.61 a barrel, after slipping as low as $90.40.	
 ""The market is trying to pre-empt Greece and worries in the
West,"" Jonathan Barratt, managing director of Commodity Broking
Services in Sydney. 
 Athens will vote on Wednesday the framework austerity
package on tax increases and spending cuts, and then on its
implementation on Thursday. It is critical for the country to
pass the package to secure funding from international lenders to
avert a sovereign default. 
 The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback's value
against a basket of major currencies, was trading above a
downward trendline that began a year ago. It was up 0.23 percent
by 0236 GMT to 75.843 , having risen 4 percent since May.	
 
 
 
 Brent crude prices fell 2 percent on Friday, dropping 7
percent for the week. The contract's premium to U.S. crude
 was at $13.79, down from a record of over $23 hit on
June 15, after the International Energy Agency (IEA)
surprised the market with a decision to release 6 million
barrels of oil from strategic reserves for the third time in
history to replace Libyan supply. 
 
 OPEC SUPPLY	
 The IEA's decision to release 2 million barrels per day over
30 days is more than the daily loss of Libya's 1.2 million bpd
exports, and may help ease concerns that the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will struggle to meet
demand as consumption from emerging nations surges.	
 ""It also releases pressure on OPEC,"" Barratt said. ""It's
more of a genuine consensus to lower import prices to avoid
economic slowdown.""

 NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - Gold slumped for a second day
on Friday to conclude its worst week in eight, crashing through
key technical supports, as investors shed riskier assets and
bought the dollar on heightened concerns over Greek debt.
 With less than a week until the end of the Federal
Reserve's second quantitative easing program, bullion's three
percent fall over the past two days has raised questions about
whether its years-long boom has stalled. After reaching a high
of $1,575.79 on May 2, gold has struggled.
 Spot prices ended the week below their 50-day moving
average for the first time since February, they ruptured a
trendline support stemming back to a January low, and they
broke out of a six-week sideways pattern to the downside.
 All of those technical chart patterns were seen as warning
signs by many investors.
 ""Once the 50-day average is broken on a weekly basis, it a
first sign of weakness and that the trend may be changing,""
said Adam Sarhan at Sarhan Capital.
 Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/ruz32s
 Spot gold  was down 1.3 percent at $1,501.40 an ounce
by 3:02 p.m. EDT (1902 GMT), having earlier fallen to a month
low at $1,498.16. It was down about 2.5 percent for the week.
 U.S. August gold futures  settled down $19.60, a 1.30
percent drop, at $1,500.90. It set a $1,498.50 and $1,526.50
range. Volume above 170,000 lots was about 20 percent below its
30-day average, but up from weak volume in recent sessions.
 The dollar gained almost 1 percent for the week versus the
euro on worries that Greece's parliament will not approve a
package of austerity measures next week. The U.S. currency also
strengthened after the Federal Reserve, earlier this week,
offered no hope for additional monetary support.
 ""Gold's decline has to do with the strength of the dollar,
and since the equity market is resuming its decline, that's
what's working counter to gold prices at the moment,"" said Mark
Luschini, chief investment strategist at broker-dealer Janney
Montgomery Scott, which manages $54 billion in assets.
 Silver  was down 2 percent at $34.55 an ounce,
lifting the gold/silver ratio -- the number of ounces of silver
needed to buy one ounce of gold -- to near a one-month high at
43.5. The ratio's increase highlights gold's outperformance
relative to silver.
 TECHNICAL WEAKNESS
 Rick Bensignor, chief market strategist at Dahlman Rose,
said, gold's pullback could have more room to the downside,
with next major support in area of May's lows between $1,488
and $1,471 a tonne.
 ""The dollar could rally up to its 200-day moving average,
and that will not help gold advance right now,"" he said.
 Worries about Greece defaulting on its massive debt, a
development that would roil markets if the country's parliament
does not approve austerity measures and concerns over some
Italian banks dragged global stock markets sharply lower for a
second day. [USD/] [.N]
 ""You have prices of crude oil, commodities and the stock
market again under pressure. And, you have a strong dollar. To
think that gold is going to rally, it's just not going to
happen,"" said independent investor Dennis Gartman.
 ""Every market that has the term 'risk' associated with it,
everybody wants out,"" he said.
 With the second round of Fed quantitative easing (QE2)
ending in June, some investors question whether risk assets
could rise further. Gold has thrived on the expectation of an
extended period of low U.S. interest rates, and that placed
non-yielding bullion in a better position to compete for
investor cash against stocks or bonds.
 Among platinum group metals, platinum  was last down
0.8 percent at $1,680.24 an ounce, while palladium  was
down 1.8 percent at $729.25.

 LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) -
Gold steadied on Friday after a fall of as much as 2 percent the
day before, drawing support from investor wariness of Greece's
ability to remain solvent, even after Athens struck a deal with
international lenders on the terms of a bailout.	
 Gold was still set for its largest weekly decline since the
so-called commodities ""flash crash"" of early May, which saw the
raw materials complex stage its biggest weekly fall on record.	
 The euro rallied overnight after Greece agreed with the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund on an
austerity plan that would bring it one step closer to securing
much-needed financial aid. USD/ 
 But this was not enough to convince markets that Athens
could avoid defaulting on its debt, which forced up the cost of
insuring its bonds against such an event. 
 Spot gold was last quoted at $1,521.00 an ounce at
0928 GMT, up 0.1 percent on the day, on course for a 1.2 percent
fall this week. But while gold looked vulnerable according to
the charts, analysts said the high level of uncertainty would
stem any steeper sell-offs.	
 ""Technically, it doesn't look ideal, but even if we breach
$1510, at $1,480. we'll stop. I can't see people liquidating
gold right now with everything that is happening,"" said VTB
Capital analyst Andrey Kryuchenkov.	
 ""You have Greece and there was nothing to indicate from the
Fed that they're turning hawkish just yet,"" he said.	
 Gold has thrived on the expectation of an extended period of
low U.S. interest rates, which depress the dollar against other
currencies and place bullion, which bears no yield of its own,
in a better position to compete for investor cash against stocks
or bonds.	
 The Federal Reserve earlier this week cut its growth
forecasts for U.S. growth, but did not signal there would be any
additional policy measures, such as quantitative easing, to
support the economy.	
 ""We still are in very uncertain times and it's likely to
continue until we see greater signs of economic growth globally,
particularly in the United States, and we start to see the
European debt situation ease,"" said Darren Heathcote, head of
trading at Investec Australia. 
 ""While those problems remain we are likely to see gold well
supported. Investors flee to gold in times of trouble as they
have done consistently for a very long time."" 
 Reflecting the push earlier this week into gold rather than
into increasingly volatile currencies was the rise in
Australian-dollar denominated gold to its highest in
nearly a year and the rise in sterling-gold to record
highs as investors punished the pound.	
 Global holdings of gold in exchange-traded funds are set for
a 20,8120-oz rise this week, having risen by 254,000 oz so far
this month, as investors have favoured safe-haven assets rather
than more industrially-linked products.	
 This compares with net outflows of 8.891 million ounces of
metal from silver ETFs and declines of 36,000 oz in palladium
ETFs. 
 Silver was down around 0.4 percent on the day at
$35.11 an ounce, while the gold/silver ratio -- the number of
ounces of silver needed to buy one ounce of gold -- is close to
its highest in a month, highlighting gold's outperformance
relative to silver.	
 News that industrialised nations would release oil from
emergency stockpiles for the third time in history in a bid to
tame high energy prices that have been weighing on the global
economy could cap gold's gains, but should boost prices of
industrial metals. 
 The news sent oil prices tumbling to four-month lows on
Thursday but prices have regained some footing on Friday as
traders assessed how much supply would reach the market. 
 Bullion investors are also paying close attention to
discussions over the U.S. debt limit after budget talks
collapsed on Thursday when Republican negotiators walked out,
casting doubt on Washington's ability to reach a deal that would
allow the government to keep borrowing and avoid a debt default.
[ID:nN1E75M0MQ} 
 Also on the radar is the final estimate for U.S.
first-quarter GDP data, due later on Friday, along with monthly
durable goods orders, following a recent spate of weak economic
numbers. 
 Platinum was last up 0.5 percent at $1,702.99 an
ounce, having fallen on Wednesday to three-month lows, while
palladium was up 0.2 percent at $742.35.

 NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - Brent crude prices fell 2
percent on Friday as Europe's debt problems and a dollar index
rebound extended oil's decline a day after consuming nations
announced they were tapping strategic reserves.
 Dropping 7 percent for the week, Brent's premium to U.S.
crude  fell below $14 a barrel intraday, from above
$19 on Wednesday, the day before the International Energy
Agency made a surprise announcement to release oil from
strategic reserves. The premium has contracted from its record
$23.34 reached on June 15.
 U.S. crude ended slightly higher on Friday, after seesawing
and briefly dipping below $90 a barrel, finding support above
Thursday's low trade.
 The euro fell versus the dollar as investors worried that
Greece's parliament may not pass austerity measures needed for
the country to secure more bailout funds.
 ""The strengthening of the dollar index is helping pressure
oil and we're seeing an unwinding of the Brent-WTI spread
because of the release of the strategic reserves,"" said Phil
Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago.
 ""The Brent-WTI spread coming in indicates that the release
was justified,"" he added.

$105.12 a barrel, after swinging between $103.62 and $108.70

 Brent trading volumes were heavy, eclipsing U.S. crude for

 The International Energy Agency (IEA) announced on Thursday
a release of 60 million barrels of government-held stocks over
the next 30 days.
 Leading commodities banks JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs cut
their oil price forecasts following the IEA announcement, but
Bank of America Merrill Lynch kept its forecast for the second
half unchanged at $102 a barrel. [ID:nL3E7HO01S]
 Saudi Arabia, the world's leading crude oil exporter, has
yet to make any comment on the release.
 The IEA move came after the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries last month could not reach agreement on a
boost to production targets. But Saudi Arabia had pledged to
increase output to meet demand.
 ""Saudi Arabia will be crucial -- will it stick to its
promise to increase its output to 10 million barrels a day or
not?"" said Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt.
 ""If they don't, then the IEA decision will have backfired.
Maybe they will scale back production in July after this stock
release.""
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Friday
that the IEA's decision was ""sensible policy.""
 ""It will provide some modest help and relief"" to the U.S.
economy, Geithner told reporters after meeting local business
leaders in Manchester, New Hampshire. ""It was a prudent use of
existing reserves.""
 Better-than-expected U.S. durable goods data provided
support to U.S. crude futures in the early going on Friday.
 New orders for U.S. manufactured goods in May increased 1.9
percent after dropping 2.7 percent in April, the Commerce
Department said. [ID:nN1E75N087]
 But concerns about euro zone debt problems continued to
weigh on markets. U.S. stocks headed for three days of losses
as worries about the Italian banking sector added to the
uncertainty over the passage of a Greek austerity plan. [.N]

 By Pratima Desai
 LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose on Tuesday as
investors spooked by talk of a Greek debt default and contagion
to other euro zone countries sought safety while a softer dollar
also helped.
 Spot gold  was bid at $1,544.10 a troy ounce at 1126
GMT compared with $1,539.95 late in New York on Monday when it
touched $1,545.90, its highest since June 9.
 Investors are watching Greece where Prime Minister George
Papandreou's cabinet faces a confidence vote later on Tuesday,
the first of three tests the government must survive to avert
the euro zone's first sovereign debt default. [ID:nL3E7HL0BG]
 ""Gold is inextricably linked to the events in Greece, both
gold and silver are hostage to contagion fears,"" said RBS
analyst Nick Moore. ""The elevation of gold can be firmly nailed
on safe-haven buying.""
 The vote in Greece follows a euro zone ultimatum that the
debt-choked Mediterranean state must approve a new five-year
package of painful economic reforms in two weeks or miss out on
a 12-billion-euro aid tranche that it needs to avoid bankruptcy.
 IMF and European inspectors are also in Athens to discuss
changes requested by Greece to the reform package.
 ""The default chorus is getting louder, people are wondering
where this is going to end, perhaps Greece will leave the euro,""
a precious metal trader said. ""I wouldn't be surprised to see
gold heading towards record highs.""
 Gold hit a record high of $1,575.79 an ounce on May 2.
 
 RIPPLE EFFECTS
 Greece's problems have in recent weeks damaged euro
sentiment and boosted the U.S. currency. 
 However on Tuesday, optimism in currency markets of a
positive outcome to Greece's problems helped the euro and
weighed on the dollar, which when it falls makes gold cheaper
for holders of other currencies. [USD/]
 Investors are afraid of what could happen if the situation
in Greece were allowed to continue. They are worried about the
ripple effects to countries such as Italy, Ireland and Spain.
 ""Uncertainty still haunts market participants with small
scale safe haven buying pushing bullion prices back up,"" said
Andrey Kryuchenkov, analyst at VTB Capital.
 ""Eurozone's debt woes are fuelled by Greece's failure to
adopt fresh austerity measures while it makes the situation
worse for other peripheral states with the cost of sovereign
funding on the rise.""
Yields on Greek and other lower-rated euro zone bonds such
as those issued by Italy rose after ministers delayed granting
emergency loans to Greece. [GVD/EUR]
 Silver  touched $36.21 an ounce, its highest since
June 13, and was last at $36.18 from $36.00 on Monday. Platinum
 was bid at $1,741.00 from $1,726.95 and palladium 
was at $751.00 from $743.65.
 Concerns about demand from car manufacturers to use in
autocatalysts have hit prices of platinum and palladium in
recent days, traders said.

 LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Tuesday from a dive
to a four-month low in the previous session as the euro gained
against the dollar ahead of a confidence vote in Greece aimed at
avoiding a messy default of its sovereign debt.
 U.S. crude for July delivery  rose $1.10 to $94.36 a
barrel by 1156 GMT. On Monday, it hit $91.14, its lowest level
since late February. The contract expires later on Tuesday.
 ICE Brent  rose 81 cents to $112.50, having fallen in
the previous four sessions.
 ""The market has been supported today by the euro,"" said Mark
Thomas, broker Marex's head of energy Europe.
 Global investors kept a close eye on a parliamentary
confidence vote for Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, a
step towards the passage of more spending cuts in exchange for
foreign loans.
 If the confidence vote is passed, the Greek parliament will
vote on the austerity measures by June 28. Euro zone finance
ministers gave debt-crippled Greece two weeks from Monday to
approve further spending cuts and tax rises in return for
another 12 billion euros in emergency loans. [ID:nLDE75I0FM]

shares also rose ahead of the confidence vote. [.EU] [FRX/]

 U.S. OIL INVENTORIES
 The next fundamental indicator will come from the United
States, when industry group the American Petroleum Institute
releases its weekly report on stocks later in the day.
 U.S. crude oil inventories probably fell in the week to June
17 amid lower imports and a rise in refinery utilization rates,
a preliminary Reuters poll ahead of the report showed. Crude
stocks were forecast down 500,000 barrels. [EIA/S]
 The International Energy Agency (IEA) watchdog reiterated
high oil prices could derail global economic recovery.
 ""High oil prices are a significant risk to derailing the
economic recovery not only in the OECD countries, but also in
China and India,"" IEA's chief economist, Fatih Birol, said on
Tuesday.
 ""China and India are the two most important economies which
helped us get out of the economic crisis. If they go for
tightening of monetary policies, this may lead to a slowdown in
their economies which is bad news for all of us.""

 By Manash Goswami	
 SINGAPORE, June 21 (Reuters) - Oil rebounded on Tuesday as
losses in the previous session provided a buying opportunity
ahead of a key meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve this week,
while a weak dollar also supported the recovery.	
 Brent  rose 10 cents to $111.79 a barrel by 0600 GMT,
after having fallen as much as 58 cents to $111.11 a barrel
earlier in the day. U.S. oil  gained 78 cents to $94.04 a
barrel, after rising to as much as $94.12.	
 The market may stay range bound ahead of a U.S. Federal Open
Market Committee meeting, as participants watch for comments by
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on the outlook for growth
just as the second phase of quantitative easing measures in the
world's biggest economy is supposed to wind down. 
 ""This movement in oil prices has nothing to do with
fundamentals,"" said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity derivatives
manager at Japan's Newedge brokerage. ""It is being driven by the
euro/dollar. Oil is rising with the euro.""	
 The euro clung to small gains as market players bet the euro
zone will cobble together a plan to prevent Greece from
defaulting on its debt, though its advance could stall ahead of
a confidence vote on the government in the Greek parliament.

 Brent fell earlier in the day, narrowing its premium to U.S.
oil. The sell-off in a key spread between Brent and U.S.
futures, which weighed on prices on Monday as well, is because
premiums of the North Sea benchmark had gone far too high,
analysts said. Brent also fell due to growing uncertainty over
demand in Europe as a result of Greece's debt crisis.	
 
 
 
 ""The premium for Brent had just gone too high,"" said
Hasegawa said. ""That is why we are seeing the correction. Also,
the market is very cautious because of the Greek debt issue.""	
 Euro zone finance ministers gave Greece two weeks from
Monday to approve further spending cuts and tax increases in
exchange for another 12 billion euros in emergency loans, piling
pressure on Athens to get its ragged finances in order.

 
 THREATENS RECOVERY	
 On the other hand, investors saw an opportunity to snap up
U.S. crude futures after they slumped to a four-month low last
week. Additional support came from buying ahead of the expiry of
the July contract on Tuesday.	
 ""The fall was to a good enough level to prompt buying on the
dips,"" said Tetsu Emori, a fund manager at Tokyo-based Astmax Co
Ltd. ""Fundamentally, there is no change. People are going to
wait and see what the Fed's view is on the economic situation.""	
 Rising prices are a major risk for the global economic
recovery as they put upward pressure on inflation, the
International Energy Agency's chief economist, Fatih Birol, said
on Tuesday.	
 ""High oil prices are a significant risk to derailing the
economic recovery not only in the OECD countries, but also in
China and India,"" Birol told Reuters. 
 ""China and India are two most important economies which
helped us get out of the economic crisis. If they go for
tightening of monetary policies, this may lead to a slowdown in
their economies which is bad news for all of us."" 
 Oil fell on Monday, pressured by uncertainty over the
approval of austerity measures for Greece, apart from the
sell-off of a key spread between the two benchmarks. 
 Brent settled down $1.52 at $111.69 barrel, while U.S. crude
oil futures settled up 25 cents at $93.26 a barrel after testing
the 200-day moving average.	
 U.S. oil is expected to stay between $90 and $100 a barrel
at least until there is more clarity on growth in the United
States and gasoline consumption, Emori at Astmax said.	
 Industry group, the American Petroleum Institute, will
release its weekly report on stocks later in the day. U.S. crude
oil inventories fell last week amid lower imports and a rise in
refinery utilization rates, a preliminary Reuters poll ahead of
the report showed. Crude stocks were forecast down 500,000
barrels, on average, in the week to June 17.

 SINGAPORE, June 21 (Reuters) - Gold edged up on Tuesday and
held near its highest in two weeks, with no quick end in sight
to economic turmoil in Europe after Greece was told to approve a
new austerity package to avoid defaulting on its debt. 
 But slow trade suggested investors were also cautious ahead
of a Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week after
ratings agency Fitch said it would place the U.S. credit rating
on negative watch if its debt ceiling was not raised by Aug. 2. 
 Spot gold added $2.81 to $1,542.76 an ounce by 0615
GMT after rising as high as $1,545.90 an ounce on Monday, its
strongest since June 9. Gold is still below a lifetime high
around $1,575 touched in early May. 
 ""We're still not seeing that huge flight-to-safety that is
really needed for the sovereign debt crisis to actually propel
gold higher,"" said a dealer in Singapore.	
 ""While investors are cautious, it's not exactly a repeat of
what we saw in 2010. For the euro zone debt situation to really
drive gold to the record high, it has to get a lot worse."" 
 Financial markets are waiting for a confidence vote on the
government in the Greek parliament later in the day, a step
towards the passage of more spending cuts in exchange for
foreign loans. 
 A Reuters poll showed euro zone money markets would be
severely affected by Greece defaulting on its debt, drying up
money supply lines that the European Central Bank has tried to
keep flowing. 
 ""We favour buying breaks in gold near $1,520 an ounce while
trading other metals as neutral affairs this week,"" said Tom
Pawlicki, precious metals and energy analyst at MF Global.	
 ""Gold will be supported by uncertainty with European
sovereign debt, the probability the FOMC leaves accommodative
policy in place, from a potential return of investment, and from
the possibility that the short-term correction in commodities is
nearing its end.""	
 Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday it would regard a voluntary
rollover of Greece's sovereign bond maturities as a default and
would cut the credit rating appropriately, keeping pressure on
Athens ahead of a confidence vote in parliament.



 Silver was steady at $36.06 an ounce, below a record
at $49.51 an ounce hit in April. Platinum and palladium
bounced from Monday's lows. 
 The dollar index eased as the euro edged up after
Klaus Regling, chief of the European Financial Stability
Facility, said the bailout fund's guarantees will be raised to
780 billion euro from the 440 billion that has just been rubber
stamped by ministers. 
 The euro could also get support from the Fed's two-day
policy meeting that begins on Tuesday, in which the central bank
may restate its commitment to hold interest rates near zero for
an extended period on signs the U.S. recovery has lost momentum.

 The physical market was subdued on Tuesday as prices gyrated
but jewellers in Indonesia started making inquiries ahead of the
fasting month of Ramadan. 
 Tokyo stocks posted their biggest daily gain in more than
three weeks on Tuesday, but investors said the move was
exaggerated by thin volumes as most players remained cautious
ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting.

 By Antonita Devotta
 NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - Oil fell on Monday, pressured
by uncertainty over the approval of austerity measures for
Greece and the sell-off of a key spread between Brent and U.S.
crude oil futures.
 The premium of Brent crude to West Texas Intermediate
narrowed to below $18 a barrel in late trade, after blowing out
to a record over $23 last week, as U.S. crude futures settled
slightly higher after hitting a four-month low on Friday.
 ""Last week's crack spread and Brent-WTI relationships
became a bit stretched and today's action appeared to represent
a significant amount of profit-taking out of some of the
inter-commodity spreads,"" said Jim Ritterbusch, president of
Ritterbusch & Associates.
 ""The primary feature in today's trade was some selling
rotation away from WTI and into the products and Brent market.""
 Brent  was weighed down early from concerns about
the Greek economic crisis and settled down $1.52 at $111.69
barrel.
 U.S. oil crude futures  settled up 25 cents at $93.26
a barrel after testing the 200-day moving average. Additional
support came from buying ahead of the expiry of the July
contract on Tuesday.
 Trading volumes were thin, with Brent trade 20 percent
below the 30-day average. U.S. crude trade was focused on the
second month, August, with total volumes 37 percent below the
30-day average.
 SPREAD PLAY
 U.S. crude began shedding losses in early U.S. activity,
pushing firmly higher in afternoon trade, with players saying
the recent wide discount Brent crude may have been overdone.
 Rising supplies of Canadian crude to the U.S. Midwest,
including the NYMEX delivery point at Cushing, Oklahoma, have
sent the transatlantic arbitrage to record levels this year.
 Concerns about the start-up of key planned pipelines, which
would help alleviate that glut by shipping crude to the Gulf
Coast, have exacerbated the spread.
 In addition, Brent has found support from supply
disruptions in the North Sea in recent weeks. Traders now say,
however, that promises of more oil from Saudi Arabia to help
cool down prices may be helping to weaken Brent's premium to
WTI.
 ""The spreads are going to fall apart, it's just a matter of
when,"" said Richard Ilczyszyn, senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldock.
 Further out on the futures curve, however, the spread
remains strong, with December 2012 pushing out by more than $4
in June to over $11 a barrel, indicating traders believe the
glut will not ease before then.
 ""We expect the WTI's physical delivery point, Cushing, to
remain oversupplied until at least late 2012,"" said analyst
Michael Wittner at Societe Generale.
 Wittner said he expects high supply to Cushing from North
Dakota and from Canadian oil sands to result in high stocks at
Cushing as a pipeline from there to the coast is unlikely to be
ready until end-2012 at the earliest.
 ""Extra supply to Cushing cannot easily be transported to
areas with strong demand. Therefore, the front end of the WTI
forward curve should remain in moderate contango until late
2012,"" he said.

 EURO WORRIES
 Traders kept a close eye on the economic crisis in Greece.
Euro zone finance ministers gave Athens two weeks to approve
stricter austerity measures in return for another 12 billion
euros ($7 billion) in emergency loans, piling pressure on
Athens to get its ragged finances in order. [ID:nLDE75I0FM]
 Concerns about the Greek crisis weighed on markets in early
trade. U.S. stocks came close to a key technical level as the
Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped toward 1,259, its 200-day
moving average, before buyers came in and pushed the index
higher. [ID:nN1E75J1B7]
 The euro slid against the Swiss franc and could fall
further after European finance ministers failed to provide
clarity on Greece's outlook by delaying a decision on the next
tranche of financial aid.
 Traders were also awaiting U.S. inventory data for
direction, with the American Petroleum Institute's data due out
on Tuesday.
 U.S. crude oil inventories were seen lower last week due to
lower imports and a rise in refinery utilization rates, a
preliminary Reuters poll ahead of weekly stockpile reports
showed Monday. [EIA/S]

 NEW YORK/LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - Gold settled a notch
higher on Monday as investors held to it as a safe bet against
growing concerns over euro zone finances, while a relatively
strong dollar capped gains in the precious metal.
 The euro slid against the dollar after the region's finance
ministers gave Greece two weeks to approve further spending
cuts and tax rises in exchange for another 12 billion euros in
emergency loans. [ID:nLDE75I0FM]
 The spot price of bullion  was at $1,540.80 per ounce
by 3:15 p.m. EDT (1915 GMT), compared with $1,538.40 in New
York late on Friday.
 Gold priced in sterling  hit a record high at
954.63 pounds in Monday's trade.
 U.S. gold futures' benchmark August contract 
finished the official session up $2.90, or 0.2 percent, at
$1,542 per ounce.
 ""The ultimatum from the European Union to Greece, and
concerns there might be a Greek default after all these, is
keeping the safe-haven bid going for gold,"" said Bruce Dunn,
vice president at New Jersey-based precious metals dealer
Auramet Trading.
 ""But the dollar has been holding up pretty well too, and
that's stopping gold from really making a big run for now.""
 Robin Bhar, precious metals analyst with Credit Agricole in
London, said gold was likely to be stuck in its present range
until the Greek bailout was resolved.
 ""You're not going to get too much movement either way until
we get more clarification as to what happens on Greece. The
market is hungry for an actual agreement to be signed, sealed
and dusted.""
 On the U.S. front, outlook for both gold and the dollar was
fraught with uncertainty as investors await the U.S. Federal
Reserve's meeting and decision this week on interest rates.
 Financial markets are bracing for the conclusion at the end
of June of the Fed's ""QE2"" program, a cheap-money policy
credited with boosting stocks but blamed for sky-high

 ""Investors will be trying to see how far or how high the
bar for the next round of quantitative easing will be. If this
bar is actually lowered, then I think it will be beneficial for
gold,"" said Ong Yi Ling, investment analyst at Phillip Futures
in Singapore.
 ""If it is high, then I think gold will still remain in its
current range bounds that we are seeing. I don't think they
will do QE3 now.""

 IMF WARNING
 Recent gains in gold were driven by debt problems in
Europe, inflation fears in China following strong economic data
and worries about a U.S. economic slowdown.
 The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for U.S.
economic growth and warned Washington and debt-ridden European
countries that they are ""playing with fire"" unless they take
immediate steps to reduce their budget deficits.

 Jewellers in Indonesia have started making inquiries for

 LONDON, June 20 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices fell by more
than $1 on Monday, extending last week's losses, with risk
aversion rising after euro zone finance ministers postponed a
final decision on emergency loans to Greece.
 By 1200 GMT, Brent crude  fell by $1.50 a barrel to
$111.71 a barrel, while U.S. oil  lost $1.30 a barrel to
$91.71 a barrel.
 ""The crisis in Greece has resulted in higher risk aversion,
which is weighing on oil prices,"" Commerzbank analysts led by
Eugen Weinberg said in a note.
 Euro zone finance ministers postponed a final decision on
extending 12 billion euros ($17 billion) in emergency loans to
Greece, pending approval of the introduction of harsh austerity
measures by Athens, which pushed the common currency lower.
[ID:nLDE75I0FM]
 The dollar index <.DXY> gained 0.4 percent against a basket
of currencies, dragging greenback-denominated commodities lower.

 ""The daily movement of the euro has been an important price
driver for oil for well over a year now,"" analysts at PVM
brokerage said. ""There's no doubt that the biggest influence on
the euro and oil prices at the moment is the thinking around
Eurozone countries' sovereign debt. Contagion is the watchword.""
 The euro zone ministers said they expected the money, the
next tranche in a 110 billion euro bailout of Greece by the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund, to be paid
by mid-July. Greece has said it needs the loans by then to avoid
defaulting on its debt. [ID:nLDE75I0FM]
 ""Right now, both crude oil prices and the euro are a touch
lower, but an expected short-term agreement will likely enable
markets to breathe a little easier and allow commodity complexes
to stage a respectable bounce on account of a stronger euro,"" MF
Global analysts said in a note. ""However, any 'solution' for
Greece will be a temporary fix at best, as this issue is far too
difficult to be wrapped up in a few weeks.""

 U.S. crude fell below the key 200-day moving average for the
first time since September, drawing additional selling.
 
 SELL-OFF MARKS GOOD ENTRY POINT
 Still, oil is unlikely to dip further because supply side
concerns remain alive as unrest in the Middle East and North
Africa continues, and the current slump will offer a buying
opportunity, Victor Shum, an analyst at Purvin & Gertz, said.
 ""Two factors have contributed to the collapse in oil futures
-- Greece and the U.S. economic outlook,"" Shum said. ""But the
pull-back in prices is temporary because the Greece crisis will
pass and supply side concerns remain.""
 Against the backdrop of the uncertain growth outlook,
continuing social unrest in Libya, Syria and other countries in
the Middle East is helping to keep a floor under oil prices.
 President Bashar al-Assad gave a speech on Monday urging
Syrians to help restore normality even if the 'crisis' lasts for

 SINGAPORE, June 20 (Reuters) - Gold shed early gains on
Monday but was still supported by debt crisis woes in Europe
after the region's ministers delayed a decision on emergency
loans to Greece, while bullion priced in sterling struck a
lifetime high. 
 Euro zone finance ministers postponed to July a final
decision on extending a further 12 billion euros ($17 billion)
in emergency loans to Greece, saying Athens would first have to
introduce harsh austerity measures. 
 Spot gold was hardly changed at $1,537.49 by 0727
GMT, having risen above $1,541 on Friday -- its biggest one-day
gain since May. Gold is still below a lifetime high around
$1,575 touched in early May. 
 Investors await the Fed's Open Market Committee's
announcement on interest rates on June 22, which could squeeze
the dollar. 
 ""Investors will be trying to see how far or how high the bar
for the next round of quantitative easing will be. If this bar

 Financial markets are bracing for the conclusion at the end

credited with boosting stocks but blamed for sky-high
commodities prices and a weak dollar. 
 Gold priced in sterling extended gains to hit a
record at 953.41 pounds on Monday, tracking early gains in spot
gold. 
 The euro dipped on Monday as euro zone finance ministers
postponed a decision on extending the next tranche of Greek
bailout funds, with recent demand for euro put options
suggesting investors were bracing for further weakness. 
 But the ministers also agreed that they would seek a
voluntary rollover of Greek debt by private bondholders to
finance a substantial part of Greek funding needs in coming
years. 
 Recent gains in gold were driven by debt problems in Europe,
inflation fears in China following strong economic data and
worries about a U.S. economic slowdown.	
 ""I think to some extent it was expected they won't be able
to finalise it so soon because it was a pre-condition that
Athens has to introduce all these austerity measures and show a
plan of that sustainability before they get their bailout,"" said
Ong of Phillip Futures.	
 ""I think for gold, I would still look at resistance at about
the $1,550 to $1,555 level."" 
 Silver hardly moved at $35.56 an ounce, below a
record at $49.51 an ounce in April. 
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei average ended Monday flat, with
investor caution before the FOMC meeting this week offsetting
gains in power companies, which rose on a government official's
comment to restart nuclear reactors. 
 The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for U.S.
economic growth on Friday and warned Washington and debt-ridden
European countries that they are ""playing with fire"" unless they
take immediate steps to reduce their budget deficits.

 ""I think the United States will maintain the interest rates
at low levels for a little while after the quantitative easing
finishes. I can't tell you whether it's going to be bullish or

 ""But I guess gold will be stable until the problem in Greece
is solved. There are so many problems to be solved.""

 By Manash Goswami	
 SINGAPORE, June 20 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell more than $1
on Monday, extending last week's losses, as concern over a debt
crisis in Greece and a weaker economic outlook for the world's
top oil consumer, the United States, weighed on prices.	
 Brent crude  slipped $1.24 a barrel to $111.97 a
barrel, while U.S. oil  declined $1.25 a barrel to $91.76
a barrel by 0647 GMT.	
 Euro zone finance ministers postponed a final decision on
extending 12 billion euros ($17 billion) in emergency loans to
Greece, saying Athens would first have to introduce harsh
austerity measures, pushing the euro lower. 
 The dollar index gained 0.5 percent against a basket
of currencies, weighing on oil prices. 
 ""There is full-fledged fear of this Greece crisis falling
apart,"" said Tony Nunan, a risk manager with Tokyo-based
Mitsubishi Corp. ""At the end of the day, they will get a
bailout, but there is fear of a contagion, a mini crisis not
very long after the Lehman collapse."" 
 The euro zone ministers said they expected the money, the
next tranche in a 110-billion euro bailout of Greece by the
European Union and the International Monetary Fund, to be paid
by mid-July. Greece has said it needs the loans by then to avoid
defaulting on its debt. 
 
 
 
 On Friday, Brent settled at $113.21 a barrel, its lowest
level since May 24, falling 4.7 percent in its biggest weekly
loss since the week to May 6. U.S. crude futures settled at
$93.01 a barrel, down 2.04 percent, their lowest since Feb. 18.
U.S. crude fell below the key 200-day moving average for the
first time since September, drawing additional selling. 
 Mitsubishi's Nunan also attributed the fall in part to
higher supplies by top oil exporter Saudi Arabia after OPEC
talks collapsed earlier this month. 
 ""If they are increasing supplies to Asia, they must have
done so for Europe as well,"" Nunan said.	
 
 PRICE OUTLOOK	
 Still, oil is unlikely to dip further because supply side
concerns remain alive as unrest in the Middle East and North
Africa continues, and the current slump will offer a buying
opportunity, Victor Shum, an analyst at Purvin & Gertz, said. 
 ""Two factors have contributed to the collapse in oil futures
-- Greece and the U.S. economic outlook,"" Shum said. ""But the
pull-back in prices is temporary because the Greece crisis will
pass and supply side concerns remain.""	
 Shum expects U.S. crude to rebound to $95 a barrel this week
and stay around $100 in the next few months with ""extreme
volatility around that level.""	
 ""Greece remains in the headlines,"" Shum said. ""But the Euro
zone will get together and will not allow Greece to default."" 
 Brent is expected to rebound to $115 per barrel, as it
failed to break below a support at $110.78, U.S. oil has been
oversold and is expected to rebound to $95 per barrel,
according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. 
 Adding to concerns of an unstable euro zone was a cut by the
International Monetary Fund in its estimate of U.S. gross
domestic product growth. The IMF now projects an anaemic 2.5
percent growth this year and 2.7 percent in 2012. Just two
months ago, it had expected growth of 2.8 percent and 2.9
percent, respectively. 
 
 SUPPLY CONCERNS	
 Against the backdrop of the uncertain growth outlook,
continuing social unrest in Libya, Syria and other countries in
the Middle East is helping to keep a floor under oil prices.	
 Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is to address the nation on
Monday as his forces sweep through the northwestern border
region with Turkey blocking refugees fleeing a military
crackdown on protests against his autocratic rule.	
 The operation along the border follows the biggest protests
on Friday during four months of anti-Assad unrest that a violent
clampdown has failed to quash. Security forces shot dead up to
19 protesters on Friday, rights groups said. 
 ""There have been reports that half of Yemen's output
capacity is currently inoperable due to pipeline attacks,""
analysts led by Peter Jolly at National Australia Bank said in a
report. ""In themselves, these shutdowns have a minimal influence
on the world oil market, but they compound the falls in Libyan
production since the start of the year."" 
 NATO has been pounding targets in Libya for months in what
it says is an operation to protect civilians who rebelled
against Gaddafi's 41-year rule. The Libyan leader says it is an
act of colonial aggression designed to steal oil.

 NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - Gold rose nearly 1 percent on
Friday, notching its biggest one-day gain in three weeks, as a
sharp dollar drop amid an outline agreement to aid debt-burden
Greece boosted investor appetite across the board.
 A string of recent lackluster U.S. economic data, worries
Greece's debt crisis may escalate and uncertainty related to
U.S. debt ceiling talks also lifted the metal for a small
weekly gain. Bullion is up nearly 5 percent in the past 30
days.
 Gold accelerated gains after mixed U.S. data point to a
wobbly economic recovery. U.S. consumer sentiment worsened more
than forecast in June on continued economic pessimism, but a
key measure of future U.S. economic activity rose more than
expected in May to a record high. [ID:nN17281627]
[ID:nN17219319]
 ""We are seeing a return to risk as the equity market was up
and the dollar is down. Obviously, gold is reacting to that
well,"" said David Meger, director of metals trading at Vision
Financial Markets.
 Spot gold  was up 0.6 percent to $1,536.89 an ounce
by 2:36 p.m. EDT (1836 GMT), its strongest one-day rally since
May 27 when it surged 1.1 percent.
 U.S. August gold futures  settled up $9.20 at
$1,539.10 an ounce, after trading between $1,523.20 and $1,543
an ounce.
 Trading volume was almost half of its 30-day average,
preliminary Reuters data showed, consistent with recently lower
levels as investors switched their focus on the equity
markets.
 Silver  was up 0.8 percent at $35.78.
 Even as gold benefits from a disappointing U.S. economic
outlook, the metal has failed to breach its record high $1,575
set in early May. Technical selling, a firm dollar combined
with sliding crude oil prices have kept gold from rising
further.
 On Friday, investor sentiment improved after Greece's
embattled prime minister replaced his finance minister to force
an unpopular austerity plan, and as the euro rose on hopes for
a new Greek aid package after Germany and France pulled
together on a rescue approach. [FRX/]

 Bullion also drew support from worries over a European debt
contagion. Moody's placed Italy's credit rating on review for
possible downgrade.
 U.S. DEBT TALK IN FOCUS
 Participants of the gold market also focused on development
over talks to reach a deficit-cutting agreement among U.S.
lawmakers also underpinned gold.
 The deal would allow Congress to raise the $14.3 trillion
U.S. debt limit before Aug. 2, when the Treasury Department has
warned it will run out of money to pay the government's bills,
a development that could disrupt the economic recovery.
 Negotiators said on Thursday they had tentatively agreed on
a number of cuts and are now gearing up for tough trade-offs
that could lead to trillions of dollars in savings.
[ID:nN16185069]
 Persistently low U.S. interest rates should also help gold,
analysts said.
 ""The weakness in the U.S. economy shall give rise to
concerns on the part of the Fed that more monetary stimulus to
be brought forth, thus raising the prospects of QE3 once
again,"" said independent investor Dennis Gartman.
 The end of a $600 billion U.S. government bond-buying
program, or the second round of quantitative easing dubbed as
QE2, this month is also fueling economic worries.
 Among platinum group metals, platinum  was down 0.1
percent at $1,751 an ounce, while palladium  slipped 0.9
percent to $745.72 an ounce. For the week, palladium was down
more than 6 percent on worries over the pace of economic
recovery.

 By Antonita Devotta
 NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday,
with U.S. crude slumping to a four-month low under $93 as a
dimmer economic outlook and the European debt crisis drove
crude to its biggest weekly loss since early May.
 U.S. futures fell more than $3 a barrel as momentum sellers
piled into the slide. U.S. crude's discount to Brent widened by
more than $1 to $19.90 a barrel.
 Oil broke away from familiar correlations, diving in tandem
with the dollar and despite gains for many commodities. Some
oil analysts appeared more pessimistic about Greece than those
in the foreign exchange market, where the dollar fell by nearly
1 percent on hopes for a debt deal.
 U.S. crude futures for July  settled at $93.01 a
barrel, down $1.94, or 2.04 percent, its lowest since the Feb.
18. It traded from $91.84 to $95.40 Friday. U.S. crude fell
below the 200-day moving average for the first time since
September, drawing additional selling.
 Brent crude for August  settled at $113.21 a barrel,
dropping 81 cents, or 0.71 percent, the lowest settlement since
May 24, when front-month Brent closed at $112.53. Trading
volume was about 20 percent below the 30-day average.
 For the week, front-month Brent fell 4.7 percent, the
biggest weekly loss since the week to May 6. Brent is up 19
percent this year, while U.S. futures are up less than 2
percent as the European market rose to a record premium.
 ""The predominant problem here is that traders own too much
oil. They bought too much in anticipation of market tightness
and now they have to adjust their positions,"" said Tim Evans of
Citi Futures Perspective.
 The current July contract for U.S. crude is set to expire
on Tuesday, June 21.
 Prices slumped early in the European day, and made new lows
in mid-afternoon as a downturn in stocks following Research In
Motion's  disappointing results weighed.
""The stock market and euro have come off a bit and that has
added pressure on oil and some sell stops have been triggered.
People just continue to be nervous about the economy,"" said
Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock.

 GREEK DRAMA
 The euro gained on the day as the embattled Greek prime
minister sacrificed his finance minister to force through an
unpopular austerity plan, while Germany and France promised to
go on funding Athens.[ID:nLDE75G0JV]
 The euro pared those gains slightly in the afternoon when
Moody's Investors Service said it may cut Italy's sovereign
credit rating from AA2, citing challenges ahead for economic
growth due to structural weaknesses and a likely rise in
interest rates. [ID:nWNA1370]
 Oil's slump broke its inverse correlation with the dollar,
which has eased to its weakest since mid-April at just 22
percent, based on the average of the past 25 days.
 ""U.S. crude has broken below the recent range of $95-$105
and looks like it will shortly tack another $5 to the
downside,"" said Gene McGillian, analyst at Tradition Energy.
 ""The fear of the fallout from the Greek debt crisis
continues to impact the oil markets. Indications of a possible
resolution of the crisis have helped pare some of oil's losses
but investors worry about the stalling pace of U.S. economic
recovery.""
 The International Monetary Fund cut its estimate for U.S.
gross domestic product. This also weighed on U.S. crude prices.
The IMF now projects an anemic 2.5 percent growth this year and
2.7 percent in 2012. [ID:nEBE7DA01M]
 Brent was also under pressure from news that this week's
relative strength for the European benchmark was drawing
physical crude from far afield, with news that traders were
offering Russian Pacific Rim ESPO in the Mediterranean.

 LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - Crude oil futures fell by more
than $2 on Friday amid growing risk aversion because of Greece's
ongoing debt crisis, sending prices down by more than 4 percent
this week in the biggest drop since early May.
 The euro slid close to three-week lows with markets still
unconvinced that the highly-indebted European country could
avoid a default even after appearing to secure a round of
near-term funding. [MKTS/GLOB]
 Brent crude for August  tumbled $2.21 to $111.80
barrel by 0753 GMT, while U.S. crude benchmark West Texas
Intermediate  retreated $2.37 to $94.59.
 ""Greece will weigh into prices next week, it will be an
underlying concern for the weeks to come. It's like watching
Lehman in 2008... it's a problem but we don't have the
solution,"" Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix said.
 Analysts were worried about the impact of the ongoing euro
zone debt crisis, which dragged equity markets lower and forced
Spain to pay a premium in its latest debt auction.
[ID:nLDE75F0U9]
 ""Everyone is fearful about the euro financial crisis,
especially in Greece,"" said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity
derivatives manager at Japan's Newedge brokerage.
 ""We have seen some good and some bad data. We hope the euro
will stabilize because it's very much correlated with crude.""
 U.S. data over the week showed the economy of the world's
top oil consumer continued to sputter in the second quarter. It
also offered evidence the recovery was on course to regain
momentum as the year progresses. [ID:nN16172420]
 U.S. Mid-Atlantic factory activity contracted in June to a
near two-year low, overshadowing better-than-expected readings
on the nation's labor and housing markets.
 ""Demand is not so bad and is steadily increasing in the
developing countries and supply will tighten in the second half
of the year,"" Hasegawa said.
 The International Energy Agency on Thursday raised the
pressure on OPEC to increase output by forecasting a steep rise
in oil demand later this year and predicting the strain on
supply would last over the medium term. [ID:nLDE75F0JR] 
 The Paris-based IEA raised its assessment of how much OPEC
oil would be needed this year by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd)
to 30.1 million bpd in a monthly report.
 
 BRENT VS WTI
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude WTI was near $19 a barrel on
Friday, after hitting a record $23.34 two days earlier, when the
July contract expired.
 ""While WTI distortions have been a key market driver in
2010, there has been little in the way of new fundamental
catalysts to warrant the ballooning out of that spread to such
extreme values,"" Barclays Capital analysts headed by Paul
Horsnell said.
 ""In an oversupplied U.S. market, the need to import Brent is
all but gone, and, hence, the WTI-Brent spread is rendered
meaningless.""
 Oil prices will stay above $100 a barrel in the next year as
supply worries outweigh concerns about flagging global economic
growth, a Reuters survey of oil industry officials, executives
and traders showed. [ID:nLDE75F11F]
 Eight of 20 participants in the Reuters Energy and Climate
Summit said they saw oil trading between $110 and $130 a barrel
in June 2012, eight saw prices between $90 and $100 and three
saw prices above $130. Only one respondent saw prices between
$70-$90 per barrel.
 
 OPEC & IEA
 A failure by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) to boost output last week, despite calls from
the West to help protect economic growth, has fueled debate over
whether OPEC and leading member Saudi Arabia have enough spare
capacity if demand rises and prices spike. [ID:nN13138830]
 Saudi Arabia is expected to raise output towards 10 million
barrels a day (bpd) this month, sources said earlier this week,
up from 8.86 million bpd in May. [ID:nLDE75D08W]
 The IEA stands ready to release strategic reserves of crude
oil to ensure adequate supply and support the global economy,
Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka said on Thursday.
[ID:nLDE75F0SB]
 ""While there is a growing perception that near term oil
supplies will be adequate either through an OPEC or IEA
response, we reiterate our concern that such confidence could
prove ephemeral, and the arrival of adequate supplies is far
from guaranteed,"" said J.P. Morgan analysts led by Lawrence
Eagles.
 The number of crude oil tankers booked from the Middle East
has surged 15 percent to a multi-year high this month due to an
increase in Saudi Arabian exports, shipbrokers said on Friday.

 SINGAPORE, June 17 (Reuters) - Oil was steady on Friday as
investors took their cue from currency markets, assessing the
impact of the Greek debt crisis on risk aversion, which has
taken almost 4 percent off Brent crude prices this week, in the
biggest drop since early May.	
 The euro was steady, but markets were still unconvinced that

 SINGAPORE, June 17 (Reuters) - Gold edged lower on Friday,
but jitters about whether Greece was edging closer to default
and economic spillover from the country's debt crisis could
still spur safe haven buying.	
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou fought to form a
cabinet to avoid defaulting on the national debt and postponed
announcing the cabinet until Friday, in a sign of how difficult
his task is. 
 Spot gold hit a high around $1,530 an ounce before
slipping to $1,526.50 by 0603 GMT, down $1.85. Down 0.3 percent
on the week, the metal is heading for its second consecutive
weekly drop. 
 ""In the last 48 hours, it's just floundering, trying to work
out what it wants to do. If anything, the strength of the dollar
and the political fears are just getting the bulls and bears at
loggerheads,"" said Jonathan Barratt, managing director of
Commodity Broking Services. 
 
 
 
 The dollar index slipped to 75.598 from a three-week
high of 76.015 after the European Union's top economic official,
Olli Rehn, said he expected the EU and the IMF to release a
crucial 12 billion euro loan tranche in early July to keep
Athens afloat. 
 Any solution to Greece's debt woes must avoid the coercion
of bondholders or a default, European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet was quoted as saying on Friday.

 Gold is 3 percent below a lifetime high around $1,575
touched in early May. Recent gains were driven by debt problems
in Europe, inflation fears in China following strong economic
data, and worries about a U.S. economic slowdown.	
 Investors await the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open
Market Committee's announcement on interest rates on June 22. 
 The Fed last November announced a programme to buy $600
billion in Treasuries to help push long-term interest rates
lower and stimulate the economy. That programme will end June
30. 
 The physical market saw sales of gold scrap, while top
consumer India was in a lean spell as farmers were busy sowing
seeds during the monsoon season. 
 ""Surprisingly, I am getting scrap from Thailand. I mean, I
got some physical requirement from them yesterday, but today,
they are selling. I guess the market is sideways because
volume-wise, it's pretty low,"" said a dealer in Singapore.	
 ""Indonesia was a good buyer at the beginning of this week,
but they started to quiet down after the market went up to the
$1,530s. There's nothing much from India either."" 
 Silver was flat at $35.29 an ounce, below a record at
$49.51 an ounce in April. 
 Platinum group metals tracked industrial metals higher.
. For the week, however, palladium was down more
than 6 percent. 
 Holdings of the largest silver-backed exchange-traded-fund
(ETF), New York's iShares Silver Trust , fell 0.27 percent
from Wednesday to Thursday, while, the largest gold-backed ETF,
New York's SPDR Gold Trust , remained unchanged for the
same period. 
 The Nikkei stock average hit a three-month low on Friday as
investors moved into safer assets with worries over Greece
compounding jitters that the global economy may be slowly headed
for a sustained slowdown.

Greece's debt woes and the potential the problems might spread
to other euro zone economies. July crude oil options expired on
Thursday, adding to the trading volatility, sources said.

 NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Gold prices ended nearly flat
on Thursday, underpinned by safe-haven demand amid fears that
Greece's debt crisis may escalate and the U.S. economic outlook
will stay weak.
 U.S. data gave a mixed picture. A gauge of regional
manufacturing activity hit a near two-year low in June,
overshadowing improved readings on the labor and housing
markets. Gold has risen around 4 percent in the last 30 days
after a string of disappointing economic data hit the equity
markets.
 But bullion drew support from economic uncertainty as
international lenders scrambled to save Greece from default,
and on uncertainty related to talks over U.S. debt ceiling.
 ""Greece is facing a number of difficulties and obstacles
right now. If it can meet some of these challenges, you will
see a flight back to the risk assets and maybe less to safety,""
said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist with Lind
Waldock, a unit of futures broker MF Global.
 ""For now, gold gets the benefit of being a safe haven.""
 Spot gold  slipped 0.1 percent to $1,527.80 an ounce
by 2:44 p.m. EDT (1844 GMT).
 The U.S. August futures contract  settled up $3.70 at
$1,529.90 an ounce, after trading between $1,522 and $1,534.
Volume was almost half of its 30-day average, consistent with
recently lower levels as investors switched their focus on the
volatile equity markets.
 The metal is about 3 percent below a lifetime high of
$1,575.79 touched in early May.
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou struggled to quell a
revolt in his party against EU/IMF-ordained austerity steps.
Worries over the European debt crisis pummeled the euro and
pushed to record highs the cost of insuring against default the
debt of Greece and several other peripheral euro zone nations.
[ID:nLDE75E0JC] [GVD/EUR] [FRX/]
 ""The (gold) market has an underlying confidence level based
upon what is going on in the Middle East, with the debt crisis,
with Greece,"" said ANZ head of metals sales Peter Hillyard.
 Gold priced in euros  touched a session high of
1,086.57 euros, just shy of the record 1,088.11 hit in late
May.
 Bullion also drew support from economic uncertainty as a
group of top U.S. lawmakers set an ambitious July 1 goal to
reach a broad debt-reduction deal. The Republicans and the
White House are still far apart agreeing on how to to raise the
$14.3 trillion debt limit so the world's biggest economy can
avoid default and keep borrowing. [ID:nN15289440]
 GOLD/SILVER RATIO RISES
 Silver  was last down 1 percent at $35.40 an ounce,
having fallen nearly a third since touching a record $49.51 in
April.
 BNP Paribas said silver buying would likely be muted over
summer on lagging industrial demand, and did not expect the
gold/silver ratio to decline back to the low 30s.
 The ratio, showing how many ounces of silver can buy one
ounce of gold, rose above 43 after falling to just 31 in late
April, its weakest since the early 1980s.

 Weaker economic sentiment also weighed on platinum group
metals. Platinum  slipped 0.9 percent to $1,753.74 an
ounce, and palladium  fell 2 percent to $755.72 an
ounce.

 LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - Gold fell on Thursday after the
U.S. dollar hit a three-week high against the euro as concern
escalated over the impact of the Greek debt crisis on the euro
zone, knocking commodities.
 The Greek prime minister said he would form a new
government, while euro zone finance ministers conceded that an
agreement over a second international bailout for Athens would
take longer than expected.
 That pummelled the euro and pushed to record highs the cost
of insuring against default the debt of Greece and several other
peripheral euro zone nations. [ID:nLDE75E0JC]
[GVD/EUR]
 It also dented palladium, copper and gold, which normally
profits from such environments.
 On Wednesday the VIX options volatility index <.VIX>, the
so-called ""fear gauge"" of Wall Street, hit three-month highs.
 Spot gold  was down 0.27 percent to 1,525.69
an ounce by 1107 GMT, after rising to around $1,533 on Wednesday
on the back of weaker equity markets.
 Gold is 3.2 percent below a lifetime high at $1,575.79
touched in early May, but still up 7.5 percent so far this year,
having risen by nearly 24 percent in the last year.
 The 1.6 percent rise in the dollar against a basket of
currencies <.DXY> this month has contributed to gold's 0.6
percent fall in June, as a stronger dollar makes gold less
attractive to non-U.S. buyers.
 It also helps lift bond yields and stock prices, undermining
the appeal of gold which bears no yield or dividend.
 ""We are more or less solely driven by the U.S. currency,
which is in turn driven by the debt criss and economic
indciators in general. We've seen many times in the past that if
commodity prices are under pressure, the gold price comes under
some pressure as well,"" said Commerzbank analyst Daniel
Briesemann.
 ""Gold cannot escape completely from a general downturn in
commodity markets, but we don't expect gold to come down much
further and it should find some support around current price
levels.""
 The euro  fell to a three-week low on Thursday and
dropped below its 100-day moving average for the first time
since February, with traders citing ECB policy maker Nout
Wellink saying in a Dutch newspaper report that the European
bailout fund should be doubled. [USD/]
 Gold priced in euros  was last broadly unchanged
on the day, trading at 1,080.74 euros an ounce, but remains less
than 10 euros off the record high of 1,088.11 euros hit in late
May.
 ""Investors are skeptical that a new (Greek) government will
be able to convince the disillusioned masses to accept more
austerity measures. Instead, much needed budget cuts could be
delayed,""
said Ong Yi Ling, investment analyst at Phillip Futures.
 ""Until Greece produces a plan for future debt
sustainability, aid could be withheld. As the likelihood of a

 By Antonita Devotta
 NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Oil rose in choppy trading
Thursday, recouping some of the previous day's sharp losses
after the West's energy watchdog forecast a steep rise in
demand.
 U.S. crude while firmer remained near Wednesday's
four-month low, weighed down by data from the Philadelphia
Federal Reserve Bank showing a slowdown in regional factory
activity, the latest in a series of indicators flagging
economic growth concerns in the world's biggest oil consumer.
ID:nN16184986]
 Limiting gains was the rising tension over a planned rescue
of Greece, amid worries about a wider fallout.
 ""The market is sort of paralyzed until we find out what
happens with Greece and the possibility of contagion,"" said
Richard Ilczyszyn, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock.
 Front-month ICE Brent August crude rose $1.01
to settle at $114.02 a barrel, having traded from $112.55 to
$114.94.
 July crude rose 14 cents to settle at $94.95 a barrel,
trading from $94.29 to $95.75.
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude slipped to $19 a barrel. It
had hit a record $23.34 on Wednesday after the July contract
expired, erasing the previous $22.80 record set on Tuesday.
 Crude trading volumes for both contracts were on track to
finish well below the previous session's, and below or just in
the vicinity of 30-day averages.
 Ilczyszyn noted U.S. crude July options expire Thursday,
adding there was a lot of open interests around $95. Open
interest for the $95 July put option stood at 13,647, according
to Reuters data, and 3,273 positions for the $95 call.
 ""It's a mixture between an impulse to liquidate long
positions versus an impulse to buy the market on any dip. The
question is whether it is still a good policy to buy on
weakness, or sell due to the shift in market sentiment,"" said
Tim Evans of Citi Futures Perspective.
 IEA'S UPBEAT FORECAST
 Early Thursday, oil rallied after the International Energy
Agency forecast global refinery crude demand would rise sharply
in the third quarter as refiners exit turnarounds and replenish
depleted oil product stocks for peak summer demand.
 IEA added higher demand and reduced spare OPEC capacity
will leave oil markets under greater strain between now and
2012 than previously thought. The forecast sent Brent up to
nearly $115 a barrel.
 ""Brent is probably getting support from the IEA report and
the prospect of good demand from China,"" said Phil Flynn,
analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago.
 The Paris-based adviser to 28 consumer countries raised its
assessment of how much OPEC oil would be needed this year by
400,000 barrels per day to 30.1 million bpd.
 ECONOMY WEIGHS
 U.S. crude was down this morning after June data from the
Philadelphia Fed showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic
region unexpectedly shrank 7.7 percent to its lowest in two
years, going against analysts' forecasts for a 6.8 percent
rise.
 Also weighing on prices were new applications for U.S.
jobless benefits which dipped in the latest week but remained
at levels too high to put a dent in the unemployment rate.
 Traders and analysts said the overall trend remained down,
given the stream of negative U.S. economic data and the Greek
sovereign debt crisis.
 ""We believe that the health of the global economy remains
the most important underlying factor driving the oil market,""
said James Zhang, an energy analyst at Standard Bank.
""Therefore, we see the softening global economy as an
increasing downside risk to the oil price in the near term.""

 By Alejandro Barbajosa	
 SINGAPORE, June 16 (Reuters) - Oil rebounded on Thursday,
with Brent up 1.4 percent, after the previous day's sharp drop
and a falling dollar created buying opportunities against a
backdrop of tumbling U.S. crude inventories and uncertainty over
OPEC output.	
 Brent crude for August , the front-month contract
after July expired on Wednesday, gained $1.49 to $114.50 a
barrel by 0322 GMT, while U.S. crude benchmark West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) rose 60 cents to $95.41 .	
 On Wednesday, U.S. crude plunged to $94.81, the lowest
settlement since Feb. 22, on signs of economic weakness as
manufacturing unexpectedly shrank in the state of New York.	
 ""It's a little bit of buying on weakness after the
significant fall overnight, and also dollar weakness is causing
prices to rise,"" said Ben Westmore, a commodities analyst at
National Australia Bank.	
 ""The economic data wasn't calamitous by any means, so
there's support for WTI at $94-$95.""	
 U.S. crude inventories last week fell by 3.4 million
barrels, more than twice as much as forecast, government data
showed on Wednesday. They remain about 7 percent above their
five-year average. 
 ""There are still abundant stocks of oil globally but that
abundance is likely to abate in the second half if we continue
to see weak production levels from OPEC,"" Westmore said. ""We
know how foggy OPEC policy can be, and I wouldn't rely on Saudi
Arabia increasing output until we see it in the numbers.""	
 Saudi Arabia is expected to unilaterally increase crude
production towards 10 million barrels per day (bpd) this month,
sources said on Tuesday, up from about 8.86 million bpd in May,
after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last
week failed to reach an agreement on output.	
 Any increase in output from OPEC countries in the Middle
East would take weeks to be reflected in U.S. inventories.	
 Crude stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma, the pricing point for
WTI crude traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, were down
1.14 million barrels at 37.76 million barrels, easing a glut
that has weighed on U.S. benchmark crude prices this year. 
 U.S. imports from Canada fell 381,000 bpd for the week to
their lowest level since December after the 591,000-bpd Keystone
pipeline from Canada was shut for a week, helping to drain
Midwest stocks. The line reopened for service on June 5.	
 In oil-producing North Africa, fights continued as Libyan
rebels have pushed deeper into government-held territory from
their base in the Western Mountains, taking two villages from
which forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi had been shelling
rebel-held towns. 
 The United States said on Wednesday tensions in Bahrain were
very high ahead of a planned national dialogue after weeks of
pro-democracy demonstrations and urged the authorities to
encourage people to speak out.

 SINGAPORE, June 16 (Reuters) - Gold lost its footing on
Thursday after the U.S. dollar jumped against other currencies,
but euro zone debt jitters could limit losses as investors
fretted about the lack of resolution over solving the crisis in
Greece. 
 The Greek prime minister said he would form a new government
as euro zone finance ministers conceded that a deal on a second
international bailout of the ailing country was now unlikely to
be reached at a summit next week. 
 Spot gold fell $4.99 an ounce to $1,524.86 an ounce
by 0557 GMT after rising for a second straight session to around
$1,533 on Wednesday on declines in equities. Gold is well below
a lifetime high around $1,575 touched in early May. 
 ""Investors are skeptical that a new government will be able
to convince the disillusioned masses to accept more austerity
measures. Instead, much needed budget cuts could be delayed,""
said Ong Yi Ling, investment analyst at Phillip Futures. 
 ""Until Greece produces a plan for future debt
sustainability, aid could be withheld. As the likelihood of a
technical default increases, a flight to safety could cause gold
and the dollar to rise in tandem.""     
 The euro fell to a three-week low on Thursday and
dropped below its 100-day moving average for the first time
since February, with traders citing ECB policy maker Nout
Wellink saying in a Dutch newspaper report that the European
bailout fund should be doubled. 
 As the euro sags, the dollar index held near a
three-week high after having jumped 1.7 percent on Wednesday --
its biggest one-day percentage gain since August 2010. 
 The escalating Greek problems and data showing the U.S.
economy is facing a troubling mix of weaker growth and higher
prices triggered selling on Wall Street, adding to pressure on
Asian equity markets and other riskier assets on Thursday.
 
 
 
 
 The physical market was subdued after some trading was
reported overnight. Premiums for gold bars were steady at 60 to
80 cents an ounce to the spot London prices in Singapore. 
 ""I guess the premiums are competitive at 80 cents. I am just
trying to push for some volume among the small tiny ripples,""
said a dealer in Singapore. 
 ""We did see some buying and selling last night, but still
there was nothing significant."" 
 Silver lost 49 cents to $35.28 an ounce, below a
record at $49.51 an ounce in April.	
 ""In our view, interest in silver is likely to be muted over
the summer months, particularly as the metal lacks support on
the economic front,"" BNP Paribas said in a report. 
 ""While silver may outperform gold towards the end of
the year, we do not expect the gold/silver ratio to
decline back to the low 30s."" 
 The gold-silver ratio, or how many ounces of
silver can buy one ounce of gold, was at about 42 after falling
to around 31 in late April, its weakest since the early 1980s. 
 In the energy market, oil rebounded on Thursday, with Brent
up 0.8 percent, after its second biggest fall in two years the
previous day created buying opportunities against a backdrop of
tumbling U.S. crude inventories and uncertainty over OPEC
output.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Wednesday for a
second straight session on safe-haven buying triggered by a
sharp pullback in equity markets amid fears of a U.S. economic
slowdown and signs that Greece's debt crisis may escalate.
 Investors turned to gold after U.S. consumer prices logged
their biggest rise in nearly three years and a regional
manufacturing gauge contracted this month. Uncertainty related
to talks on the U.S. debt ceiling also provided support.
 ""Gold is a bastion of strength right now when the equity,
crude oil and other commodity markets are weak,"" said Robert
Lutts, chief investment officer at Cabot Money Management, a
wealth management firm with $500 million in assets.
 Spot gold  was up 0.2 percent at $1,527.04 an ounce
by 3:18 p.m. EDT (1918 GMT), having recovered from a session
low of $1,513.86.
 The U.S. August futures contract  settled up $1.80 at
$1,526.20 an ounce, after trading between $1,514.50 and
$1,535.70. Volume was one-third of its 30-day average,
consistent with recently lower levels.

fear gauge, rose more than 5 percent for its biggest one-day
gain in more than a month. (Graphic:
http://r.reuters.com/xem22s )
 Gold fell in early trading, dragged down by selling across
the board and a surge in the dollar due to the worsening
European debt crisis.
 Gold is up 3 percent over the past four weeks on a flurry
of disappointing U.S. economic data including a weak jobs
report.
 Spot silver  rose 0.7 percent to $35.58 an ounce,
about 30 percent below a record high of $49.51 set on April
28.
 U.S. stocks measured by the S&P 500 index fell 1.5 percent

unexpectedly fast rise in prices in May and a contraction in
New York State manufacturing activity. [ID:nN15281293]
 Gold was one of the few gainers among commodities on
Wednesday in the face of an almost 2 percent surge in the
dollar. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB commodities index <.CRB>
dropped more than 2 percent for its largest daily loss in more
than a month as U.S. crude oil futures slid as much as $5.
 GREEK CRISIS
 Flight-to-quality buying emerged as Greece's prime minister
offered to quit and make way for a national unity government
after mass protests against an austerity plan turned violent
and the country teetered on the brink of default.
[ID:nLDE75E0JC]
 ""The theme of the European sovereign debt crisis just won't
go away, and on that basis there is a limit to how much you
want to sell gold at this moment in time,"" Saxo Bank senior
manager Ole Hansen said.
 Reflecting investor discontent over the euro zone debt
crisis, the euro fell nearly 2 percent against the dollar,
pushing up the price of gold in euros by 2 percent in its
largest one-day rise in almost a month.
 ""There are still big problems with Greece and here with our
debt ceiling,"" Jonathan Jossen, an independent floor trader in
COMEX gold options, said.
 A group of top U.S. lawmakers set an ambitious July 1 goal
to reach a broad debt-reduction deal, even though Republicans

trillion debt limit so the world's biggest economy can avoid
default and keep borrowing. [ID:nN15289440]

 LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - Gold slipped on Wednesday as a
stronger dollar prompted a flurry of sales, but investor buying
sparked by sovereign debt concerns and inflationary pressures
helped underpin sentiment.
 Spot gold  was bid at $1,519.20 a troy ounce at 1101
GMT from $1,523.25 an ounce late in New York on Tuesday. The
precious metal hit a three-week low of $1,511.11 on Monday.
 The dollar rose against the euro, which succumbed to worries
about the Greek debt crisis after euro zone ministers failed to
agree a deal. [USD/] [ID:nLDE75D0G6]
 ""Euro zone -- and perhaps soon U.S. -- sovereign debt
concerns remain critical, there is a lot of liquidity still and
China's growing middle class can't get enough of the yellow
metal,"" said David Thurtell, analyst at Citi.
 ""Investors want to avoid the dollar, euro and yen. It
doesn't leave much, especially if you can't access the yuan.""
 The United States could lose its top-notch credit rating and
the dollar's reserve-currency status could suffer if the
Republicans and Democrats do not agree a deal to cut the
deficit. [ID:nN14186233]
The deal should give Congress the political cover to raise
the $14.3 trillion debt limit well before Aug. 2, when the
Treasury Department has warned it will run out of money to pay
the government's bills.
 ""Even a short suspension of payments on principal or
interest on the Treasury's debt obligations could cause severe
disruptions in financial markets and the payments system,""
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said.
 
 RESILIENT PHYSICAL DEMAND
 A higher dollar makes commodities priced in dollars more
expensive for holders of other currencies, while gold is used to
protect investment portfolios the value of which can be severely
eroded by inflation.
 Raising concern this week was inflation data from China and
India, two of the world's fastest growing economies, which
showed accelerating price pressures. [ID:nL3E7HE1HL]
 ""Chinese and Indian inflation is underpinning what has been
resilient physical metal demand so far this year,"" said Daniel
Major, analyst at RBS, ""Currencies will be important.""
 Investor interest in gold should eventually show up in
holdings of physically backed exchange-traded funds of which the
largest is New York's SPDR Gold Trust .
 SPDR's holdings were unchanged on Tuesday from Monday, while
those of the largest silver-backed ETF, New York's iShares
Silver Trust  fell 0.44 percent. [ID:nSGE75E001]
 Spot silver  was bid at $35.18 an ounce from $35.32
late on Tuesday. The precious industrial metal hit a record high
of $49.51 on April 28.
 ""Investors have generally been prepared to trade (silver)
this year only because they believed the upside potential to be
large,"" UBS said in a note.
 ""Earlier this year the potential for a 30 percent rise in
silver appeared greater than the potential for a 30 percent
fall. Now, however, a 10 percent downside correction now looks
more likely that a 10 percent rebound.""
 Spot platinum  was bid at $1,785.50 an ounce from
$1,789.20 late in New York on Tuesday and palladium  at
$787.72 from $790.20 an ounce.

 By Gene Ramos
 NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - Oil slid more than 4 percent
on Wednesday, as signs of further economic weakness fed demand
worries and a rising dollar weighed, triggering technical sell
stops and sending U.S. crude to its lowest since February.
 U.S. crude weakened early on data showing a rise in core
inflation and shrinking New York manufacturing. After a brief
rise on news of a big drop in weekly U.S. crude stocks, prices
succumbed to intensifying selling pressure, breaking below the
150-day moving average and $95 key support.
 ""It's a rush for the exits. The market has been overvalued
for some time now...the Brent market has been a bubble and the
bubble is bursting today,"" said Tim Evans, energy analyst at
Citi Futures Perspective.
 ""In my opinion, WTI would be fairly valued at $85 a barrel
and Brent at $90 a barrel,"" Evans added.
 U.S. July crude  fell $4.56 to settle at $94.81 a
barrel, the lowest since Feb. 22. It hit a session low of
$94.01, also the lowest since that day.
 Brent crude for July delivery  expired and settled
$3.06 lower at $117.10, after hitting a session low of $116.80.
The August contract  settled down $6.34 at $113.01.
 Brent's premium against U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate for the second-month August contract narrowed by
more than $1 to around $18 a barrel after the July spread had
blown out to a record $22.80 on Tuesday. 
 EURO, STOCKS SLUMP
 The slump came as the U.S. dollar extended gains for its
biggest daily rise since August, with the dollar index <.DXY>
up 1.7 percent, while the S&P 500 stock index <.SPX> tumbled by
more than 2.0 percent to its lowest level since March. [.N]
 The euro slid against the dollar, heading for its worst day
in more than a month on worries about the Greek debt crisis.
 European ministers failed on Tuesday to reach agreement on
how private holders of Greek debt should share the costs of a
new bailout, putting the onus on leaders of Germany and France
to forge a deal later this week. [USD/] <.DXY>
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, said he will form a
new government on Thursday and seek a vote of confidence from
his parliamentary group after street protests against his
austerity plans. [ID:LDE75E041]
 The session reminded oil traders of early May, when prices
swooned from recent highs. Other commodities also fell, with
corn slumping toward its biggest three-day loss in a year and a
half. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> fell 2.3 percent.
 U.S. core consumer inflation rose more than expected in May
to post its largest increase in nearly three years, which could
prompt the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates sooner
rather than later. [ID:nN15281293]
 A separate report showed manufacturing in New York State
unexpectedly shrank for the first time since November,
surprising economists who had expected a rise.
 KEYSTONE RESTRICTED
 Macroeconomic conditions and debt fears overshadowed weekly
oil inventory data, which confirmed a much larger than expected
decline in stocks due in large part to a reduction in Midwest
supplies as a key Canadian pipeline shut down. [EIA/S]
 Inventories in Cushing may continue to draw after Canada's
TransCanada Corp  said it was curtailing oil shipments
by 11.5 percent on the 591,000 barrel per day Keystone pipeline
this month as it works on the line's facilities following two
oil spills last month. [ID:nN1546166]
 Capacity on the line will be restricted further to between
400,000 and 450,000 bpd in July while the work is going on, it
said.

 By Alejandro Barbajosa	
 SINGAPORE, June 15 (Reuters) - Oil fell on Wednesday after
euro zone ministers failed to reach agreement on a second
bailout for Greece, while rising gasoline stockpiles in top
consumer the United States signalled fuel demand was stalling.	
 Brent crude for August , which will become the
front-month contract after July expires at the end of Wednesday
trade, shed 20 cents to $119.15 a barrel by 0610 GMT, while July
U.S. crude slipped 45 cents to $98.92. 
 U.S. gasoline inventories rose by 1.1 million barrels last
week, industry group American Petroleum Institute said, their
sixth consecutive gain and in line with forecasts. That
moderated the bullish effect of a drop in crude stockpiles,
which fell 3 million barrels, twice as much as expected.	
 ""We know that gasoline demand is still slow despite falling
prices, so we don't see a very positive side for growth,"" said
Tetsu Emori, a fund manager at Tokyo-based Astmax Co Ltd.	
 ""There's a bit of profit-taking after the price increase
over the past few days. People are also focused on and worrying
about how Europe's sovereign credit issues will be solved.""	
 The dollar gained 0.25 percent against a basket of
currencies after euro zone ministers failed to agree on how
private holders of Greek debt should share the costs of a new
bailout, putting the onus on the leaders of Germany and France
to forge a deal later this week.	
 Nervous markets pushed the bond yields of Greece, Ireland
and Portugal to their highest levels since the introduction of
the euro in 1999. 
 The premium of front-month Brent to U.S. benchmark West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) hovered more than $1 below Tuesday's
record $22.79 a barrel, at around $21.10.	
 
 ECONOMY ENCOURAGES	
 Brent on Tuesday reached a five-week high and U.S. crude
rose more than 2 percent as data from top oil consumers the
United States and China eased concerns about the global economy
and the threat to oil demand.	
 While U.S. retail sales fell in May for the first time in 11
months, the slip was less than expected. Producer prices rose
less than expected, braking sharply from April. 
 U.S. retail gasoline demand climbed slightly last week from
a year earlier, by 0.2 percent, a second consecutive rise as
pump prices continue to ease, a report by MasterCard Advisors'
SpendingPulse showed on Tuesday. 
 Gasoline demand broke a near two-month long slump in the
first week of June with data that included the Memorial Day
weekend, marking the start of the summer driving season, showing
demand rising 0.5 percent from a year ago.	
 But over the latest four weeks, average U.S. gasoline
consumption was down 1 percent from year-earlier levels.	
 Government data on U.S. oil inventories and demand follows
from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.	
 China's implied oil demand in May topped the 9 million
barrel-per-day mark for the seventh consecutive month, taken as
another signal that a tap on the economic brake by authorities
had not hurt demand for petroleum.	
 But Reuters calculations based on preliminary government
data did show that while May oil demand was up versus the
year-ago period, the growth rate slowed to its lowest since
October and demand slipped sightly from April. 
 European crude benchmark Brent's premium to Middle East
marker Dubai rose to its highest level since 2004 for a second
straight day, as the imbalance between undersupplied light sweet
grades and abundant heavy sour supplies grows with increasing
output from Saudi Arabia. 
 The Brent/Dubai Exchange of Futures for Swaps (EFS) for July
jumped 85 cents to $8.85 a barrel at 0400 GMT, Reuters data
showed, after peaking at $9.20 earlier on Tuesday.	
 Saudi Arabia's crude output is expected to jump to nearly 10
million barrels per day (bpd) in June, industry sources said on
Tuesday. 
 In the weeks leading up to last week's failed OPEC meeting,
U.S. and Saudi Arabian officials met to discuss surprising the
market with an unprecedented arrangement: exchanging
urgently-needed high-quality crude oil stored in the U.S.
emergency reserve for heavier, low-quality oil from Saudi
Arabia, according to people familiar with the plan.

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, June 15 (Reuters) - Gold rose further on
Wednesday on inflation fears ignited by recent strong Chinese
economic data, lingering worries over debt problems in Europe
and the United States, as well as firm equities. 
 Although the long-term outlook remains positive, gold is
still struggling to breach $1,550, a peak touched last week,
while physical buying subsided after gold snapped a two-day
losing streak in the previous session. 
 Spot gold added $1.53 an ounce to $1,524.78 an ounce
by 0608 GMT, extending Tuesday's gains after data in China
showed inflation was running at its fastest pace in almost three
years and U.S. retail sales fell less than forecast. 
 Gold is well below a lifetime high around $1,575 touched in
early May.	
 ""There's not much to say. On the upside, there is still a
resistance to break at around $1,550. The market may test $1,500
again if it closes below $1,512,"" said Ronald Leung, director of
Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.	
 ""I think the market is watching the end of QE2 this month."" 
 Financial markets are bracing for the conclusion at the end
of June of the U.S. Federal Reserve's quantitative easing, a
cheap-money policy credited with boosting stocks but blamed for
sky-high commodities prices and a weak dollar. 
 Inflation was still a concern in China, the world's
second-largest economy, after consumer prices rose at their
fastest pace in almost three years in May, but industrial output
grew from a year ago, in line with forecasts. 
 ""Near-term pressure will be applied by Monday's break in
gold of $1,528 support and by the ongoing pricing in of economic
weakness,"" said Tom Pawlicki, precious metals and energy analyst
at MF Global.	
 ""We don't see too much weakness still in store for gold,
however, as support will be offered by the possibility that
economic weakness remains simply a 'sub-par recovery', from a
lack of progress on debt ceiling negotiations, safe-haven demand
stemming from Greece, and from potentially higher Chinese
commodity demand.""	
 China's gold production this year is expected to rise more
than 10 percent in 2011 from last year, as nagging political and
economic uncertainties persist, a China Gold Association
official said on Wednesday. 
 Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the United States could lose
its coveted AAA credit rating and the dollar's special status as
a reserve currency could be damaged if there was no quick
resolution to the political battle over raising the $14.3
trillion debt limit. 
 In Europe, euro zone ministers failed to reach agreement on
how private holders of Greek debt should share the costs of a
new bailout, putting the onus on the leaders of Germany and
France to forge a deal later this week. 
 Greece became the lowest-rated country in the world on the
scale used by Standard & Poor's, which downgraded it this week
to eight notches below junk status. [ID:nN13126859	
 Silver was steady at $35.37 an ounce, below a
record at $49.51 an ounce in April.	
 Holdings of the largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund
(ETF), New York's iShares Silver Trust , fell 0.44 percent
from Monday to Tuesday, while the largest gold-backed ETF, New
York's SPDR Gold Trust remained unchanged for the same
period. 
 In other markets, the euro came under pressure as markets
refocused on the euro zone's debt problems after Moody's
threatened large French banks with possible downgrades, while
the Nikkei ended higher on U.S. retail sales figures that
were not as bad as expected. 
 U.S. stocks posted their biggest gains in nearly two months
on Tuesday as retail sales figures allayed fears over the
economy that had driven a six-week slump in the market.

 NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Tuesday,
snapping a two-day losing streak, boosted by simmering
inflation pressures in China and sharp gains in industrial
commodities amid better-than-expected U.S. retail sales.
 Underlying economic uncertainties also supported silver's
over 2 percent gains, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke warned that a failure to lift the U.S. debt ceiling
risks a potentially disastrous loss of confidence in America's
creditworthiness.
 Data in China, the world's second-largest economy, showed
the pace of inflation was running at its fastest pace in almost
three years, while a less-than-expected drop in U.S. retail
sales lifted the S&P 500 index by 1.5 percent.
 ""The worse fears of the economic data has been discounted.
There is more risk appetite out there, and some of that money
is flowing into the precious metals,"" said Bill O'Neill,
partner of commodities investment firm LOGIC Advisors.
 Spot gold  was up 0.6 percent at $1,524.40 an ounce
by 2:55 p.m. EDT (1855 GMT), after it suffered its biggest
one-day loss in a month.
 U.S. August contract  settled up $8.80 at $1,524.40
an ounce, after trading between $1,512.80 and $1,526.70. Volume
was half of its 30-day average, consistent with lower recent
volume.
 Gold is up 3 percent in the past four weeks on a flurry of
disappointing U.S. economic data including a weak jobs report.
 Spot silver  recovered from Monday's 4-percent slide,
and was up 2.4 percent at $35.52 an ounce.
 On charts, silver's outlook turned bullish after it rose
above key support near $34 an ounce, after the metal recently
failed to regain its 55-day moving average twice in the $39
area, CitiFX analysts said. (Graphic:

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, June 14 (Reuters) - Gold rebounded on Tuesday
after posting its biggest one-day loss in a month in the
previous session on growing worries about another global
economic downturn, but a weaker U.S. dollar and bargain hunting
by jewellers offered support. 
 While industrial metals priced in expectations of a cooling
Chinese economy, dealers see no change in China's appetite for
bullion. Investors were awaiting a trail of U.S. data later in
the day which could set the tone for commodities.	
 Gold added $6.26 to $1,520.99 an ounce by 0606 GMT,
snapping a two-day drop. Gold, which hit a record around $1,575
in early May, has been buoyed by uncertainties about the outlook
for the U.S. economy and worries about euro zone debt.	
 ""I would say gold is still bullish. The main factors are
still going back to the monetary policy of the U.S. and the
longer-term weakness of the dollar. That could boost gold prices
and help it head towards a new record later this year,"" said a
dealer in Singapore. 
 ""The demand for gold in China is going to come pretty robust
this year. Despite the slowing economic growth, I think the
Chinese will continue to consume quite a bit of gold,"" he said.	
 China's inflation accelerated in May to a 34-month high of
5.5 percent, supporting the case for a tightening in monetary
policy as soon as this month even as there are signs that
economic growth is slowing down. 
 But Chinese demand for gold bars and coins as private
investments could push bullion imports above 400 tonnes in 2011,
triggered by concerns about inflation and poor returns in stocks
and the property sector. 
 The United States will release key data on Tuesday,
including retail and auto sales, and producer prices, which the
market will scour for clues to the magnitude and duration of the
slowdown in the world's largest economy. 
 U.S. economic growth could remain soft for some time but
monetary policy may not be able to address the problem, Richmond
Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said.

 Gold's recent fall spurred activity in the physical sector. 
 ""We're seeing a little bit of physical buying. It's from
jewellery makers,"" said Ronald Leung, director of Lee Cheong
Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.	
 ""I think we can say gold will try the lower end first, and
then maybe $1,480 should be a good support. Starting in August
or September, there may be room to go up again."" 
Swiss franc held near a record high against the euro
, benefiting from lingering European debt crisis and
being viewed as one of the few major currencies not suffering
from debt troubles or the currency debasement of quantitative
easing. 
 On Monday, Standard & Poor's slashed Greece's rating to CCC,
making the highly-indebted country its lowest-rated in the
world. S&P said European policymakers look increasingly likely
to impose a restructuring of Greece's debt. 
""Now that the euro zone has its problems, the U.S.
has its budget deficit, I think Swiss franc is one of the safe
havens that investors would look towards. But I would not see
Swiss franc as competing with gold per se,"" said the dealer in
Singapore.	
 ""It would be competing with other currencies."" 
 The dollar index , which tracks its performance
against a basket of major currencies, was down a smidgen at
74.488, off a two-week high of 74.960 struck the previous day. 
 Silver , which usually tracks gold, rose 40 cents to
$35.09 an ounce, below a record at $49.51 an ounce hit in April.	
 Holdings of the largest silver-backed exchange-traded-fund
(ETF), New York's iShares Silver Trust , fell 2.1 percent
from Friday to Monday, while the largest gold-backed ETF, New
York's SPDR Gold Trust saw its holdings dip 0.08 percent
during the same period. 
 In the energy market, oil rebounded after China said
industrial production grew at a faster-than-expected pace in
May, easing concerns over a global economic slowdown and
soothing worries that Europe's debt crisis would dent energy
demand.

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, June 14 (Reuters) - Gold rebounded on Tuesday
after posting its biggest one-day loss in a month in the
previous session on growing worries about another global
economic downturn, but a weaker U.S. dollar and bargain hunting
by jewellers offered support. 
 While signs of a cooling Chinese economy could weigh on
industrial metals, dealers expect no change in China's appetite
for bullion. Investors were also awaiting a trail of U.S. data
later in the day which could set the tone for commodities.	
 Gold added $4.40 to $1,519.13 an ounce by 0319 GMT
after falling on Monday to its weakest since late May. Gold,
which hit a record around $1,575 in early May, has been buoyed
by uncertainties about the outlook for the U.S. economy and
worries about euro zone debt.	
 ""I would say gold is still bullish. The main factors are
still going back to the monetary policy of the U.S. and the
longer-term weakness of the dollar. That could boost gold prices
and help it head towards a new record later this year,"" said a
dealer in Singapore. 
 ""The demand for gold in China is going to come pretty robust
this year. Despite the slowing economic growth, I think the
Chinese will continue to consume quite a bit of gold,"" he said.	
 China's consumer price inflation accelerated to a 34-month
high of 5.5 percent in the year to May from 5.3 percent in
April, fueling fears of further tightening and adding to risks
for global growth. 
 But Chinese demand for gold bars and coins as private
investments could push bullion imports above 400 tonnes in 2011,
triggered by concerns about inflation and poor returns in the
stocks and property sectors. 
 The United States will release key data on Tuesday,
including retail and auto sales, and producer prices, which the
market will scour for clues to the magnitude and duration of the
slowdown in the world's largest economy.

 The euro fell to a record low against the Swiss franc as
investors sought safety on worries about a possible Greek debt
default, while concerns about the faltering U.S. economy and
slowing Chinese growth kept prices across markets under
pressure.

 By Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Brent reached its highest in
more than five weeks on Tuesday and U.S. crude rose more than 2
percent as data from China and the United States eased concerns
about the global economy and the threat to oil demand.
 China's industrial output in May beat market expectations
with a 13.3 percent jump from a year earlier, though it slipped
slightly from April. Inflation hit a 34-month high of 5.5
percent, but investors shrugged off another bank reserve hike
by China's central bank. [ID:nB9E7GG00R] [ID:nL3E7HE1HL]
 While U.S. retail sales fell in May for the first time in
11 months, the slip was less than expected. Producer prices
rose less than expected, braking sharply from April.
[ID:nN14189765]
 Brent outpaced its U.S. counterpart in early trading and
pushed the discount to Brent  to a record above $22
a barrel, before reversing. Sweet crude supply disruptions in
Libya and Nigeria and tight North Sea cargo availabilities have
helped keep Brent elevated. [ID:nLDE75D1ER] [ID:nN13138163]
 Brent crude for July delivery  rose $1.06 to settle
at $120.16 a barrel, its highest close since May 4, the day
before it sank more than $10 in an unprecedented correction.
 U.S. July crude  gained $2.07 to settle at $99.37 a
barrel, rebounding from an early $96.51 low.
 Crude trading volumes were mixed, with Brent volumes 23
percent above its 30-day average, while U.S. volumes were 10
percent under.
 ""There's a feeling that U.S. economic data will start to
get better next month, and if you look at the retail sales
data, if you take (out) autos, which were hit by the earthquake
in Japan, they were actually up 0.3 percent,"" said Amrita Sen,
oil analyst at Barclays Capital.
 Adding to the positive sentiment in oil markets, the
economic reports helped lift U.S. stocks more than 1 percent,
drawing investors into an equities market that has had six
straight weekly declines. [.N]
 A weak dollar <.DXY> also lent support to
dollar-denominated oil prices as the euro and high-yielding
currencies were boosted by improved risk appetite after the
Chinese data eased global growth concerns. [USD/]
 ""Today's sharp price advance appeared heavily influenced by
financial drivers that included a further weakening in the
dollar and pop of almost 1-1/2 percent in the (Dow
Industrials),"" Jim Ritterbusch, president at Ritterbusch &
Associates in Galena, Illinois, said in a note.
 U.S. gasoline  futures rallied back above $3 a gallon
and heating oil  futures also settled higher.
 Lower retail prices attracted U.S. buyers, pushing demand
up last week compared to the previous week and the year-ago
period, according to a report from MasterCard. [ID:nN14226484]
 CHINA'S OIL DEMAND
 China's implied oil demand in May topped the 9 million
barrel-per-day mark for the seventh consecutive month, taken as
another signal that a tap on the economic brake by authorities
had not hurt demand for petroleum.
 But Reuters calculations based on preliminary government
data did show that while May oil demand was up versus the
year-ago period, the growth rate slowed to its lowest since
October and demand slipped sightly from April. [ID:nL3E7HE0E4]
 Copper prices rose to their highest in a week after the
U.S. data consolidated gains made on the Chinese data. [MET/L]
 U.S. OIL INVENTORIES
 U.S. crude oil stocks fell 3 million barrels last week,
with stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, oil hub falling 1.7
million barrels, according to a report from industry group
American Petroleum Institute released late on Tuesday. [API/S]
 Gasoline stocks rose 1.1 million barrels, distillate stocks
slipped 426,000 barrels and refinery capacity use eased 0.2
percentage point to 84.5 percent, the API data showed.
 Crude prices extended gains slightly in post-settlement
trading after the report. [ID:nN14236060]
 Crude stocks were expected to have fallen 1.5 million
barrels last week, according to a Reuters survey of analysts
ahead of the API report. Total distillate stocks and gasoline
inventories were expected to have increased by 1 million
barrels. [EIA/S]
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration's inventory
report will follow at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday.

in May, easing concerns over a global economic slowdown and

 Brent crude for July  climbed 21 cents to $119.31 a

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to a record of more than $22 a
barrel. July WTI  shed 6 cents to $97.24. 
 China's industrial output jumped 13.3 percent from a year
earlier, topping forecasts for a 13.2 percent gain, government
data showed on Tuesday. Consumer price inflation accelerated to
a 34-month high, signaling Beijing may continue to tighten
monetary policy. 
 ""China is still ticking along nicely,"" said Ben Le Brun, an
analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.	
 ""The government needs to tread a very fine line because the
economy is still very hot. They may have to tighten again and
that will have some effect on growth and a disruptive influence

 Brent had fallen as much as 0.5 percent before the release

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - Gold fell 1 percent on Monday
for its biggest one-day loss in over a month, succumbing to
selling that hit most commodities on worries over economic
growth and a European debt crisis. 
 Safe-haven buying was absent for precious metals despite a
downgrade of Greece's credit rating. Silver tumbled over 4
percent, marking its biggest two-day drop in a month.
 ""Gold is on the risk-on trade, and that obviously is
getting pummeled here. People look across their portfolio and
see gold, metals and energy as all the same trade,"" said Bob
Haber, chief investment officer of Haber Trilix in Boston, who
manages $2 billion in assets.
 Oil fell as much as $3 and U.S. equities also pared initial
gains.
 Spot gold  was down 1.1 percent at $1,514.05 an ounce
by 3:07 p.m. EDT (1906 GMT), its biggest one-day drop in five
weeks. It hit a session low of $1,511.11, its weakest since May
23.
 U.S. August contract  settled down $13.60 at
$1,515.60 an ounce, after trading in a range between $1,511.40
and $1,533.90 an ounce. Volume was around 110,000 lots, about
half of its 30-day average, consistent with below-average
turnover in recent weeks.
 TECHNICALS IN FOCUS
 Technical selling also weighed on prices after bullion fell
below its 20-day moving average, a level it held for the past
three weeks. Gold appears to find support after bouncing off
its 50-day moving average at $1,507 an ounce. (Graphic of gold
vs 20-day MA: http://r.reuters.com/peb22s)
 Scott Meyers, senior analyst at Pioneer Futures, a unit of
futures broker MF Global said Monday's U.S. gold settlement
below recent lows near $1,520 could be the first sign of
potential price softening but should not be viewed as an
outright bear signal.
 Adam Hewison, president of MarketClub.com, said that gold
could bounce in an area near $1,517 and $1,507 an ounce,
representing the 50 percent and 62 percent Fibonacci
retracement levels from a high of $1,553 on June 6.
 Fibonacci retracement levels are used by technical analysts
to find potential support on charts.
 Bullion extended losses from Friday when it came under
pressure as the dollar rallied and Wall Street resumed its
slide following weaker Chinese trade data.
 The metal snapped a three-week winning streak last week,
but it is up 3 percent in the past four weeks on a string of
bleak U.S. economic data including a weak jobs report.
 Spot silver  fell 3.9 percent to $34.71 an ounce.
 Crude oil and equities prices weakened further after
Standard & Poor's cut Greece's credit ratings by three notches,
saying the country is increasingly likely to restructure its
debt in a way the ratings agency would consider a default.
[ID:nN13126859]
 Credit Suisse said in a note that the lingering discussion
about the fiscal situation across developed economies should
additionally promote gold's role as a store of value.
""Gold is suffering from liquidation of risk assets and it's
going to face pressure of profit-taking, but the fundamental
story that keeps people investing in gold is still in place,""
said Sean McGillivray, head of asset allocation for Great
Pacific Wealth Management.
 Among platinum group metals, platinum  was down 1.4
percent at $1,799 and palladium  fell 1.9 percent to
$794.25.

 NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - Brent edged up while U.S.
crude fell on Monday in volatile trading after a downgrade of
Greece's credit rating fed jitters about economic growth and
oil supply interruptions buffeted energy markets.
 Brent pared gains and briefly turned lower, while U.S.
crude extended losses after Standard & Poor's Ratings Services
cut its long-term sovereign credit ratings on Greece and put
the outlook at negative. [ID:nN13126859] [ID:nN13184836]
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude  rose more than $2
to a record above $21 a barrel. The gap set a series of record
highs last week as traders pointed to prolonged loss of Libyan
output and curbed supplies of North Sea Forties crude.
 A fresh catalyst emerged on Monday when Royal Dutch Shell
 declared force majeure on its Nigerian Bonny Light
crude oil loadings for June and July. Shell blamed production
cutbacks caused by leaks and fires on its Trans-Niger Pipeline.
[ID:nLDE75C14Q]
 Concern about slower economic growth had pressured U.S.
crude even before the Greece ratings downgrade. Ample domestic
inventories, especially at the Cushing, Oklahoma, oil hub, also
have weighed on U.S. crude prices.
 Brent crude for July delivery  rose 38 cents to
settle at $119.10 a barrel, off its session peak of $120.25, a
five-week high.
 U.S. July crude  fell $1.99 to settle at $97.30 a
barrel, having slumped as low as $96.13, nearing its 150-day
moving average and the lowest intraday price since May 20.
 U.S. refined products ended mixed. Both heating oil 
and gasoline  got an early lift from the strong Brent
contract, which has pushed U.S. domestic sweets like Light
Louisiana Sweet  to big differentials above the benchmark
U.S. light sweet crude contract. [ID:nN13110417]
 ""Fundamentally, the market is still expressing concerns
over weak U.S. macroeconomic guidance ...,"" Jim Ritterbusch,
president at Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena Illinois, said
in a note.
 U.S. equities also ended mixed. Stocks found some support
when investors hunted bargains following six straight weekly
declines, but the Greece ratings news pushed equities lower
intraday. [.N]
 The dollar index <.DXY> was weaker and the greenback fell
against the euro even as Europe's single currency fell to a
record low against the Swiss franc, as worries about Greece
boosted the safe-haven allure of the franc. [USD/]
 SUPPLY THREATS LIFT BRENT
 ""While in the short term, markets appear well supplied, the
current very high Brent prices reflect rising geopolitical risk
and possible tensions on world supply-demand balances in the
future,"" said Christophe Barret, global oil analyst with Credit
Agricole.
 Libya's civil war has shut most production, estimated at
around 1.6 million barrels per day ahead of the current
conflict, since February.
 In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia's neighbor Yemen remains
in turmoil. Efforts to broker an exit for Yemen President Ali
Abudullah Saleh after months of protests and a round of open
warfare in the capital were deadlocked. [ID:nLDE75C11L]
 Syria continues to react violently to dissent and the White
House on Monday said it condemned in the ""strongest possible
terms"" the latest violence by the Syrian government in its
crackdown on pro-democracy protests. [ID:nWEN4258]

436,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2011 12:20AM ET</span>","Oil dips as investors eye U.S. economy, Saudi output"," * WTI discount to Brent near record $20 a barrel
 * Prices fall on concern global economic recovery slowing
 * Investor attention to focus on U.S. economic data

 By Alejandro Barbajosa	
 Singapore, June 13 - Oil edged lower on Monday, with Brent
below $119, as growing investor concern about a slowdown in the
United States and other industrialised economies combined with
expectations that top exporter Saudi Arabia would increase
output.	
 Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly fell in April,
government data showed, adding to doubts about the pace of
global economic recovery as the Federal Reserve's $600 billion
bond purchase program expires this month. 
 Brent crude for July  slipped 20 cents to $118.58 a
barrel by 0339 GMT, while U.S. crude shed 35 cents to $98.94,
trading close to a record discount of almost $20 to the European
benchmark as a glut in the U.S. Midwest persists.	
 Saudi Arabia will raise output to 10 million barrels per day
(bpd) in July, Saudi newspaper al-Hayat reported on Friday, as
Riyadh goes it alone to pump more outside official OPEC policy,
aiming to place additional supplies among Asian buyers.	
 ""Saudi Arabia is going to attempt to increase oil production
and there are ongoing concerns about a global economic
slowdown,"" said Serene Lim, an oil analyst at ANZ in Singapore.	
 ""If we continue seeing U.S. economic releases painting a
weak picture, it's something to watch out for. Today risk
aversion is just flowing over from Friday."" U. S. crude shed 2.6
percent in Friday's session.

 
 Asian stocks extended a seven-week losing streak and the
dollar gained more than 0.1 percent against a basket of
currencies, as European powers haggle over a fresh rescue
package for Greece. 
 The ""money manager"" speculator group cut its net long
position on U.S. crude futures and options by 33,466 contracts
to 190,974 in the week to June 7 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on
Friday. 
 U.S. producer prices and retail sales data on Tuesday would
provide a cue for prices, followed by industrial production and
housing statistics due later in the week. 
 Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia has offered more crude to
Asian refiners in July, evidence that it is taking steps to
unilaterally increase supplies after OPEC talks collapsed last
week. 
 But Iran's OPEC governor said over the weekend an increase
in crude output by the Saudis would not change market conditions
as demand is for lighter oil than the kingdom provides,
reiterating Tehran's stance there was no need to boost
production. 
 Continuing unrest in the Middle East and North Africa kept a
floor under prices.	
 Rebels fighting against Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
launched an offensive on Sunday to retake the oil town of Brega
but were repelled in a battle which killed at least four
fighters, rebels and doctors said. 
 The United Arab Emirates said on Sunday it had recognised
Libyan rebels as the sole legitimate representative of the
Libyan people, the state news agency reported, becoming the
second Arab state to take such a move. 
 ""The fact that over the weekend we saw some of the rebels
fighting against Gadaffi forces and in Syria there are fears
that it might slide into civil war will continue to support oil
prices,"" Lim said.	
 The main Syrian activist group organising protests said on
Sunday a violent crackdown had killed 1,300 civilians and called
on President Bashar al-Assad to step down to transform the
country into a democracy. 
 In Yemen, talks to resolve the country's political crisis
have failed after the deputy to wounded President Ali Abdullah
Saleh refused to speak with groups demanding he cede power
immediately, opposition figures said.

 SINGAPORE, June 13 (Reuters) - Gold gave up early gains on Monday
despite a rebound in the euro against the U.S. dollar, lacking
impetus to surpass recent peaks and sustain an uptrend fuelled
largely by a debt crisis in Europe.	
 The physical market was deserted as jewellers were unsure about
direction after bullion fell almost 1 percent on Friday for its
biggest one-day decline in a month, squeezed by a rally in the dollar
and declines in other commodities. 
 Spot gold fell $1.13 to $1,529.90 an ounce by 0620 GMT
after rising as high as $1,532.56 an ounce, still well below a
lifetime high around $1,575 struck in May. 
 Newmont Mining Corp , the world's No.2 gold producer, sees
prices for the precious metal rising to $1,600 this year and above
that next year, on growing demand from Asia's burgeoning middle
class. [ID:nJKB004560	
 ""I think it is still looking for sufficient momentum and a
catalyst that's needed for it to break the $1,550 level on a
sustained basis,"" said Ong Yi Ling, investment analyst at Phillip
Futures in Singapore.	
 ""I am still looking for gold to be supported above the $1,500
level. I think we are still seeing safe-haven flows and the Greece
debt crisis. These are still factors that will continue to underpin
gold."" 
 Support for gold was seen at its 20-day moving average of $1,524,
a level it has held for the past three weeks.



 The euro edged up against the dollar on Monday on short covering
following its slide on European haggling over a second Greek bailout
and reduced expectations for euro zone rate hikes. 
 Investors will also wait for a batch of U.S. data such as
manufacturing activity reports this week for clues on whether the
surprisingly weak U.S. employment data for May was an aberration or
the start of a trend. 
 ""If we see the dollar continue to strengthen, then it could cause
some pressure on commodities as well as for gold,"" said Ong at
Phillip Futures.	
 ""This week, I think we'll also be seeing some data like the
retail sales figures that will be pretty important for financial
markets."" 
 The euro regained strength after falling by nearly 2 percent last
week, its worst weekly performance since mid-May, but the gains could
be short-lived, as disputes among policymakers cast a shadow over a
meeting next week where euro zone leaders will finalise a new rescue
package for Greece. 
 ""People hope the market will test the lower levels, that's why
it's pretty quiet,"" said a physical dealer in Singapore. 
 ""You don't see people rushing to get physical gold. I am still
offering gold bars at premiums of 60 to 80 cents,"" he added.	
 The bullion market in top consumer India was also slow as the
monsoon progresses. The monsoon period is a seasonally slack one for
gold demand and jewellers are expected to replenish stocks ahead of
September, when festivals and weddings restart.	
 U.S. gold  edged up $2.3 to $1,530.90 an ounce.	
 In other markets, the Nikkei lost ground after a surprise fall in
Japanese machinery orders, while oil fell as growing investor concern
about a slowdown in the United States and other industrialised
economies combined with rising oil output from top exporter Saudi
Arabia.

 NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - Gold fell almost 1 percent on
Friday for its biggest one-day decline in a month, as a dollar
rally coupled with losses in crude oil and commodities prompted
investors to sell ahead of the weekend.
 Bullion also came under liquidation pressure as Wall Street
resumed its slide following weaker Chinese trade data, and the
euro tumbled more than 1 percent as fears over Greece's debt
returned to the forefront. [.N] [FRX/]
 ""Precious metals are being lumped into the commodity basket
today. There is risk-off selling, and anything in the
commodities complex is getting clobbered,"" said Mark Luschini,
chief investment strategist at financial services firm Janney
Montgomery Scott, which manages $54 billion in assets.
 Spot gold  fell to a one-week low at $1,525.74 an
ounce and was down 0.7 percent at $1,532.14 by 2:35 p.m. EDT
(1835 GMT).
 The metal was down 0.5 percent for the week, poised to snap
a three-week winning streak. Despite Friday's loss, the metal
is up 5 percent in the past five weeks on a string of bleak
U.S. economic data including a weak jobs report last week.
 U.S. gold futures for August delivery  settled down
$13.50 at $1,529.20, after trading between $1,526.70 and
$1,546.50.
 COMEX gold futures volume was around 125,000 lots, the
highest this week but 40 percent below its 30-day average.
Volume has been lackluster since last week, with bullion prices
largely rangebound.
 Analysts said gold could extend its slide if prices fell
below key support at its 20-day moving average of $1,524, a
level it has held for the past three weeks.
 (Graphic: http://link.reuters.com/sew99r )
 Sterling-priced gold , meanwhile, rose to a
record 951.78 pounds an ounce as the underlying price of the
precious metal remained supported while sterling fell after
disappointing UK industrial output data.
 Talk of large-scale, official-sector selling of gold
earlier in the session, which proved unfounded, accelerated the
drop in the yellow metal, traders said.
 Silver  slid 3.2 percent to $36.32 an ounce, sending
the gold/silver ratio -- the number of silver ounces needed to
buy an ounce of gold -- to above 42. Since May, it has steadied
between 40 and 45 after hitting 28-year lows below 32 in
April.
 WEAK ECONOMIC DATA IN FOCUS
 China's appetite for overseas copper supplies remained
sickly and iron ore buying showed signs of ending a strong run,
and that weighed heavily on equities and commodities across the
board, Janney's Luschini said. [ID:nL3E7HA1N4]
 ""In the shorter term, the weaker economic numbers set up
liquidation of assets, even as it is bullish longer-term
because the (U.S.) government is expected to do more stimulus,""
said Frank McGhee, head precious metals trader at Integrated
Brokerage Services.
 Support from inflation concerns after U.S. import prices
rose for an eighth straight month in May was offset by a
lackluster performance in the S&P and a $3 drop in U.S. crude
futures after top exporter Saudi Arabia said it was offering
more oil to Asian customers. [ID:nN10176553] [O/R]
 While gold is on the defensive, persistently low interest
rates, concerns over euro zone debt and a weak outlook for the
U.S. economy count in its favor longer-term, analysts said.
 The end of a $600 billion U.S. government bond-buying
program, or the second round of quantitative easing, this month
is also fueling economic worries.
 The flood of Federal Reserve money that has supported Wall
Street and the rest of the U.S. economy for 2-1/2 years will
shrink to a trickle with the conclusion of the Fed's bond
purchases on Friday. [ID:nN10227269]
 Platinum group metals fell with the commodities complex.
The metals, chiefly used in autocatalysts, are expected to firm
this year as car sales improve, but prices will be sensitive to
signs the auto industry is continuing to struggle.
 Platinum  was down 0.6 percent at $1,825.99 an ounce,
while palladium  slipped 0.1 percent to $812.47.

 Crude trading volumes were on pace to surpass 30-day
averages, with an hour left in post-settlement trading.
 SAUDIS OFFER OIL
 ""Saudi Arabia is offering oil even though OPEC didn't have
an agreement on production,"" said Hamza Khan, analyst at the
Schork Group in Villanova, Pennsylvania.
 ""And oil is reacting to a stronger dollar and weaker stock
market, a reversal after the weak dollar and an equities bounce
helped push oil higher on Thursday,"" Khan added.
 Oil prices were pressured early on Friday by news Saudi
Arabia is offering more crude to Asian refiners for July,
according to industry sources.
 The news was evidence Saudi Arabia was unilaterally raising
supplies after OPEC's Wednesday meeting did not produce an
agreement to boost output targets. [ID:nL3E7HA01L]
 The kingdom also intends to boost production in July to 10
million barrels per day (bpd) from 8.8 million bpd in May,
according to al-Hayat newspaper. [ID:nLDE7590YT]
 OPEC forecast a tightening world oil market in 2011. In its
monthly report, OPEC said world demand for its crude oil would
average 30.7 million bpd in the second half of 2011, much more
than the 28.97 million bpd OPEC produced in May. [ID:nWLA2285]
 CHINA'S EXPORT GROWTH SLOWS
 China's smaller-than-expected trade surplus in May had some
oil analysts and traders wary of slowing growth in the world's
No. 2 oil consumer, even as crude imports in May rose slightly
versus April and were up 20 percent from the year-ago period.
[ID:nL3E7HA0B2] [ID:nL3E7HA0E8]
 Copper prices also were pressured by the China trade data.
Imports of the key industrial metal slowed in May. [MET/L]
 Oil's price slip came even as Libya's turmoil and unrest in
Syria and Saudi Arabia's neighbor Yemen continued.
 Anti-government protesters in Yemen pressed for the removal
of wounded President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is in Saudi Arabia
for medical treatment, while loyalists urged his return.

 SINGAPORE, June 10 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose to $120 a
barrel for the first time in five weeks, while U.S. oil climbed
above $102 a barrel, on better-than-expected data from top
consumer United States and supply worries triggered by OPEC's
failure to agree on an output hike.	
 A softer dollar against a basket of currencies and political
tensions in the Gulf also supported oil prices. 
 ICE Brent for July delivery  rose 31 cents to $119.88
a barrel at 0354 GMT, after touching $120.07 earlier -- highest
since May 5. U.S. crude  was flat at $101.91 a barrel,
after hitting a high of $102.15. 
 ""The better-than-expected U.S. trade deficit results boosted
not only the U.S. equities but commodities as well,"" said
Singapore-based oil analyst Serene Lim of ANZ Bank. ""The
positive sentiment continued into Asia's morning trades."" 
 A Commerce Department report showed the U.S. trade deficit
narrowed unexpectedly in April as exports hit a new high and
imports from Japan tumbled more than 25 percent after its
earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster. 
 The trade gap narrowed 6.7 percent from March to $43.7
billion even though oil prices hit their highest level since
September 2008. The data suggested stronger second-quarter
economic growth than economists had expected.	
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
failing to make a decision on output could continue to buoy
prices in the short-haul, Lim said. 
 ""A lack of consensus on the production quota among the OPEC
members could lead to a decline in spare capacity,"" added Lim.

 OPEC met on Wednesday and for the first time in about a
decade failed to agree on output policy. 
 Numbers compiled at the OPEC headquarters in Vienna had
implied the market needed around 2 million barrels per day (bpd)
more oil for the third quarter of this year and 1.5 million bpd
for the fourth quarter, OPEC Secretary General Abdullah al-Badri
told a World Economic Forum conference. 
 But he said some of the 12 members of OPEC had different
numbers and were unable to agree on any need for more oil, even
though oil prices are trading far above $100 a barrel.

 Technical charts indicate an end in rebound for both Brent
and U.S. oil, according to Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.
Brent may end its current rebound at $121 while U.S. crude may
end it at $103. 
 
 
 POLITICAL TENSIONS CONTINUE	
 The political tension in Libya, Syria and Yemen continued to
keep support oil prices. 
 NATO warplanes pummeled a town west of Libya's capital,
state media said soon after Western and Arab powers promised
more than $1 billion to help rebels fighting to end Muammar
Gaddafi's four-decade rule. 
 U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said talks were
under way with people close to Gaddafi that had raised the
""potential"" for a transition of power without giving details.	
 But there was frustration among the rebel leadership despite
securing new aid commitments from France, Italy and Turkey. 
 In Syria, thousands of Syrians fled into Turkey fearing a
military assault, officials said, as the country braced for more
violent protests against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad.

 The latest reports of a government crackdown intensified
international concerns over Syria's handling of pro-democracy
protests, inspired by uprisings across the Arab world.	
 Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh, 69, was burned on 40
percent of his body in a rocket or bomb attack at his palace
last Friday -- injuries which, depending on the depth of wounds,
could be fatal and would probably curb his ability to rule, said
U.S. and Yemeni officials. 
 
 CHINA DATA 
 Data on Friday showed China's exports grew 19.4 percent in
May from a year earlier, while imports surged 28.4 percent, the
customs agency said. 
 That left the country with a trade surplus of $13.1 billion
in May, compared with $11.4 billion in April, squashing earlier
concerns of a possible negative data where China's exports
growth could moderate in May. 
 China, the world's second-largest crude buyer, imported
21.55 million tonnes of crude oil in May, compared with 21.54
million tonnes in the previous month.	
 Crude oil imports rose 20.7 percent from a year earlier to
5.07 million barrels per day in May.

 SINGAPORE, June 10 (Reuters) - Spot gold ticked lower on
Friday under the weight of a slightly higher dollar, but worries
about the ongoing debt crisis in the euro zone are likely to
keep sentiment in gold market underpinned.	
 Platinum group metals built on recent gains, supported by
the outlook for demand recovery from the automobile industry
after the Japan earthquake as well as a potential supply
disruption in South Africa.	
 The European Central Bank on Thursday signalled a July rate
hike as expected, but raised the stakes in its stand-off with
governments over a new bailout for Greece by rejecting any form
of debt restructure. 
 The euro struggled to retain its footing as fears on
Greece's debt problems dominated, while the dollar edged higher
against a basket of currencies . 
 the lack of an immediate solution for Greece's debt crisis
is likely to keep gold sentiment underpinned, as investors seek
a safe haven in bullion during times of economic and political
uncertainty.	
 Investors are also waiting for cues from the U.S. Federal
Reserve on whether it would employ further stimulus measures
after the expiration of the $600 billion bond buying programme
this month, after recent data showed signs of stalling growth.	
 Spot gold traded in a range of about $5, and was
quoted at $1,541.39 by 0526 GMT, down 0.1 percent from the
previous close. It was on course for a 0.4 percent gain from a
week earlier.	
 U.S. gold  was flat at $1,542.70.	
 ""Gold is in a consolidation mode,"" said Hou Xinqiang, an
analyst at Jinrui Futures in China. 
 ""We're in the seasonally dull period and gold is facing some
pressure on the chart.""	
 Technical analysis suggested that gold was neutral within
the range between $1,530 and $1,553, said Reuters market analyst
Wang Tao. 
 
 STRONG PGM	
 Spot palladium gained 0.2 percent to $814.72, on
course for a 4 percent rise from a week earlier, leading the
precious metals complex in weekly performance.	
 Platinum was little changed at $1,837.74, headed for
a 1.3 percent weekly gain.	
 Palladium had climbed about 14 percent from a month earlier,
and platinum 4 percent, compared to a 3-percent gain in gold and
7 percent rise in silver.	
 The recovery of Japan's automobile industry has helped
platinum group metals, especially palladium, used in
autocatalysts, to stage the recent winning run.	
 Toyota Motors , the world's largest automaker,
expected to resume full production globally in November and its
Japanese output is expected to recover to 90 percent of levels
seen before the March earthquake. 
 In addition, South Africa is in the midst of wage talks in
mining and related industries, during which the union has
demanded hefty wage increases.	
 ""Potential supply disruption risks continue to lurk in the
background given previous negotiations across the industry have
rarely been free of industrial action,"" said Barclays Capital in
a research note.

 By Gene Ramos
 NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose 1.5 percent
on Thursday, reaching a five-week high as OPEC's surprise
failure to reach a deal on raising output stoked more fears of
leaner supplies later in the year.
 Brent and U.S. crude rose for a third day, part of a broad
commodities rally that saw the global benchmark
Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> rise to its highest level
since the end of May.
 In London, ICE Brent for July delivery  settled at
$119.57, gaining $1.72, the highest close since May 4.
 U.S. crude  closed at $101.93, up $1.19, or 1.2
percent, highest since the end of May.
 ""The OPEC situation actually got prices a little bit
higher. I think it set a change in mentality for a lot of
traders especially after we broke above the consolidation (seen
in recent weeks),"" Mike Zarembski, senior commodities analyst
for OptionsXpress in Chicago.
 A ministerial meeting of OPEC on Wednesday broke down in
acrimony, but Saudi Arabia pledged that it will increase output
despite the disagreement over pumping more oil,
 OPEC estimates show an implied market requirement of about
2 million barrels per day more of oil for the third quarter and
1.5 million bpd for the fourth quarter this year.
[ID:LDE7580JO]
 In earlier trade, crude's gains were limited as the dollar
rose against the euro. The currency moves came after the euro
fell as the European Central Bank kept its 2012 inflation
forecast unchanged, implying that the pace of euro zone
interest rate increases may be slower than the previously
thought. [USD/]
 After trimming gains, the greenback was back up 0.30
percent against a basket of currencies in late trading.
<.DXY>
 MIDEAST CONCERNS
 Oil investors kept close watch of the Middle East and north
Africa, in the face of continued violence in Syria and the
tense situation in Yemen, where protests have mounted over
reports that wounded President Ali Abdullah Saleh would return
soon after medical treatment in Saudi Arabia.
 At the same time, traders weighed news that Libya's rebels
hoped to restart oil production soon and had gained aid pledges
of more than $1.1 billion at a conference of Western and Arab
powers in Abu Dhabi. [ID:LDE7572HC]
 The meeting was convened to focus on what one U.S. official
called the ""end-game"" for Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi as NATO
again stepped up the intensity of air raids on Tripoli.
 Months of unrest in OPEC-member Libya had cut more than 1
million barrels per day of output from the world market.
 Olivier Jakob, an analyst at Petromatrix in Zug, predicted
the West will have removed Gaddafi by the end of the year,
leading to an increase in spare capacity for 2012.
 U.S. TRADE DATA SUPPORTIVE
 Record U.S. exports in April narrowed the U.S. trade
deficit, tempering fears that the economic recovery was
sputtering and eased some worries about oil demand.
 The trade data overshadowed a weekly report showing
first-time claims for jobless benefits edged higher last week.
[ID:nN09117731]
 A 2 percent rebound in U.S. gasoline futures  due to
recent refinery troubles was also supportive for U.S. crude,
analysts said.
 The United States, the world's top oil consumer, had put
pressure on Saudi Arabia to deliver a credible deal to cap
crude prices and underpin slowing economic growth.
 President Barack Obama is keeping open the option of using
the U.S. strategic oil reserves to cover any supply gap, but no
decision has been made, a White House spokesman said.
 Oil prices have rallied since the start of the year on the
loss of Libyan oil production because of a civil war, and were
approaching 2008 peaks before falling by more than 10 percent
in early May.
 Since that time, competing pressures about supply and
ailing global growth have kept prices in a tight range.

 SINGAPORE, June 9 (Reuters) - Spot gold held steady on
Thursday as a wait-and-see sentiment prevailed on future U.S.
monetary policy moves, while palladium strengthened as the
automobile sector recovers from the Japan earthquake in March.	
 The dollar index edged lower, as the euro was
underpinned by expectations that the European Central Bank will
likely flag a July rate hike at a meeting later in the day.

 Spot gold was steady at $1,535.65 an ounce by 0554
GMT, after losing half a percent in the previous session.	
 U.S. gold  inched down 0.1 percent to $1,537.20.	
 The U.S. Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond buying
programme, launched last November to stimulate economic growth,
is set to expire at the end of June. But recent data showed
troubling signs the economic recovery may have stalled, fueling
speculation that more stimulus measures would be launched.	
 ""The market is at a loss. We need to wait for the verdict on
whether there will be further quantitative easing from the Fed
to get a clear sense of the future direction,"" said a
Tokyo-based trader.	
 The Federal Open Market Committee meeting on June 21 and 22
is expected to shed light on the monetary policy stance in the
second half of the year. 
 Spot gold has been trapped in a range between $1,530 and
$1,550 so far this week, but technical analysis suggested that
gold could correct to $1,522 in the short term, said Reuters
market analyst Wang Tao. [ID:nL3E7H903Z]	
 
 Spot palladium was the only precious metal trading in
positive territory, up 0.7 percent to $804.71.	
 A recovering auto sector in Japan, after the devastating
earthquake and tsunami disrupted the supply chain pushed the
metal, used in autocatalysts, to a three-month high of $807.50
earlier this week.	
 ""We continue to find palladium's fundamentals appealing,
particularly in light of the likely recovery in auto production
in Japan and elsewhere in the coming months,"" said a research
note by Macquarie.	
 Spot silver lost 0.4 percent to $36.65, extending
losses from the previous session. U.S. silver  was up 0.2
percent at $36.69.	
 Prices of silver surged to a record high just below $50 in
late April, before collapsing more than 30 percent over the
following two weeks, triggered by consecutive margin hikes in
COMEX silver.	
 ""The enthusiasm in silver has shrunk. There is pretty strong
resistance at $38 to $39, but we've also seen support below
$35,"" said the Tokyo-based trader.	
 Holdings in the iShares Silver Trust , the world's
largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund, stood at 9,914.21
tonnes, down 13 percent from a record high of 11,390.06 tonnes

461,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2011 10:52PM ET</span>","Brent oil rises to $118 on OPEC, US crude stocks"," By Randy Fabi	
 SINGAPORE, June 9 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose to $118 on
Thursday after Saudi Arabia failed to convince OPEC to raise
output targets, and data showed U.S. crude stocks fell sharply
last week.	
 Brent crude for July delivery  climbed 31 cents to
$118.16 a barrel by 0223 GMT, adding to gains of more than a
dollar the previous session. U.S. crude  rose 66 cents to
$101.40.	
 OPEC talks broke down in acrimony on Wednesday, underlying
concerns about the group's willingness to help control prices,
perhaps leaving the oil market more open to speculative attack.
[ID:nLDE75704C]	
 As the only OPEC member with significant spare capacity,
Saudi Arabia will now raise output unilaterally. 
 ""What this means is that there will be less spare capacity
to handle another unforeseen outage,"" said Tony Nunan, a risk
manager with Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Corp. 
 ""The market will price in this risk premium, and the way
they do that is by speculators coming in and buying it up.""	
 
 The United States, the world's top oil consumer, had put
pressure on Saudi Arabia to deliver a credible deal to cap crude
prices and underpin faltering economic growth.	
 
 EMERGENCY STOCKPILES	
 U.S. President Barack Obama was keeping open the option of
using strategic oil reserves to cover any supply gap in the
world's largest economy, but no decision had been made, a White
House spokesman said.	
 Paris-based International Energy Agency, the industrialized
nations' energy watchdog, said it also stood ready to release
oil stocks if Saudi could not fulfill all of the world's oil
needs. [ID:nN08214799]	
 Oil prices have rallied since the start of the year on the
loss of Libyan oil production because of a civil war, and were
approaching 2008 peaks before falling by more than 10 percent in
early May. They have traded in a narrow range since then.	
 U.S. inventory data on Wednesday provided a mixed picture
for the market, with gasoline stocks up a more-than-expected
2.21 million barrels last week to 214.49 million.	
 Domestic crude stocks, however, tumbled 4.8 million barrels,
the Energy Information Administration said, surpassing analysts'
expectations for a 300,000 barrel decline. 
 ""The resulting tightening in oil stocks is something that we
believe can be maintained, and causes us to continue to favour
the long side of the market in the near term,"" said Tom Pawlicki
of MF Global.	
 The dollar's rebound from one-month lows against a basket of
major currencies helped offset some of the support from OPEC and
tightening U.S. crude stocks.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - Gold fell on Wednesday as the
dollar index gained and a day after Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke offered no hints of further U.S. monetary easing
but acknowledging the economy has slowed.
 Bullion investors were disappointed with the uncertainty
over whether the Fed would embark on a third round of
government bond buying, a form of money creation known as
quantitative easing (QE). Gold is up 5 percent in the past
three weeks on bleak U.S. economic data, including a weak jobs
report.
 ""We know that the economy is weaker than the Fed would have
wanted it to be,"" said Axel Merk, who manages $700 million
mutual fund assets at Axel Investments .
 ""But it's too early for another round of QE, and that's
reflected in the market,"" he said. ""It was a gradual process as
these things don't happen overnight.""
 The second round of quantitative easing, dubbed QE2, in
which the central bank has bought $600 billion of government
bonds to stimulate economic growth, is set to expire by the end
of June.
 Spot gold  was down 0.5 percent at $1,534.64 an ounce
at 2:56 p.m. EDT (1856 GMT). Bullion hit a record $1,575.79 an
ounce on May 2.
 U.S. gold futures for August delivery  settled down
$5.30 at $1,538.70 an ounce, after trading in a range between
$1,531.80 and $1,547.40.
 COMEX gold futures volume was below 110,000 lots, almost
half its 30-day average. Volume has been lackluster since last
week, a period when bullion prices have largely rangebounded.
 Silver  was down 1.4 percent at $36.60 an ounce,
taking its direction from gold.
 Most economists said that the Fed is not expected to
tighten liquidity immediately after QE2, but it remains unclear
if the U.S. central bank will use additional market stimulus.
 Despite Wednesday's recovery in the dollar, in the longer
term, gold is set to be supported by dollar weakness with the
Fed showing no signs of reversing its easy interest rate
policy.
 The dollar was up half a percent against a basket of six
other major currencies <.DXY>, but it hit a one-month low
against the yen over U.S. economic worries. [FRX/]
 POSSIBLE U.S. DEFAULT, ECB MEETING IN FOCUS
 The dollar is still down nearly 10 percent against the euro
so far this year, and is likely to post further losses. The ECB
is widely expected to lay the ground for a July rate hike at
its Thursday policy meeting this week.
 Bullion ignored solid gains in oil prices after OPEC failed
to reach a deal to increase output, raising fears of supply
shortages later this year. [O/R]

 Gold did not budge after St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank
President James Bullard said a U.S. default is the biggest risk
facing the global economy. His comments came just hours after
Fitch Ratings warned it could slash U.S. credit ratings if the
government delays bond payments.
 Bullard told Reuters on Wednesday ""the U.S. fiscal
situation, if not handled correctly, could turn into a global
macro shock."" [ID:nN08255123]
 The Treasury Department says it can stave off default until
Aug. 2. Republican leaders, who have said they agree the limit
must be raised, say they will not approve a further increase in
borrowing authority without steps to keep debt under control.
 Gold is likely to be underpinned by safe-haven demand in
wake of a possible U.S. default or credit ratings downgrade.
 Among platinum group metals, platinum  was down 0.6
percent at $1,817.70 an ounce, while palladium  was down
0.5 percent at $800.10.

 By Jonathan Leff and Matthew Robinson
 NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped on Wednesday
after OPEC failed to reach a deal to increase output, raising
fears of supply shortages later this year that could fuel a
further price rally, imperiling the economic recovery.
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries'
talks broke down after Saudi Arabia failed to convince other
members to lift production, as many had expected in what the
kingdom's oil minister, Ali al-Naimi described as ""one of the
worst meetings...ever"".
 Still, Naimi insisted OPEC's top exporter was ready to
supply the market with whatever crude it needs. Consumer
nations said they could tap emergency reserves to help ease the
strain of high oil prices on their economies.
 ""Oil prices rising over $120 per barrel will have a severe
impact on the world economy, and we would continue to see
sluggish numbers coming out of the US and other countries,""
said Thorbjorn Bak Jensen, oil market analyst at A/S Global
Risk Management Ltd.
 London benchmark Brent crude  settled $1.07 to
$117.85, off earlier highs of $118.59, in heavy trade that saw
volumes more than a third higher than the 30 day average.
 U.S. light crude  settled $1.65 higher at $100.74 a
barrel, off earlier highs of $101.89. U.S. gasoline futures
 weighed on the complex, sliding 0.21 percent.
 EMERGENCE RESERVES
 Crude fell from earlier highs after a White House spokesman
said current oil supply levels are not meeting world demand and
that President Barack Obama was keeping open the option of
using U.S. strategic oil reserves but that no decision had been
made. [ID:nN08214799]
 The International Energy Agency, energy watchdog of the
West, later said it would coordinate a release of emergency
reserves to fill any supply gaps if Saudi Arabia could not.
 ""We are ready to move,"" IEA Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka
said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies
think tank.
 However, John Hess, Chairman and CEO of Hess International,
said supplies were healthy despite the OPEC decision.
 ""The world is getting the oil it needs,"" he said at a forum
of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, adding he was confident Saudi Arabia would step in
if there was a market shortfall.
 Oil prices have rallied since the start of the year on the
loss of Libyan oil production because of a civil war, and were
approaching 2008 peaks before falling by more than 10 percent
in early May. They have traded in a narrow range since then.

 OPEC BREAKDOWN
 After early indications that OPEC would agree a compromise
production increase at its most uncertain meeting in years, the
producer group split into irreconcilable factions.
 Saudi Arabia, together with its core Gulf allies the United
Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar had proposed an increment of
1.5 million barrels per day over OPEC's current production
including Iraq, for overall output of 30.3 million bpd.
 He said Libya, Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Venezuela, Iraq
and Iran -- nations that don't have available spare capacity to
pump more barrels quickly -- were opposed.
 The failure to reach accord doesn't necessarily change the
outcome for oil markets. A senior Gulf industry official
familiar with Saudi oil policy told Reuters earlier this week
that Riyadh plans to pump another 500,000 bpd to reach at least
9.5 million bpd, its highest in three years.
 After Wednesday's meeting, a senior delegate told Reuters
that Saudi Arabia would step up output beyond May's 9.16
million bpd this month. A Reuters poll had estimated Saudi
output at a lower 8.95 million bpd in May.
 It does suggest a new fractiousness in a group that has
remained relatively cohesive over the past decade, adding to
existing strains around the conflict in Libya.
 ""The split in OPEC doesn't really affect production plans.
In the short-run, the Saudis have already said they're going to
be increasing output,"" said Adam Sieminski, head of energy
research at Deutsche Bank. ""But what it does do is show the
mess the decision making process is in.""
 STOCKS OVERSHADOWED
 The shock from Vienna overshadowed U.S. government stock
data, which showed a 4.8 million barrel fall in crude
inventories last week, the biggest weekly drop in crude
inventories in six months as imports fell. Analysts had
forecast a tiny 300,000-barrel decline in a Reuters poll,
although the big draw jived with industry data released on
Tuesday evening. [EIA/S]
 A sizable drop in stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery
point for the U.S. oil futures contract following a week-long
pipeline outage helped support the U.S. crude, narrowing
Brent's premium to WTI to around $17 after hitting a record
more than $18 earlier.
 However, data showing that inventories of gasoline rose
2.21 million barrels to 214.49 million barrels, above the
1-million-barrel build analysts had projected, was the focus as
the United States summer driving season begins to pick up.
 ""The increase in gasoline inventories diminishes the
bullish tone somewhat. We are continuing to see rapid
replenishment of gasoline storage levels."" said John Kilduff,
Partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, June 8 (Reuters) - Gold was steady on Wednesday
as investors waited for hints on the U.S. central bank's next
policy move after its chairman acknowledged the economy had
slowed, while a slight rebound in the dollar weighed on prices. 
 Gold breached $1,550 for the second straight session on
Tuesday, but failed to close above that key level as the lack of
clues on further stimulus plan in Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke's remarks kept investors on edge.	
 ""Gold lacks momentum for a rally but does not have much room
on the downside,"" said Li Ning, an analyst at Shanghai CIFCO
Futures. ""We need some earth-shattering news to stimulate the
market.""	
 If the Fed flagged further quantitative easing, it
would drive investors, wary of future inflation, to store their
value in bullion, traders say.	
 But IMF acting chief John Lipsky said the Fed does not need
to consider additional monetary policy stimulus as the world's
largest economy is likely to pick up in coming quarters due to
growth in exports and disposable incomes.[ID:nT9E7GG02L]	
 Spot gold ticked down about 0.1 percent to $1,541.50
an ounce by 0611 GMT, snapping a three-day winning streak.	
 U.S. gold  was little changed at $1,543.	
 A slight increase in the dollar , from one-month lows
hit after Bernanke's sombre assessment of the U.S. economy and a
Chinese official's warning on holding excessive
dollar-denominated assets, weighed on gold prices. 
 Gold is likely trapped in a range between $1,530 to $1,550
before any decisive move, traders and analysts said.	
 Technical analysis suggested that gold could be due for a
deep correction, according to a Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.
[ID:nL3E7H8041]	


 U.S. ECONOMIC CONCERNS SUPPORT GOLD	
 A raft of sluggish data recently showed the U.S. economy was
losing steam, just as the Fed's $600 billion bond purchase
programme -- which has flooded markets with cheap cash and
boosted prices of gold and other commodities -- is due to
complete by the end of the month.	
 Potentially supportive of gold, an increasing number of
Republicans said a brief U.S. default might be an acceptable
price to pay if it forces the White House to deal with runaway
spending. [ID:nN07154296]	
 ""This has significant downside risks for industrial raw
material, and is highly positive for precious metals. It has
dire implications for the economy at a time when the macro data
is softening,"" said Ben Westmore, commodities economist at
National Australia Bank.	
 Spot silver lost as much as 1.2 percent to $36.66,
before rebounding slightly to $36.91, down half a percent.	
 ""The discouraging economic outlook has affected the stock
market, as well as metals with industrial applications, such as
silver,"" said a Hong Kong-based dealer.	
 Asia stocks softened on Wednesday, after the comments from
Bernanke added to fears about the strength of the global
economy. 
 Silver, which leads the precious metals complex with a near
20-percent year-to-date rise, is expected to outperform other
precious metals over the long term, as investors may continue to
favour its leverage to gold, said Austria-based hedge fund
Superfund.[ID:nL3E7H70Y8] 
 Platinum group metals also edged lower. Spot platinum
dropped 0.4 percent to $1,820.99. Spot palladium fell 0.3
percent to $801.97, after rising to a three-month high of
$807.50 on Tuesday.

 By Randy Fabi	
 SINGAPORE, June 8 (Reuters) - Brent dropped below $116 on
Wednesday ahead of an OPEC meeting where members are expected to
agree to raise global oil supplies to rein in high prices that
have weighed on growth and stoked inflation in the United
States, Europe and Asia.	
 Dollar weakness limited the fall after U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke said growth in the world's largest economy
had slowed. [ID:nN07142566]	
 Brent crude  dropped 95 cents to $115.83 a barrel by
0333 GMT, erasing some of the gains from the previous session.
U.S. crude  eased 46 cents to $98.63 a barrel.	
 Regardless of OPEC's decision, top oil exporter Saudi Arabia
plans to pump another 500,000 barrels a day this month to reach
at least 9.5 million bpd, its highest output for three years, a
senior Gulf industry official familiar with Saudi oil policy
told Reuters. [ID:nLDE7560QM]	
 The kingdom, the biggest producer in OPEC, wants OPEC to
lift formal output limits for the first time since 2007 to show
consumer countries that it recognises the danger to the economy
from energy inflation. 
 Saudi and its Gulf Arab allies want OPEC to at least close
the 1.4 million barrel per day gap between the producer group's
two-and-a-half year old official production target of 24.8
million bpd and actual output, estimated by OPEC in April at
26.2 million.	
 ""We think that the likely OPEC announcement of a 1.5 million
bpd increase in production quotas will offer moderate pressure
to trade initially but also think that it has already been
priced in,"" said Tom Pawlicki, analyst at MF Global Research.	
 Riyadh hopes its extra supplies will put an end to oil's
sharp rally, driven by strong demand growth, Arab unrest and a
weakening dollar.	
 The dollar edged up from a one-month low against a
basket of major currencies, but was under pressure on Bernanke's
comments and after a senior Chinese currency regulator warned of
the risk of excessive dollar holdings. 
 ""These (oil) prices are being driven by the U.S. dollar,""
said Jonathan Barratt, managing director of Commodity Broking
Services. ""The weak dollar-long commodity trade is entrenched
regardless of what the fundamentals are.""	
 U.S. crude stocks slipped 5.5 million barrels in the week
ended June 3, data from the American Petroleum Institute showed
on Tuesday, far exceeding the average analyst forecast for a
drop of 300,000 barrels. 
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration will issue its
weekly inventory data later on Wednesday.	
 Analysts expected U.S. crude oil inventories to have fallen
300,000 barrels last week, while gasoline stocks climbed 1
million barrels, according to a Reuters poll. 
 The U.S. government raised its world oil demand forecast for
2011 on expectations Japan and other countries will need more
crude to generate electricity, a surprise move that adds
pressure on OPEC to boost production. [ID:nN07139085]

 NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil rose 2 percent
on Tuesday, lifted by a weaker dollar and Middle East conflicts
that also pushed its premium to U.S. crude to a record above
$17 a barrel.
 U.S. crude settled slightly higher after seesawing, hemmed
in by news that Saudi Arabia planned to raise output in June
regardless of the result of OPEC's Wednesday meeting.
 Investors tried to assess whether the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries would raise its production target
only to codify current output above targets, or to signal
intent to boost actual output and not just the target.
 The U.S. dollar <.DXY> fell against a basket of currencies
after a senior Chinese currency regulator warned about the
risks of excessive dollar holdings. [USD]
 U.S. stocks gave up gains and fell for a fifth straight
session after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
acknowledged a slowdown in the economy, but did not suggest
further monetary stimulus to spark growth. [.N]
[ID:nN07142566]
 ""OPEC raising production may already be priced in and Brent
gets a lift from the euro strength and the weak dollar, and
that market is more immediately affected by potential supply
threats in the Middle East,"" said Richard Ilczyszyn, senior
market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.
 Brent crude for July delivery  rose $2.30 to settle
at $116.78 a barrel, recovering from an early $113.80 low.
 U.S. July crude  edged up 8 cents to settle at $99.09
a barrel. Prices hit $99.75 in post-settlement trading, inching
above front-month crude's 100-day moving average of $99.73.
 Trading volumes for Brent and U.S. contracts outpaced
30-day and 250-day averages.
 U.S. gasoline  and heating oil  futures also
rose sharply, lifted by Brent's strength and refinery problems,
particularly on the Texas Gulf Coast. [PRO/U]
 Brent's premium to the U.S. light, sweet crude contract
 neared $18 a barrel, amid high inventories in the
United States, especially at the Cushing, Oklahoma oil hub and
delivery point for the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) crude.
 ""It is the same old story. Oversupply in Cushing keeping
WTI depressed while Brent is being used as an inflation hedge
... North Sea fundamentals are better than WTI as there have
been some problems with Forties (crude) production,"" said Tom
Bentz, director of BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in New York.

 U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell 5.5 million barrels last
week, with Cushing stocks down 1.5 million barrels, the
American Petroleum Institute industry group said in a report
late on Tuesday. [API/S]
 Gasoline inventories fell 390,000 barrels and distillate
stocks rose 1.8 million barrels, the API said.
 Oil prices edged higher in post-settlement trading after
the report. Crude stocks had been forecast down only 300,000
barrels, with distillate stockpiles unchanged and gasoline
stocks up 1 million barrels, according to a Reuters poll of
analysts ahead of the API report. [ID:nN07148027]

the support of its allies Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates

 By Rebekah Kebede	
 PERTH, June 7 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell below $114 a
barrel on Tuesday on expectations OPEC may raise its production
target this week and lingering concerns that a weak economic
outlook will dent demand.	
 Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia and other Gulf producers,
including Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, favour a hike in
output on concerns that high oil prices are limiting economic
growth. Saudi Arabia is already planning to hike its own oil
output by 200,000 to 300,000 barrels-per-day in
June.[ID:nL3E7H70EJ] [ID:nLDE7551VM]	
 But delegates gathering in Vienna for the OPEC meeting on
Wednesday say a deal to do anything more than just close the gap
between OPEC's out-of-date official production target and actual
supplies could prove difficult. 
 ""Slowly the market is turning the focus to the OPEC meeting
and certainly a lot of the rumours around that meeting are that
Saudi Arabia are lobbying quite hard for OPEC to increase their
production quotas and that's exacerbating the downside for oil,""
Ben Westmore, a commodities analyst at National Australia Bank
in Melbourne, said. 
 ""There seems to be some political pressure (to increase
production quotas). If they do and you have extra output coming
out of those OPEC countries, it is adding to already fairly
abundant supply of oil. There's no doubt that that caused some
downside risks to the oil price."" 
 Brent crude  fell 55 cents to $113.93 a barrel by
0504 GMT, after falling $1.36 to settle at $114.48 on Monday,
its weakest close in nearly two weeks. NYMEX crude  fell
57 cents to $98.44 a barrel. 
 
 Worries about the economic outlook, especially in top global
oil consumer the United States, also dragged oil prices down. 
 ""The demand side and the hangover from the weak jobs numbers
out of the U.S. (last week) have had a dampening effect on the
oil price,"" Westmore said. 
 High fuel prices and weak U.S. economic numbers could prompt
the U.S. government's energy forecasting agency to cut its
global oil demand estimate for the second month running.
[ID:nN06122526] 
 But U.S. oil inventory reports from industry and government
could show that stockpiles fell slightly last week, a Reuters
poll of analysts on Monday showed. Gasoline and distillate
stockpiles were expected to rise. 
 Technical charts indicated that oil prices may drop in the
short term, with Brent expected to slip to $112 per barrel while
U.S. oil could fall to $97 per barrel. 
 But the correction in oil prices is temporary, Reuters
market analyst Wang Tao said, adding that charts show U.S. and
Brent crude oil futures will fall further in the short term
before resuming a long-term uptrend that could see prices
revisit May and April highs by the end of 2011. [ID:nL3E7H704Y]	
 
 POLITICAL UPHEAVALS SUPPORT	
 The threat that violence in Yemen, Syria, and Libya could
disrupt more oil supplies continues to support prices.	
 ""The political situation in the Middle East and North Africa
remains tense and some risk of a significant disruption to oil
prices cannot be entirely discounted,"" Ric Spooner, chief market
analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney said.	
 The U.S. called for a peaceful and orderly transition in
Yemen in the absence of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is
recovering from shrapnel wounds in Saudi Arabia.[ID:nLDE7552JK]

 Syrian forces fought gunmen in battles that left more than
120 members of the security forces dead, state television said
in the first report of large-scale armed clashes in the revolt
against President Bashar al-Assad. [ID:nLDE7552JX]

to be stepped up NATO air strikes on the Libyan capital on

 SINGAPORE, June 7 (Reuters) - Gold inched up on Tuesday,
after rising to its strongest in more than a month in the
previous session, as fears about a slowing U.S. economy prompted
purchases from investors seeking an alternative investment.	
 Gold added $2.45 at $1,545.50 an ounce by 0600 GMT
after rising to as high as $1,553.30 on Monday, with investors
awaiting a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on
the U.S. economic outlook later in the day.[ID:nN06262310] 
 Gold is still well below a lifetime high around $1,575
touched in early May, but with the U.S. dollar under pressure,
equities markets falling and the debt crisis in Europe far from
over, bullion -- with its safe-haven status -- continues to be
one of the chief beneficiaries.	
 ""I think the odds are stacked in favour of gold at the
moment,"" said Darren Heathcote, head of trading at Investec
Australia in Sydney.	
 ""I guess the other thing to watch is what happens if we're
getting more rhetoric from the various ministers and powers
within Europe about the Greece situation etcetera. I think the
market is still extremely weary of what the potential outcome
may be."" 
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou told his cabinet on
Monday it was crucial to accept years of austerity to secure a
new international bailout, a challenge for a nation already
seething over corruption. [ID:nLDE7550KZ]	
 Silver , which normally tracks gold, was flat at
$36.73 an ounce, below a record at $49.51 an ounce hit in April.	
 
 Gold prices, which have gained for the last three straight
weeks, have been supported by the recent soft patch of data from
the United States. 
 Federal Reserve officials said recent economic data has been
disappointing, with one suggesting it could delay the Fed's exit
from its extremely easy monetary policy. [ID:nN06299146]	
 The Fed has kept interest rates near zero for two-and-half
years and this month completes a $600 billion round of Treasury
securities purchases designed to boost an economy still
recovering from its worst recession since the 1930s. 
 The euro held firm near a one-month high on Tuesday, while
most Asian stocks eased as a trail of weak U.S. economic data
pointed to slowing growth. 
 Americans' disapproval of how President Barack Obama is
handling the U.S. economy and its growing budget deficit has
reached new highs amid broad frustration over the slow pace of
economic recovery, according to a Washington Post-ABC New poll
released on Tuesday. [ID:nN07303542]	
 The physical market saw purchases from jewellers in parts of
Asia, but volume was low as bullion prices held near Monday's
high. 
 ""I guess it is still quiet, with light buying by India and
Thailand. My premiums remain at $0.60 to $0.80,"" said a physical
dealer in Singapore, referring to premiums for gold bars to spot
London prices. 
 India's gold futures rose on Monday chasing gains in the
overseas markets, while demand in domestic spot market improved
despite price rise as jewellers made significant purchases.

 Holdings of the largest silver-backed exchange-traded-fund
(ETF), New York's iShares Silver Trust and the largest
gold-backed ETF New York's SPDR Gold Trust remained
unchanged from Friday to Monday.

 NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - Gold rose to its highest price
in more than a month on Monday, as fears of a slowing U.S.
economy and expectations that Federal Reserve monetary policy
would remain easy prompted safe-haven demand.
 Bullion has gained nearly 6 percent in the past three
weeks, boosted by a string of disappointing U.S. economic
indicators including Friday's weak jobs data. [ID:nOAT004818]
 ""A lot of people are taking their risk off by getting out
of the S&P 500 and other riskier assets. There is too much
uncertainty with the U.S. currency and the euro,"" said
Phillip Streible, senior market strategist with Lind Waldock, a
unit of futures broker MF Global.
 ""So, people think the safest place is the gold market at
the moment.""
 A survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago showed that
U.S. economic growth is expected to slow this year as inflation
rises, a pattern that will reverse next year. Investors now
await a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on the
U.S. economic outlook on Tuesday. [ID:nN06262310]
 Spot gold  was up 0.1 percent at $1,542.79 an ounce
by 2:39 p.m. EDT (1839 GMT). Gold initially hit a session high
of $1,553.30, its loftiest since early May, but pared gains as
the dollar strengthened against the euro.
 Bullion hit a record $1,575.79 an ounce on May 2.
 U.S. August gold futures  settled up $4.80 at
$1,547.20, having traded from $1,542 to $1,553.90. COMEX gold
futures volume was below 100,000 lots, almost 60 percent under
its 30-day average, extending last week's weaker turnover.
 Gold's weekly charts showed prices were well supported
within a long-term upward trend channel above its 50-day moving
average, said Adam Sarhan of Sarhan Capital.

 Spot silver  rose 1.3 percent to $36.68, rebounding
from near two-week lows in the previous session. That brought
the gold/silver ratio to 42.1, its lowest since Thursday,
denoting its outperformance over gold in the last few days.
 Silver prices have fallen more than a quarter since hitting
a record $49.51 on April 28 but are up 19 percent on the year,
compared with gold's 9 percent rise.
 Friday's surprisingly weak U.S. employment data kept the
dollar near one-month lows and suppressed investor risk
appetite.
 ""Weak U.S. economic data last week are strengthening
expectations that the Federal Reserve will maintain key
interest rates at the current very low level for even longer,
which will keep the opportunity costs for precious metals low,""
Commerzbank said in a note.
 The S&P 500 index fell to its lowest in more than two
months as U.S. stocks extended a five-week decline on a weak
performance by the bank and financial sector. [.N]
 PERU, YEMEN, EURO DEBT IN FOCUS
 Analysts cited Peru's presidential election victory by
left-wing former army commander Ollanta Humala for fundamental
support. Investors are worried Humala's views could lead to
lower gold output by the world's sixth-largest producer.
 Uncertainty over the future of Yemen while President Ali
Abdullah Saleh was recovering from injuries sustained in an
attack on his palace also unnerved markets. [ID:nLDE7550AA]
 Greece's campaign to secure another bailout to avoid
default added to investor jitters.
 Strong interest by U.S. managed money more than offset
traditionally weaker gold jewelry demand in the summer ahead of
India's wedding season, a major gold buying event.
 Speculative holdings of gold futures notched their largest
increase in 13 months last week, according to data from the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
 The net noncommercial position in gold, often used as a
proxy for speculative activity, staged its largest weekly rise
since April 2010.
 Platinum  was up 84 cents at $1,811.99 an ounce,
while palladium  was up 1.1 percent at $788.47, having
risen as much as 1.7 percent to an intraday peak at $793.50,
its highest since early May.

 NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - Oil fell on Monday in thin and
choppy trading on raised expectations OPEC will raise
production targets this week and concerns about the economic
outlook.
 Worried that oil prices near $115 a barrel are hitting
economic growth, Gulf producers including Saudi Arabia favor an
increase in output when the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries meets on Wednesday. [ID:nLDE7551VM]
 OPEC delegates gathering in Vienna said a deal to do more
than close the gap between the official output target and
actual production -- about 1.4 million barrels per day -- could
prove difficult due to opposition from price hawks such as Iran
and Venezuela. [ID:nLDE7540D1]
 Oil prices leading up to the OPEC meeting have been fairly
rangebound, with Brent crude trading between $114 to $117 a
barrel over most of the past two weeks.
 Brent crude for July delivery  fell $1.36 to settle
at $114.48 a barrel, the weakest close in nearly two weeks, in
light trading that saw volumes about 25 percent below the
30-day moving average.
 U.S. July crude  fell $1.21 to settle at $99.01 a
barrel, the lowest close in two weeks, with trade volumes about
30 percent below the 30-day moving average.

 DOLLAR, STORMS
 The dollar recovered against the euro and the dollar index

supported dollar-denominated oil prices. [USD/] U.S. stocks
ended lower and the S&P 500 slumped to its lowest level since
March on signs of a slowing economy. [.N]
 ""Today's lower (oil prices are) largely related to the
usual bearish combo of stronger dollar and a soft stock
market,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president at Ritterbusch & Associates
in Galena, Illinois, said in a note.
 ""Some positioning ahead of the upcoming OPEC meeting also
likely prompted some selling as some key oil ministers appear
to be sending out overtures of an increase in production
quotas,"" said Ritterbusch.
 Additional pressure on prices came on news TransCanada

Keystone crude oil pipeline on Sunday. [ID:nN05225928]
 The market was also watching a low pressure system in the
northwestern Caribbean Sea, which the National Hurricane Center
said had a 50-percent possibility of becoming a tropical
cyclone developing over the next 48 hours.
 A few computer models forecast the Caribbean system to move
northwest over western Cuba and reach the U.S. Gulf of Mexico,
potentially threatening offshore oil and natural gas
production, over the next few days. Other models forecast it to
move northeast toward eastern Cuba and the Atlantic.

 Ahead of closely watched weekly U.S. inventory reports from

 SINGAPORE, June 6 (Reuters) - Gold strengthened on Monday,
extending gains made in the previous session, as a disappointing
U.S. jobs data fueled fears of a slowdown in recovery of the
world's biggest economy and a softer dollar lent support.	
 U.S. employers hired the fewest number of workers in eight
months in May and unemployment rate rose to 9.1 percent, stoking
worries that the economic growth may be faltering, supporting
sentiment in gold which is seen as a safe-haven investment
during economic uncertainties. [ID:nOAT004818]	
 ""The weak U.S. data has increased the possibility of a third
round of quantitative easing,"" said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst at
Phillip Futures.	
 ""I think it is premature to say we will see a third round.
But if the Fed (U.S. Federal Reserve) signals that there may be,
it will be the catalyst pushing gold to $1,550 and beyond.""	
 Spot gold edged up 0.3 percent to $1,545.75 an ounce
by 0607 GMT, building on three consecutive weeks of gains.	
 U.S. gold  gained 0.3 percent to $1,547.40.	
 Trading was thin as markets in China, Hong Kong and South
Korea were shut on a public holiday, traders said.	
 When the Fed announced the second round of quantitative
easing, known as the QE2, in November last year, gold prices
scored record highs for four consecutive sessions.	
 Before any clear clue on further quantitative easing, gold
is likely to be trapped in the range between $1,520 to $1,550,
traders said.	
 Technical analysis also indicated that spot gold faced
resistance at $1,553 an ounce, Reuters market analyst Wang Tao
said. [ID:nL3E7H6049]	
 The U.S. dollar was stuck near a one-month low hit
against a basket of major currencies in early Asia trade,
finding no support after the disappointing jobs data bolstered
expectations that U.S. interest rates will stay low for longer.

 The weakness in the dollar is likely to buoy prices of
commodities, as a soft dollar makes commodities cheaper for
holders of other currencies.	
 
 Investors also continued to watch the ongoing Greek debt
crisis for trading cues. International lenders said on Friday
that the country was likely to get a vital slice of aid in July
to avoid default while the European Union raised the prospect of
expanding the bailout of the euro zone state.[ID:nLDE7520MP]	
 Spot silver rose 1.5 percent to $36.75 in thin
holiday trade, after dropping to a 1-1/2 week low of $35.13 in
the previous session.	
 Silver prices were nearly 26 percent lower than its record
high of $49.51 hit on April 28, but still up 19 percent on the
year, compared to gold's 9-percent rise.	
 The price drop has attracted some investors. Money managers
raised their bullish bets in gold and silver last week, U.S.
regulator data showed Friday. [ID:nN03176967] 
 ""We have seen some short covering,"" said a Singapore-based
trader, ""Generally the market will probably be buying metals on
dips after the payrolls number.""

 PERTH, June 6 (Reuters) - Brent crude slipped toward $115 a
barrel on Monday on concern about demand after disappointing
jobs data from top consumer United States, but a softer dollar
and political upheaval in the Middle East limited losses.	
 The possibility that OPEC will raise supply when ministers
meet this week also put pressure on prices. Gulf Arab members
led by Saudi Arabia will push for a rise, but were likely to
face opposition from OPEC's leading hawks Iran and Venezuela.
[ID:nLDE7540D1]	
 ""Today there is no shortage of supply. OPEC will do its
job,"" the chief executive of the French energy giant Total
said at a conference in Kuala Lumpur.[ID:nL3E7H603M]	
 Brent crude  fell 33 cents to $115.51 a barrel by
0340 GMT, after settling up 30 cents on Friday. U.S. crude
 slipped 8 cents to $100.13 a barrel. 
 ""We are going to have sideways trade, basically because the
weaker economy means weaker crude oil prices because of less
demand in the U.S., but we have Yemen that's going to keep it
high (along with) the weaker dollar,"" Tony Nunan, a risk manager
with Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Corp, said. 
 U.S. data showed payrolls rose by 54,000 in May, the softest
reading since September, and the country's jobless rate rose to
9.1 percent in May from 9 percent in April.[ID:nOAT004818]	
 
 Falling oil demand and higher supplies in the world's
largest economy are pushing prices lower, analysts said. U.S.
crude oil stocks rose in the week to May 27 to their highest
seasonal level for May since 1990. 
 TransCanada Corp's 591,000 barrel-per-day (bpd)
capacity Keystone pipeline -- which carries oil from Alberta to
the U.S. oil hub of Cushing -- resumed shipping crude oil, one
week after being shut by a leak at a Kansas pumping station, the
Calgary-based company said in a statement. [ID:nL3E7GV0NR]	
 Technical charts indicated that oil prices may drop in the
short term, with Brent expected to slip to $112 per barrel and
U.S. oil expected to revisit the Friday low of $98.12 per
barrel. 
 The dollar slid to a fresh one-month low against a
basket of major currencies early in Asia on Monday, as the jobs
data bolstered expectations that U.S. interest rates will stay
low for longer. 
 ""The value of the dollar and the way it's declining is
keeping some of these commodities at levels which are not
sustainable,"" Jonathan Barratt, managing director of Commodity
Broking Services in Sydney, said. 
 
 MIDDLE EAST SUPPORTS	
 Violence in the Middle East underpinned prices due to
worries that instability could spill over to some of the world's
largest oil and gas producers and disrupt global supplies. 
 Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh was recovering from an
operation in Saudi Arabia to remove shrapnel from his chest
while a truce between his troops and a tribal federation
appeared to be holding. 
 Protesters, interpreting Saleh's absence as a sign that his
grip on power was weakening, celebrated on the streets of Sanaa
where they have been staging anti-government demonstrations
since January. [ID:nLDE7530ED] 
 Syrian forces shot dead 31 people in the last 48 hours
during demonstrations in a northwestern town and official media
said gunmen killed four policemen in the same town.
[ID:nLDE7540LS] 
Protests against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad have grown
despite reform gestures dismissed by the opposition and a
continuing crackdown that has killed at least 1,100 people since
the uprising erupted two months ago.

 By Carole Vaporean
 NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - Gold rose to near its highest
in a month on Friday, boosted by a weak U.S. labor report that
illustrated the fragile state of the economic recovery, likely
keeping rates low and the dollar weak for awhile.
 Bullion jumped, while stocks and oil fell, in the wake of
data showing U.S. employers hired 54,000 workers in May, far
fewer workers than expected, and the unemployment rate rose to
9.1 percent. [ID:nOAT004818] Gold was also bolstered by a slump
in the dollar index <.DXY> to its lowest in a month. [FRX/]
 Dealers said there were multiple reasons for gold to gain
on the latest and strongest evidence of a softening economy:
expectations of more cheap money from the Federal Reserve;
fears of deflation; a haven from financial risk.
 While few analysts were prepared to forecast a double-dip
recession, the thought of fresh Federal Reserve funds beyond
the end of quantitative easing II (QEII) this month was enough
to spur some bids in an otherwise lacklustre gold market. U.S.
futures trading volumes was a below its norm by a third.
 ""I think QE3 is going to have to slip back into the
vernacular. If we see more (economic) numbers in June that are
en par with the ones we've been getting or worse, coming into
the fall we'll be looking at some sort of Fed action to try to
support economic activity,"" said Sterling Smith, commodity
market analyst at Country Hedging Inc in St. Paul, Minnesota.
 Spot gold  rose to a two-day peak of $1,546.39 a troy
ounce after the payrolls release, but pulled back to $1,541.10
by 3:16 EDT (1916 GMT) from $1,532.55 an ounce late in New York
on Thursday. Gold hit a record high of $1,575.79 on May 2.
 Bullion posted its highest weekly close since early May.
 August COMEX futures  posted $9.7 gains to $1,542.40
an ounce by the close.
 Gold priced in sterling  hit a record high of
946.79 pounds ($1,548) an ounce, as a weaker dollar across a
basket of currencies triggered a rush for the precious metal.
It was quoted at 938.55 sterling late in the session.

 EUROPE TOO
 ""This is gold-friendly data ... (it) points to a slackening
U.S. economy. In the worst case scenario, we could have a
double-dip in the U.S. economy and possibly deflation, which
would also help gold,"" said Robin Bhar, an analyst at Credit
Agricole.
 Next week's light U.S. economic calendar lists mostly
secondary reports. [ECI/US] The Federal Reserve's own anecdotal
reading of growth and price prospects is out Wednesday and
should provide additional clues about the likelihood of QE3.
 Investor interest in gold has also been boosted by fears of
a Greek debt default and the contagion effects on other euro
zone countries such as Ireland and Portugal.
 Greece is likely to get a vital slice of aid in July to
avoid default, international lenders said on Friday, while the
European Union raised the prospect of expanding the bailout of
the euro zone state.
 The European Commission, the European Central Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, ending a month-long review of
their bailout program, said Athens had made considerable
progress toward repairing its finances, but must step up fiscal
and economic reforms. [ID:nLDE7520MP]
 Investors use gold as a hedge against political and
economic insecurity and inflationary pressure. It typically
moves opposite to the dollar. When it falls, dollar-denominated
commodities cheapen for holders of other currencies.
 SILVER SUFFERS
 Spot silver  continued its descent of the last three
days, falling to $35.18 an ounce, its lowest since May 24. By
late session, it was quoted about even with $36.17 late on
Thursday. For the week, silver has lost about 4.75 percent.
 Investors have been dumping industrial metal silver on a
spate of weak manufacturing news. They also fled the white
metal after exchange operators in Shanghai and New York
increased margins, the money required to trade silver futures.
 Weak fundamentals reinforced the sell-off, which has seen
silver fall from a $49.51 an ounce hit on April 27.
 Platinum  ended higher at $1,813 than $1,809.60
previously, and palladium  firmed to $780.50 from $767.05
an ounce on Thursday.

 NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - Brent crude edged up on Friday
as the weak dollar and Middle East violence sparked a rebound
after disappointing U.S. payrolls data sent prices plunging.
 U.S. crude futures settled slightly lower after tumbling
more than $2 in early trade reacting to the jobs data. U.S. May
nonfarm payrolls posted the weakest reading since September and
the U.S. jobless rate rose to 9.1 percent. [ID:nOAT004818]
 The dollar fell as the disappointing U.S. jobs data added
to evidence of an economic slowdown. The euro touched a
one-month high on optimism that Greece will receive its next
aid payment. The lessening of worry about Greece also helped
Brent crude rebound.
 Brent crude for July delivery  rose 30 cents to
settle at $115.84 a barrel, recovering from a $113.40 intraday
low. It ended with a weekly gain of 81 cents, or 0.7 percent.
 U.S. July crude  fell 18 cents to settle at $100.22 a
barrel, recovering from its $98.12 low and pushing back above
its 100-day moving average of $99.58.
 Crude trading volumes fell from the previous day, but were
near 30-day averages.
 ""The dollar is weak and equities bounced back some and the
initial shock from the jobs report wore off,"" said Dan Flynn,
analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago, as crude pushed off
early lows.
 ""The Middle East and Yemen especially will make people
cautious about being too short going into the weekend.""
 Brokers said oil prices drew support as the S&P 500 index
pared enough losses to finish above 1,300. [.N]
 U.S. regulators said they will not let TransCanada Corp
 restart its Keystone crude oil pipeline until they are
satisfied problems that caused at least two leaks in a month

 This added to uncertainty about the timing of the restart
for the 591,000 barrel a day pipeline that moves Canadian crude
to the United States. [ID:nN03188031]
 Refinery outages lifted U.S. gasoline  and heating

 OPEC, MIDDLE EAST
 Traders were watching the growing violence in Yemen, a
small oil producer on the Arabian Peninsula that borders top
OPEC exporter Saudi Arabia. Shells struck Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh's palace in Sanaa, slightly wounding Saleh and
three other senior officials. [ID:nLDE7520A1]
 Syrian forces opened fire to disperse demonstrators in
several parts of the country, residents said, and protesters
defied a widespread military crackdown as they demanded the
ouster of President Bashar al-Assad. [ID:nLDE7520VJ]
 Markets are also awaiting next week's OPEC meeting. Some
OPEC sources have indicated the producer group could raise
output targets at their meeting, although Ali Al-Naimi, Saudi
Arabia's oil minister, took a cautious tack on Thursday,
repeating previous comments that OPEC would lift production if
there was more demand for crude. [ID:nWSF010384] [ID:nWLA1915]
 Analysts will be looking to see if any change only codifies
estimates of current production above targets, or suggests an
actual output boost.
 The International Energy Agency (IEA), advisor to 28
industrialized countries, reiterated on Friday its call for
OPEC to boost output to pull oil prices further lower.
[ID:nLDE75211P]
 ""There is a need for more oil in the market, and we hope
producing countries are reading the market signals in the way
we are,"" Fatih Birol, chief economist for the IEA, told
Reuters.
 ""We are already seeing the impact of high oil prices in the
U.S. and China,"" Birol said, adding that U.S. economic data was
showing slower growth rates while inflationary pressure in
China was on the rise.

 By Seng Li Peng	
 SINGAPORE, June 3 (Reuters) - Brent and U.S. crude were flat
on Friday as the dollar steadied against a basket of currencies
and investors waited to see if U.S. non-farm payrolls data would
add to evidence of a faltering global economy.	
 The market shrugged off news that OPEC is considering
raising output by as much as 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd),
ahead of the group's meeting in Vienna on June 8. One delegate
said a 1 million-bpd hike would be the likely outcome.
[ID:nLDE75114K]	
 But also weighing on sentiment, U.S. crude stockpiles rose
2.88 million barrels to 373.8 million barrels in the week to May
27, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Thursday,
against expectations of a fall.	
 Brent oil gained 7 cents to $115.61 a barrel at 0316 GMT,
heading for a weekly gain of nearly 2.7 percent, supported by
intensified chaos in Yemen and the absence of Libyan light sweet
crude. 
 ""The weakness in data and (higher) inventories should have
been a night off for oil, but oil prices went up this morning
possibly due to the weakness in the U.S. dollar,"" said Ben Le
Brun, a Sydney-based markets analyst at CMC Markets.	
 The euro hit a one-month high against the dollar on
Friday, with investors fretting about a Moody's warning on U.S.
debt levels and disappointing economic data this week. 
 ""The economic data throughout the world is negative and that
is going to put a bit of pressure on oil,"" Le Brun added. 


 U.S. oil rose 19 cents to $100.61 a barrel, on track for a
weekly gain of about 1.3 percent.	
 ""There have to be question marks on what sort of demand we
are going to see in crude. Non-farm payrolls are going to be
vital tonight as they will have a short-term, big impact on
oil,"" Le Brun said. 
 U.S. non-farm payrolls data for May is forecast to show
employers likely added 150,000 jobs, according to a Reuters
survey, after increasing payrolls by 244,000 in April.
[ID:nN01187478]	
 Data on Wednesday already flagged weaker factory growth
around the world last month, and this has intensified concerns
that the world's main economic engines are cooling fast as
richer countries curtail orders. [ID:nLDE7500VU] 
 There are also worries about the end of the Fed's second
round of quantitative easing later this month. Known as QE2, the
$600 billion asset purchase program was launched to stimulate
the economy. Investors fear its removal could hinder recovery.
[ID:nN02256664]	
 Market attention is also turning to the hurricane season in
the Gulf of Mexico, with the National Hurricane Center on
Thursday warning a low pressure system about two hundred miles
north-northwest of the Yucatan peninsula continued to have a 10
percent chance of strengthening into a depression over the next
48 hours. [ID:nL3E7H239V]	
 
 OPEC	
 OPEC's output remains far below that of a year ago, with its
exports in the period to June 18 expected to be 570,000 bpd down
from a year ago mainly because of the loss of Libyan supplies,
UK consultancy Oil Movements said in its latest weekly estimate
on Thursday. [ID:nWLA1816]	
 Analysts say there is divergence within OPEC over the need
for any output hike.	
 Ecuador's oil minister Wilson Pastor said on Thursday that
OPEC countries may decide to increase output quotas when they
meet next week if they see the global oil market as
under-supplied. [ID:nN02257799]

 SINGAPORE, June 3 (Reuters) - Spot gold held steady on
Friday as the dollar rebounded from a month low and investors
moved to the sidelines ahead of the release of closely-watched
U.S. non-farm payrolls data later in the day.	
 Moody's threatened to cut the top-notch credit rating of the
United States if the White House and Congress do not make
progress by mid-July in talks to raise the U.S. debt limit,
which sent the dollar index to its lowest since early
May. [ID:nN01214888] 
 The index however steadied in later Asian trade, up 0.08
percent to 74.392 at 0616 GMT.	
 The greenback has been battered in recent weeks by a raft of
sluggish U.S. economic data that has fueled fears that recovery
in the world's biggest economy is losing steam. [ID:nN02246578]	
 ""If the payrolls data turns out worse than expected, it may
help gold advance towards the record high in the next few days,""
said Hou Xinqiang, an analyst at Jinrui Futures, who said gold
is still on an upward trend after a correction last month
knocked prices below $1,500.	
 Economists revised down their forecast on the May non-farm
payrolls data, after a report on Wednesday showed a sharp
slowdown in private job growth last month. [ID:nN01187478] 
 Spot gold was nearly flat at $1,531.66 by 0604 GMT,
after touching a one-week low of $1,519.60 in the previous
session. It was headed for a minor 0.2 percent fall from a week
earlier.	
 U.S. gold  was little changed at $1,532.90.	
 Technical analysis suggested gold might face some downside
risk in the short term, with a bearish target at $1,511, said
Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.	
 
 ""A lot of people have reduced risk ahead of the payrolls
data, so there is not much action in the market,"" said a
Singapore-based trader. ""But gold is still looking firm -- the
dip overnight was well bought into.""	
 Investors continued watching the ongoing Greek debt crisis.
Greece agreed with its EU and IMF lenders to impose yet deeper
austerity and speed up state selloffs in exchange for fresh
funds to avert a debt default. [ID:nLDE7510BM]	
 Spot silver lost 0.6 percent to $35.94, on course for
a 5 percent weekly decline, although it was still up 16 percent
year to date, leading the precious metals complex. 
 U.S. silver  fell 0.7 percent to $35.94.	
 The recent losses in silver have helped the gold-silver
ratio, used to measure how many ounces of silver is needed to
buy an ounce of gold, rise to a nearly two-week high above 42.	
 Spot platinum was barely changed at $1,810.74, headed
for a third week of gains at one percent. Spot palladium
declined 0.3 percent to $764.50, also on its way to a
one-percent weekly rise.

 NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - Gold ended moderately lower on
Thursday in see-saw trade, falling as much as 1 percent in a
profit-taking spree, then bouncing off the session low as the
dollar slid when a ratings agency expressed concern that the
United States might default on its debt.
 ""You might have gotten some knee-jerk profit-taking to
begin with, but things have gone back up because the euro went
through the roof,"" said Sean McGillivray, head of asset
allocation at Great Pacific Wealth Management in Oregon.
 Spot gold  was down at $1,533.50 an ounce, having
risen earlier to a session high at $1,544.16, and then fallen
to one-week low at $1,519.60. If ended Wednesday at $1,540.20.
 August COMEX futures  lost 0.7 percent, or $10.50,
to settle at $1,532.70, after rupturing support to fall as low
as $1,520.40.
 The euro touched a one-month high against the dollar after
Moody's Investors Service said there was a small, but rising
risk of a short-lived default by the United States with no
increase in the statutory debt limit in coming weeks. [USD/]
 The euro had already extended gains against the dollar,
helped by a Reuters report that euro zone officials had agreed
in principle on a new three-year adjustment program for Greece
that would involve increased external funding. [ID:nLDE7510VR]
 Gold fell to its session low as most commodities were swept
up in a broad sell-off.
 ""With the discussions in the market about lower commodity
prices if China's slowing. We also had an outright decline in
crude oil as well as base metals, that sapped some of the vigor
from the bullion market,"" said James Steel metals analyst at
HSBC in New York.
 Gold pulled up from the lows when many other commodities
turned higher, as the dollar's slide brought back the so-called
risk trade.
 Gold was supported the latest weaker-than-expected U.S.
economic reading cast doubt on the outlook for growth in the
world's largest economy.
 Thursday's weak U.S. factory data added to a raft of
negative U.S. economic reports in May that gave many investors
the impression easy money would continue to be available.
 ""With such weak data, it leaves the door open for some kind
of stimulus and keeping interest rates low. That's what's been
rallying commodities in the first half of the year,"" he said.
 On Friday, investors will be anxiously awaiting the U.S.
employment report for May. Economists polled by Reuters look
for jobs growth of 150,000 for the month, which could put a
pause in investments of riskier assets. But, a negative number
could cause a more buying in commodities.
 Thursday's data showed the number of Americans signing up
for jobless benefits fell slightly last week, doing little to
calm fears of a stalled in the U.S. economy's recovery.
[ID:nN02246578]
 And, new U.S. factory orders dropped in April, partly
because of a 1.2 percent drop in demand for transportation
goods, after an upwardly revised March rise. [ID:nN02253767]
 Because of its industrial component, silver suffered the
steepest losses after a third day of disappointing U.S. data.
 July silver futures  tumbled to $36.2020 an ounce,
ending down $1.4920, or nearly 4 percent. Spot silver 
cut declines by late trade to $36.12, off $36.79 previously.
 ""It's been silver that has taken the harder fall, because
of the greater industrial component there. It has been the weak
link in the group,"" said Steel.
 GOLD STILL SUPPORTED
 The gold price has still risen by over 5 percent since the
early-May sell-off, and the outflow of cash from the bullion
market, as evidenced by declines in exchange-traded fund and
futures holdings, has begun to reverse.
 In ETF flows, gold holdings rose for the first time since
May 26, up about 70,000 ounces to 64.542 million ounces,
bringing the net change in holdings for the year to -0.73
percent, from -0.66 percent a week ago. [GOL/ETF]
 Palladium rose modestly, while platinum slipped, with both
having posted sharp declines on Wednesday data showed U.S.
vehicle sales slowed far more than expected last month.
 Palladium  was quoted slightly higher at $767.97 an
ounce, having fallen by nearly 1 percent on Wednesday when it
finished at $765.98. Platinum  fell to $1,811.24 from
$1,814.25, having shed 0.7 percent on Wednesday.

 NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Thursday in
volatile trading as the weaker dollar outweighed news OPEC was
mulling hiking its output target and rising U.S. inventories.
 Markets were closely watching comments from OPEC sources,
who said the group could lift production targets by up to 1.5
million barrels per day (bpd) when it meets on June 8 to help
bring down high fuel costs threatening the economic recovery.
[ID:nL3E7H20QC]
 Further pressure came from U.S. inventory data, which
showed crude inventories last week reached the highest level
for this time of year since 2006 amid weak demand. [EIA/S]
 Crude rallied back as the euro touched a one-month high
against the dollar after Moody's said there was a very small
but rising risk of a short-lived default by the United States
and a report that euro zone officials had agreed in principle
on a new adjustment program for Greece. [ID:nN02140420]
 Support also came from news of of an explosion and fire at
Chevron's  refinery at Pembroke in Wales.
[ID:nLDE7511ZC]
 Brent  crude for July delivery rose $1.01 to settle
at $115.54 a barrel, rallying after being pressured by the U.S.
oil inventory data and pushing the Brent premium to U.S. crude
 to over $15 a barrel.
 U.S. July crude  edged up 11 cents to settle at
$100.40 a barrel.
 ""It's another bail out boost. The dollar also got hammered
by the Moody's warning about U.S. default and the Pembroke fire
definitely provided some lift,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at
PFGBest Research in Chicago.

 OPEC MULLS RAISING TARGETS
 Ahead of OPEC's meeting next week in Vienna, officials said
the producer group was considering raising output, possibly by
as much as 1.5 million bpd, though one delegate said a 1
million-bpd hike would be the likely outcome.
 ""Oil prices are too high. $100 oil is scaring people,"" one
delegate said, adding a rise of 1 million bpd in OPEC's output
target would result in only a small increase in actual oil
supply from the group.
 ""If this is 1 million bpd on top of the targets from over
two years ago, then it's meaningless. If it's 1 million bpd
above current production levels, then it's exactly what the
market needs,"" said David Wech, analyst at JBC Energy in
Vienna.
 Ali Al-Naimi, top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia's oil
minister, was cautious, repeating previous comments that the
group would lift production if there was more demand for crude.
[ID:nWSF010384]
 RISING U.S. INVENTORIES
 Even as OPEC members considered increasing output, demand
in top consumer the United States remained weak, down 5 percent
over the past four weeks compared to a year ago, while U.S.
crude stockpiles rose 2.88 million barrels to 373.8 million in
the week to May 27, the highest level since late April 2009.
 Gasoline inventories jumped 2.55 million barrels are
refiners built up their stores ahead of the summer driving

 SINGAPORE, June 2 (Reuters) - Brent and U.S. crude oil
declined for a second day on Thursday on a surprise gain in U.S.
crude stocks, weak jobs data in the world's top crude importer
and a report that OPEC will meet next week to discuss a 1.5
million barrels per day (bpd) output increase.	
 Brent oil fell toward $114 a barrel, while U.S. oil slipped

 OPEC	
 OPEC will discuss increasing oil output by up to 1.5 million
barrel per day (bpd) when it meets next week, industry publisher
Energy Intelligence reported on Wednesday. [ID:nN01216874]	
 An output increase would be at odds with a Reuters poll
predicting the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
would roll over its current output agreement, untouched since a
record cut in December 2008. 
 Iran said on Wednesday preserving OPEC's production ceiling
was the only way to control the oil market, the semi-official
Mehr news agency quoted Iran's OPEC governor Mohammad Ali
Khatibi as saying. [ID:nMOS136339]	
 ""OPEC understands that over supplying the market will drive

 SINGAPORE, June 2 (Reuters) - Spot gold prices held steady
on Thursday, after rising to a one-month high in the previous
session when Moody's downgrading of Greece and weak U.S.
economic data sent some investors to seek a safe-haven in
bullion.	
 Fears mounted that the U.S. economy may be running out of

expected in May and output in the manufacturing sector hit its

data,"" said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures, ""The

May 2, Ong said.

said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. [ID:nL3E7H205J]

growing risk that Athens would fail to stabilise its debt
position without a restructuring. [ID:nLDE75038N]	
 ""Along with other commodities being sold on weak U.S. data

gold will be able to stand on its own unless we make fresh highs

 ""Otherwise investors would likely take profits and gold
would move lower along with other metals.""

sector, which heightened anxiety that the economic recovery may
hit a soft spot. [ID:nLDE7500VU]

4.3 percent drop on Wednesday.	
 Spot platinum was little changed at $1,813.74, off a

palladium was trading at $770.22, up 0.6 percent.

 By Carole Vaporean
 NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - Gold held onto healthy gains
on Wednesday in late trade, though off earlier one-month highs,
as investors sought its safety after weaker U.S. manufacturing
data and a private-sector jobs report for May.
 The worrisome data from the Institute for Supply Management
followed an early report showing the U.S. private-sector added
only 38,000 jobs in May, which cast doubt on the health of the
world's largest economy and undermined the dollar.
 Spot gold  was trading at $1,538.40 an ounce at 3:55
p.m. EDT (1955 GMT) after earlier hitting $1,550.14, its
highest since May 3.
 Benchmark August COMEX futures  rose $6.40 to
finished at $1,543.20 after earlier reaching its highest since
May 2 at $1,551.60 an ounce.
 ""I think we're still with the safe-haven play on gold. Gold
is the only thing that's still up today. People are a bit
afraid of the weak economy and what happened to the dollar,""
said David Lee, precious metals trader at Heraeus Precious
Metals Management in New York.
 U.S. factory activity growth slowed in May to its lowest
level since September 2009, suggesting a loss of momentum in
the economy in the second quarter. [ID:nN01147563]
 The discouraging manufacturing figures from the United
States follow similar reports out of Europe and China.
 A separate report showed growth in U.S. private-sector
payrolls falling to its lowest level in eight months, just two
days before a key monthly government report on employment.
 Investors are looking ahead to U.S. nonfarm payrolls data
due Friday for evidence of the ability of the world's largest
economy to generate jobs, after sluggish data on Wednesday
suggested U.S. growth was losing momentum.
 Gold was vacillating in early business, but once the U.S.
data was released, bullish action in the options pit spilled
over to the futures market, causing a swift rally that held.
 ""You had some very bullish action in the options, which
means we have to buy futures against it. We haven't seen stuff
like this for awhile. But the economic numbers have been pretty
awful,"" said independent metals trader, said Jonathan Jossen on
the COMEX exchange floor in New York.
 ""With what's been going on in the world, I feel gold's been
underperforming,"" he added.
 Gold fell by about 2 percent in May, although the price
remained on track for a near 8 percent gain this year, fueled
in large part by investor nerves over euro zone finances.
 The price of gold in euros  hit a life-time high
of 1,088.11 euros an ounce last week and a record high in
dollars of $1,575.79 an ounce in early May, just before a major
sell-off across the commodities complex. It was up sharply at
1,073.28 an ounce in late business.
 GOLD ETFs SHOW OUTFLOW IN MAY
 Investor demand for gold retreated in May, as reflected in
the net outflow of metal from global exchange-traded funds,
which fell nearly 1 percent last month in their first monthly
decline since February.
 Mexico's central bank moderately expanded its gold holdings
in April, buying 190,000 ounces of gold, worth nearly $282
million based on average spot price of the month, after buying
more than $4 billion in bullion in March.
 White metals, used extensively in the manufacturing and
auto sectors, fell sharply after the slower factory activity
report and as many U.S. auto industry reported far weaker than
expected sales for May. [ID:nN01188471]
 Spot silver  was sharply lower at $36.76 an ounce
than $38.44 at Tuesday's close. U.S. July silver futures 
fell 4 percent to $36.77 in after-hours trade. Silver dropped
over 20 percent in the month of May.
The London Bullion Market Association said it would launch a
silver forward price curve following the launch of its gold
forward price curve <0#XAU=LBMA> in January. [ID:nL9E7EL004]
 U.S. platinum and palladium futures were also down
following declines reported for most major U.S. automakers.
 In late dealings, benchmark platinum futures  lost
$12.70 to $1,821.30 per ounce and palladium futures 
tumbled $6.45 to $772.50 per ounce.
 Spot palladium  slipped to $769.47 an ounce from
$774.10 an ounce on Tuesday, and platinum  slid to
$1,815.24 compared with $1,828.10 the day before.

 SINGAPORE, June 1 (Reuters) - Spot gold edged lower on
Wednesday, as easing worries about the Greek debt crisis
dampened some appetite for bullion, but a weaker dollar is
expected to provide support.	
 Gold came off a four-week high of $1,540.50 hit in the
previous session, as European officials met to sketch out
options for a second bailout package for Greece, boosting
investor risk appetite. [ID:nLDE74U1G7]	
 ""Gold has retraced a little primarily as a result of the
easing in the Greece situation to certain extent,"" said Darren
Heathcote, head of trading at Investec Australia. ""It's given
the market a little bit comfort that we might see a reasonable
resolution.""	
 Spot gold edge down 0.2 percent to $1,532.20 an ounce
by 0604 GMT, after posting a 1.8-percent decline in May. U.S.
gold  lost 0.2 percent to $1,532.90.	
 Technicals suggest that spot gold may retrace to $1,514,
said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. [ID:nL3E7H104I]	
 
 ""Technically, it looks like that gold might be going low,
but I don't see any justification for it to break much below
$1,520,"" said Heathcote of Investec. ""I don't think we are close
to having it (the Greek debt crisis) completely solved yet, and
the market will remain skeptical and well supported.""	
 Supporting sentiment, the dollar edged down against a basket
of currencies as the euro hit a three-week high against
the greenback, on hopes for an agreement on Greece austerity
steps and progress towards a second aid package. 
 Mexico's central bank moderately expanded its gold holdings
in April, buying 190,000 ounces of gold, worth nearly $282

 By Robert Gibbons and Simon Falush
 NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than $2
on Wednesday as disappointing reports on U.S. private sector
employment and manufacturing reinforced concerns that slowing
economic growth will curb petroleum demand.
 U.S. private employers added a paltry 38,000 jobs in May, a
report by ADP Employer Services said, below expectations and
the lowest level since September 2010. [ID:nEAPA10EH0]
 Another industry report showed the pace of U.S.
manufacturing sector growth slowed more than expected to its
lowest level in more than 1-1/2 years. [ID:nN01129608]
 U.S. equities slumped, with major stock indexes posting
their biggest daily decine since August. [.N]
 ""Today's sharp sell-off across the complex developed
largely in response to additional negative economic data in the
form of a disappointing ADP employment report and a bearish ISM
manufacturing index figure,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president at
Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Illinois, said in a note.
 The data arrived ahead of the key U.S. May nonfarm payrolls
report due on Friday and followed news that European
manufacturing growth slipped sharply and China's factories
expanded in May at their slowest pace in at least nine months
[ID:nSLAVGE7UJ] [ID:nL3E7H103M].
 Brent crude for July delivery  fell $2.20 to settle
at $114.53 a barrel, retreating from an earlier $117.28 peak.
 U.S. July crude  fell $2.41 to settle at $100.29 a
barrel, having briefly dipped below $100 a barrel.
 Trading volumes remained tepid, with totals for both Brent
and U.S. crude below 30-day averages.
 Both crude contracts extended losses in post-settlement
trading late on Wednesday after the American Petroleum
Institute (API) said U.S. crude stockpiles rose last week.
 U.S. OIL INVENTORIES IN FOCUS
 U.S. crude oil stockpiles jumped 3.5 million barrels last
week, the API said, against expectations stocks would be lower.
Gasoline stockpiles rose 1.5 million barrels, while distillate
inventories fell 1.4 million barrels, the API report showed.
[API/S]
 Ahead of the API report, a Reuters analyst poll yielded a
forecast for U.S. crude oil stocks to be down 1.3 million
barrels, with distillate stocks expected to be down only
300,000 barrels and gasoline stocks up 800,000 barrels.
 The government's report from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration will follow on Thursday morning.
 Also before the API data, a MasterCard report showed U.S.
retail gasoline demand fell last week versus a year earlier,
though demand was up versus the previous week as drivers geared
up ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend. [ID:nN01189612]
 U.S. gasoline futures  tumbled more than 2 percent,
ending below benchmark distillate heating oil  futures.
 Moody's ratings agency downgraded Greece's credit rating,
helping lift the dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the
greenback against a basket of currencies. [ID:nWNA0007]
 The dollar's earlier weakness did not stem oil's tumble. A
weak dollar usually is supportive to dollar-denominated oil.
 Rising tensions in the Middle East supported oil early,
before the economic data sent prices in retreat.
 Explosions ripped through a northern area of Yemen's
capital and a powerful tribal group backing the ouster of
President Ali Abdullah Saleh battled security forces in the
country that borders Saudi Arabia. [ID:nLDE7500RQ]

 SINGAPORE, June 1 (Reuters) - Brent was steady below $117 a
barrel on Wednesday, supported by disruptions to oil supplies to
top consumer the United States and political upheaval in Yemen,
while weak economic data from the world's largest economy
weighed on the market.	
 Fresh hopes of a new bailout package for debt-laden Greece
lifted the euro to a three-week high against the dollar and
eased concern about fuel demand in the region. [ID:nL3E7H1008]	
 Brent crude  was flat at $116.73 a barrel at 0452
GMT, after touching a three-week high of $117.49 in intraday
trading on Tuesday. The sell-off in commodities earlier in May
led to Brent posting a 7.3 percent loss for the month, its
biggest monthly percentage loss in a year.	
 U.S. crude  gained 21 cents to reach $102.91 a barrel.	
 ""The ongoing tension in Yemen is raising concerns
while crude supply disruptions are also supportive of oil
prices,"" said Singapore-based oil analyst Serene Lim of ANZ
Bank.	
 Pipeline disruptions to U.S. supply have hit the world's
largest oil consumer just as it enters the summer driving
season. 
 TransCanada Corp said it will take several days to
re-open its 591,000 barrel per day (bpd) Keystone oil pipeline
to Cushing, Oklahoma, oil hub after the second spill in less
than a month forced it to shut at the weekend.[ID:nN31283793]	
 Enbridge Inc restored power on Wednesday to three
pumping stations on a 290,000 bpd pipeline that had lost
electricity supply after severe storms. [ID:nN3198856]	
 
 Flashpoints in Yemen have multiplied this week with fighting
in the capital, government troops gunning down protesters in
Taiz in the south and a battle with al Qaeda and Islamic
militants in the coastal city of Zinjibar. [ID:nLDE74U00R]	
 Yemen is a small independent producer, but the concern for
oil markets is of chaos in Yemen, a haven for al Qaeda

exporter Saudi Arabia.	
 Technical analysis for Brent and U.S. crude was bullish,
with 24-hour targets at $118.43 and $105.10 a barrel
respectively, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 
 U.S., CHINA AND EUROPE	
 The growth outlook for the U.S. and China, the world's top
oil importers, weighed on crude.	
 China's official purchasing managers' index hit a nine-month
low in May, a survey showed on Wednesday, reinforcing evidence
that economic growth is slowing under the weight of government
credit curbs and power shortages. [ID:nL3E7H103M]	
 While analysts expect the rate of fuel demand growth in
China to slow this year, investors are wary of any sign of a
sharper than expected slowdown in the country's economy. 
 On Tuesday, U.S. consumer confidence slid in May as
consumers turned more pessimistic on the outlook for the labor
market and inflation worries rose, according to a private sector
report released on Tuesday. [ID:nN9E7G401Y]	
 Also, U.S. single-family home prices dropped in March,
dipping below their 2009 low, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller
composite index of 20 metropolitan areas. 
 The euro gained slightly on Wednesday on a report
that the European Union, International Monetary Fund and
European Central Bank were expected to finalise a financial aid
package for Greece in the coming days. 
A weaker dollar supports the prices of commodities
denominated in the U.S. currency by making them cheaper for
holders of other currencies.	
 U.S. crude inventories fell last week as imports declined, a
preliminary Reuters poll ahead of weekly industry and government
reports on Wednesday and Thursday. 
 The data releases were delayed for a day because of the U.S.
Memorial Day holiday on Monday.

 By Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, May 31 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose 2 percent on
Tuesday, lifted by the closure of a pipeline carrying Canadian
crude to the United States and a decline in the dollar on new
hopes for a debt bailout for Greece.
 Both Brent and U.S. crude prices reached three-week highs
intraday, but still posted monthly declines for May that were
the biggest in a year in percentage terms.
 TransCanada Corp  on Sunday shut its 591,000 barrel
per day (bpd) Keystone crude oil export pipeline, for the
second time in less than a month, due to a small leak in
Kansas. The company had no estimate for when the pipeline,
which runs from Alberta to the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point
 ""In case of a longer disruption, we might see a noticeable
crude stock draw in Cushing in next week's US inventory
reports,"" said JBC Energy in a note.
 Adding to the crude supply problems, storm-related power
outages shut down a number of Enbridge Inc's  oil
pipelines in the U.S. Upper Midwest, although throughput was
being restored on Tuesday, the company said. [ID:nN31299604]
 Brent crude for July delivery  rose $2.05 to settle
at $116.73 a barrel, off its $117.49 intraday peak.
 Brent posted a 7.3 percent loss in May, its biggest monthly
percentage loss since May 2010.
 U.S. July crude  rose $2.11 to settle at $102.70 a
barrel, having moved above its 20-day moving average of
$100.76.
 U.S. crude lost 9.9 percent in May, also its biggest
monthly percentage loss since May 2010. Both Brent and U.S.
crude contracts have been rebounding from a commodities
sell-off earlier in May.
 Brent and U.S. crude oil trading volumes were on pace on
Tuesday to end the day below 30-day averages.
 The euro  rose to a three-week high against the
dollar as the European Union stepped up efforts to draft a
second bailout package for Greece. [ID:nL3E7GV07I]
 U.S. June gasoline  and heating oil  also saw
price gains as the contracts expired on Tuesday.
 Oil's gains came despite disappointing reports showing
falling U.S. home prices, a drop in U.S. consumer confidence in
May and much slower growth than expected in the U.S. Midwest.
[ID:nN31289567]
 The less-than-steller data came ahead of Friday's closely
watched U.S. May non-farm payrolls report.
 Oil prices also received a lift from the end of a truce
between tribal groups and forces loyal to Yemen's President Ali
Abdullah Saleh. [ID:nLDE74U00R]
 Street fighting raged across the Yemeni capital after the
breakdown of the truce, edging the Arab country that borders
Saudi Arabia closer to civil war.

the (Midwest business activity) and consumer confidence data
took away some of the momentum,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at
PFGBest Research in Chicago, commenting on oil's choppy
trajectory.

 By Carole Vaporean and Amanda Cooper
 NEW YORK/LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - Gold fell slightly in
lackluster, post-holiday trade after touching its highest price
in nearly four weeks on Tuesday, as new hopes for a debt
bailout for Greece restored confidence in riskier assets.
 There was plenty of interest on both sides. These days,
some investors are seeking a safe haven asset, while others are
looking for the so-called risk-on trade, analysts said.
 ""You have the fight-to-quality camp, but those investors
are disappointed today coming back from a long weekend and
seeing the euro up over a full penny,"" said Adam Klopfenstein,
Senior Market Strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.
 ""There will be some buying from investors looking for the
risk-on trade, when all commodities rally along with equities,""
he added.
 Upon reopening from the U.S. Memorial Day and a UK bank
holidays, spot gold  rose to an early high of $1,540.50
per ounce, its loftiest since May 4, but pulled back to
$1,534.40 by 3:26 p.m. EDT (2026 GMT). It finished Monday at
$1,537.95.
 Benchmark August COMEX futures  lost 50 cents to
close at $1,536.80 per ounce. The outgoing June gold contract
 settled 40 cents lower at $1,535.90 an ounce.
 For the month, gold is down 1.82 percent, hanging below a
lifetime high at $1,575.79 touched early in the month. Although
it has been a beneficiary of investor nervousness over Greece,
it has struggled to retain gains.

 The Wall Street Journal reported Germany was considering
dropping its push for an early rescheduling of Greek bonds in
order to facilitate a new package of aid loans to prevent
Athens from defaulting on its debt. [ID:nL3E7GU21K]
 A drop in the dollar did little to spur demand for gold,
but helped to buffer the downside. Gold usually moves inversely
to the U.S. currency, but the improved risk appetite left
bullion somewhat sidelined. [USD/]
 ""At least to some degree, the sovereign debt issues with
Greece and the other peripheral EU countries have been pretty
well documented, so it's not necessarily a surprise for the
market,"" HSBC analyst James Steel said.
 ""Gold has been rallying since the middle of May and is
actually some 60-odd dollars higher from the recent low, so it
hasn't done too badly.""
 Gold's losses were minimized by buying elsewhere in
commodity markets and in equity markets, which were lifted by
prospects of financial aid for Greece even as disappointing
data on U.S. home prices, consumers and regional manufacturing
raised concerns that the U.S. economy's soft patch could become
protracted. [ID:nN31289567]
 GOLD STILL SOUGHT
 Recent increases in risk aversion have translated into
greater interest in owning gold, as reflected in last week's
net rise in global holdings of the metal in the world's largest
exchange-traded funds, the first weekly gain in a month.
 Gold holdings are down by more than 500,000 ounces this
month and down 0.68 percent year-to-date, but bullion ETFs have
lured more cash in May than other precious metals.
 Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed that speculators raised their gold holdings for the
first time since mid-April last week, bringing futures open
interest to its highest since April 19.
 Silver  ended up 1 percent at $38.40 an ounce.
Despite the day's gains, silver was down about 20 percent in
May -- its biggest monthly decline since August 2008 -- after
setting a record $49.51 in April.
 Platinum fetched $1,825.05 an ounce, well above $1,796.35
previously, while palladium rose about 3 percent to $775.75.
 This month, platinum fell nearly 2.5 percent and palladium
off almost 2 percent.

U.S. May consumer confidence data disappointed [ID:nN9E7G401Y]
and business activity in the Midwest grew by less than expected
in May. [ID:nN9E7G401Z]
 But the weaker dollar helped put a floor under oil prices,
analysts said. The dollar <.DXY> was down 0.57 percent against a
basket of currencies at 1411 GMT. A weaker dollar makes oil
cheaper for those holding other currencies.
 Roy Jordan, research associate at Facts Global Energy, said
the dollar was being weighed down by the relatively weak
economic data that has come out over the last few days.
 ""There has been an inverse correlation between oil and the
dollar over the past month,"" added Thorbjorn Bak Jensen, oil
analyst at Global Risk Management. 
 U.S. crude has also gained support from the temporary
closure of the 591,000-barrel-a-day Keystone pipeline, which
carries oil from Alberta to U.S. oil hub Cushing
[ID:nN31283793].
 ""While the shutdown was implemented around midnight
following a leak, it is still unclear when operations will be
resumed,"" said analysts at JBC Energy in a note. ""In case of a
longer disruption, we might see a noticeable crude stockdraw in
Cushing in next week's US inventory reports.""
 Brent is similarly being supported by production problems in
the North Sea which are disrupting the Forties programme.
 Bak Jensen also pointed to Germany's decision to cease
producing electricity from nuclear power plants by 2023. ""Over
20 percent of their electricity comes from nuclear power at the
moment so this will give support to coal and oil as well as
alternative energy,"" he said. [ID:nLDE74U0OD] [ID:nLDE74T16Q]
 Despite the rally as traders in London and New York returned
to their desks after a long weekend, both oil contracts are
still down for the month of May.
 Brent is down about 8.7 percent and U.S. crude is down about
10.8 percent following a broad commodities sell-off at the start
of the month.
 
 OPEC FOCUS
 The market's focus is now turning to the upcoming OPEC
meeting in Vienna in June. Analysts JBC Energy believe an
increase in output allocations of 2-2.5 million barrels per day
would be justified given the current fundamental situation.
 ""Nevertheless, the outcome of the meeting will once again
depend strongly on OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia's stance on the
issue, with the Middle Eastern country holding some three
quarters of the group's idle capacity,"" they said in a note.
 Oil was supported by the end of a truce between tribal
groups and forces loyal to Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh,
which brings the country closer to civil war. [ID:nLDE74U00R]
""It's providing continued support to oil prices and
protection to the downside,"" Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at
Commerzbank said.
 Yemen's Saleh has refused to step down despite efforts by
regional nations to broker a departure amid widespread protests,
causing concern that unrest may spill into neighbouring states.
[ID:nLDE74S0JS]
 ""Yemen is regarded as a centre of the al Qaeda terror
network and directly borders with Saudi Arabia, the world's
largest oil producer,"" said Commerzbank analysts. ""Consequently,
there is a high risk of unrest destabilising the entire region.""

 SINGAPORE, May 31 (Reuters) - Brent rose above $115 a barrel
on Tuesday as the dollar weakened on improved prospects of a
bailout for debt-laden Greece, but oil remained on track for a
fall in May, snapping a record eight-month winning streak.	
 The euro rose to three-week high against the dollar as the

said Tony Nunan, a Tokyo-based risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp.	
 ""As for Libya, unless there is a big break through such as
(Muammar) Gadaffi stepping down, Libya is going to be out (of
the oil export business) for a while. That would continue to be
a bullish factor.""

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, May 31 (Reuters) - Gold held near its highest in
almost four weeks in volatile trade on Tuesday as lingering
fears about a Greek debt default overshadowed a rebound in the
euro, while silver was heading for its biggest monthly decline
since 2008.	
 A Wall Street Journal report that Germany could make
concessions on efforts to put together a bailout for Greece
lifted the single currency, but analysts said Grece's debt
crisis deterred investors from searching out higher risk assets.	
 Spot gold hit an intraday high of $1,540.36, its
highest since May 4, before slipping to $1,536.59 an ounce by
0536 GMT, down 0.09 percent. Gold is down 1.7 percent so far in
May, hovering below a lifetime high around $1,575 touched early
in the month. 
 ""It's crucial for markets to see whether Greece is actually
sustainable and whether it can actually obtain the next 12
billion euros that is required for them to meet their funding
needs in July,"" said Ong Yi Ling, investment analyst at Phillip
Futures in Singapore.	
 ""I think silver was going up too fast and within too short a
period of time. But I think on a longer-term basis after the
sell off, you see that investors are slowly coming back."" 
 Silver was barely changed at $38.12 an ounce, but the
metal is down around 20 percent in May -- its biggest monthly
decline since 2008. Silver struck record at $49.51 an ounce in
April.	
 The European Union is racing to draft a second bailout
package for Greece to release vital loans next month and avert
the risk of the euro zone country defaulting, EU officials said
on Monday. [ID:nLDE74T0LG]	
 Germany is considering dropping its push for an early
rescheduling of Greek bonds in order to facilitate a new package
of aid loans for Greece, the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing people familiar with the matter. [ID:nL3E7GU21K] 
 The euro rose as high as $1.4407 , its highest in
three weeks, piercing its 55-day moving average of $1.4334 and
also $1.4373, the top of the Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart.

 
 The physical market lacked activity, but some speculators
could be tempted to cash in on gold's gains. Demand from top
consumer India was likely to ease as the wedding season comes to
an end. 
 Indian parents customarily give gold jewellery as gifts.	
 ""It's a very quiet start,"" said a dealer in Singapore.	
 ""But we saw two-way business yesterday. Thailand and
Indonesia were sellers, while the Indians were the buyers. We
also saw speculators buying silver."" 
 In other markets, The Nikkei rose on predictions of strong
industrial output in the coming months, while solar-energy
shares gained on news that Germany will shut all its nuclear
reactors by 2022. 
 Credit rating agency Moody's during the midday break placed
Japan's sovereign ratings on review for possible downgrade,
citing concerns about a weak policy response to faltering
economic growth prospects. [ID:nT9E7GH024]

 LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil fell below $115
a barrel on Monday, heading for its first monthly decline this
year, as investors weighed the prospect that Europe's debt
crisis and a sputtering U.S. economy may slow demand.
 Public holidays in the United States and the UK on Monday
kept trading volume at less than 5 percent the daily norm. The
U.S. driving season, The U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend
marks the official beginning of summer driving season, when
gasoline demand usually rises.
 Brent crude  slipped 35 or 0.3 percent cents to
$114.54 a barrel by 2022 GMT, having held above the first
technical support level of $114. Prices are down 9 percent for
the month of May, the biggest decline since May of last year.
 U.S. crude  dropped 21 cents to $100.38 in late
trading. The New York Mercantile Exchange will not issue a
settlement price on Monday, with all trading registered for May
31.
 ""Trading volume is very thin with the UK and U.S. markets
not in. The only factor that I can see is a slightly firmer
U.S. dollar, which may put pressure on prices,"" said Carsten
Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank.

 The euro eased on Monday, pulling away from a key chart

 A stronger dollar can reduce investor demand for
dollar-denominated commodities such as oil.
 Oil traders remained focused on gasoline. Gasoline futures
soared on Friday in anticipation of higher demand this summer,
but gains were limited as a plunge in U.S. home sales added to
worries about the pace of U.S. economic recovery. RBOB futures
 added 0.1 percent on Monday.
 A U.S. government report last week showed gasoline demand
over the previous four weeks was down 2.1 percent on the year
and inventories rose more than expected. Nonetheless, some
analysts see potential for prices to gain strength.
 ""There are expectations of prices picking up purely because
of the drive time in the U.S.,"" said Jonathan Barratt of
Commodity Broking Services in Sydney. ""We feel that might
actually support crude prices.""
 Brent crude is up about 20 percent this year, boosted by
fighting in Libya that has halted its oil exports and unrest in
North Africa and the Middle East. High energy costs have
sparked global concern as they are a drag on economic growth.
 While the conflict in Libya has almost shut down oil output
in what used to be Africa's third-largest producer, supply from
all 12 members of OPEC is expected to rise in May, according to
a Reuters survey on Friday. [OPEC/O]

 By Jonathan Leff
 NEW YORK, May 30 (Reuters) - Gold held steady at an over
three-week high and silver edged up in anemic trade on Monday,
buoyed by expectations of further debt woes in the euro zone.
 With national holidays in the United States and Britain
sapping liquidity, trading volume in U.S. futures was less than
one-tenth its norm. In Asia, traders said a hike in margins by
the Shanghai Gold Exchange kept sentiment in check.
 The focus for now is Europe, where concerns over Greek debt
have helped reignite gold's rally after an abrupt collapse in
commodity markets at the start of May. For the month, gold is
down about 1.6 percent, on track for its first monthly decline
in four months.
 The European Union urgently worked on a second bailout
package for Greece in a race to release vital loans next month
and avert the risk of the euro zone member defaulting. Greece's
conservative opposition meanwhile demanded lower taxes as a
condition for consensus with the Socialist government on
further austerity measures. [ID:nLDE74T0059]
 ""Given the current state of political and economic affairs
in Europe, is there any reason to believe that at the margin --
and perhaps at the very center -- money shall do anything other
than to leave the euro and to gravitate toward gold?"" long-time
investor Dennis Gartman wrote on Monday.
 The answer, he asserted, was negative, noting that both
fundamental and technical signals had encouraged him to buy on
the dips, adding to his gold holdings in non-dollar terms.
 The euro eased on Monday, pulling away from a key chart
resistance as uncertainty over Greece's debt crisis kept
investors on edge, while the dollar stabilized following a
slide late last week. [USD/]
 Spot gold  rose $1.56 or 0.1 percent to $1,537.95 an
ounce by 2030 GMT after jumping more than 1 percent on Friday.
U.S. gold  gained $2.80 to $1,539.10
 Spot silver  rose 0.5 percent to $38.05 an ounce,
extending last week's 8.1 percent rise. U.S. silver 
gained 0.6 percent to $38.10. Silver is down more than 20
percent in May, its worst showing since the midst of the
financial crisis in August 2008.
 After downbeat U.S. consumer spending and home sales data
last week, traders will scrutinize U.S. and German jobs numbers
and euro zone inflation figures this week to determine whether
they should pare back risk ahead of the end of the $600 billion
Treasury purchases (QE2) in June. [ID:nLDE74Q128]

 The Shanghai bourse plans to temporarily increase margins
on gold and silver forward contracts on settlement at June 2

 ""The margin hike in Shanghai Gold Exchange is adding
pressure to prices,"" said Peter Fung, head of dealing at Wing
Fung Precious Metals in Hong Kong.
 Fung said $1,500 should offer strong support to gold, and
prices are likely to reach $1,600 by the end of the year as
investors continue to buy bullion to protect themselves against
economic uncertainties.
 However, technical analysis suggested that spot gold may
retrace to $1,513, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.

 By Seng Li Peng	
 SINGAPORE, May 30 (Reuters) - Brent crude edged below $115 a
barrel on Monday on expectations that OPEC's oil output in May
would come in higher than April, with investors also focused on
demand from top consumer the United States as the summer driving
season begins.	
 Brent  fell 8 cents to $114.95 a barrel while U.S.
crude  fell 8 cents to $100.52 at 0409 GMT.	
 More oil from top exporter Saudi Arabia and fellow OPEC
members Nigeria and Iraq should push the producer-group's total
output higher and more than compensate for a further fall in
Libyan supply in May, a Reuters survey found on Friday.
[ID:nLDE74Q1RF]	
 The U.S. driving season traditionally kicks off on the
weekend of Memorial Day, a public holiday taking place on
Monday. London traders were also out on Monday for a public
holiday there, so trading would likely be thin.	
 As motorists drive out on vacation, U.S. gasoline demand
reaches its annual peak. With uncertainty over the strength of
the recovery in the world's largest economy and with high U.S.
gasoline prices a matter of concern for President Barack Obama,
demand for the fuel will be closely watched.	
 ""There are expectations of prices picking up purely because
of the drive time in the U.S.,"" said Jonathan Barratt of
Commodity Broking Services managing director in Sydney. ""We feel
that might actually support crude prices.""	
 Still, government data ahead of the driving season last week
showed gasoline demand over the previous four weeks down 2
percent on the year.	
 High energy costs have sparked global concern as a drag on
economic growth. A slowdown in economic expansion would in turn
slow the growth in demand for fuel.	
 In France, the Group of Eight world leaders agreed that the
global economic recovery was becoming more ""self-sustained"",
although they said higher commodity prices were hampering
further growth. [ID:nLDE74P0DD]	
 
 MIDDLE EAST	
 Fighting in Libya has almost shut down output in
what used to be Africa's third-largest producer, but supply from
all 12 members of OPEC is expected to average 28.90 million
barrels per day (bpd) this month to help cover the gap.	
 This is up from a revised 28.79 million bpd in April, the
Reuters survey of oil companies, OPEC officials and analysts
found.	
 Ongoing unrest in small, independent oil producer Yemen has
had limited influence on oil prices. Yemeni forces loyal to
President Ali Abdullah Saleh opened fire on protesters in the
southern city of Taiz on Sunday, killing at least six people and
wounding 120, hospital sources said. 
 In the capital Sanaa, seven explosions were heard on Sunday
night in the district of Hasaba, the scene of week-long fighting
between Saleh's forces and a rival tribe in which 115 people
were killed, residents said. [ID:nLDE74S0JS]

 By Carole Vaporean and Pratima Desai
 NEW YORK/LONDON, May 27 (Reuters) - Gold prices stayed near
three-week highs late into Friday's session, as worries about
Greece's debt crisis encouraged buying by investors looking for
relative safety and a softer dollar underpinned sentiment.
 ""Today is a continuation of the mild risk-on tone that the
market went into mid-week, with some caution. But there's
clearly been a move up in the last two sessions,"" said Rick
Bensignor, a chief strategist at Dahlman Rose in New York.
 Spot gold  hit $1,538.10 a troy ounce, its highest
since May 4. It remained close to that peak at $1,535.60 as of
3:26 p.m. EDT (2026 GMT). Thursday's late New York bid was
$1,518.10.
 Benchmark COMEX June gold futures  settled up $13.50
per ounce at $1,536.30, near their highest levels since May 4.
 Gold's appeal has been boosted in recent weeks by worries
about debt contagion spreading from Greece to Ireland, Portugal
and Spain.
 London and New York commodity and financial markets will be
shut on Monday for holidays, and many players regarded Friday
as the last trading day of the month.
 The day's strong close bodes well for the yellow metal.
 Based on Friday's action, Bensignor said, technical
patterns suggest gold will set a new peak as long as the metal
starts higher on Tuesday and the open is not the session high.
 ""I have a short-term breakout targeting $1,597, which would
be the new all-time high. But it might take a little time to
get there,"" the strategist said.

 ""The chances of debt default by Greece are rising,"" a
trader said, adding higher oil prices were also helping gold.
 Gold is used by investors as a hedge against inflation,
which is often triggered by rising oil prices.
 Meanwhile, a steep decline in pending sales of existing
U.S. homes provided gold with added safe-haven appeal. April
home sales dropped far more than expected to a seven-month low,
dealing a blow to hopes of a recovery in the housing market.
 But U.S. consumer sentiment improved in May as job gains
offset high gasoline prices.

 NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices regained their
footing near the close to end slightly higher on Friday,
finding support from gasoline futures, which soared in
anticipation of higher demand this summer driving season.
 Gains were limited, however, as a plunge in U.S. home sales
added to festering economic worries, erasing much of the day's
earlier gains sparked by a weaker dollar.
 Gasoline futures rose for the sixth straight session, ahead
of the summer driving season that kicks off with the long
Memorial Day holiday weekend.
 Industry data showed pending sales of existing U.S. homes
fell more than expected in April to hit a seven-month low,
dashing hopes for a recovery in the vital housing market.
[ID:nN27109401]
 The report capped the week's series of disappointing news
about the economy that has kept U.S. crude shackled near $100,
after recovering from a $20 fall three weeks ago.
 ""The weak home sales data signifies the U.S. economy is
sputtering rather than improving nicely,"" said Gene McGillian,
analyst, at Tradition Energy, in Stamford, Connecticut
 ""U.S. crude has hit over $100, but is having a hard time
moving further up because of economic uncertainty,"" he added.
 U.S. crude for July delivery  settled at $100.59 a
barrel, up 36 cents. For the week, U.S. crude  gained
$1.10, or 1.12 percent.
 In London, ICE Brent for July delivery  settled at
$115.03 a barrel, off 2 cents. For the week, Brent crude gained
$2.64, or 2.35 percent.
 Pre-holiday volume was light, with U.S. crude tallying
375,000 lots, 42 percent below the 30-day average, with about
an hour left in the day's trade.
 Brent volume was about 270,000 lots, down 39 percent from
the 30-day average.

 By Francis Kan	
 SINGAPORE, May 27 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose on Friday,
hovering above $115 a barrel, as a softer dollar and persistent
Middle East tensions tempered demand worries triggered by euro
zone debt concerns and weak U.S. economic data.	
 The dollar fell across the board, hitting a record low
against the Swiss franc and a three-year low versus the New
Zealand dollar, with traders citing talk of dollar selling by
model funds and U.S. banks, as well as Asian sovereign players.

 ""The immediate factor impacting crude's trade direction is
the U.S. dollar, which is helping to support prices,"" Victor
Shum, an analyst at Purvin & Gertz, said in Singapore. A softer
dollar makes commodities priced in the greenback more attractive
to consumers using other currencies.	
 ""It's also the Memorial Day holiday in the U.S. on Monday,
and most traders wouldn't want to be caught short over the long
weekend."" 
 Brent crude  rose 21 cents to $115.26 a barrel by
0611 GMT. U.S. crude  was up 50 cents at $100.73, after
falling more than 1 percent on Thursday.	
 Both benchmarks were headed for monthly losses in May,
snapping eight-month winning streaks. 
 According to technical charts, a bullish target at $118.43
per barrel was intact for Brent crude, while U.S. oil was
expected to zigzag up to $104.60 per barrel, said Reuters market
analyst Wang Tao. [ID:nL3E7GR04S] [ID:nL3E7GR049]	
 
 But demand concerns stemming from the euro zone debt crisis
and disappointing data from top energy consumer United States
kept a lid on oil price gains.	
 Markets were spooked by the possibility of a Greek default
after the head of euro zone finance ministers, Jean-Claude
Juncker, said the IMF could deny Greece the next tranche of aid.	
 Juncker's spokesman, however, later clarified that if
European and IMF inspectors were convinced by new Greek
austerity measures, there would be no problem with the June aid
tranche. [ID:nLDE74P1HC]	
 ""There's no question that the euro zone is adding to the
volatility of crude futures. If the IMF appoints a new head
quickly that might add some clarity to the situation which would
support the euro and weaken the dollar,"" said Shum.	
 The post of IMF managing director is up for grabs since
Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Kahn, arrested on May 14 on charges
of attempting to rape a New York hotel maid, quit.	
 China joined other increasingly powerful but less developed
nations to challenge an understanding in the recruitment process
that has kept the top job in European hands ever since the IMF
was created after World War Two. [ID:nLDE74P1K7]	
 Weak economic data from U.S. overnight also sparked fresh
concerns about oil demand.	
 Unexpectedly weak consumer spending hobbled the U.S. economy
in the first quarter, with GDP coming in at an annual 1.8
percent which was less than expected, corporate profits shrank
and there were fresh signs of a slowdown in the labor market -
pointing to an uphill struggle for recovery.[ID:nN26233734]

 SUPPLY DISRUPTION FEARS	
 The risk of further supply disruptions in North Africa and

 SINGAPORE, May 27 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Friday as
mounting worries about a Greece debt default prompted buying
from investors, while silver gained more than 2 percent after
tumbling from a two-week top in the previous session. 
 Gold may revisit a recent three-week top before profit
taking kicks in, while silver -- which has outpaced gold and is
heading for its best weekly gain since late April at more than 7
percent -- will continue seeing volatile price movements,
analysts said. 
 Spot gold added $5.60 to $1,523.70 an ounce by 0517
GMT as Greece fights to avoid a debt restructuring. Gold touched
a record around $1,575 in early May. 
 ""It's still the expectation that there's a possibility for a
Greece default and greater safe-haven buying coming to the
precious metals such as gold and silver,"" said Ong Yi Ling,
investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.	
 ""With gold prices actually close to a three-week high, then
perhaps you could also see some profit taking and some closing
of the bullish position later in the day,"" she said.	
 Silver rose 27 cents to $37.51 an ounce in thin
trade after hitting a high around $38. It had rallied to a
two-week high at $38.84 on Thursday before hitting a low around
$36 as speculators booked profits. Silver struck record at
$49.51 an ounce in April.	
 ""I guess for silver, it's a lot of speculation and a lot of
volatile movements. I would expect that to continue. We're not
seeing the longer-term investors really coming back into the
market yet,"" said Ong of Phillip Futures.	
 ""It's pretty much speculation and volatility going forward.""
 
 
 Holdings on the largest silver-backed ETF, New York's
iShares Silver Trust , dropped 0.51 percent earlier this
week and remained unchanged at 9,941.33 tonnes on Thursday.

 Holdings have fallen by nearly 9 million ounces this week
alone, bringing year-to-date outflow to 8.4 percent, or 42.79
million ounces.	
 The gold-silver ratio, used to measure how many ounces of
silver can buy one ounce of gold, was at about 40 after falling
to around 31 in late April, its weakest since early 1980s.	
 Precious metal prices continued to be supported by jitters
over Greece's debt problems that could have a big ripple effect
across other high risk-European countries struggling with gaping
fiscal deficits. [ID:nLDE74O1MZ] 
 The International Monetary Fund could withhold the next
slice of aid to Greece due next month, the head of euro zone
finance ministers said on Thursday, spooking markets with the
possibility of a default. [ID:nLDE74P1HC]	
 Overall trading was slow in the bullion market ahead of the
U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend. COMEX June gold futures
rose $3.3 an ounce to $1,526.1 an ounce.	
 The dollar tumbled broadly on Friday after weak U.S.
economic data dragged the 10-year Treasury yield down to a
six-month low overnight, with the greenback's drop gaining steam
on a flurry of stop-loss selling. 
 ""I think people are cautious about silver after seeing what
happened yesterday. There's only a slight amount of physical
buying. It's a holiday in the U.S. next week, so people may
square off positions tonight,"" said a dealer in Hong Kong.	
 ""But I think sentiment is still bullish for gold because of
the problems in Greece.""	
 
 PLATINUM, PALLADIUM TRACK GOLD HIGHER 
 Gains in gold lifted platinum around 1 percent to a
high of $1,784 an ounce, but activity in the physical market has
yet to pick up in Japan after the devastating earthquake,
tsunami and nuclear disaster in March.	
 Platinum bars were offered at a discount of $1.5 to the spot
London prices, unchanged from last month. Platinum and palladium
are mainly used in catalytic converters to cut
climate-warming vehicle emissions.	
 Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co saw
their global production slump to around half of year-ago levels
in April after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc
with their supply chains. [ID:nL3E7GR0GL]	
 In other markets, the Nikkei ended lower on Friday, while
Brent crude rose on a softer dollar and tensions in the Middle
East.

 SINGAPORE, May 27 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose on Friday,
hovering above $115 a barrel, as a softer dollar and persistent
Middle East tensions tempered demand worries triggered by euro
zone debt concerns and weak U.S. economic data.	
 The euro fell to a record low against the Swiss franc
on worries that Greece was again teetering on the brink of a
financial crisis, while the dollar index ticked down 0.6
percent, dented by data showing the U.S. economy grew less than
expected in the first quarter. 
 ""The immediate factor impacting crude's trade direction is
the U.S. dollar, which is helping to support prices,"" Victor
Shum, an analyst at Purvin & Gertz, said in Singapore. A softer
dollar makes commodities priced in the greenback more attractive
to consumers using other currencies.	
 ""It's also the Memorial Day holiday in the U.S., and most
traders wouldn't want to be caught short over the long weekend.""	
 Brent crude  rose 28 cents to $115.33 a barrel by
0319 GMT. U.S. crude  was up 45 cents at $100.68, after
falling more than 1 percent on Thursday.	
 Both benchmarks were headed for monthly losses in May,
snapping eight-month winning streaks. 
 According to technical charts, a bullish target at $118.43
per barrel is intact for Brent crude, while U.S. oil may zigzag
up to $104.60 per barrel, as a rebound that started from the May
17 low of $95.02 has not completed, said Reuters market analyst
Wang Tao. [ID:nL3E7GR04S] [ID:nL3E7GR049]	
 
 But demand concerns stemming from the euro zone debt crisis
and disappointing data from top energy consumer United States
kept a lid on oil price gains.	
 Markets were spooked by the possibility of a Greek default
after the head of euro zone finance ministers Jean-Claude
Juncker said the IMF could deny Greece the next tranche of aid.	
 Juncker's spokesman, however, later clarified that if
European and IMF inspectors were convinced by new Greek
austerity measures, there would be no problem with the June aid
tranche. [ID:nLDE74P1HC]	
 ""There's no question that the euro zone is adding to the
volatility of crude futures. If the IMF appoints a new head
quickly that might add some clarity to the situation which would
support the euro and weaken the dollar,"" said Shum.	
 The post of IMF managing director is up for grabs since
Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Kahn, arrested on May 14 on charges
of attempting to rape a New York hotel maid, quit.	
 China joined other increasingly powerful but less developed
nations to challenge an understanding in the recruitment process
that has kept the top job in European hands ever since the IMF
was created after World War Two. [ID:nLDE74P1K7]	
 Weak economic data from U.S. overnight also sparked fresh
concerns about oil demand.	
 Unexpectedly weak consumer spending hobbled the U.S. economy
in the first quarter, with GDP coming in at an annual 1.8
percent which was less than expected, corporate profits shrank
and there were fresh signs of a slowdown in the labor market -
pointing to an uphill struggle for recovery.[ID:nN26233734]

 SUPPLY DISRUPTION FEARS	
 The risk of further supply disruptions in North Africa and
the Middle gained traction again as ongoing conflicts in Yemen
and the Libya showed no signs of respite.	
 In the Middle East, Yemen stood precariously on the verge of
civil war on Friday as President Ali Abdullah Saleh defied calls
from opponents and world leaders for him to relinquish power.

 Uncertainty over pan-Arab protests and Libya's conflict
pushed Brent to a 32-month peak last month, and has effectively
put a floor under prices, analysts said.

 NEW YORK, May 26 (Reuters) - U.S. crude fell more than 1
percent on Thursday as the U.S. economy grew less than expected
in the first quarter, stoking fresh worries about oil demand.
 Other U.S. economic data showing corporate profits shrank
while weekly jobless benefit claims rose signaled a tough slog
ahead to regain recovery momentum, further pressuring crude.
 On the other side of the Atlantic, Brent crude eked out a
tiny gain, as a weaker dollar supported and as geopolitical
worries about the Middle East and North Africa persisted.
 ""Today's U.S. first quarter GDP estimate is disappointing
and the job claims numbers were soft,"" said Bill O'Grady, chief
market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St.
Louis, Missouri.
 The latest U.S. growth estimate for the first quarter
showed an unrevised 1.8 percent rise, but that was below
expectations, and corporate profits unexpectedly shrank while
weekly jobless benefit claims rose. [ID:nN26233734]
 U.S. crude for July delivery  settled $1.09 lower, or
1.08 percent, at $100.23 a barrel. In London, ICE July Brent
crude  edged up 12 cents to close at $115.05.
 U.S. crude's discount against Brent crude rose to $14.82,
the highest since May 16, from $13.61 at Wednesday's close.

 Trading was choppy in a day that saw prices mostly lower,
erasing much of the 2 percent gain on Wednesday on the back of
a sharp fall in U.S. distillate inventories.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a global
commodities benchmark, was back down 0.3 percent late in the
day, after having moved near flat earlier as the dollar
weakened.
 In late afternoon trade, the dollar was down 0.50 percent
against a basket of major currencies. <.DXY>.
 With the end of the day's trading still more than an hour
away, U.S. crude's volume was near its 30-day average. In
London, Brent's volume was down about 20 percent from its
30-day average.
 GASOLINE REVS UP, MARKET DIP PROBABLY SHORT-LIVED?
 Going against crude, U.S. gasoline for June delivery 
closed up 3.21 cents at $3.0483 a gallon, gaining for the fifth
straight day.
 The gasoline crack spread, which reflects refinery profit
from processing crude into fuel, rose to the day's high of
$26.31 a barrel, up from Wednesday's $24.12 and posting the
highest since May 16's peak at $30.33.
 The rise was prompted by expectations of better motor fuel
demand, ahead of coming U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend that
kicks off the summer driving season.
 News of Midwest refinery troubles involving Exxon Mobil's
 238,000 barrel-per-day plant in Joliet, Illinois, and
Marathon Oil's  206,000 bpd facility in Robinson,
Illinois, kept gasoline futures supported, traders said.
 While crude prices were down most of the day, analysts said
further declines may be short-lived, citing longer-term
prospects.
 They noted Goldman Sachs on Tuesday raised its year-end
target for Brent to $120 per barrel from $105, and its 2012
forecast to $140 from $120, saying it expects fuel demand
growth will sap global supply and strain OPEC's spare oil
output capacity. [ID:nL3E7GO153]
 They also cited support from U.S. equities, which rose for
a second day despite the day's disappointing data, helped by
gains in technology shares. [.N]
 ""We are still viewing yesterday's advance (in oil futures)
to two-week highs as a sufficient alteration to the chart
picture to preclude the development of fresh lows any time
soon,"" said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch &
Associates in Galena, Illinois.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - Gold finished lower on
Thursday, led by a drop in euro-priced bullion after the single
European currency came under sudden pressure on heightened
concerns over euro zone debt issues, although safe-haven buying
limited its declines.
 The euro fell early, with traders citing a report quoting
the Euro Group's Jean-Claude Juncker as saying the
International Monetary Fund may not release its next tranche
for Greece on June 29. [ID:nLDE74P1Z2] [USD/]
 The euro surrendered most of its gains against the U.S.
dollar, after earlier climbing above $1.42 on a news report
that China is interested in buying bailout bonds for Portugal.
 Spot gold  trimmed its decline to $1,520.40 an ounce,
from the two-day low at $1,514.34 hit earlier. On Wednesday,
bullion prices rose to $1,532.10 their strongest since May 4.
 The upward trend established since a commodities sell-off
earlier this month, however, remained intact, analysts said.
 Benchmark COMEX June gold futures  also pared earlier
losses to settle down $3.90, or 0.26 percent, at $1,522.80 per
ounce. Earlier, the contract slipped to a two-day low at
$1,514.60. It reached its highest since May 4 on Wednesday.
 ""Market sentiment towards gold has become more positive
over the past few days, as illustrated by the resumption of net
inflows into ETFs,"" said BNP Paribas analyst Anne-Laure
Tremblay.
 ""I believe that the gold price will trend higher from its
current levels in 2011,"" she said, adding the other key drivers
of the gold price this year were still present.
 Gold has risen by more than 7 percent so far this year, in
dollar terms, fueled by investor concern over the euro zone
debt burden, violence in the Middle East and the fragility of
the U.S. economic recovery.
 While the euro zone debt issues overshadowed U.S. economic
concerns, gold found additional support from unexpectedly weak
consumer spending data that hobbled the U.S. economy in the
first quarter, as well as fresh signs of a slowdown in job
creation. [ID:nN26233734]
 First quarter U.S. gross domestic product growth was
unrevised at annual rate of 1.8 percent, and new U.S. claims
for jobless benefits unexpectedly climbed to 424,000 last week.
[ID:nN26234110] [ID:nCAT005446]
 Euro-denominated gold  slid by about 0.7 percent
on the day, but held at 1,075.57 euros by session end, and was
still near a record at 1,088.11 an ounce struck on Wednesday.
 ""We are in for a prolonged period of prices treading water
and probably stagnating at around $1,500. I wouldn't be looking
for as much positive dynamic going on, despite the demand for
it as a safe haven right now being fueled by the debt crisis,""
said Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg.

 SILVER VOLATILITY
 Spot silver  fell to a low of $36.36 an ounce before
recovering to $37.27 by day's end, down from Wednesday's close
at $37.88 an ounce.
 Silver touched a record at $49.51 in late April before
falling sharply on a broad sell-off in commodities and after
exchange operators in Shanghai and New York raised the amount
of money required to trade silver futures.
 The CME Group  may bring down margins over time once
market volatility eases, Harriet Hunnable, CME managing
director for metals products, told Reuters in an interview.
 CME, operator of the world's leading energy, grain and
precious metal markets, hiked trading margins for silver five
times over a two-week period up to May 9 by a total of about 84
percent. [ID:nL3E7GQ0D5]
 ""We still think that concerns about the ability of the EU
to manage Greece's sovereign debt problems and potential
contagion to other peripheral countries will be supportive for
gold,"" said Natalie Robertson, commodities strategist at ANZ.
 Silver ETFs continue to leak metal. Holdings have fallen by
nearly 9 million ounces this week alone, bringing year-to-date
outflow to 8.4 percent, or 42.79 million ounces. [GOL/ETF]
 Bullish for gold was metals consultancy GFMS' estimate that
China could import as much as 400 tonnes of metal this year,
compared with 200 tonnes last year when it ranked as the
world's second-largest consumer after India. [ID:nB9E7EK00F]
 Among other precious metals, platinum  was down at
$1,766.50 an ounce from Wednesday's close at $1,776.70, while
palladium  was up at $750.99 from $745.13 previously.

 LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - Oil retreated on Thursday,
pressured by gloomy U.S. economic data, but dollar weakness and
supply concerns sparked by renewed violence in the Middle East
helped limit losses.
 Unrevised first quarter U.S. GDP data disappointed investors
who had been expecting an upward revision while corporate
profits unexpectedly contracted and jobless claims rose.
 However, crude remained in a tight range close to $100
barrel where it has been for three weeks, and analysts saw
longer-term appetite for energy as robust.
 ""It's very range bound, it's been pressured by European debt
concerns and poor data,"" said David Jones, chief market
strategist at IG Index.
 ""But there's massive appetite for oil, and whenever we have
bad data, usually some better news comes soon after, so we see
(U.S.) crude trading at $110 in coming months.""
 As of 1319 GMT U.S. crude for July  was down 25 cents
to $101.07. Brent crude for July  was down 14 cents to
$114.79 per barrel.
 Crude oil had gained sharply on Wednesday as traders
initially focused on an unexpected drop in U.S. distillate
stocks. [EIA/S]
 However the figures from the Energy Information
Administration showed domestic crude stocks rising, countering
expectations of a fall, which underlined the gloomy outlook for
demand. [ID:nN25126927]
 ""The net result was that there was a build in inventories,
so I think the move was a bit overdone yesterday,"" Simon
Wardell, oil analyst at Global Insight said.
 Both benchmarks rose around 2 percent on Wednesday to close
at their highest since May 10.
Fears of spreading turmoil in the Middle East were rekindled
by a brewing civil war in Yemen as dozens were killed in
overnight gun battles. [ID:nLDE74O2C5]
 Analysts said the tensions in the region have added a
$10-$20 security premium to oil prices, as investors focus on
risks to supply.
 The dollar retreated against the euro  and slipped
against a basket of currencies <.DXY>, making commodities priced
in the greenback more attractive to consumers using other
currencies, and preventing sharper losses. [USD/]

 SINGAPORE, May 26 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose above $115 a
barrel on Thursday due to a softer dollar and as an unexpected
drop in U.S. distillate stocks overshadowed gains in gasoline
and crude inventories.	
 The dollar retreated against the euro and edged down
against a basket of currencies , making commodities priced
in the greenback more attractive to consumers using other
currencies. 
 The surprise distillates drawdown last week helped ease
concerns the rise in gasoline inventories ahead of the Summer
driving season that begins this weekend is a sign of waning
demand. Also supporting the market was fresh violence in Libya
and Yemen, raising the spectre once again of further supply
disruptions in the region.	
 ""The euro/dollar is the main factor driving prices today for
oil and other commodities, and will continue to do so until
there is some clear direction on where the dollar is headed,""
said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity derivatives manager at Newedge
Brokerage in Tokyo.	
 Brent crude for July  rose 32 cents to $115.25 a
barrel by 0638 GMT, after rising as much as 54 cents. U.S. crude
 gained 27 cents at $101.62. Both benchmarks rose around 2
percent on Wednesday to close at their highest since May 10.	
 The euro was boosted by a report that China and other Asian
investors are expected to buy a ""strong proportion"" of
Portuguese bailout bonds when the eurozone's rescue fund starts
auctioning them next month.	
 But the risks surrounding the single currency remain, with
Greece fighting to avoid a debt restructuring that could spread
to other European economies struggling with gaping fiscal
deficits. [ID:nLDE74O1MZ] 
 U.S. distillate inventories fell 2.04 million barrels to 141
million barrels, its lowest level in April 2009, and well below
projections for a 100,000 barrel build, data from the Energy
Information Administration showed on Wednesday. 
 Gasoline stocks rose by 3.79 million barrels, while crude
stocks showed a modest gain of 616,000 barrels. 
 According to technical charts, Brent is expected to extend
gains to $118.43, subject to a break above a resistance at
$116.28, while U.S. oil is expected to rise to $104.60 per
barrel, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. [ID:nL3E7GQ029]

 While bears cited weak demand and ebbing geopolitical risk
premiums as reasons for oil to plunge to $75 per barrel, bulls
saw it soaring to $140 due to supply shortages and the limited
ability of OPEC to cushion any new disruption.	
 The market will also be closely watching U.S. gross domestic
product numbers out later on Thursday for further signs of
recovery in world's biggest energy consumer.	
 The government is expected to report that the economy grew
at a 2.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, according to
a Reuters survey, rather than the 1.8 percent pace it estimated

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, May 26 (Reuters) - Gold edged up on Thursday to
near its strongest level in three weeks on concerns over
Europe's sovereign debt crisis, while silver reached a two-week
top, catching up with bullion's gains.	
 Europe's policy options to avert a Greek debt default
appeared to be dwindling, sparking fears of a chain reaction
affecting other heavily indebted countries in the 17-nation
currency bloc. 
 Spot gold added $5.95 to $1,529.25 an ounce by 0519
GMT after rising as high as $1,532.10 on Wednesday, its
strongest since May 4. Bullion struck a record above $1,575 in
early May.	
 ""We still think that concerns about the ability of the EU to
manage Greece's sovereign debt problems and potential contagion
to other peripheral countries will be supportive for gold,"" said
Natalie Robertson, commodities strategist at ANZ. 
 ""After this heavy sell off at the beginning of the month,
silver is kind of retracing some of those gains. When gold
prices will go up, silver prices will go up even more. It's a
little bit more volatile than the gold market."" 
 Spot gold is due for a correction, as it may end its
current exhausted rebound around $1,536 per ounce, according to
Wang Tao, who is a Reuters market analyst for commodities and
energy technicals. 
 
 In the physical market, jewellers from Indonesia cashed in
on gold after recent gains in prices, but main consumer India
was chasing bullion as the wedding season progresses.	
 Annual gold production in China, the second-largest consumer
of the precious metal, is expected to be 400 tonnes in three
years' time, with demand at 700 tonnes, the head of the
country's largest state-owned gold miner China National Gold
Group said on Thursday. [ID:nB9E7FQ02L] 
 
 SILVER AT TWO-WEEK PEAK	
 Silver hit an intraday high of $38.62 an ounce, its
strongest since May 11, but there was hardly any activity in the
physical sector. 
 Silver touched a record at $49.51 in late April before
falling sharply on a broad sell-off in commodities and after
exchange operators in Shanghai and New York raised the amount of
money required to trade silver futures.	
 The CME Group may bring down margins over time once
the market volatility eases, Harriet Hunnable, CME managing
director for metals products, told Reuters in a phone interview.	
 CME, operator of the world's leading energy, grain and
precious metal markets, hiked trading margins for silver five
times over a two-week period up to May 9 by a total of about 84
percent. [ID:nL3E7GQ0D5] 
 ""I guess some clients who got stuck during the last
correction would be happy to see this current price and silver
is moving in tandem with gold,"" said a physical dealer in
Singapore.	
 ""I hope there is some physical silver to sell after a short
break, then it will be good for us.""	
 Holdings of the largest silver-backed ETF, New York's
iShares Silver Trust , dropped 1.43 percent from Tuesday
to Wednesday, while, the largest gold-backed
exchange-traded-fund (ETF), New York's SPDR Gold Trust
remained unchanged for the same period. 
 
 EURO-PRICED GOLD HOLDS NEAR RECORD	
 Euro-denominated gold held near a record just
above 1,088 euros an ounce struck on Wednesday. 
 The euro advanced to a one-week high against the dollar on
as strong commodities prices and a report that China is
interested in buying ""bailout bonds"" for Portugal spurred active
stop-loss buying of the single European currency.	
 But lingering uncertainty over debt problems in Greece and
other euro-zone countries was expected to limit strong
follow-through moves. 
 The Greek government sought consensus on Wednesday for tough
measures to exit the debt crisis as Greece's EU commissioner
warned that its euro membership was at risk if it failed to
agree to sacrifices.[ID:nLDE74O1MZ]	
 In other markets, Asian stocks were on course for their
biggest gain in a month, led by resources and consumer sectors,
with recovering commodity prices and the euro's rebound toward
$1.42 bringing investors back into the markets in search of
bargains.

 By Carole Vaporean and Pratima Desai
 NEW YORK/LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - Gold hit a three-week
high on Wednesday, boosted by concern over the debt crisis in
euro zone countries such as Greece and as June options expire
in the COMEX futures market.
 Spot gold  rose as far as $1,532.10 per troy ounce,
its highest since May 4, but pulled back to $1,526.05 by 3:20
p.m. EDT (2020 GMT), still higher than $1,525.75 late in New
York on Tuesday.
 Benchmark COMEX June gold futures  finished $3.40, or
0.22 percent, higher at $1,526.70 an ounce in New York. They
rallied earlier to $1,532.30, the loftiest since May 4.
 ""There's been a little push over the last few days heading
into the options expiry today, trying to get it above $1,500.
They got it above there,"" said Fred Schoenstein, a trader at
Heraeus Precious Metals Management in New York.
 ""After they expire,"" he added, ""where it goes will depend
on what happens in the euro zone. But I don't expect it to sell
off significantly and it will probably hold above $1,500.""
 Schoenstein said euro zone debt concerns would likely push
gold back up to test the $1,550 range and even the previous
high on June COMEX at $1,577.40 an ounce.
 Euro-priced gold  hit a record 1,088.11 euros an
ounce, Reuters data showed. Gold priced in sterling 
scaled a session peak of 944.82 pounds per ounce, just short of
the lifetime high of 944.87 struck on Tuesday.
 Escalating worries about Greece's finances and potential
contagion effects on other countries, including Portugal and
Ireland, triggered a flurry of investor buying.
[ID:nLDE68T0MG]
 The euro zone debt crisis has also weighed on the single
currency against the dollar. [USD/]
 ""It's balancing debt problems against the impact it's
having on the euro versus the dollar,"" said Daniel Major,
analyst at RBS. ""Underlying physical demand in Asia is
relatively resilient.""
 The dollar slipped after new orders for long-lasting U.S.
manufactured goods fell more than expected in April to record
their largest decline in six months. [ID:nCAT005443]
 A stronger U.S. currency makes commodities priced in
dollars more expensive for holders of other currencies.
 OPPORTUNITY COST
 A yardstick for investor interest is holdings of the
largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), New York's SPDR
Gold Trust , which rose 0.38 percent to above 39 million
ounces on Tuesday from Monday. [ID:nSGE74N017]
 ""Fresh inflows into gold ETFs following sizable outflows in
recent weeks hint at rising investor interest,"" Credit Suisse
Private Banking said in a note. ""Low real yields should prove
additionally supportive.""
 Investors are more likely to hold gold when interest rates
are low, as there is little or no opportunity cost for owning
the precious metal, which does not earn interest or dividends.
 However, holdings of the largest silver-backed ETF, New
York's iShares Silver Trust , dropped 0.51 percent to
324.253 million ounces on Tuesday from Monday.
 Spot silver  hit $37.97 an ounce, its highest since
May 11, and last fetched $37.90. The late Tuesday bid was
$36.53. The industrial precious metal is down 35 percent since
touching a record $49.51 on April 28.
 Silver's trading volume is about a third of the levels
attained when its price hit record highs, Schoenstein at
Heraeus said.
 ""I think people are putting some of that money into gold.""
 Platinum and palladium, used to make autocatalysts, are
expected to remain in tight supply with auto sales forecast to
post double-digit growth in 2011. [ID:nCARS1]
 Spot platinum  was bid at $1,777 an ounce, up from
$1,761.55 on Tuesday but off an earlier one-week high at
$1,782.50.
 Palladium  jumped to $747.22 from $732.53 an ounce,
having touched a three-week high of $749.50.

 By Gene Ramos
 NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose 2 percent on
Wednesday, climbing to two-week highs as an unexpected drop in
U.S. distillate inventories trumped a sharp rise in gasoline
stocks and as a softer dollar supported fresh commodities
buying.
 Inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration showed distillate stocks, which include heating
oil and diesel fuel, fell 2.04 million barrels to 141 million
barrels last week, the lowest since April 2009. [EIA/S]
 The data overshadowed a larger-than-expected 3.79 million
barrel build in gasoline stocks and an unexpected modest gain
of 616,000 barrels in crude stocks.
 U.S. crude for July delivery  settled $1.73 higher,
or 1.74 percent, at $101.32 a barrel, the highest close since
May 10.
 In London, ICE Brent for July  closed up $2.40, or
2.1 percent, at $114.93, also the highest settlement since May
10.
 Prices had been lower in the early going on concerns about
weak gasoline demand ahead of the U.S. driving season that
kicks off on the U.S. Memorial Day holiday on May 30.
 ""The main component in today's rise in crude futures is the
supportive drawdown in distillate stocks,"" said Rich Ilczyszyn,
senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.
 ""We're also seeing a weaker dollar and higher prices in
gold, silver and copper as supportive,"" he added.
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a
global commodities benchmark, rose 1.6 percent, gaining the
most in a week and extending Tuesday's rise of 0.7 percent.
 Oil trading volumes were moderate, with U.S. crude down 18
percent from the 30-day average, with about an hour to go
before the end of the day's trade. Brent crude volume was down
about 8 percent from the 30-day average.
 U.S. June heating oil finished up 7.06 cents, or 2.43
percent, at $2.9803 a gallon, also the highest since May 10.
 Earlier, Brent rose on concerns about unrest in the Middle
East and North Africa after violence escalated in Yemen while
uncertainty over Libya's future festered as NATO strikes
intensified.
 South African President Jacob Zuma said he would visit
Tripoli next week to discuss an exit strategy for Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi in cooperation with the Turkish government.
[ID:nLDE74O070]
 SCHISM WIDENS ON MARKET'S COURSE
 Sharp upward revisions of oil price forecasts by Wall
Street giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have deepened
the schism between oil bears and bulls to levels unseen since
oil prices peaked in 2008, a Reuters monthly poll showed.
[ID:nL9E7EA00K]
 While bears cited weak demand and ebbing geopolitical risk
premiums as reasons for oil to plunge to $75 per barrel, bulls
saw it soaring to $140 due to supply shortages and the limited
ability of OPEC to cushion any new disruption.
 Further signs of weaker economic demand in the U.S. appears
to buttress bearish views about the future course of oil
prices.
 Data on Wednesday showed a larger-than-expected drop in new
orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods in April, the
largest decline in six months. [ID:nCAT005443]
 The weak durable goods report could embolden economists to
moderate their forecasts for the U.S. second-quarter growth,
analysts said.
 U.S. dependence on imported oil fell below 50 percent of
total oil demand in 2010 for the first time in more than a
decade due to the weak economy and the increasing number of
fuel efficient vehicles, a report from the U.S. Energy
Department showed on Wednesday. [ID:n25148640]

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, May 25 (Reuters) - Spot gold edged down on
Wednesday, having rallied to its highest level in three weeks in
the previous session, but bullion priced in euro rose to a
record on concerns about the impact of a possible debt default
by Greece on other euro zone economies.	
 The euro fell on nagging fears about Europe's debt crisis as
Moody's warned a Greek debt default would hurt other peripheral
euro zone states and could push Portugal and Ireland into junk
territory. [ID:nLDE74N0AQ]	
 Spot gold fell $3.89 to $1,521.86 an ounce by 0551
GMT after rising as high as $1,527.45 on Tuesday, its strongest
since May 4. Bullion was still below a lifetime high around
$1,575 an ounce struck in early May.	
 A firmer dollar , which edged up against a basket of
currencies, weighed on dollar-denominated gold, but concerns
about the euro zone's spreading debt crisis and a rise in
exchange-traded-fund holdings should keep a floor under prices. 
 ""Overall sentiment for the long term is still bullish. But I
think for the short term, we'll start to see resistance at
$1,530,"" said Ronald Leung, director of Lee Cheong Gold Dealers
in Hong Kong.	
 ""The physical sector is a bit quiet today. People seem to be
scared about buying,"" said Leung, referring to a lack of
interest from the jewellery sector.	
 Premiums for gold bars were unchanged in Hong Kong at $1.60
an ounce to the spot London prices. 
 Euro-priced gold hit a record above 1,085 euros
an ounce. Gold priced in sterling held near a
lifetime high struck on Tuesday. 
 ""Unless the crisis in Europe is resolved and there's more
clarity on how the debt problems can be solved, I think the euro
will be under pressure,"" said a dealer in Singapore.	
 ""With greater safe-haven flows into gold, there's a chance
that gold priced in euro as well as in pounds will continue to
rally. I guess for the dollar-denominated gold, when the dollar
rises, then bullion will come under some pressure."" 
 Europe's policy options to avert a Greek default are
narrowing fast after the ECB and ratings agencies warned against
even voluntary debt rescheduling and Athens highlighted its
urgent need for more EU cash. [ID:nLDE74N0JZ]	
 Holdings of the largest gold-backed exchange-traded-fund
(ETF), New York's SPDR Gold Trust , rose 0.38 percent on
Tuesday, while that of the largest silver-backed ETF, New York's
iShares Silver Trust , dropped 0.51 percent. 
 Premiums for gold bars were also unchanged in Singapore at
between 80 cents and $1 an ounce to the spot prices in London,
but there was selling pressure from Indonesia and Thailand.	
 ""It's a two-way business from speculators. Bullion dealers
and jewellers are not doing much today except very light
selling,"" said a physical dealer in Singapore.	
 Spot gold may end its current rebound around $1,536
per ounce, as it is expected to revisit the May 5 low of
$1,462.40, according to Wang Tao, a Reuters market analyst for
commodities and energy technicals.	
 
 Silver was little changed at $36.43 an ounce after
rising as high as $36.68 on Tuesday, its highest since May 11.

 By Francis Kan	
 SINGAPORE, May 25 (Reuters) - Brent crude futures slipped
below $112 a barrel on Wednesday after industry data showed U.S.
crude inventories fell less than anticipated last week and the
dollar rebounded against the euro.	
 The American Petroleum Institute (API) said crude
inventories fell 860,000 barrels for the week ended May 20,
compared with analysts' expectations for a 1.3 million-barrel
draw. 
 Gasoline stocks rose 2.4 million barrels a week before the
Memorial Day weekend, the official start of the summer driving
season. Analysts had only expected a 300,000-barrel build.	
 ""The inventory numbers are driving prices lower. The rise in
gasoline stocks is significant coming just before Memorial Day.
If the EIA numbers show a rise as well that will put more
pressure on prices,"" said Michel Lo, a Hong Kong-based analyst
with Nomura International.	
 As the U.S. driving season approaches, traders have been
closely eyeing the steady drawdown of gasoline stockpiles.	
 Separate data from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA) showing 11 successive weekly draws in the
motor fuel up to early May had helped to boost oil prices. The
EIA will issue its latest data later on Wednesday. 
 Brent crude for July  fell 65 cents to $111.88 a
barrel by 0220 GMT. U.S. crude  was down 64 cents at
$98.94.	
 
 A stronger dollar was also depressing prices, as the
greenback bounced back against the euro and ticked up
versus a basket of currencies amid fears about Greece's
finances and Europe's spreading debt crisis.	
 Euro zone debt concerns drove oil prices down more than 2
percent on Monday, before rebounding strongly a day later after
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley raised their forecasts for
Brent crude. [ID:nL3E7GO153]

 END OF QE2 
 Commodity markets have also been preparing for the end of
the U.S. Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond-buying program in
June, which was designed to stimulate the economy and has helped
prop up prices. 
 Although prices have already been declining in anticipation,
the end of quantitative easing initiative, or QE2, will likely
leave markets more vulnerable to issues that investors have
overlooked as long as the Fed was printing money at a record
pace, analysts say.	
 But the Fed would likely not change its policy immediately
after the end of QE2, but would stay on hold ""for a couple of
meetings,"" James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, said
on Tuesday. [ID:nN24227650]	
 Elsewhere, the conflict in Libya that has helped put a floor
on oil prices showed no signs of letting up, as NATO warplanes
hammered Muammar Gaddafi's compound with their heaviest air
strikes yet on Tuesday after the United States said the Libyan
leader would ""inevitably"" be forced from power. [ID:nLDE74N2D3]

 NEW YORK/LONDON, May 24 (Reuters) - Gold rose to its
highest in about three weeks on Tuesday, as concerns about a
spreading EU debt crisis fueled safe-haven buying, and the
euro's gains on the dollar added support.
 Spot gold  rallied to $1,527.45 a troy ounce, its
highest since May 4. By 3:20 p.m. EDT (2020 GMT), the yellow
metal was changing hands at $1,525.49 an ounce, up from
$1,516.05 in late New York trade on Monday.
 In New York, benchmark COMEX June gold futures  ended
with gains of $7.9, or 0.52 percent, at $1,523.3 an ounce.
 Late-session comments by St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank
President James Bullard curbed gold's gains.
 Speaking to a Rotary Club audience, he said the Fed could
reverse its ultra-loose monetary policy in the second half of
2011 if the economic recovery goes well, but would likely keep
its policy on hold ""for a couple of meetings"". [ID:nWAT015133]
 In the long term, there may be headwinds for the precious
metal such as any decision by the Fed to increase interest
rates, VTB Capital analyst Andrey Kryuchenkov said.
 Low interest rates help gold, which competes with
yield-bearing assets for investors' cash.
 Earlier, the EMEA chief credit officer at ratings agency
Moody's told Reuters that Portugal and Ireland would be at risk
of multi-notch credit downgrades should Greece default.
[ID:nATH006096]
 ""There is so much uncertainty that the downside risk for
gold is low in the short term,"" Kryuchenkov said.
 ""People are still frightened about Portugal and about a
possible restructuring of the Greek debt, so safe-haven flows
will continue,"" he added.
 An upbeat outlook for metal markets from Goldman Sachs also
boosted precious and base metal prices, said David Meger,
Vision Financial Markets director of metals trading, in
Chicago.
 ""That report gave some support, along with ongoing concerns
regarding European sovereign debt issues,"" he said.
 Goldman said in a note: ""We expect gold prices to continue
to climb in 2011 as the resumption of quantitative easing
should keep U.S. real interest rates low.
 ""However ... we expect U.S. real interest rates to begin to
rise into 2012, likely causing gold prices to peak in 2012.""

 Gold prices in British pounds  hit a record high

April to notch their second straight month of gains.
 ""It's a positive surprise. Sales activity continues to
bounce along the bottom. There is no evidence of a second leg
down for housing,"" said Richard Dekaser, economist at The

 NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - Oil rose 2 percent on Tuesday
in choppy trading after Goldman Sachs raised its price
forecasts for Brent crude, saying demand from economic growth
will eat into stockpiles and OPEC spare capacity.
 Goldman raised its Brent price forecast to $115, $120 and
$130 a barrel on a three-, six-, and 12-month horizon and
boosted its year-end target for Brent to $120 per barrel from
$105 and its 2012 forecast to $140 from $120. [ID:nL3E7GO153]
 A weaker dollar also supported oil prices, which had
declined 2 percent the previous session. [USD/]
 The euro edged up from a two-year low against the dollar on
German data that was better than expected, though nagging fears
about Europe's debt crisis were expected to check euro gains.
 Brent crude for July delivery  rose $2.43 to settle
at $112.53 a barrel, having swung between $109.50 and $112.65.
 U.S. July crude  rose $1.89 to settle at $99.59 a
barrel, having pushed intraday as high as $100.09 and ending
above its 100-day moving average of $98.80.
 Crude futures trading volumes remained tepid, with total
U.S. volumes 23 percent below and Brent volumes 18 percent
under their 30-day averages, according to Reuters data.
 ""Data showing U.S. home sales rose in April was supportive
to the market, in addition to the buying encouragement prompted
by the Goldman Sachs forecast for higher Brent crude prices,""
said Joe Posillico, broker at MF Global in New York.
 New U.S. single-family home sales rose a second straight
month in April, but an overhang of previously owned homes was
expected to limit any market recovery. [ID:nN24237107]
 The view that the U.S. economy is mired in a soft patch was
reinforced by a Richmond Federal Reserve survey showing central
Atlantic region manufacturing activity stalled in May.
 Oil prices showed little immediate reaction to news the
United States announced new sanctions on OPEC-member
Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA and six other smaller oil
and shipping companies for trading with Iran. [ID:nN24277213]
 The sanctions are narrowly targeted and will not affect
PDVSA's sales of oil to the United States or the activities of
its subsidiaries including U.S.-based CITGO.
 U.S. front-month June gasoline  and heating oil
 futures helped lead the complex up early and posted
higher settlements, though gains were pared when trade sources
said a gasoline-making unit at Irving Oil's Canadian refinery
had restarted. [ID:nN24255462]
 Also curbing gasoline gains was a report that U.S. retail
gasoline demand fell last week against both the previous week
and the year-ago period, even as fuel prices began to recede,
according to a MasterCard report. [ID:nN24275452]
 GOLDMAN PRICE TARGET SHIFTS
 Goldman Sachs in April predicted a sharp oil price
correction that materialized the first week of May, then issued
a note in early May saying oil could surpass recent highs by
2012, before issuing raised targets for Brent on Tuesday.
 Morgan Stanley on Tuesday also raised its Brent crude price
forecast for 2011 and 2012.
 Citing improved demand coupled with production lost to
Libya's conflict, Morgan Stanley raised its 2011 Brent crude
price forecast to $120 per barrel from $100 a barrel, and its
2012 forecast to $130 from $105. [ID:nL3E7GO054]

 U.S. OIL INVENTORIES
 U.S. crude oil inventories fell 860,000 barrels last week,
according to the weekly report from the industry group American
Petroleum Institute, released late on Tuesday. [API/S]
 Crude stocks increased slightly at the key Cushing,
Oklahoma, hub, but gasoline stocks rose 2.4 million barrels and
distillate stockpiles fell 846,000 barrels, the API said.
 Oil prices pared gains slightly after the report in
post-settlement trading.
 Ahead of the report, a Reuters poll of analysts yielded a
forecast for U.S. crude stocks to have fallen 1.3 million
barrels. Distillate stocks were expected to be near flat, up
only 100,000 barrels, while gasoline stockpiles were estimated
to be up by 300,000 barrels. [ID:nN24284821] [EIA/S]
 The weekly inventory report from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration will follow on Wednesday at 10:30
a.m. EDT (1430 GMT).

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, May 24 (Reuters) - Gold firmed to its highest
level in almost two weeks on Tuesday on worries that Europe's
debt crisis was spreading out of control, sending
euro-denominated bullion to a record above 1,081 euros an ounce.	
 Gold may challenge a record high hit earlier this month as
negative ratings actions on Greece and Italy as well as regional
election results in Spain raise concerns about a deepening of
the euro zone's debt problems, adding lustre to bullion's
safe-haven appeal.	
 Spot gold added $1.89 to $1,517.94 an ounce by 0543
GMT, having hit an intraday high at $1,518.46 an ounce, its
strongest since May 11. Bullion was still below a lifetime high
of $1,575.79 an ounce struck in early May. 
 ""The market is so unsure as to what the outcome of all the
various meetings that are going on in Europe, whether or not
they are going to come to an agreement for restructure or some
other kind of means of dealing with it,"" said Darren Heathcote,
head of trading at Investec Australia.	
 ""We've yet to find out.""	
 Euro-denominated gold hit a record at 1,081.43
euros an ounce. 
 
 The dollar held near a seven-week high against a basket of
currencies and the euro remained on the defensive on Tuesday on
worries that the euro zone's debt crisis could spread to
heavyweights like Spain that had been considered safe from
contagion. 
 ""Gold will benefit as a result of its safe haven status ...
Obviously, a very positive sign for gold at the moment,"" said
Heathcote of Investec Australia.	
 ""We'll be targeting the next level now, which is probably
going to be somewhere initially around $1,520 but I guess, then
around $1,526,"" said Heathcote, adding that gold could
eventually revisit the record high. 
 St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on
Monday protracted European sovereign debt turmoil could weigh on
the U.S. economic recovery. [ID:nN23204840]	
 Silver was steady at $35.27 an ounce, below a record
at $49.51 an ounce hit in April. 
 Holdings of the largest gold-backed exchange traded fund,
New York's SPDR Gold Trust , rose 0.63 percent, while that
of the largest silver-backed ETF, New York's iShares Silver
Trust , dropped 0.15 percent from Friday to Monday.

 ""Sentiment is slightly bullish because of the ETF, which is
giving gold some support. But I would say that people will be
buying gold at lower end and then liquidate a little bit,"" said
a dealer in Hong Kong.	
 ""Let's see if gold could hold above $1,520. Silver trading
has slowed down. Everybody is waiting for the right time to buy
again, which won't be at the $35 level."" 
 In other markets, Asian stocks held steady on Tuesday but
may resume declines after the prior session's sell-off as fears
about the euro zone's worsening debt problems and volatile
commodity prices kept investors on edge.

 By Francis Kan	
 SINGAPORE, May 24 (Reuters) - Brent crude futures rose on
Tuesday, rebounding from the previous day's sharp fall, as the
prospect of strong oil demand trimming inventories overrode
concerns about Europe's debt crisis.	
 Brent crude for July  was up 59 cents at $110.69 a
barrel by 0309 GMT. U.S. crude  for July gained 60 cents
to $98.28 a barrel. Both benchmarks had fallen by over $2 on
Monday to end below their 100-day moving averages.	
 Sovereign debt problems in the euro zone, coupled with data
pointing to a slowing Chinese economy, had pushed investors to
sell riskier assets like oil and the euro in favour of gold and
the dollar.	
 Spot gold hit an intraday high at $1,517.74 an ounce,
its strongest since May 11, while the dollar extended its gains
to hit an eight-week high against the pound and edged closer to
a 10-week high versus the euro. 
 ""What we're seeing is some short covering or value buying
after significant losses yesterday, but in the short term there
are still risks from Europe's debt issues and softening economic
data,"" said Ben Le Brun, market analyst with CMC markets in
Sydney.	
 But analysts expect oil prices to head higher after the
current correction, as strong demand from emerging economies
draws down on global inventories and puts a strain on OPEC's
spare capacity.	
 ""While near-term downside risk remains...we believe that the
market will continue to tighten to critical levels by 2012,
pushing oil prices substantially higher to restrain demand,""
said U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs in a research note on
Monday.	
 The influential Wall Street bank, which in April had
predicted the major correction in oil prices earlier this month,
said on May 7 that oil could surpass its recent highs by 2012. 
 Echoing this view was Morgan Stanley, who raised their 2011
Brent crude forecast to $120 a barrel, from $100 previously,
while it has upped its 2012 target to $130, from $105.	
 The loss of some 1.5 million barrels per day of Libyan
production, and firm demand from emerging economies, will lead
to tighter inventories in the second half of the year, the
bank's analysts said in a report.	
 ""It is very likely that OPEC will respond to tightening
inventories by lifting their production; in response, we see
flat prices moving higher as spare capacity continues its fall
to untenable levels,"" the report said. [ID:nL3E7GO054]	
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are
scheduled to meet next on June 8 in Vienna.	
 An expected fall in U.S. crude stocks last week could also
support prices, analysts said. A drop in imports and increased
refinery use are forecast to have pushed crude oil inventories
lower, according to a Reuters survey of analysts on Monday.
[ID:nN23182962] 
 
 
 CHINA TO DRIVE DEMAND	
 Strong Chinese oil demand is expected to be the key driver
of oil prices for the rest of this year, despite data pointing
to a slowing economy, analysts said.	
 A purchasing managers index on Monday showed China's
factories expanding at their slowest pace in 10 months in May.
[ID:nL3E7GN06N] 
 However, this news was tempered by data showing no let up in
Chinese oil imports last month, which grew 9.6 percent
year-on-year, its third-highest level ever.	
 ""The softer manufacturing data is a good sign that
tightening measures are starting to take effect and the
government may be less inclined to tighten further,"" said CMC's
Le Brun.	
 The conflict in Libya escalated, with at least 12 heavy
explosions heard in Tripoli early on Tuesday and a column of
smoke was seen rising from the area of leader Muammar Gaddafi's
compound, a Reuters correspondent said. [ID:nLDE74M257]	
 Uncertainty over pan-Arab protests and Libya's conflict
pushed Brent to a 32-month peak last month, before a sharp
correction in early May resulted in prices registering their
largest ever weekly decline of more than $16 a barrel.

 By Chris Kelly
 NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - The price of gold climbed to
its highest level in nearly two weeks on Monday after a raft of
unsettling news on indebted euro zone nations such as Greece
and Italy dented investor confidence.
 Gold rose even as most other commodities tumbled under
pressure from the dollar, which strengthened against the euro.
Bullion's resilience signaled its appeal as a hedge against the
mounting crisis in Europe.
 ""Gold is doing relatively well. This whole sovereign debt
crisis will continue to be with us for quite some time and I'd
suspect people will want the exposure to gold as a hedge
against any sovereign defaults,"" said Bart Melek, head of
commodity Strategy with TD Bank Financial Group.
 ""With the dollar strengthening as a safe haven, you'd
expect gold to weaken ... it's not happening today mainly
because we're looking at gold as a hedge.""
 Spot gold  rose to a session high of $1,517.50 an
ounce, its highest since May 11, then eased back by 3:23 p.m.
(1923 GMT) to $1,515.29, still up 0.5 percent from Friday's
close.
 Gold priced in euros  hit a record high of
1,080.04 euros an ounce.
 The trigger for gold's rise was the decision on Friday by
ratings agency Fitch to cut Greece's debt ratings by three
notches.
 Safe-haven bids gathered steam as doubts grew about Spanish
austerity measures and Italy suffered a credit outlook
downgrade. [ID:nLDE74L02S] [ID:nLDE74L0D5]
 In New York, June gold futures  settled up $6.50 at
$1,515.40 an ounce, after touching its own near two-week peak
at $1,519.
 With prices maintaining momentum above $1,500 an ounce,
more consolidation was in store, participants said.
 ""This market is just at its equilibrium for the time
being,"" said George Nickas of commodities futures broker FC
Stone.
 ""Weakness in the stock market is not doing anything to
gold, nor is the weakness in crude ... gold traders are on the
sidelines.""
 Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on
Friday backed his view.
 The data showed money managers sharply scaled back their
bullish bets in COMEX gold futures and options to the lowest
level since March. [ID:nEMS3CA3JA] (Graphic:
http://r.reuters.com/buv87r )
 The euro tumbled to a two-month low against the dollar,
prompting another sell-off across the commodities complex,
which pressured the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> down 9
percent so far this month -- its biggest monthly decline since
2008.
 ""If we hadn't had a safe-haven bid, gold would have been
quite a bit lower because we're still seeing this washout in
commodities being repeated again today,"" said Saxo Bank senior
manager Ole Hansen.
 Gold has fallen by nearly 3.5 percent so far in May,
compared with a 27-percent drop in spot silver , a 13
percent fall in Brent crude futures  and a 5-percent
fall in benchmark copper .

 LEAVING IN DROVES
 The decline in the price of gold has attracted fresh
investor buying, as reflected by inflows into exchange traded
funds (ETFs).
 Gold ETFs saw their first daily inflow in nearly three
weeks on Friday, the biggest one-day inflow in a month thanks
to a 341,000 ounce rise in holdings of the largest gold-backed
ETF, New York's SPDR Gold Trust , reversing the outflows
of the week. [ID:nSGE74K001]
 In more industrially focused precious metals, ETF holdings
fell last week, showing investors turned away from silver,
platinum and palladium.
 ""Investors still seem to be leaving platinum and palladium
ETFs in droves,"" a precious metals trader said.
 Spot silver  was last at $35.08 ounce. U.S. silver
futures  shed 18.30 cents to finish at $34.904 an ounce.
 Platinum  lost about a percent of its value to
$1,752.50 from $1,768.50. Palladium  was down at
$729.97.
 Platinum ETFs shed 18,000 ounces of metal last week in
their largest weekly decline since the week of March 25.
 Palladium ETF holdings have fallen for five weeks on the
trot now, down 48,000 ounces last week.
 Both platinum and palladium are used to make autocatalysts
for cars, production of which is expected to accelerate this
year and next. [ID:nCARS1]
 ""Given the positive fundamental backdrop, we think the
risks are rather skewed to the upside, with $1,780 marking an
important resistance for platinum and $730 being a key level
for palladium,"" Credit Suisse private banking said in a note.

 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - Gold rallied to its highest in
nearly two weeks on Monday after a raft of unsettling news on
indebted euro zone nations such as Greece and Italy dented
investor confidence.
 Spot gold  rose by as much as 0.67 percent on the day
to hit $1,517.49 an ounce, its highest since May 11 before
retreating to $1,508.96 by 1316 GMT.
 Gold priced in euros  hit a record high of
1,080.04 euros an ounce.
 The trigger for gold's rise was the decision on Friday by
ratings agency Fitch to cut Greece's debt ratings by three
notches.
 Further reasons to buy gold were doubts about Spanish
austerity measures, an outlook downgrade to Italy's credit
rating and growing speculation about Greek debt restructuring.
[ID:nLDE74L0D5]
 The euro tumbled to a two-month low against the dollar,
prompting another sell-off across the commodities complex, which
has lost 9 percent so far this month <.CRB>, sparking a rush for
perceived safe-haven assets such as gold or German debt. 
 ""If we hadn't had a safe-haven bid, gold would have been
quite a bit lower, because we're still seeing this washout in
commodities being repeated again today,"" said Saxo Bank senior
manager Ole Hansen.
 ""It's still worth pointing out that the correction we've
seen recently has been less than the previous three and given
the severity of the corrections elsewhere, it's been holding up
pretty well.""
 Gold has fallen by nearly 3.5 percent so far in May,
compared with a 28-percent drop in spot silver , a 13.3
percent fall in Brent crude futures  and a 6-percent fall
in benchmark copper .
 ""The driving factor is obviously concerns about Greece and
whether there will be a debt restructuring,"" said Robin Bhar,
analyst at Credit Agricole.
 ""Greece is important in terms of the implications it will
have for other weak euro zone economies such as Ireland and
Portugal. Markets have started the week in risk-off mode.""
 Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou will discuss new
measures with his cabinet on Monday to cut the budget deficit,
in an effort to convince lenders Greece can deal with a debt
crisis without a restructuring. [ID:nLDE74L0D5]

 NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell 2 percent on
Monday as concerns about the euro zone sovereign debt crisis
sent investors out of commodities and into safer havens.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a global benchmark
for commodities, lost 1 percent and equities dropped as the
dollar surged to a two-month high against the euro. Traders
were weighing heightened risks in Spain and Greece and fresh
concerns about Italy. [ID:nN23283761]
 ""The euro zone appears to have triggered this morning's
sell-off,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president at Ritterbusch &
Associates in Galena, Illinois, said in a research note.
 ""Dollar strength against most currencies is driving a
renewed 'risk-off' response.""
 Early pressure on oil came from a purchasing managers index
that showed China's factories expanding at their slowest pace
in 10 months in May, adding to evidence that the economy is
moderating as tighter monetary policy starts to bite.
[ID:nL3E7GN06N]
 U.S. front-month June gasoline futures  bucked the
trend and settled higher, lifted by the shutdown of a
gasoline-making unit at a Canadian refinery. [ID:nN23185315]
 Brent crude for July delivery  fell $2.29 to settle
at $110.10 a barrel, ending below the 100-day moving average
and falling intraday as low as $108.58.
 U.S. July crude  dropped $2.40 to settle at $97.70 a
barrel, finishing below the 100-day moving average and having
fallen to a low of $96.37. Investors eyed support above the
$94.63 low for May and the 200-day moving average of $90.05.
 U.S. crude trading volumes remained light, 34 percent below
the 30-day moving average in post-settlement trading. Brent
volumes trailed the 30-day average by 24 percent.
 Recent tepid trading volumes have helped cause price
swings, especially intraday volatility, analysts and traders
said. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil volatility index
<.OVX> rose 4.1 percent on Monday to 38.73 percent, reaching
40.66 intraday, still well below the 48.64 peak from May 5.
 In addition to the Canadian refinery problem, an
emissions-related upset at Exxon's Joliet, Illinois refinery
and a reported explosion at a Venezuelan refinery added support
for U.S. gasoline futures. [ID:nN23170969] [ID:nN23289447]
 U.S. June heating oil , the distillate benchmark,
tumbled more than 7 cents as the June contracts continue to
trade until May 31.

 SINGAPORE, May 23 (Reuters) - Investors ditched the euro and
turned to gold as a safe haven after Fitch cut Greece's debt
ratings by three notches, pushing the country deeper into junk.	
 In another sign that the continent's debt problems are
escalating, Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Italy to
""negative"" from ""stable"", helping bullion hit its highest in
nearly two weeks. [ID:nLDE74J1K7] 
 Spot gold added $1.60 an ounce to $1,508.99 by 0246
GMT, having hit an intraday high around $1,518 an ounce. This
was its strongest since May 11, but still well below a lifetime
high around $1,575 struck in early May.	
 ""I would expect gold to be supported above the $1,500 level.
If the crisis starts to involve other nations beyond Greece,
then we could see gold heading to a new record high,"" said Ong
Yi Ling, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.	
 ""Silver is still trying to gain ground after the huge fall
earlier. If we do see a new record for gold, then I think silver
will move higher."" 
 Silver was hardly changed at $34.97 an ounce. It hit
a record at $49.51 in late April before falling sharply on a
broad sell-off in commodities and after exchange operators in
Shanghai and New York raised the amount of money required to
trade silver futures.	
 
 The euro fell broadly on Monday and slipped to a record low
against the Swiss franc, hurt by ongoing worries about the
potential for debt restructuring by Greece. 
 The Nikkei stock benchmark fell 1 percent on Monday after
construction machinery and related parts makers tumbled on a
brokerage's downgrades and as a flare-up in euro-zone debt
worries hurt overall sentiment for risk assets. 
 ""It's messy in Europe and it looks like central banks are
diversifying into hard assets, whatever they are. It should
benefit gold,"" said a dealer in Hong Kong.	
 ""There's also some physical buying at the lower end. There's
not much sale of gold scrap.""

 By Francis Kan	
 SINGAPORE, May 23 (Reuters) - U.S. crude slipped below $100
a barrel on Monday as investors flocked to the dollar on renewed
concerns over the euro zone debt crisis.	
 ""The dollar is definitely the driving factor as the market
is looking for a new direction following the sharp correction
earlier this month,"" said David Cohen, director of Asian
Economic Forecasting at Action Economics in Singapore. 
 U.S crude futures for July  fell 97 cents to $99.13 by
0242 GMT, after falling by over a dollar earlier, while Brent
crude for July  was down 78 cents to $111.61 a barrel.	
 The dollar index , measuring the greenback against a
basket of currencies, rose as much as 0.7 percent to its highest
since March 30 after the euro extended its losses, making
dollar-denominated crude more expensive for consumers using
other currencies. 
On Friday, Fitch Ratings cut Greece's debt ratings by three
notches, pushing the country deeper into junk, while its rival
Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Italy to ""negative"" from
""stable"" on Saturday, in a sign that the continent's problems
were escalating rapidly. [ID:nLDE74J1K7]	
 Oil prices were also hit by expectations of lower oil demand
from Europe as a volcanic eruption threatens air travel
disruption.	
 Ash from a massive plume of smoke from an eruption of
Iceland's most active volcano could spread south to parts of
Europe next week, but experts on Sunday still hoped the impact
on air travel would be limited. [ID:nLDE74L0JH]	
 Brent is expected to rise towards $118 per barrel, while
U.S. crude remains neutral within a range of $95.26-$100.99 per
barrel, but is biased to rise to $104.60, says Reuters market
analyst Wang Tao. [ID:nL3E7GN01L] [ID:nL3E7GN03A]	
 
 
 DEMAND STILL STRONG	
 Strong demand from China and a weakening dollar are expected
to support oil prices in the longer term, analysts said.	
 China is bracing for its worst power shortage since 2004,
which has led to it clamping down on diesel shipments.	
 ""With the oil market already in deficit, incrementally
higher Chinese demand over the summer could create an extra
layer of strength,"" said Barclays Capital in a research note.	
 Analysts also expect the greenback to come under pressure
again as U.S. interest rates continues to remain low compared to
those in other countries.	
 ""Assuming the Europeans can get their act together, and U.S.
interest rates stay below those in other economies, the dollar
should weaken, and that will be supportive of oil prices,"" said
Cohen.	
 Persistent tensions in the Middle East continue to put a
floor under prices, analysts said.	
 Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh refused to sign an
agreement on Sunday to step down, the third time such a deal has
fallen through at the last minute, despite pressure from Gulf
Arab and Western mediators. [ID:nLDE74L0PI]

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - Gold rose 1.5 percent on
Friday, its biggest daily gain in two weeks, on safe-haven
buying as investors fretted about euro zone debt after Fitch
cut Greece's credit ratings.
 Bullion fell early in the session before turning higher
after Fitch downgraded Greece's rating and as the International
Monetary Fund urged Europe to agree to more comprehensive
measures to tackle the debt crisis. [ID:nLDE74J1KA]
 The euro fell against the dollar on caution before upcoming
Spanish elections this weekend and the uncertain Greek debt
situation. Crude oil and commodities reversed early losses as
the dollar pared gains, and the euro zone worries boosted gold
and silver.
 ""A lot of the move this morning is prompted by the move of
the dollar. That dollar strength is probably short-lived...It
has largely run its course and may soon begin to reverse,"" said
Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist of LPL Financial,
which has $100 billion in assets under management.
 Spot gold  rose 1.5 percent to $1,514.49 by 2:52 p.m.
EDT (1852 GMT). U.S. June gold futures  settled up $16.50
at $1,508.90 an ounce, after trading between $1,486.40 and
$1,515.80, which marked a one-week high.
 Gold is up 1.5 percent for the week. The metal is still 4
percent lower after rallying to a lifetime high near $1,575 an
ounce in early May.
 Silver  was up 0.6 percent at $35.16, but remained
down 30 percent from the record $49.51 hit on April 28.
 Bullion has dropped three out of the last four sessions on
weak U.S. housing and manufacturing data and uncertainty about
the end of the the Federal Reserve's bond-buying program.
 ""This week, we've had one of the worst weeks for economic
data so far this year, as most of the data came in below
expectations. I don't think that will be the case next week,""
said Kleintop, whose firm has an overall commodity allocation
of between 10 to 20 percent.
 Managed money sharply scaled back their bullish bets in
COMEX gold futures and options to the lowest level since March
as prices fell sharply, U.S. regulator data showed.
[ID:N20573163]
 Investor sentiment took a toll on Monday when billionaire
financier George Soros dumped almost his entire $800 million
stake in bullion in the first quarter, well before a
commodities slump blamed partly on reports he was liquidating
his holdings, regulatory filings showed. [ID:nN16628736]
 VOLATILITY RISING, OPTION EXPIRY
 CBOE gold volatility index <.GVX>, a gauge of bullion
investor anxiety, rose 3 percent, its first rise this week,
after the metal moved in a $30 range on Friday.
 COMEX options expiry next week were also keeping prices
hemmed in around the $1,500 mark, where sizable open interest
was aligned, said Tom Kendall of Credit Suisse.
 Prices tend to gravitate toward large pools of open
interest as options expire. June options are scheduled to
expire May 25. <0#GCc1++>
 Also supporting gold was news that the cost to hedge
against a U.S. government debt default rose on Friday to its
highest level since January ahead of the government's sales of
$99 billion in securities next week. [ID:nN20198528]
 Worries persist over Washington's struggle to reach a
deficit-cutting deal and to raise its $14.3 trillion legal
borrowing limit, which was hit on Monday.
 Gold is among one of the assets expected to fall in the
three months after the end of the Fed's second massive bond
buying operation, also known as quantitative easing, or QE2, a
Reuters poll found. QE2 is scheduled to expire in June.
 Bullion was up 20 percent since August when Fed Chairman
Ben Bernanke's speech at Jackson Hole, Wyoming marked the
beginning of QE2. The Fed is not expected to raise interest
rate for the rest of 2011.
 CHART POTENTIAL
 On the charts, gold kept finding support at its 50-day
moving average, a level it has held for more than three
months.

 ""Gold's been given every opportunity to break this week,
and it has refused to do so, and now it appears in the process
of breaking out to the upside instead. We are much impressed
... enough so to add to our gold positions,"" said Dennis
Gartman, publisher of The Gartman Letter.

third consecutive weekly decline.

 NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - Oil rose in thin, volatile
trading on Friday, bouncing back from sharp mid-session losses
as traders struggled to set a clear direction in a market
buffeted by new euro zone concerns and mixed signals on
demand.
 The expiration of the June U.S. crude contract, technical
trading on either side of the 100-day average, below-normal
volume and choppy dealings in the dollar all contributed to
another erratic day for oil, marked by a wide range that
analysts say underscored traders' lack of conviction.
 Prices tumbled earlier in the day as the dollar rallied on
news that Norway suspended a payment grant to Greece for
failure to comply to commitments and a ratings downgrade by
Fitch. Concerns that Spanish regional elections at the weekend
could result in bad bank news added to the euro's losses.
 But crude later reversed course to rise, causing the dollar
to pare gains as the two markets took turns driving the inverse
correlation that has been pronounced in recent weeks.
 The later move left traders struggling to pin down a cause,
although some saw broader gains across the commodity complex as
evidence that investors were tip-toeing back in. Gold, copper
and corn all rose by about 1.5 percent.
 ""Any commodity can serve as a store of value if you are
worried about currencies you were holding and while gold is the
easiest to hold, its price is very high and that may have
benefited oil,"" said Bill O'Grady, chief investment strategist
at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis.
 Brent crude for July delivery  rose 97 cents to
settle at $112.39 a barrel, bouncing off a low of $108.60
posted after sliding below the 100-day moving average of
$109.76.
 For the week, front-month Brent fell $1.44, or 1.27
percent,
 The expiring U.S. June crude contract  rose $1.05 to
go off the board at $99.49 a barrel, after falling as low as
$95.99. Despite the rally it ended the week down 16 cents.
 The early slide failed to challenge the $94.63 low from May
6, where oil found at least a temporary floor after retreating
from a 2-1/2 year peak of $114.83 on May 2.
 The U.S. July crude  rose $1.17 to settle at $100.10,
bouncing from its intraday low of $96.35.

 FUNDAMENTALS AND VOLUME
 The oil market also struggled to absorb conflicting
accounts of oil demand in the world's biggest consumer.
 Although diesel usage surged some 15 percent in April,
gasoline demand fell by 5 percent, the American Petroleum
Institute said. And the number of highway miles driven fell by
1.4 percent in March, the first decline in 13 months.
[ID:nN20219569] [ID:nWNA9165]
 Several brokers and traders said short-covering ahead of
the weekend added to the bounce.
 U.S. total crude trading volume at 16 percent below the
30-day average Brent volumes 22 percent under enabled the price
volatility, traders said.
 ""Thin volumes had had to play a role in those kind of
swings,"" said O'Grady.
 News that al Qaeda plotted to hijack or sink oil tankers
last year to prompt a spike in prices and trigger an economic
crisis in the West also helped oil rebound, trading sources
said. [ID:nN20173119]
 The threat to U.S. oil infrastructure from flooding along
the Mississippi River and other waterways in the region
remained supportive, although only a small amount of refinery
capacity had been affected as of Friday and major plants are
now thought to be largely out of harm's way. [ID:nN20180081]

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, May 20 (Reuters) - Gold bounced on Friday as bargain hunters
resurfaced after prices slipped in the previous session, while silver could be
struggling to sustain early gains following a drop in exchange-traded fund
holdings.	
 Bullion has fallen about 5 percent since rallying to a lifetime high around
$1,575 an ounce in early May, but expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will
keep monetary policy ultra-loose for a while longer following the release of
weak economic data could polish up gold's safe haven appeal.	
 Spot gold added $5.76 an ounce to $1,497.36 by 0603 GMT. Silver
barely moved, standing at 35.19 an ounce -- well below a record at $49.51
an ounce in April. 
 ""The long-term uptrend for gold is still intact. If gold moves above the
resistance of $1,500, then I think it could go higher. As the commodity markets
start to stabilise, investment demand for silver could return. It has a strong
positive correlation to gold and is a cheaper alternative,"" said Ong Yi Ling,
investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.	
 ""I think, short-term, silver is still bearish."" 
 Holdings in the world's largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund, iShares
Silver Trust , fell to 10,203.73 tonnes by May 19, from 10,446.43 tonnes on
May 18. [ID:nL4E7GK03B]
 
 
 
 The dollar looked set to post its first weekly loss in three weeks as
investors increased bets on risky assets like equities on expectations the
United States would take a long time to raise interest rates after posting weak
economic data. 
 Data showing a slowdown in manufacturing growth in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic
region and an unexpected dip in existing home sales in April cemented views that
if economic data continues to disappoint it could push out Fed action until well
into 2012 or perhaps even later. [ID:nN19134058] 
 In the physical market, dealers noted buying from speculators and jewellers,
although the volume had declined somewhat. Premiums for gold bars were steady at
80 cents to spot London prices in Singapore, but there were also offers at $1 an
ounce. 
 ""In all, it says buckle your seat and we will be in for a roller coaster
ride, either up or down. Silver has come to a standstill. That's a pity, but
allows time for us to focus on gold,"" said a physical dealer in Singapore. 
 ""I heard there's not much movement in Hong Kong and there isn't gold scrap
flowing through there. Basically, the Hong Kong supplies are one-way traffic
into China and there's limited selling out.""	
 U.S. gold futures for June delivery rose $4.9 an ounce to $1,497.3 an
ounce. 
 Investors forsook gold exchange traded funds in the first quarter in favour
of coins and bars, the World Gold Council said, with buying of physical
investment products helping lift overall bullion demand by 11 percent.

 * Traders use earlier session's dip to snap up cargoes
 * Oil to continue consolidating next week -analyst

(Adds details on Alberta disruption, updates prices)	
 SINGAPORE, May 20 (Reuters) - Oil prices recovered on Friday
as traders saw the previous session's dip as an opportunity to
snap up cargoes amid expectations that concerns over supply
disruption from the Middle East would continue to support the
market.	
 Brent crude for July  rose 12 cents to $111.54 a
barrel by 0521 GMT, while U.S. oil for June  gained 41
cents to $98.85 ahead of the contract's expiry.	
 ""Traders are seeing yesterday's slide as a buying
opportunity,"" Victor Shum, an analyst at Purvin & Gertz, said in
Singapore. ""We are not likely to see an aggressive exit by
participants from oil as there is no sign of a quick resolution
to the geopolitical risk, and that is offering a support to the
market."" 
 Brent is poised for a fall of 2 percent this week, swinging
between a high of $113.56 a barrel and a low of $108.07. U.S.
oil is expected to remain little changed, trading between
$100.99 and $95.02 this week. 
 The phase of consolidation comes after both crude grades
lost between $15 and $20 in the prior two weeks, a correction
some traders and analysts said was overdone. 
 
 
 
 For next week, Shum expects U.S. oil to trade around $100 a
barrel and Brent around $100-$115 a barrel, with a key driver
being the value of the dollar against the euro.
 Any fresh development on the sovereign debt issue in Greece
and other economies in Europe will weigh on the euro,
strengthening the dollar, which will in turn put pressure on
commodities, as they are denominated in dollars.	
 
 CONSOLIDATION	
 On the other hand, a quick appointment of a new chief of the
International Monetary Fund may support the euro on expectations
of there being someone to take charge of long-term policy,
weakening the dollar, Shum said. [ID:nL4E7GJ0I0]	
 ""Overall, the market mood is of consolidation,"" he said. 
 Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao says Brent needs to
overcome a resistance at $113.20 per barrel to rise further
towards $115, as its drop on Thursday has temporarily
neutralized the signals, while U.S. oil has turned neutral due
to the drop. 
 On Thursday, U.S. crude prices fell back below $100 a barrel
as U.S. economic data stoked fresh economic worries and the
International Energy Agency suggested members could release
emergency stockpiles if producers did not increase supply. 
 U.S. weekly jobless benefit filings remained above 400,000
for a sixth straight week, sparking concerns about labor market
recovery. [ID:nN19134058] 
 ""There has been some bearish news out of the United States
this week,"" Shum said. ""And that has made the oil market overall
bearish.""	
 Other data showed sales of previously-owned U.S. homes
falling in April, and factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic
region growing less than expected this month.	
 
 SUPPLY UNCERTAINTY 
 The International Energy Agency urged oil producers to boost
supply to cut fuel costs and protect economic recovery and
appeared to suggest its members could release emergency
stockpiles if OPEC does not act. [ID:nLDE74H0VC] 
 Governments from the U.S. to China have been worried the
surge in oil prices this year may derail the nascent global
economic recovery as high costs accelerate inflation, paring
consumers' ability to spend, resulting in a slowdown in demand.	
 Prices have surged in part due to concerns that social
unrest will spread from Libya and Syria to other countries that
are major oil exporters, just at a time when demand from
emerging nations such as China and India continues to rise.	
 Muammar Gaddafi will inevitably leave power, U.S. President
Barack Obama said, as NATO intensified its weeks-long bombing of
government targets and said on Friday it had sunk eight Libyan
warships. [ID:nLDE74I27W]	
 ""While geopolitics is not attracting as much headline news
space as before, the risk to future disruptions remains,"" Shum
said. ""Libya has reduced OPEC's spare capacity, and on top of
this there is rising demand from emerging nations.""	
 Wildfires raging through northern Alberta are forcing oil
companies to chop production, with more than 100,000 barrels per
day shut in, while smoke from the blazes prompts oil sands
operations to evacuate staff. [ID:nN17146041]	
 Demand for oil in countries such as China is being fed by
rapid economic growth. The nation's implied oil demand in April
rose 8.8 percent from a year earlier to the third highest on
record on a daily basis, according to Reuters calculations. 
 The country's central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, said on
Friday the government was trying to find a balance between
controlling inflation and supporting growth. [ID:nL4E7GK04N]	
 ""China is engineering a soft landing and so far they have
been successful,"" said Shum. ""These comments are giving a
reassurance to the market that they are continuing with that
strategy.""

 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Gold fell on Thursday as the euro
edged up against the dollar and oil prices firmed, but prices
were still set for a daily decline as investors took their cue
from currency markets.
 Spot gold  was bid at $1,492.09 an ounce at 1433 GMT,
against $1,496.30 late in New York on Wednesday. U.S. gold
futures for June delivery  fell $4.2 to $1,491.50.
 The dollar fell against the euro and trimmed gains against
the yen after a key index of regional business activity
unexpectedly hit a seven-month low in May, and after data showed
another fall in U.S. existing home sales. [FRX/]
 But the overall strength of the U.S. currency has undermined
gold and other commodities this month.
 ""There is probably some consolidation around where we are,
perhaps to test $1,500. I think the dollar will continue to play
an important role,"" said RBS analyst Daniel Major.
 ""We've had some very choppy price action today but we have
seen a small turnaround in what has been a strengthening trend
in the dollar that we've seen throughout May.""
 Gold usually moves in the opposite direction to the dollar,
as strength in the U.S. currency makes dollar-priced assets
pricier for non-U.S. buyers, and this inverse correlation is
trading close to its lowest levels since mid-January.
 
 BAR, COIN DEMAND SOARS
 The dollar's 3 percent rise against a basket of currencies
this month has diminished some investor appetite for gold, which
is now about $80 off early May's record high at $1,575.79.
 Interest in gold investment products like bullion-backed
exchange-traded funds remained soft, with holdings of the
world's largest, New York's SPDR Gold Trust , declining by
nearly 30,000 ounces on Wednesday. [GOL/ETF]
 The World Gold Council said in a report on Thursday that
investors turned away from gold-backed exchange-traded funds in
the first quarter in favour of coins and bars. [ID:nLDE74H1FE]
 Gold coin and bar investment rose in most geographical areas
in the first quarter, the WGC data showed, more than doubling in
China to 90.9 tonnes, rising 54 percent in the United States to
22.5 tonnes and almost doubling in Europe to 78.1 tonnes.
 ""It is very interesting that we continue to see a high level
of enthusiasm from European investors,"" said the WGC's Research
Manager Eily Ong. ""We still see a very slow global economic
recovery, and ongoing sovereign debt issue in the euro area.""
 Holdings of the largest silver ETF, the iShares Silver Trust
, also declined by 1.316 million ounces, the fund said on
Wednesday. Its holdings rose strongly throughout last year, but
silver's recent more than 30 percent price dive has been
accompanied by outflows.
 The other more industrial precious metals picked up in line
with a rise in the oil price  and as base metals pared
some of the day's earlier losses.
 Silver  was last up 0.9 percent at $35.31 an ounce,
while platinum  was up 0.2 percent at $1,767.00 an ounce
and palladium  up 0.7 percent at $733.72.
 Platinum and palladium have firmed this week during London's
Platinum Week, as miners, recyclers, traders, analysts and
end-users gathered here for the launch of a key industry report
from Johnson Matthey and other events. [ID:nLDE74I0SC]
 ""Major players gathering in London for (Platinum) week
expressed cautious optimism for PGMs, even though most people we
talked to do not see a spec drive similar to that at the start
of the year, concentrating on the favourable fundamentals
instead,"" said VTB Capital analyst Andrey Kryuchenkov.
 ""We are also mildly bullish on PGMs, but we see many more
uncertainties than at the start of the year amid a faltering
economic recovery, expectations of monetary tightening in the
U.S., ongoing tightening in China and concerns over automotive
demand due to high fuel prices among other things.""

 NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than $1
on Thursday as weak U.S. economic data stoked worries about
demand, and the International Energy Agency suggested members
could release emergency stocks if OPEC failed to act.
 The pull-back coincided with a broad decline across
commodity markets, which are testing price floors following
several weeks of volatile trade.
 Oil volume was light at a quarter less than the 30-day
average, suggesting many traders remained on the sidelines. The
oil volatility index <.OVX> dipped to its lowest since May 5 as
demand for options protection ebbed.
 U.S. crude for June delivery  settled $1.66 lower at
$98.44, a day after rebounding when some buyers scooped up
bargains. Prices touched a session high of $100.79, trading in
a narrow range of between $96 to $101 for a sixth day.
 ""Some of the new longs that came into the market after the
recent fall of about $20 a barrel are selling as the U.S.
economic data this morning wasn't supportive,"" said Gene
McGillian, analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford,
Connecticut.
 ""The recent buyers pushed prices back to over $100, but
they were disappointed with the data on weekly jobless claims
and regional manufacturing and are bailing out,"" he added.
 In London, ICE Brent for July delivery  settled down
88 cents at $111.42, off the early session high of $113.04.
 U.S. data showed weekly jobless benefit filings fell last
week, yet claims remained above 400,000 for the sixth straight
week, sparking labor market concerns. [ID:nN19134058]
 Other data showed sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell
in April while factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region
grew much more slowly than expected this month, raising more
concerns about economic growth.
 Still, with unemployment down from a year ago there was
some evidence that U.S. drivers were taking near-record $4
gasoline prices in stride.
 Americans will cut other expenses rather than forsake
highway holidays this Memorial Day weekend, travel group AAA
said on Thursday, forecasting that the number of people hitting
the road would be little changed from 2010. [ID:nN19177541]
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a
globl benchmark for commodities, was down 1.4 percent, heading
for its largest loss in a week.
 IEA URGES PRODUCERS TO PUMP MORE
 Concerned that high oil prices would dent the fragile
global economic recovery, the Paris-based International Energy
Agency urged oil producers to boost supply to cut fuel costs.
 IEA, a watchdog for 28 industrialized nations, suggested
its members could release emergency stockpiles if OPEC failed
to act, although U.S. officials played down prospects for using
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to tamp down prices.
[ID:nLDE74H0VC]
 The IEA statement, issued after its governing board met,
was an unusual comment on producer policies, analysts said. The
statement came ahead of OPEC's next policy meeting on June 8.
 The 12-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries maintains that world oil supplies are adequate.
 ""The IEA is part of the equation today. Investors have to
be saying to themselves, 'hey, they could be serious about
pulling the trigger on reserves',"" said Richard Ilczyszyn,
senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.
 Also weighing on prices, UK consultancy Oil Movements
forecast that seaborne oil exports from OPEC, excluding Angola
and Ecuador, will rise by 420,000 barrels per day in the four
weeks to June 4. [ID:nWLA0831]
 An unexpected drop in U.S. crude oil inventories last week
and a large drop in stockpiles at the key Cushing, Oklahoma,
delivery point for the U.S. oil futures contract further
supported Wednesday's rally. [EIA/S]

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, May 19 (Reuters) - Silver and gold steadied on
Thursday, as a softer dollar and rising oil prices continued to
support sentiment a day after commodities notched up their
biggest gain in two months.	
 The dollar dropped as much as 0.4 percent against a
basket of currencies, boosting buying interest in
dollar-denominated commodities, while higher oil prices stoked
inflation worries, increasing gold's appeal as a safe-haven
investment. 
 Spot gold was little changed at $1,494.86 an ounce by
0617 GMT, below the 30-day average at $1,499.67. U.S. gold
 was nearly flat at $1,494.70.	
 ""We are seeing signs of bottoming-out in gold as the dollar
has weakened, but $1,500 remains a very contested level,"" said
Li Ning, an analyst at Shanghai CIFCO Futures. 
 The gold-silver ratio, used to measure how many ounces of
silver can buy one ounce of gold, dropped to a one-week low of
42.59, off the three-month high above 44 hit earlier in the
week. 
 Technical analysis suggested that spot gold may revisit the
May 13 high of $1,516.40 per ounce, said Reuters market analyst
Wang Tao. [ID:nL4E7GJ05H]	
 Commodities posted their biggest gain in two months on
Wednesday, suggesting investors believed this month's deep slide
may have been overdone. But some analysts think the bearish
trend may have further to go, pointing to thin volumes in
certain markets. [ID:nLDE74F15N]
 
 
 
 
 Global gold investment in the first quarter increased by 26
percent in tonnage terms to 310.5 tonnes, helping push up total
bullion demand by 11 percent to 981.3 tonnes, the
industry-funded World Gold Council said.[ID:nLDE74H1FE] 
 Investors favoured coins and bars over exchange traded
funds, causing the first net quarterly outflow from gold ETFs
since mid-2007.	
 The trend continued into the second quarter, with holdings
in the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest gold ETF,
slipping to a one-year low of 1,191.344 tonnes by May 18.
 
 Spot silver gave back most of early gains to $35.07,
up 0.2 percent. It was poised for a third consecutive day of
rise, after rising for more than 3 percent in the previous
session.	
 U.S. silver  was little changed at $35.08.	
 ""Technically it would be healthy to have a deeper
correction,"" said a Singapore-based dealer. ""We originally
expected silver to fall to $30, but buyers came back at the $33
level and they may push silver back to above $40 again.""	
 Spot platinum gained 0.6 percent to $1,773.49. Spot
palladium gained 0.3 percent to $730.97, on course for
its fourth day of consecutive gains.

 By Florence Tan	
 SINGAPORE, May 19 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Thursday for a
second session as an unexpected drop in crude inventories in the
United States helped prices rebound while wildfires in Alberta
threatened Canadian supply.	
 The market is likely to remain volatile on concerns about
the economic recovery in the United States and unresolved
sovereign debt issues in the euro zone.	
 ICE Brent for July delivery  rose 37 cents to $112.67
a barrel by 0300 GMT after rising more than $2 the previous day,
above the 100-day moving average. Front-month Brent prices have
tumbled around 10 percent since the start of May.	
 U.S. crude for June delivery  gained 28 cents to
$100.38 a barrel.	
 ""The EIA data was very unexpected as U.S. crude inventories
have been rising. It gave prices a bit of a kick-along,"" said
Ben Le Brun, a Sydney-based markets analyst at CMC Markets.	
 Crude inventories in the United States dropped unexpectedly
as refinery utilisation rates rose while imports fell. Stocks at
Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for NYMEX contracts, slid
1.6 million barrels, data from the Energy Information
Administration showed late Wednesday. 
 Wildfires in Alberta threatened supply from neighbouring
Canada. The country could more than double its output cuts over
the next few days after shutting in close to 50,000 barrels per
day of production on Tuesday. [ID:nN1724114]	
 Market sources said the shutdowns had yet to move prices for
heavy crude, but cautioned that lengthy outages could tighten
supplies.	
 The Federal Reserve's rate-setting panel also released its
minutes on Wednesday, showing that most Fed officials prefer to
raise rock-bottom interest rates before selling assets when the
time comes to tighten policy. [ID:nN18279205]	
 But the minutes also stressed that the April discussion did
not indicate the Fed was ready to start tightening policy any
time soon. Money market futures are still not fully pricing in a
rate hike for more than a year from now. 
 ""It is going to be a gradual and transparent process. The
Fed is not going to pull the rug out from underneath everyone,""
Le Brun said.	
 
 
 
 ECONOMIC RECOVERY	
 However, oil prices are expected to remain volatile as weak
economic data from the United States and the ongoing debt crisis
in the euro zone fuelled concerns about demand.	
 The debt problems in the euro zone ""have the ability to
soften demand depending on what happens to Greece and Portugal,""
Le Brun said.	
 The IMF warned Greece on Wednesday that it would fail to
shore up its finances unless it redoubled reform efforts, and
euro zone officials dismissed suggestions that a mild debt
restructuring might help. [ID:nLDE74H13X]	
 Investors will scour data from the United States, such as
the weekly unemployment claims due to be released later on
Thursday, for indications of its economic health.	
 ""Economic data in the United States is starting to soften a
little bit so it's not going to have a good impact on oil
prices,"" Le Brun said.	
 Oil investors may also be not as optimistic as before, he
said.	
 ""In the options market, the $70 put is the most actively
traded contract and this could mean that investors think oil
will be under pressure,"" Le Brun said.

Thursday after surging more than 3 percent to above $100 a day earlier on the
back of a surge across commodities markets following a recent selling spree.	
Wednesday's rise was supported after the U.S. Energy Information
Administration reported an unexpected dip in U.S. crude oil inventories and a
large drop of 1.6 million barrels in stockpiles at the key Cushing, Oklahoma,

by 0019 GMT, after settling up $3.19 at $100.10 a day earlier.

 Gasoline stocks rose 119,000 barrels, the EIA said, less than the
800,000-barrel rise expected, while distillate stocks fell 1.2 million barrels,
against estimates they would be up 700,000 barrels. 
 * Canadian oil production cuts could more than double over the next few days
as companies move to protect employees and property from wildfires raging
through northern Alberta and cope with the shutdown of a key pipeline.	
 Oil companies had shut in close to 50,000 barrels per day of production on
Tuesday because of wildfires in the Western Canadian province. Further cuts are
expected as big fields are closed in because they cannot ship their oil to
market. [ID:nN1724114]

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - Gold rose and silver surged 3 percent on
Wednesday, as rallying grain and crude oil prices and lingering worries
about a European debt crisis lifted precious metals in a commodity rally.
 Bullion is now heading for its biggest one-day gain in over a week,
snapping a three-session losing streak. Trading volume, however, was
quieter than usual, a sign that funds were less active participants
following a sharp sell-off.
 ""Some of the recent selling may have been overdone. It was too much a
reaction to the negatives in worldwide economic growth, said Michael
Cuggino, portfolio manager of Permanent Portfolio Funds with about $12.5
billion in mutual fund assets.
 Cuggino said that longer-term investors might be coming back to the
precious metals market after hot money had exited the commodities sector
during the sell-off.
 Spot gold  rose 0.7 percent to $1,494.79 an ounce by 3:24 p.m.
EDT (1924 GMT). U.S. gold futures for June delivery  settled up
$15.80 an ounce at $1,495.80, after trading in a range from $1,484.60 to
$1,499.70.
 Gold and silver prices largely held onto their early gains even as
minutes of the Federal Reserve's April meeting showed most Fed officials
prefer to raise benchmark interest rates before selling assets when the
time comes to tighten policy. [ID:nN18279205]
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a global benchmark for
commodities, was set for its biggest gain in two months as buyers emerged
for oil and other raw materials cheapened by the sell-off of the last
fortnight.
 U.S. grain prices soared on harsh weather and crude futures rose about
3 percent, while the S&P 500 index was higher after three straight days of
losses. [GRA/] [O/R] [.N]
 Silver  was last up 3.1 percent on the day at $34.97.
 COMEX gold and silver futures volume was sharply below their 30-day
norms again, reversing a trend of heavier turnover during recent
sell-offs.
 ""The funds are more cautious as far as commodities are concerned. The
CFTC data across the board indicates there's been fund liquidation so there
is less participation there,"" said Bill O'Nell, partner of commodities
investment firm LOGIC Advisors.
 ""Very often, at the end of a sell-off period, you'll see a quieter
market and then it builds up momentum again,"" O'Neill said.
 Silver has outperformed gold for a second day, bringing the gold/silver
ratio -- which shows how many ounces of silver an ounce of gold can buy --
to 43 Wednesday from near 45 on Monday.
 ASIAN PHYSICAL DEMAND RISES
 Gold prices are still down over 4 percent this month, with investor
sentiment towards the precious metal turning more cautious as gold holders
worried it may struggle to rise significantly after hitting record highs
this month.
 (Graphic on gold, commods performance:
http://r.reuters.com/nab49r )
 Consumer demand has materialized with gold's three-session slide
earlier this week due to weak factory and housing data combined with
disappointing corporate earnings.
 Premiums for gold bars in Asia increased slightly from a week earlier,
as buyers from China and elsewhere in the region took advantage of a dip in
prices to buy physical materials. [GOL/AS]
 Also providing safe-haven demand to gold was a warning by the
International Monetary Fund that Greece would fail to shore up its finances
unless it redoubled reform efforts, and euro zone officials dismissed
suggestions that a mild debt restructuring might help. [ID:nLDE74H13X]
 INFLATION, INTEREST RATES IN FOCUS
 Precious metals also benefited as investors turned their focus on
rising inflationary expectations.
 Impetus for higher interest rates is fading on the Bank of England,
which decided to keep rates at 0.5 percent, as policymakers are torn
between weak growth and surging inflation. [ID:nLDE74H0VM]
 Also, Canadian wholesale trade volumes rose in March, providing further
evidence of what appears to be stronger-than-expected first-quarter
economic growth, while April's leading indicator suggested the strength may
persist.
 Among other precious metals, platinum  was up 0.3 percent at
$1,766.50, while palladium  rose 1.7 percent to $731.97.
 Palladium prices have risen 4 percent so far this week after a bullish
industry report by PGM specialist Johnson Matthey Plc  earlier this
week.

Administration reported an unexpected dip in U.S. crude oil
inventories in the latest week and a large drop in stockpiles
at the key Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point for the U.S. oil
futures contract. [EIA/S]
 Crude rose early as buyers rushed back into commodities.
The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a global benchmark for
commodities, finished the session up 2.3 percent, its biggest
daily gain in two months. [ID:nN18264749]
 ""There is a sense that perhaps the selling in the energy
markets was overdone, particularly in gasoline futures, said
Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago.
 Gasoline futures had tumbled in recent sessions as concerns
about the threat of floods to U.S. Gulf Coast refiners receded,
and as data continued to show tepid demand.
 In London, ICE Brent for July delivery  closed at
$112.30, gaining $2.31, after holding the 100-day moving
average.
 U.S. crude for June delivery  settled at $100.10 a
barrel, gaining $3.19 and bouncing back from two days of
declines. The day's buying has pushed U.S. crude above the
100-day average of $98.50.

 Trade was stronger on the U.S. contract than in Brent. With
about two hours to go before the last trade, crude volume in
the United States was up 6.3 percent against the 30-day
average. In London, Brent's volume was down 25 percent from the
30-day average.
 Some analysts said selling was overdone by Tuesday, after
U.S. crude had fallen 17 percent from a 32-month high of
$114.83 on May 2 to $95.02.
 ""Everyone was looking on the short side of the market
yesterday. We tried pressing the market lower to a key level of
$94.86 seen in June (futures contract), but we couldn't press
any lower,"" said Richard Ilczyszyn, senior market strategist at
Lind-Waldock in Chicago,
 ""The people who were initiating shorts here over the last
week or so, started covering their positions,""
 U.S. CRUDE, GASOLINE STOCKS LITTLE CHANGED
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported crude
inventories fell 15,000 barrels last week instead of rising 1
million barrels as analysts polled by Reuters had predicted.
 Gasoline inventories rose by 119,000 barrels, below analyst
forecasts for an 800,000 barrel rise as U.S. motorists gear up
for the summer driving season, the EIA data showed.
 The EIA report showed refinery activity rose 1.5 percentage
points, dwarfing the forecast for just an 0.2 percentage point
gain, and imports fell by 394,000 barrels per day, against
expectations that shipments increased. [EIA/S]
""These statistics are bullish because they show that the
U.S. has consistently lower imports and consistently higher
refinery runs,"" said Jan Stuart, global oil economist at
Macquarie Securities in New York.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, May 18 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Wednesday as
Asian buyers snapped up bullion after a three-day losing streak,
taking the cue from a weaker dollar, with the ongoing euro zone
debt crisis also supporting sentiment.	
 The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies
while the euro climbed although worries over the euro zone debt
crisis kept investors nervous about piling up euro positions
after top European finance officials acknowledged that Greece
may have to restructure its debt. [ID:nLDE74G0PD]	
 ""The slightly weaker dollar and some bargain hunting are
helping gold's rebound,"" said a Hong Kong-based dealer. 
 ""But the market does not have a clear sense of direction and
a lot of people are just waiting.""	
 The premium on gold bars in Hong Kong increased 10 cents
this week to between $1.30 and $1.80 per ounce over London spot
prices as buying picked up, he said. Scrap selling was still
muted, he added. 
 Spot gold gained 0.4 percent to $1,491.26 an ounce by
0605 GMT. U.S. gold  rose 0.8 percent to $1,491.20.	
 The technical outlook for bullion remains bearish for the
short term. Spot gold is expected to continue its fall towards
$1,456 an ounce, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.	
 ""Gold can face more downside pressure technically if prices
break below the 50-day moving average at about $1,470,"" said Ong
Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures.	
 The long-term outlook for bullion still looks bright, and
expectations that Greece will restructure its debt may drive
some investors to seek safe haven in gold, she said.	
 
 Spot silver rose 1 percent to $34.27 an ounce. U.S.
silver  climbed more than 2 percent to $34.26.	
 Spot silver hit an all-time high at $49.51 in late April,
buoyed by strong investment demand. But prices have fallen more
than 30 percent since as successive margin hikes in COMEX silver
futures which nearly doubled trading costs drove investors away.	
 Holdings in the iShares Silver Trust , the world's
largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund, dropped 8 percent
from its peak in late April to 10,487.38 tonnes by May 17.	
 ""Given that the key driver of prices remains investment
demand, they are likely to remain volatile until they find
support from physical demand, which we expect to materialise
around the low-$30s,"" Barclays Capital said in a research note.	
 Spot platinum climbed half a percent to $1,770.74,
recovering from a low of $1,744.20 hit on Tuesday, its weakest
since end of March. Spot palladium was down 0.2 percent
at $718.18.	
 Palladium, by far the worst performing precious metal with a
10 percent year-to-day decline, is likely to stage a better run
than platinum this year on booming automotive industry in
emerging economies such as China and India and concerns on
ebbing supply, analysts said in a Reuters poll. [ID:nLDE74C1SQ]

 By Florence Tan	
 SINGAPORE, May 18 (Reuters) - U.S. oil rebounded more than a
$1 to $98 a barrel on Wednesday, after two straight sessions of
declines, as a surprise drop in gasoline stocks allayed concerns
about weaker demand ahead of the peak driving season.	
 Prices were also supported by a softer dollar, but sovereign
debt problems in Europe and weak economic data from the United
States kept investors on the edge.	
 Brent crude  was up 69 cents at $110.68 a barrel by
0255 GMT, after dropping 2.4 percent in the previous session.
U.S. crude  gained 86 cents at $97.77 a barrel, after
rising to as high as $98.00 earlier.	
 ""It has been a severe correction since two weeks ago after
the dollar rebounded and the ECB didn't raise interest rates,""
said Tony Nunan, a Tokyo-based risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp.	
 ""NYMEX has twice rebounded above $95, maybe the correction
has run its course.""	
 Technical charts indicate short-term bullish targets of
$112.50 for Brent and $100 for U.S. oil, according to Wang Tao,
a Reuters markets analyst. 
 U.S. crude stocks rose 2.7 million barrels last week, but
gasoline stocks fell 676,000 barrels and distillates dropped 2.8
million barrels, American Petroleum Institute data showed.	
 A Reuters survey of analysts had forecast U.S. crude
inventories would be up for the fourth straight week, but only
by 1 million barrels. The poll had also forecast a 800,000
barrels build in gasoline stocks. 
 The drop in gasoline stocks could signal that demand for the
fuel picked up after prices fell last week for the first time in
eight weeks, easing from highs of near $4 a gallon in April.
[ID:nN16201605]	
 ""If DOE data confirms the draw in gasoline, that will be
bullish for crude,"" Nunan said, adding that supply was not
keeping up with demand on lower refinery utilisation rates and
as Louisiana refineries had been threatened by flood water from
the Mississippi River.	
 Eight large Louisiana refineries equal to 12 percent of
national capacity appear to be at lower risk of flooding after
U.S. Army engineers opened a key floodgate over the weekend,
Senator Mary Laudrieu said. [ID:nN16484897]	
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its
own inventory data on Wednesday at 1430 GMT. 
 
 
 WEAKER DOLLAR SUPPORTS	
 The U.S. dollar index , a measure of the greenback
against a basket of currencies, was down 0.22 percent by 0255
GMT, supporting dollar-denominated commodities. A weaker dollar
boosts the purchasing power of holders of other currencies.	
 Supply worries stemming from geopolitical tensions also
continued to support oil prices.	
 Libya's top oil official defected from Muammar Gaddafi's
administration and fled to neighbouring Tunisia, a Tunisian
security source said. [ID:nLDE74G00F]	
 ""It confirms what most people believe that it's just a
matter of time that the Gaddafi regime collapses, but it will be
a long time before production comes back,"" Nunan said.	
 But demand worries lingered amid the euro zone's debt crisis
and disappointing data from the United States. 
 Europe's top financial officials broke a taboo on Tuesday
and acknowledged for the first time that Greece may have to
restructure its debt, a move that could stoke Europe's sovereign
debt crisis. [ID:nLDE74G0PD]	
 In the United States, factory output slipped for the first

 NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Tuesday

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Gold fell for a third straight session
Tuesday as weak U.S. factory and housing data combined with disappointing
corporate earnings TO trigger fund liquidation.
 Investors questioned the metal's ability to extend its decade-long
rally after regulatory filings showed billionaire financier George Soros
dumped almost his entire $800 million stake in bullion investment in the
first quarter.
 Technical selling dragged gold prices after the metal breached major
trend line support, and looked set to test below a 50-day average which it
had held for the past two months.
 ""Dollar strength and commodities decline are symptoms of what's going
on with the global industrial cycle, and those are compounded by
deleveraging,"" said James Dailey, a portfolio manager with TEAM Asset
Strategy Fund which has $54 million fund assets.
 Spot gold  fell 0.4 percent to $1,482.60 an ounce by 3:02 p.m.
EDT (1902 GMT). U.S. gold futures for June delivery  settled down
$10.60 at $1,480 an ounce.
 Silver  gained 0.7 percent to $33.80 an ounce. It was now 32
percent below a sharp rally to a record high of $49.51 an ounce set on
April 28.
 U.S. futures activity was quieter than usual, with both gold and silver
slightly below their 30-day norms, reversing a trend of heavier volume
during recent sell-offs.
 U.S. factory output slipped for the first time in 10 months in April
while home building slumped, showing the economy got off to a weak start in
the second quarter. [ID:nN17138040]
 Signs of lackluster economic activity were also evident in corporate
results on Tuesday from Wal-Mart Stores  and Home Depot , both
of which reported a drop in sales. Disappointing results from
Hewlett-Packard Co  also weighed. [ID:nN17152086]
 Spot gold could face further technical headwinds after bullion breached
a rising trend line dating back to late January, a key support bullion had
held for nearly four months, said TEAM's Dailey.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 The metal is now $100 or 6 percent below its record highs above $1,575
an ounce set earlier this month.
 Gold handed back its initial gains after a rally in the dollar
exacerbated a sell-off in an already-fragile commodity complex and
overshadowed the euro zone debt crisis which had propped the metal.
 Billionaire financier George Soros, who called gold ""the ultimate
bubble,"" dumped almost his entire $800 million stake in bullion in the
first quarter, well before a commodities slump blamed partly on reports he
was liquidating his holdings.
 Famed gold bull John Paulson held his ground, but Soros was joined by
several other big names, including Eric Mindich and Paul Touradji,
according to 13-F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
that show where hedge funds are placing their bets. [ID:nN16628736]
 CBOE gold volatility index, a measure of bullion investor anxiety,
<.GVX> has eased to 17 since hitting a 5-1/2 month peak in early May, but
still remains close to its highest levels this year, meaning the price is
tending to react more violently than usual to external forces.
 ETFs UNDER PRESSURE
 Gold holdings in exchange-traded funds monitored by Reuters fell for a
10th consecutive trading day Monday, bringing the net decline for the
period to more than 1.14 million ounces. They are down 1.62 percent year to
date. [GOL/ETF]
 In the last month in gold, the only outflows had come from the largest
fund, SPDR Gold Trust , which reported a 1.25-million-ounce outflow
from mid-April to May 16.
 Holdings of the world's largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund, New
York's iShares Silver Trust , fell another 51 tonnes on Monday. The
fund has seen outflows of 570 tonnes since silver's pullback from record
highs began in earnest in late April.
 Platinum Week in London entered its second day, after the launch of
refiner Johnson Matthey's awaited report on the platinum group metals'
market fundamentals on Monday. [ID:nLDE74F1DR]

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, May 16 (Reuters) - Gold gyrated around unchanged
on Monday, as lingering uncertainty about indebted euro zone
countries pressured equity markets along with gold, offsetting
the positive influence of a weaker dollar.
 Silver was weak, down 3 percent at one point, as funds
continued to liquidate bullish bets and U.S. photography
company Eastman Kodak , a top industrial consumer of
silver, said it is adjusting its film products pricing policies
in response to the ""unprecedented rise"" in silver prices.
 Precious metals investors were eagerly awaiting regulatory
filings by hedge fund managers and institutional investments
due later on Monday, which will show changes in precious metal
holdings in their portfolios including during the first
quarter.
 ""Those problems around the euro zone are still there, and
they might reemerge even this week,"" said Adam Klopfenstein,
senior market strategist of MF Global's Lind-Waldock unit.
 Spot gold  gained 54 cents to $1,493.79 an ounce by
1:06 p.m. EDT (1706 GMT). Bullion had hit a record high of
$1,575.79 on May 2. U.S. gold  was flat at $1,493.60 an
ounce.
 Euro zone finance ministers meeting in Brussels are
expected to back a bailout for Portugal and tell Greece it must
deliver on agreed fiscal and privatization targets if it wants
new emergency funding next year.
 Losses in bullion were limited as the dollar fell 1 percent
against the euro, which was boosted by sovereign demand after
last week's sharp sell-off, and as optimism grew a European
Union meeting would support Greece and avert a restructuring of
the country's debt. U.S. equities were also lower.[FRX/]
 KODAK ADJUSTS PRICING, CITES SILVER
 Silver  fell 3.1 percent to $34.18 an ounce. The
industrial precious metal has crashed about 30 percent since
hitting a record high of $49.51 on April 28.
 A wave of hot money from funds fueled a rally in which the
silver price nearly doubled over four months.
 Managed money continued to liquidate positions even after
U.S regulatory data showed big hedge funds and speculators cut
their bullish bets in the silver futures market in the week
through May 10. [ID:nN1627700]
 On industrial demand, Eastman Kodak said that a majority of
the silver contained within its color film and paper products
was removed during processing, allowing the company to use a
variable pricing strategy. Silver is a key raw material for
Kodak.
 ""We've seen some very steep curves in commodity pricing
recently, including an extraordinary rise in cost of silver,""
said Brad Kruchten, president of Kodak's film, photofinishing
and entertainment Group.
 In late April, Kodak CEO Antonio Perez told analysts on a
conference call that ""We are indexing our contracts, we are
hedging, and we are moving as fast as we can with the part of
the portfolio that is not silver-dependent.""

 LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - Gold steadied on Monday, as the
twin forces of deepening concern about the euro zone debt crisis
and the growing strength of the dollar offset each other, while
investors kept silver pinned near last week's 2-1/2 month lows.
 The euro slid to a seven-week low against the dollar after
IMF Chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a key voice in euro zone debt
talks, was charged with sexual assault, increasing uncertainty
on aid for Greece and other indebted euro zone countries.
 The dollar index <.DXY>, a measure of the greenback's
strength against a basket of currencies, advanced to its highest
since early April. [USD/][ID:nN15215355]
 Spot gold  was little changed at $1,494.49 an ounce by
0838 GMT, after ending flat in the previous week. Prices had
fallen by about 5 percent from the lifetime high of $1,575.79
hit on May 2.
 U.S. gold  was nearly unchanged at to $1,494.50.
 ""The dollar is coming into some safe-haven bids, with all
the uncertainties and the turmoil and there's maybe a
reassessment that we'll see the dollar aggressively firm,"" said
Credit Agricole analyst Robin Bhar.
 ""So it's dollar strength and possibly euro zone jitters.""
 
 MIXED BLESSING
 Gold in euros  did not get much of a lift from the
renewed concern Greece will have to restructure its debt without
further EU support and euro zone finance ministers were not
expected to make much progress tackling Athens' financial
crisis.
 Euro-priced gold rose 0.1 percent to 1,057.56 euros an
ounce, having fallen by 0.2 percent so far this year as the euro
has gained ground against the dollar. 
 ""It is a bit of a double-edged sword, because in theory any
debt, any currency woes should play into gold's strength. But on
the other hand if the euro is pummelled and the dollar
strengthens, they offset each other,"" Bhar said.
 Euro zone finance ministers are likely to back a bailout
package for Portugal in a meeting on Monday.[ID:nLDE74E0N7]

 NEW YORK, May 16 (Reuters) - Gasoline futures tumbled
nearly 5 percent on Monday, dragging crude oil down $2 and
extending crude's slump this month to about 15 percent as
concern mounted about energy demand and the economy.
 U.S. wholesale gasoline prices fell 4.7 percent to close
below $3 a gallon for the first time since March. The sell-off
came on signs of weakening demand in the world's largest oil
consumer, and after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened a
spillway along the Mississippi River at the weekend, making it
less likely floods will hit U.S. refinery operations.
 The heavy midday sell-off in gasoline turned back a brief
rally spurred by the euro's rise off of a seven-week low
against the dollar as a European Union meeting showed support
for debt-burdened countries. [FRX/]
 ""It's notable that RBOB (gasoline) which led the complex up
is now leading it down,"" said John Kilduff, a hedge fund
manager at Again Capital LLC in New York, adding there was a
sense of ""declining economic activity and a negative impact on
demand outlook.""

 U.S. crude futures for June delivery  settled down
$2.28 at $97.37 a barrel, and continued to slide in electronic
trading to a low of $96.89 by 3:00 pm EDT (1900 GMT).
 June Brent , which expires on Monday, hit a session
low of $112.00 and finished down $1.10 at $112.73. The July

 RBOB gasoline futures  settled down 4.66 percent at
$2.9311 a gallon and hit a low of $2.9183 in after-hours
electronic trading. Gasoline futures have fallen by 16 percent

 Oil traders were nervous about mounting volatility. Prices

futures volume down 13 percent.
 On Friday, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data

 SINGAPORE, May 16 (Reuters) - U.S. oil futures slipped to as
low as $98.35 a barrel on Monday as the dollar index rose to a
six-week high on worries that Greece may restructure its
sovereign debt. 
 Brent crude for June  fell 44 cents to $113.39 a
barrel at 0229 GMT. It settled at $113.83 on Friday, rising 3
percent on the week. Buyers came in late Friday after gains in
the dollar sent prices down just before midday in New York. U.S.
oil  traded at $98.80 a barrel, down 85 cents.	
 The euro, which also dragged down gold and silver, may test
pivotal support areas after IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was
charged with sexual assault, increasing uncertainty on aid for
Greece and other indebted euro zone countries. 
 ""The euro is coming down day by day and that is impacting
oil prices,"" said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity derivatives manager
at Japan's Newedge brokerage. ""After the big rebound, oil prices
are loosing direction.""	
 U.S. oil futures may trade between $95 to $104.50 a barrel
this week, while Brent may swing in a $15-a-barrel range,
Hasegawa said, as the uncertainty on the direction of the euro
because of the zone's economic outlook remains.	
 ""We need to see what impact the euro will have on the forex
market, and what it will mean for commodity prices,"" he said.	
 Oil and dollar-denominated commodities often move inversely
to the dollar and a stronger greenback typically pressures oil.	
 Both Brent and U.S. oil futures are technically neutral,
according to Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. Brent is biased to
fall towards $105.21 per barrel, a target established last week,
while U.S. oil is trapped within a range of $95.40-$100.75 per
barrel, he said. 
 
 ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY	
 Euro zone finance ministers are likely to back a bailout
package for Portugal on Monday, with new conditions set by
Finland. The meeting was also expected to pressure Greece to
announce more austerity steps to secure further emergency
funding. [ID:nLDE74E0N7] [ID:nN15215355]	
 The U.S. economy remains on a solid footing but it is still
to early for the Federal Reserve to offer a detailed view of its
exit strategy, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on
Sunday. Lockhart said the lack of a step-by-step guide for a
reversal of unprecedented stimulus measures should not be
mistaken for complacency about the need to be ready.
[ID:nN15239860]	
 ""We market participants are always waiting for any
announcement on interest rates in the U.S. and Europe to give us
an idea on the future direction of markets,"" Hasegawa said.
""Overall, interest rates are likely to go up faster in Europe
than in the U.S.""	
 President Barack Obama on Sunday warned Congress that
failing to raise the U.S. debt limit could lead to a worse
financial crisis and economic recession than 2008-09 if
investors began doubting U.S. credit-worthiness. [ID:nN14199711]	
 Investors were also looking at monetary tightening measures
by China to gauge the impact on demand from the world's
second-largest oil consumer.	
 China needs to raise interest rates further to rein in
inflation, which is likely to stay high in coming years due to
rising global commodity prices, Li Daokui, an adviser to the
People's Bank of China said on Monday. [ID:nL4E7GG072]	
 China has lifted bank reserve requirements eight times and
raised interest rates four times since October in a bid to put a
lid on rising prices.	
 
 MIDDLE EAST UNREST	
 A factor preventing oil prices from sliding further is the
ongoing social unrest in Libya and Syria and fears that it may
spread to other oil-exporting nations in the region.	
 NATO must broaden the range of targets it is bombing in
Libya or risk failing to remove Muammar Gaddafi from power,
Britain's most senior military officer was quoted as saying.

 Markets were also watching the Mississippi flooding
situation, a day after U.S. Army engineers opened a key spillway

 Failing to open the spillway would have put New Orleans at
risk of flooding. In addition to threatening densely populated

eight refineries and at least one nuclear power plant. The
refineries make up about 12 percent of the nation's capacity for
making gasoline and other fuels. [ID:nN15214521]

 NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - Gold fell on Friday, sharply
reversing early gains, as a dollar surge against the euro and
renewed uncertainty about euro zone debt prompted investors to
sell ahead of the weekend.
 Silver continued to recover from last week's 25 percent
correction, and technical charts suggested the metal could
stabilize after bouncing off a key support level.
 (Graphic: http://link.reuters.com/nan59r)
 ""It's mostly position squaring over the weekend,"" said Axel
Merk, who manages $700 million mutual fund assets at Merk
Investments. ""We've had this dramatic run-up week after week in
both gold and euro.""
 ""The good news is that it shakes out the trend chasers and
momentum traders coming into these markets, and what you end up
are stronger hands who are buying gold and euro in the long
term,"" he said.
 Spot gold  fell 0.7 percent to $1,492.50 an ounce by
3:09 p.m. EDT (1908 GMT), having earlier risen as high as
$1,516.40. U.S. gold futures for June delivery  settled
down $13.20 at $1,493.60, after trading in a range from $1,482
to $1,516.40.
 For the week, gold was flat after shedding nearly 5 percent
last week during a commodity rout.
 Money managers cut bullish bets in COMEX silver futures and
options to the lowest level since January, as prices tumbled as
much as 30 percent from a record high near $50 an ounce, and
they also slashed net longs in gold during the period, U.S.
regulator data showed. [ID:N13575666]
 Earlier in the session, gold rose after data showed
gasoline and food prices hoisted U.S. inflation to a 2-1/2 year
high in April, but there was little sign of a broader pick-up
in consumer prices that would trouble the Federal Reserve.
[ID:nN13186747]
 Even as gold investors continued to pay close attention to
market uneasiness about Washington's fraught political battle
over public spending, Asia's reserve-rich nations see no viable
option but to keep on purchasing U.S. government debt,
policymakers told Reuters. [ID:nL3E7GC18V]
 Gold was pressured as the U.S. dollar scaled six-week peaks
against the euro as concerns about the global economy spurred a
return to the greenback's safety. [ID:nN13186747]
 Precious metals have been pressured by worries about dollar
strength, ahead of a meeting of Eurogroup finance ministers,
followed by an Ecofin meeting of EU finance ministers on
Monday, which could provide further direction to the euro. The
single currency is likely to remain under pressure until at
least after investors digest any outcome. [ID:nLDE66D1JB].
 SILVER FINDS CHART SUPPORT
 Silver  was up 1.2 percent at $34.62 an ounce. It
still lost about 1.5 percent for the week after notching its
worst weekly performance since 1980 last week.
 Silver had lost as much as 30 percent from its record high
of $49.51 an ounce set on April 28.
 Earlier this week, the metal bounced off a low of $32 an
ounce near trendline support dating back to August 2010, a sign
of stability for the market.
 Silver was still up 13 percent this year, and it was also
the top performer in the commodity complex with a 90 percent
gain in 2010.
 The largest silver ETF, the iShares Silver Trust ,
reported its holdings slipped another 24.3 tonnes on Thursday.
Although silver is outperforming other precious metals on
Friday, it is expected to suffer further losses.
 Platinum  eased 0.1 percent at $1,760.24 an ounce,
while palladium  fell 0.9 percent to $704.49.

 By Matthew Robinson
 NEW YORK, May 13 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Friday in late
short-covering, ending the week higher after a volatile session
whipsawed by European economic concerns and news Libyan leader
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi may have been wounded.
 Trade volumes slowed after a week of heavy activity that
saw big swings of more than $11 a barrel between the highs and
lows.
 Brent crude ended up nearly $5 on the week, after dropping
$16 last week as the market digested a wide range of factors
fogging the supply and demand outlook, including the death of
Osama bin Laden, the impact of high fuel prices, euro zone debt
worries and consumer nation monetary policy.
 Buyers came in late Friday ahead of the weekend after gains
in the dollar sent prices down just before midday in New York.
 ""Crude prices rose near the close on short-covering ahead
of the weekend,"" said Tom Knight,senior trader of Truman Arnold
in Texarkana, Texas.
 Brent crude  rose 85 cents to settle at $113.83 a
barrel after hitting as high as $114.92 earlier. U.S. crude
 traded up 68 cents to $99.65 a barrel.
 Volumes eased compared with the strong trade seen over the
last week, but were close to the 30-day moving average near the
close.
 Oil came under pressure after comments from Italian Foreign
Minister Franco Frattini that Gaddafi had likely been wounded
and left the capital Tripoli. Libyan state television later
carried brief audio remarks in which he taunted NATO and said
he was in a place they could not reach. [ID:nLDE74B2KJ]
 Conflict in the OPEC nation has slashed exports, helping
send prices this year to peaks not seen since 2008. Many
experts expect the country's output could be reduced for most
of this year.

 EARLY STRENGTH
 Oil prices got an early boost as strong economic data from
Germany and France pushed first-quarter growth in the euro zone
well above forecasts, boosting the euro against the dollar.
 The dollar rebounded later, as investors refocused on euro
zone debt issues ahead of meetings by finance officials in
Brussels, helping to lift crude prices. [ID:nN1361110]
 A meeting of Eurogroup finance ministers, followed by an
Ecofin meeting of EU finance ministers on Monday, could provide
further direction to the single currency and the euro is likely
to remain pressured until at least after investors digest any
outcome. For more on the meetings see [ID:nLDE66D1JB].
 Early support also came from news China will stop exporting
diesel to conserve supplies ahead of a looming summer power
crunch, signaling the world's top energy user may need net
imports to cover surging demand. [ID:nL3E7GD08N]
 Markets were watching rising waters on the Mississippi,

metals run

 SYDNEY, May 13 (Reuters) - Gold surrendered early gains to
trade flat on Friday as the dollar strengthened and expectations
mounted that U.S. inflationary pressures eased in April.	
 Silver was also stationary after bouncing off a sharp fall
overnight that shaved nearly 3 percent off the price at one
point.	
 Headline consumer price index data out later on Friday is
expected to show a more subdued rise of 0.4 percent versus 0.5
percent in March, according to a Reuters poll , reducing
gold's appeal among investors seeking an inflation hedge.	
 ""Any signs that inflation was easing will weigh on gold
today,"" a metals trader in Sydney said.	
 Gold was showing similar resilience to that of base metal
commodities, with London Metal Exchange copper futures
trimming some early gains before the data is released. 
 ""Gold lost some ground too as the dollar picked up steam but
still managed to stay positive,"" the trader said.	
 The U.S. dollar rose on Friday and was now on track to post
a second week of gains, according to foreign exchange dealers 
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, edged 0.18 percent higher to 75.373. The
index had hit a three-week high of 75.645 on Thursday.



 Weaker oil prices also rubbed some of the inflation-driven
polish off gold, falling more than $1 to as low as $97.87 a
barrel	
 Spot gold was fetching $1,502.59 an ounce by 0306
GMT versus the overnight closing bid of $1,502.35, according to
Reuters data. U.S. gold futures  were down $2 to $1,504.80
an ounce. 
 Spot silver at $34.60 an ounce was unchanged. COMEX
silver  was down a half-percent to $34.62 an ounce.
 Comments by European Central Bank Executive Board member
Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell that Greece would get its financial
woes under control with the help of other euro zone members
further tarnished gold's safe harbour appeal. [ID:nLDE74B18U]	
 In related news, Australian gold stocks on Friday were the
worst-performing sector on the bourse, falling on average 1.07
percent. 
 Price speculation has emerged as a major factor behind the
recent wild swings in silver, which saw the metal surge to a
peak of almost $50 an ounce in April before diving to as low as
$32.33 on Thursday after the Shanghai Gold Exchange hiked margin
 requirements, according to the Financial Times newspaper
[ID:nIGM0NIC2]	
 Silver turnover on the Shanghai exchange has soared nearly
30-fold since the start of the year, with the number of
outstanding contracts similarly doubling from the start of the
year to the end of April.	
 Chinese investors were seen cutting their silver positions
sharply last week as prices tumbled then returned early this
week to drive a short-lived rebound.

701,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2011 10:52PM ET</span>","Brent crude eases towards $112 on global demand concern, dollar"," SINGAPORE, May 13 (Reuters) - Oil eased towards $112 on
Friday, pressured by concerns over global crude demand, a
strengthening dollar, and debt problems in the euro zone.	
 Brent crude  fell 22 cents to $112.76 a barrel by
0226 GMT. The market was poised to end the week around 3 percent
higher, rebounding from the previous week's record decline of
more than $16.	
 U.S. crude  dropped 62 cents to $98.35 a barrel,
erasing nearly all of Thursday's 76-cent gain.	
 ""There are concerns China might be tightening too much, that
demand might be falling and high prices might be starting to
affect demand,"" said Tony Nunan, a risk manager with Mitsubishi
Corp. in Tokyo. 
 The International Energy Agency, advisor to 28
industrialized nations, trimmed its global oil demand growth
estimates for this year by 1.5 percent to 1.29 million barrels
per day, noting gasoline pump prices near $4 a gallon prompt
Americans to drive less. [ID:nLDE72E0Q3]	
 Investors were also concerned that China's battle with
inflation may start to trim demand from the world's second
largest oil consumer.	
 China's central bank raised the reserve requirements for
commercial banks by another 50 basis points as it pursued a
campaign to fight inflation despite initial signs of a slowing
economy. [ID:nL3E7GC287]	
 Further pressure came from a strengthening dollar. Lingering
worries about Greece's debt problems helped boost the dollar
against the euro. 
 The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against
a basket of currencies, edged 0.18 percent higher to 75.373. The
index had hit a three-week high of 75.645 on Thursday.	
 
 VOLATILITY TO CONTINUE	
 The market's rollercoaster ride over the past two weeks was
likely to continue, with volatility expected to remain high in
the short-term.	
 ""Volatility is going to remain high until we see true
fundamental strength and that will come with a drawdown in
inventories in the United States during the peak summer driving
season,"" Nunan said.	
 Trade volumes, which have been strong over the past week,
held well above recent levels, with Brent trade 56 percent over
the 30-day moving average and U.S. crude 35 percent over that
average.	
 Open interests have swelled as well, with U.S. crude futures
hitting a record 1.66 million on Wednesday. [ID:nN12462143]	
 According to technical charts, Brent futures are expected to
fall towards $105.21 per barrel, while U.S. crude drops to
$92.12, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, May 12 (Reuters) - Spot silver dropped 2.6
percent and gold edged lower on Thursday as worries about
economic growth and the end of easy monetary policy crushed
early gains, extending losses from the previous session.	
 A broad-based sell-off in commodities that has seen major
losses last Thursday and again on Wednesday has pulled silver
down nearly a third from a record high hit just two weeks ago,
with gold off 5.4 percent from the record hit at the start of
the month. 
 Data on Wednesday showed Chinese output growth slowing and
inflation still high, painting a mixed picture that could mean
slowing purchases from the world's top driver of commodities
demand growth, especially if it has to continue monetary
tightening to clamp down on consumer prices. [ID:nL3E7GB0H2]	
 ""With China tightening and the ECB looking to withdraw
monetary stimulus the chances were commods were going to
struggle,"" said David Thurtell, an analyst at Citigroup.	
 ""Given that most metals, including silver, were above fair
value, the passing of easy money makes it difficult to stay
above fair value.""	
 Spot silver fell 2.6 percent to $34.16 an ounce by
0721 GMT, after a fall of nearly 9 percent the previous day.
Gold dipped 0.4 percent to $1,494.46, adding to the 1
percent loss on Wednesday.	
 Even with the recent losses silver remained the best
performer of the precious metals complex, up 10.3 percent so far
this year, compared to gold's 5.3 percent gain and falls for
platinum and palladium.	
 
 
 
 ""People are still worried about commodities -- we have seen
some short covering, some buying on dips today, but the buying
is not substantial,"" said Dick Poon, manager of precious metals
at Heraeus in Hong Kong.	
 The China data, which show inflation still high in April but
off its peak of the previous month in the world's second-largest
economy, undermines gold's appeal as a hedge against higher
prices.	
 ""If inflation had been much higher, it would have meant more
buying in gold and silver,"" said a Tokyo-based trader. ""Since
the economy is slowing and inflation seems under control, it is
relatively bearish for precious metals.""	
 Easy monetary policy has also been seen as a major driver of
commodities prices as investors hunt for yield, but this
influence is fading with the European Central Bank raising rates
at its last meeting, China already well through its tightening
cycle and a second round of quantitative easing in the United
States set to end in June.	
 The gold-silver ratio, used to measure how many ounces of
silver is needed to buy an ounce of gold, jumped nearly 9
percent on Wednesday to 42.78, its highest level since late
February.	
 The dollar index , a measure of the greenback's
strength against a basket of currencies, held steady near a
three-week high, as fears over Greece's debt crisis weighed on
the euro.

 NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - Oil rose slightly in volatile
trading on Thursday, rebounding from a 5 percent plunge in the
previous session as a weaker dollar prompted investors to buy
riskier assets.
 Crude turned higher after the euro bounced off a six-week
low against the greenback as European Central Bank policy maker
Luc Coene said April's interest rate rise was ""certainly not"" a
one-off event. <.DXY> [USD/]
 On Tuesday, a steep 7.6 percent drop in gasoline futures
dragged the oil complex lower, its second steep decline in a
week, as concerns about fuel supplies eased ahead of the summer
driving season.
 ""Oil is maintaining a tight correlation with the dollar for
now and given some expected wide swings in currencies going
forward, exceptional two-sided oil price volatility will likely
remain intact through the balance of this month and possibly
beyond,"" said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch &
Associates, in Galena, Illlinois.
 A weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated oil cheaper for
those using other currencies, and can push investors seeking
better returns into other assets.
 In London, Brent crude for June delivery  settled 41
cents higher at $112.98 a barrel, climbing from a session low
of $110.15.
 U.S. June crude  closed 76 cents higher at $98.97 a
barrel, up from the session low of $95.25.
 U.S. gasoline futures fell 5.89 cents to $3.0639 a gallon,
after plummeting nearly 26 cents on Wednesday, the biggest
one-day loss for gasoline since September 2008.
 Trade volumes, which have been strong over the past week,
held well above recent levels, with Brent trade 56 percent over
the 30-day moving average and U.S. crude 35 percent over that
average. Open interest has swelled as well, with hitting a
record 1.66 million on Wednesday for the U.S. oil contract.
[ID:nN12462143]
 Prices fell early, under pressure after the International
Energy Agency cut its global demand forecast and No. 2 oil
consumer China further tightened bank reserve requirements. In
addition, sluggish U.S. economic data weighed on markets.

 By Alejandro Barbajosa	
 SINGAPORE, May 12 (Reuters) - Oil rebounded by more than $1
on Thursday as investors focused on strong demand growth in Asia
after a selloff of 4 percent the previous day triggered by a
surprise increase in U.S. gasoline stockpiles.	
 Brent crude for June  gained $1.33 to $113.90 a
barrel by 0303 GMT, partly reversing a sharp drop on Wednesday,
when official data showed the first increase in U.S. gasoline
inventories in 12 weeks, triggering a slump across fuel markets
that shaved more than $5 from front-month Brent. U.S. crude
 advanced $1.40 to $99.61.	
 ""In the United States they are more concerned about the
unexpected rise in gasoline inventories and the sputtering
economic recovery,"" said Gordon Kwan, head of energy research at
Mirae Assets Securities in Hong Kong.	
 ""But over in Asia we have a more bullish view. Even if we
see weakening in Chinese industrial output, it is still very
strong and we don't believe in a hard landing. Inflation has
peaked, so we believe tightening policies will be done by the
end of the third quarter. Oil demand will remain elevated in the
run-up to the winter.""	
 Implied oil demand in China, the world's second-largest
crude consumer, reached its third-highest level on record last
month, but year-on-year growth slipped to 8.8 percent after six
consecutive months of double-digit gains.	
 At the current pace, China has surpassed a growth rate of 5
percent to 7 percent in oil consumption suggested in a Reuters
poll earlier this year. [ID:nTOE70G05Z] [ID:nL3E7GB0BS]	
 Signs that China's economy is cooling on Wednesday prompted
some investors to sell. Still, the expected phasing out of
monetary tightening measures could lead to sustained energy
demand growth in the world's second-largest economy.	
 China's consumer inflation eased modestly to 5.3 percent in
April from a 32-month high of 5.4 percent in March, underlining
the view that price pressures are peaking and may start to ease
in the second half of 2011. [ID:nL3E7GB0H2]	
 U.S. gasoline inventories rose by 1.28 million barrels last
week as demand for the motor fuel fell in the past four weeks by
2.4 percent, on average, versus the same period of 2010. 
 While gasoline led the market lower on Wednesday, with
benchmark U.S. futures down by almost 8 percent, the most since
September 2008, U.S. crude stockpiles jumped by 3.8 million
barrels last week to more than 370 million barrels, a two-year
peak.	
 The abrupt tumble drove oil volatility to its highest
close since mid-March as prices posted their second rout in less
than a week. Wednesday's drop could prove another blow to
commodity hedge funds, after last week's oil drop spurred double
digit losses to big name funds such as Astenbeck and BlueGold.
[ID:nN09256393]	
 Benchmark gasoline futures on Thursday gained 4.71 cents to
almost $3.17 a gallon. Wednesday's plunge triggered a
five-minute halt in trading of New York Mercantile Exchange
crude and refined products.	
 The CME Group, owner of NYMEX, raised margins for RBOB
gasoline futures by 21.4 percent to $8,500 per contract from
$7,000 effective after the close of business on Thursday.
[ID:nL3E7GB416] 
 Crude plunged more than $16 a barrel last week -- down 10
percent last Thursday alone -- with investors weighing factors
from the death of Osama bin Laden to the impact of higher fuel
and commodity costs on the economies of consumer nations. 
 In Libya, state TV showed footage of an apparently healthy
Muammar Gaddafi meeting officials in a Tripoli hotel on

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, May 12 (Reuters) - Spot silver rebounded as much
as 2.3 percent and gold edged up on Thursday after losses in the
previous session, supported by light buying in Asia, while a
firm dollar weighed on market sentiment.	
 The commodities market took a hit on Wednesday from weak
Chinese industrial output data, improving global grain supplies
and rising U.S. gasoline stocks. 
 Light buying was spotted in the physical gold and silver
markets, but activities slowed down from Wednesday after market
participants were caught off guard by the sell-off, led by a
drop of 9 percent in silver.	
 ""People are still worried about commodities -- we have seen
some short-covering, some buying on dips today, but the buying
is not substantial,"" said Dick Poon, manager of precious metals
at Heraeus in Hong Kong.	
 China's April industrial output was significantly weaker
than forecast, suggesting the world's second-largest economy was
cooling, reducing the need for further aggressive monetary
policy tightening even as inflation remains high.[ID:nL3E7GB0H2]	
 ""If inflation had been much higher, it would have meant more
buying in gold and silver,"" said a Tokyo-based trader. ""Since
the economy is slowing and inflation seems under control, it is
relatively bearish for precious metals.""	
 Spot silver rose as much as 2.3 percent to $35.88 an
ounce, and eased to $35.43 by 0340 GMT. U.S. silver futures
 edged down 0.2 percent to $35.46.	
 Bearish technicals contributed to the sharp fall in silver,
the trader added.	
 ""It was a perfect textbook scenario -- when silver failed to
break above $39.4, the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level
from the high last week, it collapsed,"" he said.	
 The gold-silver ratio, used to measure how many ounces of
silver is needed to buy an ounce of gold, jumped nearly 9
percent on Wednesday to its highest level since late February,
at 42.78.	
 Silver is likely to consolidate around the $35 level, after
a rapid rally pushed it to record high near $50 last week and a
dramatic sell-off knocked prices down more than 25 percent last
week.	
 Silver remained the best performer of the precious metals
complex, up 15 percent so far this year, compared to gold's 6
percent gain.
 


 Spot gold edged up 0.4 percent to $1,505.19, also
rebounding from the losses in the previous session. U.S. gold
futures gained 0.3 to $1,505.10.	
 The $1,490 level was seen to offer strong support to gold,
traders said.	
 ""We may see gold prices retrace a bit, as the factors that
had supported gold's recent rally are fading,"" said Hou
Xinqiang, an analyst at Jinrui Futures in China.	
 These factors include the unrest in the Middle East and
North Africa, high oil prices and dollar weakness, he said.	
 The dollar index , a measure of the greenback's
strength against a basket of currencies, held steady after
hitting a three-week high on Wednesday, as fears over Greece's
debt crisis weighed on the euro.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - Silver fell more than 7
percent on Wednesday, breaking a three-day rebound from last
week's 25 percent decline and dragging gold as crude oil
tumbled and after China's industrial output growth eased much
more than expected.
 Silver's losses accelerated as energy products plummeted,
leading a sharp decline across the commodity sector. U.S.
government data showing rising crude oil and gasoline
inventories triggered a steep sell-off in gasoline, crude oil
and heating oil futures.
 Earlier, Chinese data showed industrial output growth eased
much more than expected in April, while consumer inflation in
the world's second biggest economy eased modestly from a
32-month high in March. [ID:nL3E7GB0H2]
 China is a major consumer of silver and the second-largest
consumer of gold. More than half of silver's global output is
consumed by the industrial sector.
 The Reuters/Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a broad measure of
commodity performance, fell 2.5 percent.
 ""China is trying to contain inflation, and some of the
measures it has enacted will likely to have an impact on
economic growth. It's another reason for people to take money
off the table for commodities in the short term,"" said Evan
Smith, co-manager of U.S. Global's Global Resources Fund
, which has $1 billion assets.
 Spot silver  rose as much as 2.7 percent early, then
reversed those gains and was down 7.2 percent to $35.70 by
12:13 p.m. EDT (1613 GMT).
 Silver lost nearly one-fifth of its value last week. Before
Wednesday's dive, the metal had rebounded as much as 19 percent
since Friday.
 Sharply lower U.S. gasoline futures, triggered a
five-minute halt in trading of energy products including crude
oil futures. [O/R]
 Spot gold  fell 1 percent to $1,500.57 an ounce.
COMEX gold futures for June delivery  were down $16.30 to
$1,500.60.
 Silver's tumble pushed the gold/silver ratio, which
measures how many ounces of silver an ounce of gold can buy,
toward a three-month high.
 Silver, hit by a succession of margin increases that nearly
doubled trading costs, fell 25 percent last week, its biggest
such decline since prices collapsed in 1980.

 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - Gold broke a three-day rally to
fall on Wednesday, under pressure from a rebound in the dollar
and a broad decline in other commodities, although potential
demand growth from China was expected to stem any severe slides.
 Data from China, a major consumer of silver and the
second-largest consumer of gold, showed inflation picked up more
than expected in April, while industrial output slowed.
 The dollar pared earlier losses and rose against the euro,
which came under pressure from mounting worries about how
European officials will solve the debt problems of Greece and
Portugal. [FRX/]
 Spot gold  fell 0.4 percent to $1,508.54 an ounce by
1338 GMT, leaving the price on course for a 1 percent rise this
week, while COMEX gold futures for June delivery  were
down 0.5 percent at $1,509.60.
 ""We had Chinese inflation numbers this morning ... which
helped alleviate some of the risk of further monetary policy
tightening in China, but as far as gold is concerned, it's still
trading with the broader market,"" said VTB Capital analyst
Andrey Kryuchenkov, adding that the rebound in the dollar
against a basket of currencies had exacerbated the decline.
 Brent crude oil  fell 1.2 percent to $116.20 a
barrel, off an intraday high of $118.43, while London Metal
Exchange copper  fell 2.4 percent to $8,700 a tonne.
 
 BOOST FROM CHINA
 Earlier, gold benefitted after data showed high inflation
and slowing growth in the world's second-largest economy, which
could increase demand for bullion in its capacity as a hedge
against rising price pressures.
 ""Inflation remains above the government's desired target.
Although it's not accelerating, it's nevertheless above target,""
said Standard Chartered analyst Daniel Smith.
 ""The macro data is a little bit on the weaker side if you
look at industrial production and fixed-asset investment, which
came in broadly in line with expectations, but it's not roaring
away. So it's a picture of still slowing growth and high
inflation, so in that sense it's more favourable for precious
metals than say base metals,"" he said.
 Real interest rates, with the rate of inflation factored
into a central bank's benchmark rate, are at about 1 percent in
China, compared with -2.45 percent in the United States, -1.55
percent in the euro zone and an average of -0.4 percent across
the G20.
 An effective negative interest rate helps gold, which pays
no interest rate or dividend of its own, compete with
yield-bearing assets for investor cash.
 China's inflation in April was stronger than expected at 5.3
percent on the year, while industrial output was considerably
weaker than forecast. [ID:nLDE74A01W]
 ""Gold is generally benefiting from the return of confidence
from investors,"" said Darren Heathcote, head of trading at
Investec Australia. ""They are very happy buying on the dip, as
we see the same old problems hanging around.""
 Growing concern over Greece's fiscal status, dollar weakness
and high oil prices continue to fuel nervousness in the
financial markets, driving investors to seek safe haven in
bullion. [ID:nLDE7491FC]
 But this has not translated into hefty inflows of metal into
exchange-traded funds, at least not yet. Global gold ETF
holdings are at their lowest for the year, around 64.322 million
ounces, having declined by nearly 10 percent in the past week
alone. [GOL/ETF]
 Holdings of metal in the iShares Silver Trust , the
world's largest silver-backed ETF, rose to a one-week high of
10,585.99 tonnes by May 10, reflecting some of the
bargain-hunting that has taken place since the price hit its
lowest in over two months. [GOL/ETF]
 Spot silver  reversed course and fell 3.1 percent to
$37.26, having risen earlier by as much as 2.7 percent to
$39.48, falling after three straight days of gains. COMEX silver
 fell 3.4 percent to $37.17.
 The gold/silver ratio -- the number of ounces of silver
needed to buy one ounce of gold -- has risen for four
consecutive days, indicating gold's outperformance over silver.
 Platinum group metals fell in line with the rest of the
commodities complex. Spot platinum  fell 0.7 percent to
$1,780.49, while palladium  fell 1.0 percent to $716.05.

 By Gene Ramos and Matthew Robinson
 NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled over 4
percent on Wednesday after an unexpected rise in gasoline
stocks amid slowing demand sent prices into a tailspin,
triggering a five-minute halt in trade and fueling the second
big commodities sell-off in a week.
 The momentum of gasoline's biggest fall in over two years
washed across the oil complex and hit everything from silver to
copper to the euro. Early losses stemming from weak Chinese
industrial output data and gains in the dollar tied to Greek
debt woes spiraled through the day, setting off sell-stops.
 The abrupt tumble drove oil volatility <.OVX> to its
highest close since mid-March as traders struggled to figure
out where markets might find equilibrium after diving more than
$13 a barrel from their peak just last week.
 ""The gasoline market continues to run crazy. Last week's
steep slide has increased volatility in the market, and we are
still responding skittishly to that,"" said Gene McGillian,
analyst for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""The underlying fundamentals haven't changed enough to see
this kind of price change. The market is nervous.""
 Unlike last Thursday's precipitous fall concentrated in the
crude oil market, activity focused on gasoline, which fell
after the first rise in stocks in 12 weeks and as traders
reckoned it less likely that flooding would affect refineries
bordering the Mississippi River. [EIA/S]
 Trading of crude and refined products halted after gasoline
futures dropped 25 cents, the limit down, tripping a
five-minute circuit breaker aimed to calm feverish markets. It
was the first time the breakers had been hit since the
financial crisis in September 2008.
 Gasoline fell further after trade resumed, breaking
technical levels. Total volume reached a record 240,000 lots.
 Brent crude  settled down $5.06 to $112.57 a barrel.
U.S. crude  fell $5.67 to $98.21 a barrel, after touching
as low as $97.50 a barrel.
 U.S. gasoline futures  suffered the biggest daily
drop since Sept. 2008, with the June contract settling at
$3.1228 a gallon, losing 25.69 cents, or 7.6 percent. It was
the biggest loss in dollar terms since September 2008.
 Rising fuel costs this year have fueled calls by U.S.
lawmakers to cut down on speculation in oil markets.
 Those calls grew louder on Wednesday, even as prices fell,
with a group of 17 U.S. senators calling on regulators to
immediately crack down on ""rampant oil speculation"" by
hastening planned rules to limit concentration.[ID:nN11248413]

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<
 STRONG VOLUME, HIGH VOLATILITY
 Trading volumes, which have spiked amid the frenzied trade
seen over the past week, surged again. Brent trading exceeded
770,000 lots in late U.S. activity, about 72 percent over the
30-day moving average, while trading on U.S. crude futures was
about 40 percent over that average.
 Oil market volatility rose sharply after the release of
inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration,
sending the CBOE's oil volatility index <.OVX> out of a narrow
trading range to hit a high of 43.8 percent. [ID:nN11248752]
 In addition to the surprise build in gasoline inventories,
the first rise in stocks after 11 consecutive declines, the EIA
report showed a large rise in crude oil stockpiles as gasoline
demand continued to trail year-ago levels.
 The biggest increase came in the U.S. Northeast, including
the New York harbor delivery point for the NYMEX gasoline
contract.
 CHINA, MARGINS
 Early pressure on prices came after data showed China's
industrial output growth eased much more than expected in
April, suggesting the world's second-biggest economy is
cooling. Consumer inflation eased modestly to 5.3 percent in
April from a 32-month high in March of 5.4 percent.
[ID:nL3E7GB0H2]
 Wednesday's fall in oil prices could prove another blow to
commodity hedge funds, after last week's oil drop spurred
double digit losses to big name funds such as Astenbeck and
BlueGold. [ID:nN09256393]
 Crude plunged more than $16 a barrel last week -- down 10
percent on Thursday alone -- with investors weighing factors
from the death of Osama bin Laden to the impact of higher fuel
and commodity costs on the economies of consumer nations to
monetary policy in major economies.
 CME Group Inc , which owns the NYMEX, increased
margin requirements on gasoline futures on Wednesday, following
a similar move for crude futures on Monday amid soaring
volatility. [ID:nL3E7GB416] ICE Clear Europe also raised
margins for Brent crude on Wednesday, creating more downward
pressure on prices. [ID:nL3E7GB3OO]

 By Alejandro Barbajosa	
 SINGAPORE, May 11 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose past $118 on
Wednesday after a jump in China's implied oil demand to the
third-highest level on record showed that Beijing's efforts to
cool the economy of the second-largest oil consumer are doing
little to dent use.	
 Brent crude for June  gained 80 cents to $118.43 a
barrel by 0737 GMT after earlier trading as low as $117.08. U.S.
crude  rose 50 cents to $104.38.	
 ""The bullish data shows that China's oil demand growth is
still very much intact,"" despite the government's tightening
measures, said Serene Lim, an ANZ Bank oil analyst based in
Singapore.	
 With the start of the summer U.S. driving season around the
corner, investors are focusing on falling inventories of
gasoline in the world's top market, paying less attention to
rising crude stockpiles.	
 ""U.S. gasoline inventories have been coming off, so we still
see healthy demand despite concerns of higher commodity prices
slowing consumption,"" Lim said. 
 U.S. gasoline stocks fell by 1.8 million barrels in the week
to May 6, the American Petroleum Institute said late on Tuesday,
versus an expected drop of 200,000 barrels. Inventories are now
nearly 11 million barrels below levels this time last year.

 Robust demand growth in China is also helping allay concerns
of a deteriorating outlook for consumption in top consumer the
United States.	
 


 Oil prices will stay firmly above $100 a barrel for the rest
of the year despite last week's correction and might even target
new highs as supplies remain tight and developing economies
grow, a Reuters poll showed. [ID:nLDE7451PZ]	
 ""The crude market has some place for prices to go higher,""
Lim said.	
 
 CHINA'S IMPLIED OIL DEMAND	
 China's implied oil demand, a combination of crude oil
throughput and net imports of refined oil products, was at 9.32
million barrels per day (bpd) last month, Reuters calculations
showed, up 8.8 percent from a year earlier. [ID:nL3E7GB0AP]	
 The jump in demand came even as the country's industrial
output growth in April missed expectations with a slight
slowdown to 13.4 percent on the year from a pace of 14.8 percent
in March, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.	
 China's inflation eased a touch to 5.3 percent in the year
to April from a 32-month high of 5.4 percent in March but was
still higher than expected, keeping the door open for more
tightening steps. [ID:nL3E7GB06W]	
 Demand elsewhere, especially in developed economies, may not
be as resilient to high prices.	
 The U.S. government late on Tuesday cut its projection for
world oil demand this year by the most in 10 months, as crude
prices well over $100 a barrel are starting to take a bite out
of consumption. [ID:nN10109808]	
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration's 120,000 barrel
per day (bpd) reduction in its 2011 demand growth forecast is
the latest sign that analysts are factoring in less fuel use as
a result of gasoline and jet fuel prices approaching 2008 peaks.	
 OPEC and the Paris-based Energy Information Administration
will release their reports later this week. 
 More than half the reduction was due to lower than expected
fuel use in the U.S., where 2011 oil demand will grow by only
130,000 bpd, the EIA said its Short-Term Energy Outlook. A month
ago the agency had predicted growth of 210,000 bpd.	
 API data showed U.S. crude stockpiles rose 2.9 million
barrels last week, compared with a forecast of a 1.4
million-barrel gain in a Reuters poll, helped by higher imports.	
 U.S. government data on oil inventories and demand from the
EIA will follow later on Wednesday.	
 In Japan, commercial crude inventories rose 6.9 percent last
week, reflecting a lower refinery utilisation rate following
weak product sales after a devastating earthquake hit northeast
Japan in March, hurting consumer sentiment. [ID:nL3E7GB0IG]

 SINGAPORE, May 11 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell towards $117
on Wednesday after China's inflation exceeded expectations in
April, rekindling concern that Beijing's efforts to cool the

energy demand.	
 A jump in China's implied daily oil demand in April to the

failed to take Brent out of negative territory.

 SINGAPORE, May 11 (Reuters) - - Gold firmed a touch and
silver rose more than 2 percent on Wednesday, as concerns about
China's high inflation and waning economic growth are seen
buoying interest in precious metals.	
 China's inflation in April was stronger than expected, at
5.3 percent on the year, while industrial output was
considerably weaker than forecast. [ID:nLDE74A01W]	
 High inflation and lower economic growth in China, the
world's second-largest economy, are likely to dampen risk
appetite and support interest in gold, though reaction to the
data was muted.	
 Spot gold rose by half a percent to $1,522.96 an
ounce by 0615 GMT, building on gains in the past three sessions.	
 U.S. gold  edged up 0.4 percent to $1,523.10.

 Growing concern over Greece's fiscal status, dollar weakness
and high oil prices continue to fuel nervousness in the

 Brent crude was steady near $118 after a jump in China's
implied oil demand to the third-highest level on record showed
that Beijing's efforts to cool the economy of the second-largest
oil consumer are doing little to dent use. 
 Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust remained unchanged at a
one-year low, but those in the iShares Silver Trust , the
world's largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund, extended a
rise of 3 percent in the previous session and edged up 0.2
percent to a one-week high of 10,585.99 tonnes by May 10.

 Spot silver rose as much as 2.3 percent to $39.34,
before easing to $39.19, on course for a fourth straight session
of gains. COMEX silver  gained nearly 2 percent to
$39.22.	
 Silver prices plunged more than 25 percent last week and
gold nearly 5 percent, prompting buying in the physical market
in Asia, dealers said.	
 ""We saw buying when gold dipped below $1,500 from China,
India and Indonesia, but not much scrap selling, as people are
still bullish on gold,"" said a Hong Kong-based dealer.	
 Technical analysis echoed bullish sentiment in the physical
market, as it indicated that gold could rise to $1,531 in the

 ""It's not beyond reason for gold to reach another record

 * Prices to spur earnings; weather to boost output
 
 By Mark Denge
 NAIROBI May 10 (Reuters) - Kenya expects its coffee export
earnings to rise by 5-10 percent in the 2010/11 season thanks to
good prices and improved output, the ministry of agriculture's
top official said on Tuesday.
 Statistics from industry regulator Coffee Board of Kenya
showed east Africa's biggest economy earned 16 billion Kenyan
shillings ($189.7 million) from the 2009/10 (Oct-Sept) coffee
season, a 50 percent jump from the previous year.
 This was despite a drop in output to 40,000 tonnes due to
bad weather from 54,000 tonnes in the 2008/09 season, when the
industry earned 10.7 billion shillings.
 Sales at the Kenyan coffee auction more than doubled in the
first quarter of the 2010/2011 crop season, rising 112 percent
to $45.73 million.
 ""Despite the early break in the 2010/11 marketing season we
expect earnings to grow by between 5 and 10 percent,""
Agriculture Ministry Permanent Secretary Romano Kiome told
Reuters in an interview.
 ""Prices have been robust throughout the season and we expect
that to reflect in the overall earnings later in the year.""
 Kenya last month suspended its weekly auction of the
commodity following a relentless dip in volumes and crop
quality. The auction resumes on June 7. Kenya's coffee marketing
season typically breaks around the July-August window.
 Kenyan coffee prices have hit records this year -- climbing
as high as $1,022 per bag -- because of high prices
internationally and a squeeze in the local supply.
 
 YOUNG FARMERS
 Kiome said output from the 2010/11 season was expected to be
between 12,000 and 15,000 tonnes higher compared to production
in the 2009/10 season on improved weather.
 ""The weather looks promising so far and unless we have any
incidences of coffee berry disease towards August then the crop
output will be very good. We expect output to grow by between
12,000 and 15,000 tonnes,"" he said.
 Traditionally, coffee volumes at auction surge around March
but they peaked earlier this year after the east Africa nation
witnessed unusually heavy rains in the first months of last
year.
 Kiome said a surge in the number of youthful entrepreneurs
taking up coffee farming is expected to revamp the industry.
 ""It is thrilling to see more young farmers moving to take
over the coffee farms and injecting fresh ideas and energy. This
is certain to drive both quality and output volumes for the good
of the industry,"" he said.
 ""The good prices being realised globally have made many
especially the youth to rethink about coffee as a serious
business venture.""
 The official said government-led reforms were also
encouraging more farmers to invest in coffee production.
 Most small-scale coffee farmers disillusioned by poor
earnings have neglected their coffee trees or chopped them down
altogether and taken up dairy farming in frustration at years of
hard toil with no returns.
 According to new rules, co-operatives can keep only 20
percent of net sales and must pass on the rest to farmers.
Growers are also replacing corrupt co-operative officials that
siphoned their cash, which is also beginning to bear yields.

 * Talks stalled after legal snags
 * Gas needed to deal with chronic power shortage
 
 By Rania El Gamal
 BAGHDAD, May 10 (Reuters) - Iraq and Royal Dutch Shell have
settled most of the pending legal issues that have delayed a $12
billion gas deal for more than two years, an Iraqi deputy oil
minister said on Tuesday.
 Since the signing of an initial agreement in 2008, Iraq has
been working to finalise a joint venture between its South Gas
Co, Shell and Mitsubishi to capture associated gas at southern
oilfields.
 Iraq has struggled for years with power blackouts and risks
years more of electricity shortages. Using associated gas is a
centrepiece of its master plan to boost electricity production
to keep up with demand that is double the rate of supply.
 Deputy Oil Minister Ahmed al-Shamma said he expected a final
draft of the agreement to be ready by next week but could not
give a timeframe for when it would be presented to the Iraqi
cabinet for approval and signing.
 ""I just came back from meetings with Shell in Istanbul. We
have found satisfactory solutions for all the issues that we
(disagreed) upon before,"" Shamma said. ""We have reached a common
agreement.""
 The deal has suffered a series of setbacks including legal
hurdles and political opposition.
 On Monday Deputy Prime Minister Hussain al-Shahristani said
the oil ministry had reached a final draft contract on the gas
deal and sent it to Iraq's cabinet for approval.
 But Shamma said legal advisers from both parties were still
trying to finalise a final draft, a positive step towards ending
the saga.
 ""We left it now to the lawyers to draft the final
agreement,"" he told reporters.
 ""The deal has been delayed because the country does not have
instructions or laws that govern gas (production). There is not
enough understanding. Gas is more difficult than oil in
processing,"" he added.
 If a deal is reached, more than 700 million cubic feet per
day of gas could be captured at southern fields to help deal
with power shortages.

 * Revenues 1.202 bln euros, up 3.9 percent
 * CEO confident of achieving 2011 targets
 * Shares up 2.1 percent, outperform Milan index
 (Adds company comment, detail, background, shares)
 MILAN, May 10 (Reuters) - Italy's Autogrill, the world's
biggest airport retailer, stuck to its 2011 guidance in the face
of rising oil prices which took a toll on first-quarter core
earnings.
 The Italian group, which manages motorway and airport
restaurants from Canada to New Zealand, said on Tuesday core
earnings slowed 8.1 percent to 85.9 million euros ($122.7
million) in the first quarter, partly due to increasing oil and
raw material prices and higher marketing and labour costs.
 ""The positive trend in airport traffic, above all in the
United States, and the measures taken by the group enable us to
be confident of achieving our full-year objectives"", Chief
Executive Gianmario Tondato Da Ruos said in the results'
statement.
 The group posted a first-quarter net loss of 4.3 million
euros, better than a mean forecast for a loss of 8.5 million
euros by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and down from a 9.1 million
euros loss a year ago.
 Autogrill shares were up 2.10 percent to 9.86 euros at 1021
GMT, outperforming Milan's all-share index.
 The company, which manages more than 5,300 points of sale in
39 countries, said in March it expected continued high oil
prices and weak economic growth to almost wipe out earnings
growth this year.
 Autogrill, which sold its air catering unit last autumn,
said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA) were likely to be between 610 million and
640 million euros this year. 
 First-quarter revenues were 3.9 percent higher, or up 2
percent at constant currencies, to 1.202 billion euros, helped
by recovery in airport traffic. Sales in the first 17 weeks of
the year were up 4.5 percent at constant rates.
 The group forecasts revenues this year of 5.8-5.9 billion
euros.

 By Tom Bergin
 LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - Civil unrest in Egypt and Tunisia
hit production and profits at British gas and oil producer BG
Group Plc in the first quarter and forced it to cut its output
growth forecast for this year.
 Underlying pretax profit fell 8 percent, the company said on
Tuesday in an update that missed forecasts and knocked 1.9
percent off the company's shares.
 They traded at 1,408 pence by 1030 GMT after falling as low
as 1,365.5, their lowest since early February.
 BG said its profit excluding non-cash accounting charges
fell to $1.01 billion, compared with a forecast for $1.24
billion in a Reuters poll.
 The company said gas and oil production fell 5 percent as
disorder in Egypt and Tunisia curbed operations at its liquefied
natural gas (LNG) production facilities there.
 Chief Executive Frank Chapman said he did not expect BG to
be punished for its association with the previous
administrations and that the new governments needed companies
like BG to provide the investment the countries needed.
 ""I have every expectation that we will, engaged as we are
with the current interim administration period, sustain our long
term interests in both countries,"" he told reporters on a
conference call.
 North Sea field maintenance and extensive flooding in
Queensland, Australia, where it produces gas, also weighed on
output.
 BG now only expected modest production growth in 2011.
 Previously, the company had indicated 7 percent per annum
long-term growth.
 ""The plans for a ramp-up in production in 2012 and 2013, as
well as our 2020 goals, are unaffected,"" he said.
 Analysts at Bernstein, who described the results as a ""messy
miss"", said they still forecast 2001 growth of 3.5 percent, 12
percent in 2012 and, on average, 14 percent each year from 2010
to 2015.
 ""Consequently, we continue to rate BG Outperform with a
£16.70 price target (NAV derived) and it remains
one of our top picks in the sector,"" the brokerage said in a
research note.
 An increase in British North Sea taxes also hit profit.
Stuart Joyner, oil analyst at Investec, said he had reduced his
estimated 2011 earnings per share by 10 percent following a
review of the statement and incorporating the impact of the UK
tax hike.

 By Ken Wills and Wan Xu	
 BEIJING, May 10 (Reuters) - First Solar, Inc , and
China Power International New Energy Holding Ltd (CPINE), a
wholly owned subsidiary of China Power New Energy Development Co
Ltd (CPNE) , have agreed to collaborate on solar
photovoltaic projects in China, the United States and other
international markets, the two companies said in a statement on
Tuesday.	
 First Solar and CPINE will initially explore collaboration
on solar photovoltaic projects in China, and will identify
investment opportunities for CPINE in the United States and
other global markets. 
 The two companies signed a strategic cooperation framework
agreement in Beijing on Tuesday, paving the way for cooperation
in the near future.	
 ""This cooperation leverages our advantages in the domestic
solar power industry, and helps First Solar further expand its
business presence in China,"" Li Xiaolin, chairwoman of China
Power International, CPNE and CPINE, said in the statement	
 ""In addition, we are happy to explore other cooperation
opportunities in different areas and through different methods
with First Solar, working together to further expand in the
global market,"" Li said.	
 CPINE is a subsidiary of China Power International Holding
Ltd, the main listed arm of China Power Investment Corp, one of
China's five major state-owned power producers.	
 ""This agreement can serve as a model for U.S.-China
collaboration on renewable energy,"" TK Kallenbach, President of
First Solar's Components Business Group, was quoted as saying.	
 Arizona-based First Solar, which makes the world's lowest
cost thin-film solar modules, is the largest solar company by
market value.	
 First Solar and CPINE are still in discussion to finalise
solar projects to cooperate in China and overseas, with no
timeline set yet, China Representative of First Solar Kevin
Berkemeyer said at a press briefing in Beijing.	
 First Solar is currently developing another giant solar
project in Ordos of Inner Mongolia with China Guangdong Nuclear
Solar Energy Company. It plans to install 30 megawatts of solar
power generation capacity in the first phase, and will
eventually expand to 2 gigawatts capacity by 2020.	
 The new partnership with CPINE was the next step First Solar
took to diversify their relationships within China to get a
broader set of opportunities, Kallenbach said.	
 However, China's power policy is a concern for foreign power
companies who invest in China.	
 ""China's solar power is still under development. I think the
concessionary bidding economics are extremely challenging. The
concessionary bidding process doesn't give you the kind of
long-term visibility that you would like, so both of these are
challenges,"" Kallenbach said.

 By Matthew Robinson and Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Tuesday, supported
by concerns that flooding could hit the U.S. Gulf Coast
refining hub and data showing strong Chinese crude imports for
April.
 While no refineries had been forced to cut operations yet,
rising waters along the Mississippi threatened to disrupt
plants in Louisiana, including the second largest U.S.
refinery, in the next two weeks.
 Gasoline futures led oil market gains, with the flood
threat adding to concerns about 11 straight weeks of inventory
declines as the United States gears up for the peak summer
holiday period. [ID:nN10229975]
 U.S. gasoline inventories fell 1.8 million barrels last
week, the industry group American Petroleum Institute said in a
report released late on Tuesday, much more than the
200,000-barrel dip analysts polled by Reuters had expected,
[API/S] [ID:nN10113370]
 But crude stockpiles rose 2.9 million barrels, the API
said, more than double expectations, and distillate stocks rose
582,000 barrels, in line with estimates.
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration's inventory
report follows on Wednesday morning.
 Brent crude for June delivery  rose $1.73 to settle
at $117.63 a barrel. U.S. June crude  settled up $1.33 at
$103.88 a barrel as U.S. gasoline futures  jumped 3
percent.
 Crude oil trade volumes, which surged last week as prices
tumbled $16 a barrel, remained strong with Brent volumes 60
percent over the 30-day moving average and U.S. crude 15
percent above that average, according to Reuters data.
 Trading volume has been high as traders remain cautious and
watch every market turn after last week's sell-off and the 6
percent rebound on Monday, analysts said.
 ""Crude futures are stronger today as the flooding in
Mississippi River has raised worries about refinery operations
in that region,"" said Mark Waggoner, president of Excel Futures
in Bend, Oregon.
 ""The other bullish influence today is the strong trade data
from China, which seems to have overcome, at least for the
moment, concerns about any slowdown in its economy.""

 Chinese crude oil imports in April were the third highest
on record, on a daily basis, at 5.24 million barrels of crude
oil per day (bpd), up 1.7 percent on the year, official customs
data showed on Tuesday. [ID:nL3E7GA0AX]
 Oil product imports in the No. 2 oil consumer fell by 17
percent drop, however, as smaller refineries cut runs to cope
with high oil prices, diminishing demand for feed stocks.
 News that the CME Group Inc  raised margins on U.S.
crude oil futures for a fourth time since February in an effort
to tackle rising volatility weighed on prices in early trade.
 ""Having high margin requirements makes it more difficult
for speculative traders to enter the market, so naturally that
will cause less speculative activity in oil markets,"" said Ben
Westmore, commodity economist at National Australia Bank.

 TOKYO, May 10 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Naoto Kan said on
Tuesday that renewable energy would be a key pillar of Japan's
new energy policy after the world's worst nuclear crisis in 25
years, but that it would still rely on nuclear power for much of

electricity supply in the future must be reviewed from scratch.	
 The massive earthquake and tsunami on March 11 knocked out
cooling systems at the Fukushima plant in northeast Japan, and
the prolonged crisis could hamper Japan's efforts to reduce its

promoting natural energy and renewable energy,"" he said, citing
wind, solar or biomass energy as possible alternative sources --
areas that Japan lag globally.	
 Japanese engineers are still trying to gain control of the
Fukushima Daiichi plant, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo,
whose cooling system was knocked out after the massive quake and
tsunami and four out of the six reactors at the plant remain
volatile.	
 Unpopular Kan, under fire for his handling of the Fukushima
crisis, last week called for Chubu Electric 's Hamaoka
nuclear plant in central Japan to halt operations until it can
be better defended against a major tsunami, and Chubu on Monday
reluctantly agreed to this.	
 While some have lauded Kan's calls, several business leaders
and media, which tend to be close to the politically influential
nuclear power industry, have criticised his move as being too
abrupt and lacking a sound explanation.	
 Kan defended his decision, saying that the request was made
after careful deliberation.	
 Japan will need to conduct a thorough investigation into the
nuclear incident, Kan said, adding he wants to call on the
international community for safer use of nuclear power.	
 The prime minister, who is the fifth leader of Japan in as
many years, is likely to speak about his country's atomic crisis
at the Group of Eight summit at the end of May in France.

 By Melanie Burton
 LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - Copper climbed on Tuesday, as
robust China trade figures burnished risk appetite and investor
demand for the metal used in power and construction, offsetting
news that headline imports in April fell.
 Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange traded at
$8,960 a tonne in official rings, versus $8,890 a tonne on
Monday's close.
 The metal fell to its lowest since early December at
$8,657.50 a tonne last week.
 China posted its biggest trade surplus in four months in
April, swinging from a trade deficit in the first quarter, as
exports hit a record on stronger global demand despite initial
signs of a pinch from Japan's earthquake and nuclear crisis.
 The figures in general boosted risk appetite, and even a
drop in headline copper imports could be read as bullish for
demand in the world's top consumer of base metals, which has
helped underpin prices, said analyst Daniel Briesemann of
Commerzbank.
 ""Some players think that the lower imports dynamics mean
that China is currently now using local stockpiles to make up
for demand,"" he said.
 ""This could already be seen over the last couple of weeks as
Shanghai copper inventories have been falling.""
 China's imports of copper fell 13.7 percent to 262,676
tonnes in April from 304,299 tonnes in the previous month, data
from the General Administration of Customs showed.
 However, copper stocks held in warehouses monitored by the
Shanghai Futures Exchange have dropped by 30 percent since
mid-March.
 There are signs also that the influx of copper into East
Asian warehouses monitored by the LME this year is slowing.
 LME copper stocks fell by a small 275 tonnes, the latest
data showed, with a dearth of stocks into Asia.

 However, total LME stockpiles at 468,325 tonnes are still
close to their highest levels since June 2010.
 Analysts said an exodus of investors from the copper market
could see prices slip to the $8,000 a tonne mark before heading
back towards record highs later this year as stronger demand
from China and Japan becomes visible.
 
 ALUMINIUM NEARBY
 China imported 76,724 tonnes of unwrought aluminium,
including primary, alloy and semi-finished aluminium products,
in April, down from March's 87,729 tonnes, the data showed.
 
 Reflecting a lack of available metal in May, cash aluminium
traded at a small $1.50 premium against the three-months
contract from a $31 discount one month ago.
 This may put pressure on short position holders to deliver
metal when the May contract becomes prompt next week, a London
trader said .
 ""Last time there was a bit of tightness we saw 100,000
tonnes delivered into Vlissingen. This time I think it's
probably going to run right to the wire and we'll find out on
Monday.""
 LME aluminium changed hands at $2,650 a tonne from $2,612 on
Monday.
 In other metals, headline nickel stocks fell by 312 tonnes
to 115,560 tonnes, their lowest levels since August 2009, as
still soft demand eats away at constrained supply.
 ""It is still connected to the various outages we saw earlier
in the year... also LME is cheapest supply of nickel if you are
a merchant,"" an LME nickel trader said.
 Brazilian miner Vale said in February it will lose around 5
percent of its total 2011 nickel production due to a 16-week
shutdown of a smelter furnace in Canada.
 Nickel was at $24,800 from $24,375.
 Tin was untraded but bid at $30,000/30,050 from $29,795
while zinc, used in galvanizing was also bid at $2,178/2,179
from $2,164 on Monday's close.

 (Adds quotes, details, background)
 By Martin Roberts
 MADRID, May 10 (Reuters) - Goldcorp, the world's fifth
largest gold producer, said on Tuesday supply and demand
fundamentals showed gold's bull run was not over.
 ""I certainly think we're in much more the middle than near
the end of this long bull run,"" Chief Executive Chuck Jeannes
said in an interview.
 ""We have limited mine supply -- it has actually declined
over the past 10 years -- and very strongly increasing demand
world wide, both of the physical metal for jewellery and
investment.""
 Gold prices eased below $1,510 an ounce in Europe on Tuesday
as the dollar rose 0.5 percent against the euro on simmering
concerns over euro zone debt levels.
 Jeannes, speaking by telephone from a Barcelona conference,
said that Goldcorp would not be hedging its gold output.
 ""We are committed to providing full exposure to the gold
price to our investors. That's what they're looking for and
that's what they'll get,"" he said.
 Goldman Sachs late last year predicted gold would peak at
about $1,600 an ounce in 2012 at which point it forecasts the
Federal Reserve will begin raising rates, thereby undermining
some of the investment appeal for gold. 
 It recommended producers begin hedging some of their output
at this point in anticiation of a gradual price decline in line
with a strengthening dollar.
 Silver is a by-product of Goldcorp's gold operations and it
expects output to reach 30 million oz this year, which Jeannes
thought would make the company the world's third-largest
producer.
 He saw potential upside for silver prices.
 ""I don't think the silver run has necessarly ended, as would
have been indicated by the move last week and the rebound over
the past couple of days would support that,"" he said.
 
 MAY EXCEED OUTPUT TARGETS
 Goldcorp expects to produce 2.65-2.75 million oz of gold
this year, and 4 million oz by 2015 from mining projects in
Canada and Latin America.
 Jeannes said Goldcorp could exceed its target if it were
later able to include other potential projects in its formal
plan, like Noche Buena in Mexico and Cerro Blanco in Guatemala.
 In addition to silver, Goldcorp produces copper and zinc as
by-products but plans no expansion into base metals.
 ""Our strategy reains to be a gold-mining company,"" Jeannes
said. ""Don't look for us to go diversify into a pure base metal
opportunity.""
 Jeannes saw scope for mergers and acquisitions in the gold
sector, but noted that Goldcorp had already been active in
recent years.
 ""I'd actually be surprised if we didn't see a deal or two
going forward involving the majors,"" he said. 
 ""We have the luxury of kind of sitting back and not needing
to do anything, but being able to keep our eyes on opportunities
and being very selective if we want to move forward.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - Gold and silver prices rose
for a third straight session on Tuesday after last week's
sell-off, boosted by intense fighting in Libya, uncertainty
about debt-laden Greece and the rising cost of oil and grain.
 Concerns over a European debt crisis after conflicting
reports on a potential aid deal for Greece and similar problems
elsewhere in the euro zone underpinned prices, as did gains in
crude oil on concerns that U.S. flooding could hit refineries.
 Precious metals rose amid sharply higher commodity prices
across the board as the sector continued to recoup last week's
near-record losses. The price of silver still has more than
doubled since August 2010, and gold is up 25 percent.
 ""From loose monetary policy to fiscal uncertainty and
geopolitical unrest, those factors that have driven gold higher
still exist,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist
at broker-dealer Janney Montgomery Scott, which manages $53
billion in client assets.
 ""Until you see some normalization of those things, gold is
going to stay higher,"" he said.
 Spot gold  gained 0.2 percent to $1,516.81 an ounce
by 3:24 p.m. EDT (1924 GMT). U.S. gold futures for June
delivery  settled up $13.70 at $1,516.90 an ounce, after
trading in a range from $1,505.20 to $1,520.
 Spot silver  reversed initial losses to add 1.8
percent at $38.59 an ounce, after rallying 6 percent in the
previous session, its biggest one-day rise in six months.

 * Sales 1.67 billion euros, vs forecast 1.57 billion
 * Expects higher chemicals, plastics profits in 2011

(Adds detail)
 By Aaron Gray-Block
 AMSTERDAM, May 9 (Reuters) - Belgian chemicals group Solvay
reported a 79 percent jump in first-quarter operating profit,
beating estimates thanks to improved demand and price hikes, and
forecast higher full-year 2011 earnings.
 ""In the context of the globally favourable business climate
and based on its strategy of sustainable and profitable
growth, Solvay expects to improve its annual operating result,
both in chemicals and plastics activities in 2011,"" it said.
 Recurring earnings before interest and taxes from continuing
operations (REBIT) was 197 million euros ($275 million),
compared with a forecast for 148 million in a Reuters poll in
which the highest estimate was 165 million.
 Solvay was wxpected to report full-year REBIT of 794 million
euros. ING analyst Jan Hein de Vroe said both the consensus and
his 750 million euro forecast will need to be raised in light of
the first-quarter figures.
 Global chemicals firms have reported solid first-quarter
earnings reflecting strong demand, especially in Asia, and
because they have been able to raise prices for chemicals and
plastics to more than offset higher costs for raw materials,
such as crude oil, used in many chemicals products.
 Industry leader BASF beat estimates after demand from
carmakers picked up, while French specialty chemicals group
Rhodia, which Solvay is buying for 3.4 billion euros, raised its
2011 forecast.
 Solvay group sales from continuing operations were 1.67
billion euros, up 23 percent from a year-ago restated 1.36
billion euros, and against a forecast 1.57 billion euros.
 Solvay said sustained demand had allowed it to raise its
selling prices across its business to offset increased costs of
energy and some raw materials, adding volumes rose 10 percent
and it had raised prices 12 percent.
 ""The main good news is in caustic soda, where sales improved
41 percent,"" ING's De Vroe said. Caustic soda is used to make
detergents as well as in the pulp and paper industry.
 ""They are also talking about improved sales volumes for
vinyls, which is not too bad, although some of this might have
been a bit of restocking ahead of price increases.""
 Solvay's plastics unit reported REBIT of 116 million euros,
beating a forecast for 83.5 million, thanks to higher volumes
for both specialty plastics and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which
is used in construction.
 The PVC market has been problematic for Solvay in recent
quarters due to sluggish construction markets, increased
competition and higher costs.
 In the chemicals unit, record operating profit of 101
million euros also beat estimates of 78 million.
 Solvay's agreed buy-out of Rhodia will lift its exposure to
fast-growing markets such as China and Brazil to 40 percent and
allow it to further tap into higher-margin specialty chemicals.
 Solvay's shares have risen 18 percent since it announced the
deal, as it removed persistent worries over the type of
acquisition the company might make following the sale of its
drugs unit to Abbott Laboratories in February 2010.

 MILAN, May 9 (Reuters) - Edison, Italy's No. 2 power

 By Michael Hirtzer
 CHICAGO, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. grain futures rallied on
Monday, rebounding from the sell-off last week, with wheat
surging more than 3 percent on scorching temperatures in the
drought-ravaged southern Plains and dry weather in Europe.
 Corn futures rose about 1.5 percent as wet weather
continued to slow plantings in the eastern grain belt, although
farmers were making some progress in the western region.
 ""Every Sunday and every Monday, you price in the weather,
and there are a lot of bullish weather patterns that are
helping the markets this morning,"" said Tim Hannagan, analyst
at PFG Best in Chicago.
 ""Wheat got brutalized last week,"" he added.
 Wheat for July delivery was 25-3/4 cents higher at
$7.85-1/4 per bushel at the Chicago Board of Trade while CBOT
July corn climbed 11 cents to $6.97-1/4 per bushel.
 CBOT July soybeans were up 4-1/2 cents at $13.30-1/2,
following gains in corn and crude oil.
 A Kansas wheat tour last week concluded that HRW wheat
production in the largest producing state of the grain will be
the smallest since 1996 as drought has devastated the crop.
 Hot weekend temperatures in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas were
also likely to further stress the crop as wheat plants enter
the crucial heading phase.
 Highs on Sunday in Kansas ranged from 93 to 104 degrees
Fahrenheit (34 to 40 degrees C), with temperatures even hotter
in Texas and Oklahoma.
 'INCREDIBLE TEMPERATURES'
 ""These temperatures are incredible for this time of the
year and reflective of the extreme drought in Texas, Oklahoma
and southern Kansas,"" said Telvent DTN forecaster Mike
Palmerino.
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Wednesday will
release its first winter wheat production estimates of the year
and also update U.S. and global grain stocks.
 USDA late on Monday will release planting progress reports
for corn and soybeans and update conditions for the HRW wheat
crop.
 Analysts expect USDA to put corn plantings at 31 percent,
down from the five-year average of 53 percent, and soybeans at
7 percent planted, versus normal pace of 14 percent.
 Corn farmers were able to make some progress as a warm, dry
weekend in the western Corn Belt provided a planting window.
But rains are forecast for much of this week in South Dakota,
Minnesota, Illinois and elsewhere.
 Flooding along the lower Mississippi River left standing
water in fields in the mid-South and Delta regions and forced
closures of locks on the main waterway to the U.S. Gulf Coast.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, which tracks a basket of
commodities, on Monday gained 1.3 percent or about 4 points to
341.91, rebounding from the worst weekly decline last year
since December 2008.
 Analysts linked last week's sell-off in commodities to
financial investors reversing long commodities and short dollar
positions that helped boost corn futures to a record last
month.
 However, Hannagan warned the selling in grains could resume
if oil, gold or silver lose ground.
 ""Funds that trade a broad-based portfolio -- that's just
what they do. They'll trade any hat tossed in the ring,"" he
said. ""You're pricing in the weather with these big moves and

341.91, rebounding from the worst weekly decline last year
since December 2008.
 Analysts linked last week's sell-off in commodities to
financial investors reversing long commodities and short dollar
positions that helped boost corn futures to a record last
month.
 However, Hannagan warned the selling in grains could resume
if oil, gold or silver lose ground.
 ""Funds that trade a broad-based portfolio -- that's just
what they do. They'll trade any hat tossed in the ring,"" he
said. ""You're pricing in the weather with these big moves and
then that's done.""

 * MDC sees plans as economic looting
 
 By Nelson Banya
 HARARE, May 9 (Reuters) - Angloplat and Implats, the world's
top platinum miners, are cooperating with Zimbabwe on proposals
to sell majority shares in their local operations to blacks, a
government minister said on Monday.
 A government notice issued on March 25 by Indigenisation and
Economic Empowerment Minister Saviour Kasukuwere gave miners 45
days to provide plans on how they would comply with a law that
seeks to give stakes of at least 51 percent to locals.
 ""Most of the major mines are with us; they are co-operating.
What is left is for us to evaluate the substance of their
co-operation to see if it meets our expectations,"" Kasukuwere
told Reuters.
 Although 45 days have passed, ""the closing date is not
today, because it is 45 days excluding public holidays and
weekends,"" Kasukuwere said. This calculation would extend the
deadline to June 2.
 Foreign mining companies then have until Sept. 30 to comply
with the law and surrender 51 percent.
 Kasukuwere told Reuters last week Zimbabwe's cash-strapped
government would not pay any money for the mining stakes but
would base any payment negotiations on the state's ownership of
the southern African country's untapped mineral wealth.
 He said on Monday Kazakh mining group ENRC and Zimbabwe
Mining and Smelting Company (Zimasco), which is owned by
Sinosteel of China, had also submitted their local ownership
proposals.
 ""The companies are continuing to come in with their plans,""
he said.
 The coalition government, formed by bitter foes President
Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, is divided
over the implementation of the Indigenisation and Economic
Empowerment Act, signed into law in 2008. Critics say will hurt
the country's economic recovery prospects.
 Tsvangirai has called the empowerment drive ""looting and
plunder by greedy elite"".
 Global miner Rio Tinto and African-focused miner Mwana
Africa, which all have operations in Zimbabwe, did not respond
when asked whether they had submitted their proposals.

 * Industry concerned about 'cowboy' operators
 * Deployment of armed teams on ships is legal grey area
 * U.N. agency to discuss private maritime security firms
 
 By Jonathan Saul
 LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Maritime security firms have come
together to create a code of conduct and ethics, prompted by
alarm over the rising number of companies without seaborne
experience aiming to cash in on the surge in Somali piracy.
 Increasingly violent attacks on merchant ships and crews by
Somali gangs have led more ship owners to consider deploying
private security teams on board vessels, attracting companies
previously operating in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 ""There are literally hundreds of Iraq and Afghanistan
'expatriates' setting up shop, never having been aboard a ship
before, much less knowing how to defend it,"" said John Dalby of
security company Marine Risk Management.
 ""We have fears that a glut of inexperienced and unqualified
so-called maritime security operators are bringing the legit
guys into disrepute.""
 Dalby is one of the founders of the International
Association of Maritime Security Professionals (IAMSP), a
self-regulated, voluntary body seeking more transparency in the
sector. Its code of conduct includes ensuring members are
properly trained, abide by laws and regulations where they
operate, act ethically and do not accept bribes.
 ""Private security in the marine sector is currently not
regulated in the way that it is on land. There is a big worry
this could be opening the doors to a lot of cowboys,"" said
Andrew Linington with seafarers' union Nautilus International.
 
 PRICES UNDERCUT
 Officials say it costs around $55,000 to deploy an
experienced four-man security team on a 10-12 day transit
between Suez and Galle in Sri Lanka. Firms touting for business
without experience have offered teams at $15,000 to $20,000.
""Security companies and individual professionals who are
trying to operate to high standards get undercut by the
competition which is clearly less than satisfactory and provides
a less than satisfactory service,"" said David Buston, managing
director of security firm Red Cell and an IAMSP founder.
 Dalby said the IAMSP had over 400 members, including former
marines and special forces from Britain's Special Boat Service
and the United States' Navy Seals, comprising ""half of the
reputable industry"".
 Overstretched international navies have proved unable to
contain piracy in the Indian Ocean due to the vast distances
involved. The crisis is costing world trade billions of dollars
a year.
 ""The need to employ armed guards is an indication of the
lack of political resolve to control the spread of Somali-based
piracy across the northern Indian Ocean,"" said Peter Hinchliffe,
secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping.
 ""The lack of regulation in the private security sector in
the maritime domain is a problem and this is leading to growth
in the sector which suggests that standards may be very
variable.""
 
 ARMS TRADE
 David Stone, a licenced and registered arms dealer, director
of maritime security company APPDS Ltd and an IAMSP member, said
""fly-by-night"" security companies had to buy their weapons on
the black market in places such as Djibouti.
 When approaching a 12-mile territorial zone close to a port,
operators dumped their illicit weapons over board, he said, in
order to avoid getting caught breaking the law.
 ""It means when they do another transit they will have to buy
more arms. So it's a vicious circle of the proliferation of
illegal arms,"" Stone said. ""This is something that the IMASP is
trying to stop because it is illegal and gives a bad name to
everyone in the business.""
 The safety committee of the International Maritime
Organization, a United Nations agency, will this week discuss
the development of guidance on employing maritime security
companies.
 Many in the security industry have called for an amendment
related to the position of private armed teams, which is not
addressed under international maritime conventions.
 Maritime lawyers say armed private security guards involved
in a killing on board a ship may run the risk of criminal
prosecution in some countries.
 ""Whereas in the past it could be argued that non-lethal
countermeasures would be enough to deter pirates, as the threat
escalates, not being armed is now becoming more of a challenge
to justify,"" said Red Cell's Buston, whose firm provides
training and advice to maritime security professionals.
 ""Those that are in control of potential lethal force ...
must have clear and agreed procedures to work under. Without
this, the already grey area of armed guards at sea could turn
into a real mess.""

 * Concerns remain over Ivory Coast cocoa exports
 
 (Adds details, quotes, background, updates prices)
 By Sarah McFarlane and David Brough
 LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Soft commodity prices bounced
higher on Monday, in line with other commodity markets following
last week's sharp sell-off.
 Commodities bounced some way back on Monday from their
biggest weekly drop since 2008, revived by a weaker dollar and
strong U.S. jobs data, which helped restore some confidence to a
shaken investment community.
 ""In the short term, prices are going to remain vulnerable to
any moves in external markets, any moves in the U.S. dollar and
any sense around risk aversion and risk reduction,"" said
Sudakshina Unnikrishnan, an analyst at Barclays Capital.
 Sugar futures rose from near eight-month lows following a
lead from stronger oil and a weaker dollar, dealers said.
 ICE July raw sugar futures rose 0.28 cent or 1.4 percent to
20.75 cents a lb at 1403 GMT, after dipping to an eight-month
low of 20.40 cents on Friday.
 ""Twenty cents is a key bottom area,"" one dealer said.
 ICE sugar remained down more than 40 percent from its
30-year peak of 36.08 cents a lb touched on Feb. 2.
 ""We expect the market in the short term to correct a little
from the relentless downside pressure over the last nine
sessions, but overall, expect further downside over the medium
term,"" said Thomas Kujawa of brokerage Sucden Financial.
 Large supplies in the pipeline from Brazil and Thailand are
bearish for the market as they are expected to shift the supply
and demand balance sheet into surplus in 2011/12.
 Dealers talked of a pick-up of physical sugar enquiries at
the low prices.
 Egypt's state-owned Sugar and Integrated Industries Company
(SIIC) was tendering on Monday to buy raw sugar, European trade
sources said.
 One senior physical trade source told Reuters the SIIC was
tendering to buy 100,000 tonnes of raw sugar for May-June and
September shipment.
 Liffe August white sugar fell $1.80 or 0.3 percent to
$580.20 per tonne at 1409 GMT, above the eight-month low of
$571.90 hit on Thursday.
 
 COFFEE, COCOA
 Coffee prices were also stronger, although arabicas' rise
outpaced robustas as tight supplies of high quality beans
underpinned New York prices.
 ICE July arabica coffee rose 1.1 cent or 0.4 percent to
$2.8865 per lb at 1417 GMT, while Liffe July robustas were
unchanged at $2,598 a tonne.
 Dealers said that large European exchange stocks and
expected production increases from robusta exporting countries
weighed on the London market.
 Coffee farmers in Vietnam are ploughing gains from steadily
rising prices into fertiliser and water pumps to incrementally
lift yields.
 ""Indonesian farmers are investing, production capacity
should be increasing slowly,"" a European trader said, adding
historically high robusta prices were providing an incentive.
 Cocoa prices were swept up in the rise across commodity
markets as dealers monitored the first shipments of cocoa coming
out of top producer Ivory Coast in months.
 ""For cocoa there still remains concerns about the level of
exports coming out of the Ivory Coast, not because supply is an
issue but because of financing,"" Barclays Capital's Unnikrishnan
said.
 Ivory Coast resumed cocoa bean exports on Sunday, more than
three months after they were halted by the country's political
conflict, officials and a Reuters witness said.
 ICE second-month, July cocoa was up $22, or 0.7 percent at
$3,104 per tonne at 1419 GMT, while London July cocoa traded up
19 pounds or 1 percent at 1,909 pounds a tonne.

753,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2011 07:56AM ET</span>",EU agency sued for transparency on toxic chemicals," * Chemicals agency ECHA sued in fight over transparency
 * Environment groups want makers of 356 chemicals identified
 * Chemicals industry says move would damage confidentiality
 
 By Pete Harrison
 BRUSSELS, May 9 (Reuters) - Two environmental groups said on
Monday they had sued Europe's chemicals watchdog for withholding
information about the production of toxic chemicals.
 The lawsuit, filed by activist lawyers ClientEarth and
chemicals campaigners ChemSec, says the European Chemicals
Agency (ECHA) breached transparency laws by refusing to disclose
the names of facilities producing 356 potentially dangerous
chemicals.
 ECHA is Europe's agency for evaluating and restricting more
than 30,000 substances that currently face little regulatory
oversight, many of them a potential risk to human health.
 Companies wanting to sell chemicals must register them with
ECHA, including details on toxicity, which the agency will
publish on its website.
 A dispute has erupted over whether ECHA can also publish
names of manufacturers -- a move chemicals companies say will
endanger their commercial confidentiality and was not intended
when the control laws were agreed in 2007.
 ECHA told Reuters last week it had decided to publish
company names only in the case of firms that are suppliers of
hazardous substances, but that they could request
confidentiality. The move will be voluntary for producers of
non-hazardous chemicals.
 The agency, based in Helsinki, was not immediately available
on Monday to comment on the court action.
 ClientEarth lawyer Vito Buonsante said he had ""exhausted
all avenues"" to get transparency on toxic chemicals, and ChemSec
said legal action at the EU's General Court was now necessary.
 ""Knowing who is producing dangerous substances, and the
level of exposure, is vital to safeguard the public,"" said
ChemSec campaigner Jerker Ligthart.
 ""These chemicals are present in many consumer products, from
detergents and paints to computers and toys, and often in high
concentrations,"" he added. ""Commercial interests should not be
given precedence over people's health.""
 Chemicals industry group Cefic opposes publication of
company names, saying it might help overseas rivals compile a
detailed picture of the European chemicals market.
 It might also help customers switch chemicals suppliers to
cut out the middle-man and it could reveal changes of strategy
or innovation with new products.
 ChemSec last week highlighted 22 hormone-disrupting
chemicals routinely found in plastics, packaging and cosmetics
that it wants regulated by the European Union.
 ChemSec wants a total of 378 substances included in ECHA's
list of ""substances of very high concern"", which currently only
covers 47 chemicals.

754,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2011 07:28AM ET</span>",Iran doing final pre-start tests at nuclear plant," * Russian-built Bushehr complex has suffered many delays
 * Symbol of Iran's nuclear ambitions
 * Seen joining power grid in next two months
 TEHRAN, May 9 (Reuters) - Iran is conducting final tests at
its first nuclear power plant and it is expected to start
generating electricity in the next two months, Iranian media
said on Monday.
 Meant to be the first of a network of nuclear power stations
Iran says it is planning, the Russian-built Bushehr complex has
missed deadline after deadline to come on stream, most recently
fuel had to be removed and checked for technical problems.
 Fars news agency said Bushehr would start injecting power
into the national electricity grid in the next two months.
 ""Right now, after the fuel rods that were unloaded from the
reactor core were washed, they are being loaded again and final
tests are under way,"" Gholamali Miglinejad, a member of a
parliamentary committee monitoring Bushehr, was quoted as saying
by the student news agency ISNA.
 Iran began loading fuel into Bushehr last August in front of
foreign and domestic media, touting it as a symbol of resistance
to international sanctions imposed by countries that suspect the
Islamic state is seeking nuclear weapons, something it denies.
 At that time, Iranian officials said it would take two to
three months for Bushehr to start producing power, and that it
would generate 1,000 megawatts, about 2.5 percent of Iran's
electricity usage. Russia is providing the fuel for Bushehr.
 But the start-up of the plant has been hit by several delays
since then, with some analysts blaming the mysterious Stuxnet
computer virus. Tehran said Stuxnet had afflicted staff
computers at Bushehr but not affected major systems there.
 Security experts say the computer worm may have been a
state-sponsored attack on Iran's nuclear programme and have
originated in the United States or Israel. Neither country has
mentioned any link with Stuxnet.
 Diplomats and security sources say Western governments and
Israel view sabotage as one way of slowing Iran's nuclear work.
 
 NUCLEAR SABOTAGE IN IRAN?
 Some analysts believe Iran may be suffering wider sabotage
aimed at slowing its nuclear advances, pointing to a series of
unexplained technical glitches that have cut the number of
working centrifuges at its Natanz uranium enrichment plant.
 Natanz is at the core of Western concerns about Iran's
nuclear intentions since the country, without any nuclear power
plants other than Bushehr, has no current civilian use for
enriched uranium. Western leaders believe Iran, one of the
world's biggest oil and gas producers, secretly aims to refine
uranium to the high degree suitable for atom bombs.
 Earlier this month, an Iranian official said his country had
been hit by a new malware called ""Stars"". But foreign experts
have voiced doubt that this represented a second cyber attack.
 The Bushehr plant was begun by German electronics giant
Siemens in the 1970s but the project was halted by Iran's
Islamic Revolution in 1979.
 Russia later completed the plant and will supply its fuel.
 To ease concerns abroad that Iran might reprocess spent fuel
rods from Bushehr into bomb-grade plutonium, Russia will
repatriate the used fuel. The plant will also be regularly
monitored by inspectors of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency.
 Western officials have urged Iran to join the 1996
Convention on Nuclear Safety, saying the Islamic state would be
the only country operating a nuclear reactor which is not part
of the international pact once Bushehr is launched.
 The convention, with 72 signatory states at present, was
designed to boost global nuclear safety, an issue that has
gained more significance in light of Japan's Fukushima nuclear
crisis, through a system of peer review and mutual oversight.
 ""The plant's location on the coast makes the safety of
Iran's nuclear programme a regional security concern,"" the
International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank,
said in a report last month.
 It noted that Bushehr, like Fukushima, is in an earthquake
zone. But Iran does not need to fear a tsunami of the size that
knocked out the electricity and back-up cooling systems at
Fukushima, as Bushehr is located by the Gulf and not an ocean.

 By Naveen Thukral and Michael Hogan
 HAMBURG, May 9 (Reuters) - Chicago wheat rose over 2 percent
on Monday and corn added 1 percent as both rebounded from last
week's lows as concerns about bad crop weather in the United
States and Europe provided support.
 Soybean futures also firmed, tracking strength in corn and
crude oil as commodities recovered some way from their dramatic
slump last week on improved risk appetite following
better-than-expected U.S. job numbers.
 ""We are looking at the impact of weather on European crop
and the picture of U.S. winter wheat doesn't look too good,""
said Abah Ofon, an analyst with Standard Chartered Bank in
Singapore.
 An analyst at a European bank added: ""We are seeing a return
to fundamentals in grains markets following the meltdown last
week, with dry weather in parts of France and Germany which
could damage crops returning to focus.""
 ""The weaker dollar is also generally supportive.""
 Chicago Board of Trade July wheat rose 2.14 percent to
$7.75-3/4 a bushel by 1055 GMT in European trade on Monday as
the market recovered from the lowest levels seen since mid-March
reached in last week's selloff.
 Chicago July corn gained 1.02 percent to $6.93-1/2 a bushel,
while soybeans for July delivery rose 0.6 percent to $13.34-1/2
a bushel.
 Last week, front-month corn fell 9.4 percent, its biggest
weekly drop since October. Wheat futures fell 5.8 percent for
the week and soybeans fell 4.9 percent in the largest weekly
drop in commodity prices since 2008.
 The wheat market was supported by a drought trimming U.S.
winter wheat prospects and unfavourable weather in Germany,
France, China and Canada also pointing to possible tighter
supplies, particularly of higher protein wheat.
 European benchmark wheat in Paris surged on dry weather
worries in France and Germany. 
 Paris new crop November wheat was up 3.53 percent or 7.25
euros at 220 euros a tonne.
 ""North France, north Germany and Poland have not received
enough rain in past days and concern about falling yields is
growing,"" one European trader said. ""Plants could still recover
if they get rain but the window is starting to close.""
 ""Attention was also returning to bad news about the U.S.
crop last week which got forgotten in the commodity selloff.""
 Last week's tour of the Kansas wheat crop concluded that the
state's hard red winter wheat production this year would be the
smallest since 1996 at 256.7 million bushels. Global
supplies of high-quality wheat have been on the slide over the
past year, with excessive rains in top exporter Australia last
year downgrading its crop.
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will update its
weekly crop progress report at 2000 GMT. The USDA will also
issue on Wednesday its May supply-demand report, which will
offer the department's first estimate of the winter wheat crop
in the United States -- which accounts for nearly half of all
U.S. wheat exports.
 It will give its first estimate of ending stocks for this
year's corn and soybean crops. Additionally, it will update
global crop production numbers, including corn and soy
production in Brazil and Argentina.
 The euro rose on Monday as Asian and Middle East sovereign
investors bought the single currency after a steep drop last
week. A weaker dollar makes U.S. commodities attractive for
overseas buyers holding other currencies.

 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Commodities bounced some way back
on Monday from their biggest weekly drop since 2008, revived by
a weaker dollar and strong U.S. jobs data, which helped restore
some confidence to a shaken investment community.
 Brent crude oil broke above $111 a barrel and U.S. silver
leapt by more than 5 percent after data on Friday showed U.S.
private firms added jobs at the fastest pace in five years in
April.
 The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies as as
heartened investors turned to higher-yielding, riskier assets,
to the benefit of the commodity complex.
 The strong U.S. non-farm payrolls brought some relief to
markets concerned about the impact of soaring commodity prices
on shaky economic growth in Europe and the United States, and on
inflation in the fast-growing economies of China and India --
one of the factors behind last week's rout in the prices of raw
materials.
 Silver bore the brunt of last week's sell-off, falling by 25
percent in its biggest weekly slide in 30 years.
 ""We're seeing a bit of stabilisation after the horrors and
shock of last week,"" Credit Agricole analyst Robin Bhar said. 
""We've had a bit of a pullback in the dollar. The general
trend has been for the dollar to strengthen against the euro,
but there's been a bit of a bid coming back for the euro this
morning, so that's helping.""
 Oil had led the charge higher after both U.S. and Brent
crude fell by a record of more than $16 last week. 
 Brent crude rose 3.1 percent to $112.22 a barrel by 1037
GMT, off a high of $111.63. It tumbled $16.76 last week, its
largest weekly decline in dollar terms.
 ""Prices have fallen very sharply and very quickly, so people
are dipping their toes back in,"" said Citigroup analyst David
Thurtell.
 ""With the market a lot cleaner now than it has been for some
time, you can get some chunky moves in either direction.""
 Some heavyweight banks came out on Friday in oil's support,
with JP Morgan raising its 2011 Brent crude forecast by $10 to
$120 a barrel, citing an undersupplied market.
 Goldman Sachs, which in April predicted a major correction
for commodities, said that while it was not ruling out a further
fall in oil prices, crude could top its recent highs by 2012 on
tight global supplies.
 
 PRECIOUS REGAINS LUSTRE
 Silver futures were up by 6 percent, set for their largest
one-day rise in six months. But the rally was not enough to
recover the 20 percent lost over the previous five trading days.
 Spot silver rose 4.6 percent to $37.33 an ounce after losing
a quarter of its value last week. COMEX silver jumped 5.5
percent to $5.45 an ounce.
 The more than 30 percent plunge in silver prices from record
highs in late April, triggered by a string of margin hikes on
U.S. silver futures, accelerated the broad commodity decline.
 The extent of the exodus from silver was reflected in last
week's 33-million ounce decline in holdings of silver in
exchange-traded funds, which globally now stand at their lowest
this year.
 The world's largest silver ETF, the iShares Silver Trust
saw a record $1 billion outflow in the week ended May 4,
leaving holdings at a six-month low of 10,253.75 tonnes by
Friday.
 Spot gold rose 0.8 percent to $1,506.99 an ounce after
falling more than 4 percent last week.
 ""The dollar has stabilised, and it is not unusual that some
bottom fishing will be taking place,"" said Ole Hansen, a senior
manager at Saxo Bank. ""Gold did not break any significant levels
on the downside, so long-term investors were not forced out like
in silver, where it was pure carnage.""
 Friday's data showed U.S. non-farm payrolls rose 244,000 in
April, the largest rise in 11 months, outstripping forecasts for
a rise of 186,000, the most since February 2006.
 The data, which revived confidence in the world's No. 1
economy, boosted commodities on Friday after Thursday's
bloodbath, although a stronger dollar made those gains
short-lived.
 The 19-commodity benchmark Reuters-Jefferies CRB index
dropped 9 percent last week, its biggest weekly decline since
December 2008, the nadir of the global financial crisis.
 Attention shifted to Chinese data this week, starting with
trade numbers on Tuesday, for signs of import demand from the
world's top commodity consumer.
 ""If there's evidence that the Chinese are still not buying
or have cut their imports a lot you'll probably find that copper
could revisit the lows of last week,"" Citigroup's Thurtell said.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose 1.2
percent to $8,936 a tonne, while Chicago wheat led grains
higher, rising 2.3 percent to $7.77 a bushel, supported by
unfavourable weather conditions in the United States and Europe.

757,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2011 06:52AM ET</span>","ANALYSIS-Nuclear plant halt may boost unpopular PM, but how much?"," By Linda Sieg	
 TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Unpopular Japanese Prime Minister
Naoto Kan has succeeded in his rare bold move to shut down a
nuclear power plant due to safety fears, but the decision may
not win enough public applause to be a key factor his messy
battle to keep his job.	
 Kan, under fire for his handling of the crisis at another
nuclear plant crippled by a huge March 11 quake and tsunami,
asked for the shutdown of the Hamaoka plant 200 km (120 miles)
southwest of Tokyo on Friday, citing the high risk of another
powerful quake.	
 On Monday, Chubu Electric Power Co reluctantly
agreed to shut the plant until defences against a massive
tsunami can be improved. 
 Already Japan's fifth premier in as many years, Kan has seen
his ratings sink below 30 percent on concerns about his
leadership and faces calls from both inside and outside his own
party to step down -- although few expect him to quit easily and
there is no obvious successor waiting in the wings.	
 The political bickering has distracted policy makers from
efforts not only to figure out how to fund the massive cost of
rebuilding from the triple March 11 disasters, but from tackling
the deeper woes of a fast-ageing society and huge public debt.	
 Japanese mainstream media, which tend to have close ties to
Japan's politically influential nuclear power industry,
criticised what they called the abruptness of Kan's Hamaoka
request, although some analysts said many voters would approve.	
 ""You can say it was sudden, but the chance of a quake
affecting the plant is high, so the public will agree with his
decision,"" said political analyst Hirotaka Futatsuki. ""But I
don't know if this will go so far as to change Kan's image.""	
 An initial poll by broadcaster TBS conducted on the weekend
showed Kan's support rate had slipped three points to 29.5
percent, although more than half said Japan should either reduce
its number of nuclear plants or close them all.	
 About 70 percent said that while they were dissatisfied with
Kan, they wanted him to stay in his post a while longer.

Experts have long warned about the risk to the Hamaoka plant
from a megaquake and the tsunami-triggered accident at Tokyo
Electric Power Co's (TEPCO) Fukushima Daiichi plant
northeast of the capital has fanned those concerns.	
 
 POWER SHORTAGE CONCERNS	
 The temporary shutdown of Hamaoka, which supplies power to
central Japan -- home to many manufacturers including Toyota
Motor Corp -- has added to concerns about power
shortages in the summer when usage peaks.	
 ""It's good they're closing Hamaoka. They talked a lot about
the earthquake risks ... so I'm glad they are going to shut it
down. But I'm worried about power shortages in the summertime,""
said a mother strolling in Tokyo with her two-year-old son.	
 Kan may also face criticism given that Japanese media and
many pundits, while typically professing a longing for decisive
leadership, often seem uncomfortable when it is exercised.	
 ""For a change, he took a risk and made a decision that was
quite justified, but the way people are so reluctant to give him
credit doesn't lead me to believe that this is going to be a
game-changer (politically),"" said Sophia University professor
Koichi Nakano.	
 Members of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) sniped at what they dubbed a hasty, ill-explained
decision, but some outspoken politicians applauded the move.	
 ""The job of elected politicians is to set goals to mobilise
the public ... There may be many who oppose the decision but
without a doubt, the overwhelming number of people feel that
even if there is some burden from halting operations at the
dangerous Hamaoka plant, they want to make efforts to achieve
that goal,"" Toru Hashimoto, the popular governor of Osaka in
western Japan, said in a televised interview at the weekend.	
 Even one ally of Kan's heavyweight Democratic Party of Japan
rival, former DPJ leader Ichiro Ozawa, expressed approval.	
 Ozawa's group probably won't abandon attacks on Kan, but
prospects they lack the numbers to unseat the premier by backing
a no-confidence motion mean Kan could last until his term as
party leader expires in 2012, said DPJ lawmaker Hirotami
Murakoshi.	
 Whether Kan follows his Hamaoka decision by outlining a
broader energy policy that points to a shift away from nuclear
power over time remains in much doubt, especially given the
industry's deep tentacles in the DPJ as well as the rival LDP.	
 A top government official said on Sunday Japan would not
back off from nuclear power, which supplies about one-third of
Japan's electricity needs, while the trade minister added that a
target to raise that to half by 2030 would have to be rethought.	
 ""Utilities are the ultimate in political power,"" said
Murakoshi, who favours gradually weaning Japan from reliance on
nuclear power over coming decades.

in paragraph 20; corrects location of the city of Kolkata,
dealer's name in paragraph 2.)	
 * Gold price fall comes on big festival day
 * Medallions see strong interest as holding value
 * Jewellery purchases too small to be swayed

 By Jo Winterbottom	
 NEW DELHI, May 6 (Reuters) - Indians, the world's biggest
buyers of bullion, took gold's latest tumble as another
incentive to buy on one of the country's most auspicious
festivals on Friday.	
 ""They started calling in from yesterday evening to lock in
this buying opportunity. Even as I am speaking to you my three
phones are ringing,"" said Harshad Ajmera, owner of JJ Gold House
in the eastern city of Kolkata.	
 In the capital's luxury Ashok Hotel, customers queued to pay
for medallions and jewellery with brown-paper wrapped wads of
banknotes at a fair for Akshaya Tritiya, one of the busiest
gold-buying festivals alongside Diwali and Dhanteras in autumn.	
 At the centre of a flower-festooned hall, women in
glittering saris and men in western gear weighed up gold
medallions at the busiest stall of the fair, organised by
India's largest bullion importer, state-run MMTC.	
 ""We're buying from an investment point of view and for the
festival,"" said a housewife from Delhi, who was buying a gold
medallion for the first time, and preferred to give just her
surname, Mehra.	
 The medallions come slotted into a credit card sized plastic
holder with the logo ""A Mark of Purity"" on the front and the
weight of the gold stamped on the back, along with a hallmark.	
 Mehra, in a turquoise gold-embroidered sari, said jewellery
tended to lose value on re-sale.	
 ""When you return medallions, it's the same value,"" she said.	
 Last night's fall had already translated into price cuts on
the floor, with a 20 gram gold medallion asking 47,375 rupees on
Friday from 48,015 rupees on Thursday.	
 Gold spot prices on international markets have fallen
over $100 in five days but had steadied on Friday to around
$1,486.96 per ounce.	
 India's gold market is almost entirely fed by imports, which
are expected to climb 64 percent to as much as 550 tonnes in
2011 with a normal monsoon forecast which may help farm incomes
recover after a severe drought in 2009 slashed spending power.	
 ""Those who will buy coins for investment may buy now,
expecting a rebound in prices,"" said Kimti Lal Jain of Kailash
Jewellery House in the capital. ""But do not expect any major
jump in jewellery sales.""	
 
 Jewellery buyers were taking the price fall in their stride
as the difference of daily price changes is lower given the
smaller size of purchases.	
 ""People here are not affected by the daily highs and lows.
If you're buying bulk, maybe it's an issue, said a homemaker
from Delhi at the MMTC fair, who gave only her surname, Sharma.	
 She had bought a pair of 22-carat gold bracelets with a
simple geometric design as an investment.	
 She did not say how much she spent but a similar pair,
weighing 26.31 grams, were on offer at 64,000 rupees ($1,429).	
 ""Price spikes don't make any difference for jewellery. For
raw gold, maybe people prefer to buy when the price goes down,""
said Love Kumar Sharma, senior manager with MMTC in Delhi.	
 Visitors to the fair were expected to more than double on
Friday to about 50,000 people, with turnover forecast at 80 to
100 million rupees ($1.8 million to $2.2 million), from about
thirty million rupees on Thursday.	
 Sanjay Anand, deputy general manager of MMTC, said around 40
percent of purchases would be jewellery with most of the rest in
medallions and plain gold. About five percent would be silver.
Cash purchases make up about 40 percent of turnover, with credit
cards paying for the remainder.	
 The Bombay Bullion Association (BBA) said it
expected total purchases on Akshaya Tritiya to be 20 metric
tonnes, up from 15 metric tonnes last year.	
 The Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange
extended trading hours for gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for
the festival by five and a half hours.	
 ""The fall is minuscule. And how much will you buy? You will
buy only to the extent that your pocket allows. I am certainly
not on a buying spree despite the fall,"" said Leena Singh, a
homemaker from Delhi buying in the Karol Bagh market in
preparation for the festival.

 NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - Gold gained 1 percent on Monday
and silver surged 5 percent, bouncing up on bargain hunting
after last week's sharp sell-offs and boosted by a ratings
downgrade of Greece and a broad commodities rally.
 Gold and silver rose sharply for a second session, but some
said gains were unlikely to last. Silver, hit by a succession
of margin hikes that nearly doubled costs, had its biggest
correction last week since prices collapsed in 1980.
 ""Last week's sell-off was indicative of something more
important in play -- the commodity markets are beginning to

the likelihood that the U.S. dollar had put in at least an
intermediate low,"" said James Dailey, portfolio manager of the

 * Chinese economic data awaited on Tuesday
 
 (Adds detail, comment, updates with closing prices)
 By Marie-Louise Gumuchian and Melanie Burton
 LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Copper ended higher on Monday on a
relief rally following steep losses last week, but a downgrade
of Greece's credit rating added to global slowdown fears and
capped the metal's advance.
 Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange
finished at $8,890 versus $8,825 a tonne at Friday's close. The
metal used in power and construction had hit $8,657.50 on
Friday, its lowest since early December.
 ""The market is still in shock from last week. This relief
rally is dominated by relatively thin volumes. The dollar has
begun to strengthen ... and the pattern is one to sell the
rallies at the moment,"" said analyst Alex Heath of RBC Capital.
 ""On the whole, the risk remains to the downside ... until we
see some clarity out of statistics to indicate that growth is
back on line,"" he said.
 The euro pared gains after Standard and Poor's cut Greece's
rating to B from BB-, dragging it further into junk territory
over concerns that a debt restructuring is increasingly likely.

 A stronger dollar makes commodities such as metals cheaper
for holders of other currencies.
 Commodity markets fell sharply last week, with the
Reuters-Jefferies CRB index down 9 percent in its biggest weekly
decline since December 2008 despite unexpectedly strong U.S.
non-farm payroll numbers on Friday.
 Since then, many major commodities have rebounded. Brent
crude rose on Monday after losing $16 last week in the biggest
ever decline in dollar terms.
 
 CHINESE DATA
 Indian non-ferrous metals producer Hindalco Industries said
it expected strength in prices and volumes to continue but
spiralling input costs were a concern.
 The firm, part of the diversified Aditya Birla Group, said
it expected aluminium demand in India to grow 8-9 percent in
2011/12.
 A slew of Chinese and U.S. economic data could keep
volatility high again this week, including inflation numbers
that will give some indication of how far the monetary
tightening cycle has to run in China, the top driver of
commodities demand growth. 
 ""The next batch of Chinese economic data due out over the
next two days will ... be vital, particularly in terms of trying
to gauge the effectiveness of the Chinese tightening measures,""
said Standard Bank in a note.
 ""A combination of high inflation and lower-than-expected
growth looks like being the worst option and would likely
trigger further weakness.
 Copper, tin and lead inventories in LME warehouses rose, the
latest data showed.
 Nickel stocks fell to their lowest since mid-August, while
tin stocks rose to their highest in more than a year, rising 305
tonnes to 21,720 tonnes.
 Indonesia's refined tin exports rose 22 percent in April
from the same month last year due to improving weather
conditions, an official at the trade ministry said.
 Indonesia is the world's top tin exporter. A crackdown on
illegal mining, tighter export rules, declining onshore reserves
and rain that has hindered production in the country have helped
drive tin's rally. The metal, which is used in soldering in the
electronics industry, hit a record high of $33,600 in April.
 Tin finished at $29,795 a tonne from $29,650 at the close on
Friday. Aluminium ended $2,612 a tonne versus $2,608. Zinc, used
in galvanizing, closed at $2,164 a tonne from $2,140.
 Battery material lead ended at $2,300 a tonne from $2,280.
Nickel closed at $24,375 versus $24,650 a tonne.

 By Adveith Nair
 LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - British utility Centrica Plc
warned that rising taxes on North Sea oil and gas production
would erode profit growth this year and prompt it to scale back
investments, sending its shares to a nine-month low.
 In March, Britain unexpectedly raised a supplementary tax
charge on North Sea oil and gas producers to 32 percent from 20
percent to help lower fuel duty for motorists.
 ""We continue to expect growth in our 2011 group earnings but
at a more modest rate than anticipated at the time of our last
results announcement as upstream profits have become more highly
taxed,"" the company said in a statement on Monday.
 The company, which planned to spend about half its 1.5
billion pounds ($2.46 billion) 2011 capital expenditure budget
on UK upstream, no longer expects to maintain those ""high levels
of investment"" in the UK.
 Centrica shares were down 3.3 percent at 305 pence at 0909
GMT, the top percentage loser on Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100
index and hitting their lowest since August.
 Last week, Britain's Economic Secretary to the Treasury
Justine Greening acknowledged the impact of higher taxes on
investments in the UK and said the government would work with
the oil and gas industry to limit the impact of the unexpected
tax hike on marginal North Sea fields.
 Centrica had said a week ago it may shut one of its gas
fields as the tax rise made it unprofitable to run, echoing a
decision by Norway's Statoil in March to put some developments
on hold.
 On Monday, the company said the higher tax rates would lead
to reduced cash flow and higher fiscal uncertainty.
 The group expects an effective tax rate of about 45 percent
for 2011 -- an increase of nearly 300 million pounds in the tax
charge over last year -- and sees ""significant"" one-off deferred
tax charges due to the increase in upstream tax rates.
 Investec analyst Angelos Anastasiou, however, said he was
still positive on the company's prospects and maintained a ""buy""
recommendation. He said the statement suggested a relatively
tough trading environment, but most factors were already known.
 ""Despite higher taxation, earnings are still set to grow,""
he said, and kept his 424 pence price target on Centrica shares,
35 percent higher than the stock's Friday closing price.
 According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, which weighs
analysts' forecasts according to their track record, the company
is expected to report earnings of 27.22 pence per share for
2011, 17 percent higher than last year.
 Centrica, which owns Britain's biggest household energy
supplier British Gas, said the number of residential energy
accounts on supply has grown to about 16 million, slightly above
the level reached at the end of 2010.
 But the company warned market conditions for its residential
energy supply business were significantly more challenging than
last year, due in part to warmer weather.
 Average residential gas consumption in the first four months
of the year was 19 percent lower, while electricity consumption
was down 4 percent, Centrica said.

 * Fiscal tightening and economic restructuring loom
 * Warns against over-reaction to Japan nuclear crisis
 * Open to Chinese joint ventures
(Adds comments, details)	
 MELBOURNE, May 9 (Reuters) - Top global miner BHP Billiton
sees the global economy remaining fragile in the near
term and warned that economic growth could slow in the medium
term, echoing recent comments from rival Rio Tinto .	
 BHP Billiton Chairman Jacques Nasser said on Monday that
moves by the United States and Europe eventually to raise
interest rates to tame inflation could come when their economies
remain vulnerable.	
 ""In the short term, although many economies are recovering,
the world remains in a fragile state with persistent levels of
unemployment and threats of inflation,"" BHP Chairman Jacques
Nasser said at a business lunch.	
 ""For the medium term, we should be prepared for further
downside as global monetary and fiscal tightening and economic
restructuring take hold,"" he said.	
 BHP plans to spend $80 billion over five years to expand
iron ore, coal, copper and uranium production to meet soaring
Asian demand, undeterred by day-to-day commodity price swings.

 
 
 REACTING TO JAPAN 
 BHP plans to decide in 2012 whether to go ahead with an
expansion of its Olympic Dam mine, which could cost more than
$20 billion as it looks to triple the mine's copper production
capacity and more than quadruple uranium capacity. 
 Chief Executive Marius Kloppers said last week he did not
expect Japan's nuclear crisis to affect the expansion plan, and
Nasser said the world would need a range of energy sources to
meet rising demand while cutting carbon emissions.	
 Nasser warned against hasty moves to clamp down on
nuclear energy following a call by Japan's Prime Minister Naoto
Kan to close a nuclear plant in central Japan following the
worst nuclear crisis in 25 years.	
 ""I don't think an over-reaction at this point is valuable
for the world and for energy solutions,"" he told reporters.	
 ""I still think that there is, inside of the whole energy mix
solution for the world, a place for safe nuclear generation of
power,"" Nasser said, matching comments by Rio Tinto's chairman,
Jan du Plessis, last week. 
 After failing on three major deals since 2007 -- a full
takeover of Rio Tinto, an iron ore joint venture with Rio and a
takeover of Potash Corp -- BHP has been quiet on the
acquisitions front, focusing instead on its own projects.	
 Nasser said BHP would be willing to work with the Chinese on
projects, like Rio Tinto has done with Chinalco's Chalco
unit on the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, but
only if the partner brought unique advantages to the venture.	
 ""We're not against sitting down and looking for ways to
improve our performance by partnering with other people. We just
want to be convinced that when we do that, we're doing it for a
good reason,"" he said.	
 BHP's shares rose 0.5 percent on Monday, outpacing a 0.3

 By Manolo Serapio Jr	
 SINGAPORE, May 9 (Reuters) - Commodities bounced back on
Monday from their biggest weekly drop since 2008, as a softer
dollar and upbeat U.S. employment data helped lure back shaken
investors.	
 Brent crude oil rebounded to above $111 a barrel, U.S.
silver jumped nearly 3 percent and gold edged higher after data
on Friday showed U.S. private firms adding jobs at the fastest
pace in five years in April and as the dollar slipped against a
basket of currencies .	
 Concerns about the impact of soaring commodity prices on
shaky economic growth in Europe and the United States, and on
inflation in fast-growing economies like China and India, has
been one factor cited behind last week's broad rout in the
prices of raw materials, so the strong U.S. non-farm payrolls
number brought some relief.	
 A slew of China and U.S. economic data could keep volatility
high again this week, including inflation numbers that will give
some indication of how far a cycle of monetary tightening has to
run in China, the top driver of commodities demand growth.	
 ""Prices have fallen very sharply and very quickly, so people
are dipping their toes back in,"" said Citigroup analyst David
Thurtell.	
 ""With the market a lot cleaner now than it has been for some
time, you can get some chunky moves in either direction.""	


 Oil led the charge higher after both U.S. and Brent crude
fell by a record of more than $16 last week. The Financial Times
reported that Clive Capital, the world's largest hedge fund,
lost $400 million because of the collapse of oil prices.
[ID:nN08135098]	
 Brent crude  rose 2.2 percent to $111.48 a barrel by
0738 GMT, off a high of $111.63. It tumbled $16.76 last week,
its largest weekly decline in dollar terms.	
 U.S. crude  climbed 2.4 percent to $99.52, after
losing $16.75 last week, the biggest weekly drop since the
contract began trading in 1983.	
 Some heavyweight banks came out on Friday in oil's support,
with JP Morgan raising its 2011 Brent crude forecast by $10 to
$120 a barrel, citing an undersupplied market. [ID:nLDE74513V]	
 Goldman Sachs , which in April predicted a major
correction for commodities, said that while it was not ruling
out a further fall in oil prices, crude could top its recent
highs by 2012 on tight global supplies. 
 
 PRECIOUS REGAINS LUSTRE	
 Silver rose, extending gains from Friday after suffering its
biggest sell-off since prices collapsed in 1980.	
 Spot silver rose 1.9 percent to $36.28 an ounce after
losing a quarter of its value last week. COMEX silver 
jumped 2.9 percent to $36.33 an ounce, after diving 27 percent.	
 The more than 30 percent plunge in silver prices from a
record high in late April, triggered by a succession of margin
hikes on U.S. silver futures, helped set off the broad commodity
decline.	
 A record $1 billion outflow from the iShares Silver Trust
in the week ended May 4 fueled silver's dizzying price
decline, with holdings in the world's largest silver-backed
exchange-traded fund hitting a six-month low of 10,253.75 tonnes
by Friday. [ID:nN06293857] 
 Spot gold rose 0.8 percent to $1,505.60 an ounce
after falling more than 4 percent last week. 
 ""Much better buying value has been restored for gold,"" said
Thurtell. ""Silver is still probably overpriced but not as badly
overpriced as it was."" 
 
 EYES ON CHINA DATA	
 U.S. non-farm payrolls rose 244,000 in April, the largest
rise in 11 months, and topping economists' estimate of 186,000,
data showed on Friday. U.S. private companies created 268,000
jobs, the most since February 2006, while government payrolls
shrank. [ID:nOAT004799]	
 The data, which revived confidence in the world's No. 1
economy, boosted commodities on Friday after Thursday's
bloodbath, although a stronger dollar made those gains
short-lived.	
 The 19-commodity benchmark Reuters-Jefferies CRB index
dropped 9 percent last week, its biggest weekly decline
since December 2008.	
 All eyes are now on Chinese data this week, starting with
trade numbers on Tuesday, for signs of import demand from the
world's top commodity consumer.	
 ""If there's evidence that the Chinese are still not buying
or have cut their imports a lot you'll probably find that copper
could revisit the lows of last week,"" said Thurtell.	
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose
1.5 percent to $8,959 a tonne and Shanghai's benchmark copper
 closed up 1.6 percent at 66,980 yuan.	
 Chicago wheat led grains higher, rising 1.5 percent to
$7.70-1/2 a bushel, supported by unfavourable weather conditions
in the United States and Europe.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, May 9 (Reuters) - Gold extended gains on Monday
on a weaker dollar, after suffering its worst weekly loss since
2009, while U.S. silver futures rose nearly 3 percent as
investors took advantage of last week's free fall in prices to
enter the market.	
 Precious metals were supported by a softer dollar, which
edged down 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies after
hitting a 2-1/2-week high on Friday following unexpectedly
strong U.S. employment numbers and a media report on the
possibility of Greece quitting the euro zone. 
 ""It is too early to say that silver has started to rebound,
as it is still stuck in a descending channel. What will
eventually decide the price trend in precious metals is the U.S.
monetary policy,"" said a Tokyo-based trader. 
 COMEX silver  rose by as much as 2.9 percent to
$36.31, after plunging 27 percent in the previous week, its
biggest weekly drop since 1980. It stood at $35.75 by 0606 GMT.	
 Spot silver edged up 0.2 percent to $35.66 an ounce.
It dropped 25 percent last week.	
 ""From a medium-to-long term perspective, $35 is a reasonable
level to buy,"" the Tokyo-based trader said, adding that the
return of Japanese investors after the Golden Week holiday was
also propping up silver prices.	
 TOCOM silver jumped more than 4 percent to 94.3 yen
per gram, equivalent to $36.4 an ounce, before paring gains to
92.40 yen.	
 On this week's data schedule, the United States is due to
release its April consumer price data, which may shed light on
the future moves in monetary policy by the central bank, as
market speculation mounts on what the Federal Reserve might do
after the stimulus package rolls off in June.

 As silver prices tumbled last week, holdings in the world's
largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund, iShares Silver Trust
, dropped to a six-month low of 10,253.75 tonnes by Friday.

 The ETF suffered a record outflow of $1 billion in the week
ended on May 4, feeding silver's free-fall last week.
[ID:nN06293857]	
 In line with the decline of investment interest in the ETF,
speculators scaled back the bullish bets on COMEX silver futures
and options to the lowest level since early February.
[ID:nN06302550] 
 ""Short-term we would not be surprised if silver recovered
some of its losses, and perhaps even targeted $38 an ounce,""
said Heraeus, a Germany-based precious metals and technology
company, in a research note. 
 ""Longer-term we remain sceptical and feel that the price is
still overdone and prices well below the $30 an ounce mark would
not astonish us.""	
 Spot gold rose by half a percent to $1,501.50 an
ounce, recovering from a 4.5 percent fall last week.	
 COMEX gold  gained 0.7 percent to $1,501.40. 
 Technical analysis suggested that gold may fall to $1,462,
said Wang Tao, a Reuters market analyst. [ID:nL3E7G9038]	
 ""Longer-term investor interest in gold remains robust, with
ETP inflows of 40 tonnes in April and further substantial buying
from central banks, but we expect demand from Asia to cushion
the downside,"" said Barclays Capital in a research note.

(Adds Misrata supply problems, report rebels take village)
 By Guy Desmond
 TRIPOLI, May 8 (Reuters) - Libyan rebels fought a fierce
battle with forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi near the airport at
the western city of Misrata on Sunday as NATO planes targeted
government ammunition stores on another front in the war.
 Hundreds have died in Misrata, which is the scene of weeks
of conflict as rebels fighting to end Gaddafi's decades in power
attempt to hold off a government siege.
 The port city is considered crucial to rebels' chances of
success because it stands as the last city they hold in the west
of the country.
 Conflict is escalating in the Western Mountains region where
on Sunday NATO targeted ammunition dumps near Zintan, southwest
of Tripoli, but elsewhere there is stalemate with rebels holding
Benghazi and other towns in the east while the capital and other
cities remain firmly in government hands.
 NATO said in a statement it carried out 153 sorties on
Saturday, including 58 ""strike"" sorties that aim to identify and
hit targets but do not always deploy munitions.
 ""Fierce fighting is taking place now at the airport and in
the air force college area (near the airport). We are still
hearing sounds of artillery and rockets,"" the spokesman, called
Abdelsalam, said from Misrata.
 ""NATO struck an area in the east of Misrata today but we do
not have details,"" he told Reuters.
 Gaddafi's forces are concealing tanks and artillery and
using 'shoot and scoot' tactics in Misrata, frustrating NATO air
efforts to break the weeks-long siege of the city, the rebels
and NATO officials say.
 Government forces have abandoned the city centre to the
rebels but are entrenched in the built-up outskirts, sometimes
firing from the open and scuttling for cover between buildings.
 On Friday, the government bombarded fuel storage tanks for
the city, sparking a huge fire.
 
 REBEL SURRENDER DENIED
 Groups of rebels in Misrata surrendered to the government,
the state-run Al-Jamahiriya television station said on Sunday in
an apparent effort to capitalise on the strike's impact.
 It gave no numbers but quoted a military spokesman as saying
some of those who surrendered made recorded ""confessions"" that
would be screened later.
 The broadcast brought a swift rebuttal from rebels.
 ""This is a big lie. Nobody did this (surrendered) and nobody
will do. We are steadfast and full of challenge. We will fight
him (Gaddafi) till the end even with our nails and teeth if we
have to,"" spokesman Ahmed Hassan said.
 He acknowledged the fuel tank attack was causing problems.
 ""The fuel is still burning and huge clouds of smoke are
covering Misrata. This is causing breathing difficulties and
threatens a major environmental problem in the city,"" he said by
telephone from Misrata.
 An Italian ship came to help extinguish the fire but could
not dock because the port is closed and rebels were now at a
loss to know how to combat the fire, he said. The port has come
under heavy shelling from pro-Gaddafi forces.
 The shelling has hampered supply efforts for the city and a
rebel spokesman said there only was enough food and water for
about a month.
 ""If this deliberate attack on the port area continues
without something done about eliminating that kind of threat, we
might come to a really bad situation as far as food supplies,
especially water supplies, are concerned,"" Saddoun El-Misurati
said.
 El-Misurati also called on NATO to step up strikes on
Gaddafi forces outside the city.
 ""We need to see more stepping up of action by NATO, actions
that will limit and eliminate targeting of the civilian
population, including the port,"" he told a news conference in
Benghazi.
 Al Jazeera television quoted ""sources"" who were not further
identified as saying rebels had taken control of a village
called Zareek, about 25 km from Misrata. There were no further
details.
 Another flashpoint in the conflict, the Dehiba-Wazin border
crossing linking Libya to Tunisia, was quiet on Sunday, a day
after Libyan government munitions landed in Tunisian territory
close to the town of Dehiba, a Reuters witness said.
 Rebels hold the crossing but Gaddafi's forces are in charge
of a far bigger one to the north.

776,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2011 01:40PM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Ivory Coast resumes cocoa exports after crisis," * First cocoa exports in more than three months
 * Nearly half a million tonnes sitting in warehouses

(Adds details, colour, quotes, byline)
 By Ange Aboa
 ABIDJAN, May 9 (Reuters) - Ivory Coast resumed cocoa bean
exports on Sunday more than three months after they were halted
by the country's political conflict, officials and a Reuters
witness said.
 Workers were loading beans onto a ship owned by Bollore
Africa Logistics from a warehouse brimming with cocoa sacks.
 ""This is the first boat. It arrived on May 7 and this
morning we started operations,"" said Kwame Kwassi, a Bollore
official. ""We have 1,796 tonnes (on this boat) and there's
another boat coming at a later date to load 9,000 tonnes.""
 Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer, providing
a third of the supply internationally.
 Nearly half a million tonnes of cocoa were held up at the
West African country's Atlantic seaports by a conflict which
lasted more than four months.
 Bollore shipping agent Seydou Traore said the boat would
head to San Pedro on Monday to pick up 7,500 tonnes of cocoa
after it had finished loading the 1,796 tonnes at Abidjan.
 Another boat would come on May 10 to load 8,000 tonnes at
San Pedro, he said.
 ""There is a large number of boats expected to come here and
there are further contracts being finalised for other exports,""
Traore told Reuters, as a crane loaded several sacks of cocoa
beans aboard the ship.
 The violence only eased this month with the arrest of former
president Laurent Gbagbo, who had refused to step down after
November election results showing he had lost.
 Last week exporters resolved a row with the new government
of President Alassane Ouattara over how to make customs
payments, paving the way for exports to resume.
 On Friday, acting agriculture minister Gnamien Konan told
Reuters a production forecast for 1.3 million tonnes of cocoa
this season remained in place despite the crisis.
 The conflict killed thousands of people and displaced more
than a million, but Konan said it probably had little impact on
the amount of cocoa grown by farmers because much of the
fighting had been in urban areas.
 In total, at least four boats were expected in the next few
days to help ease the export backlog, said Captain Idrissa
Dosso, head of the operations department at Abidjan port that
lies on the southern end of the main city's sprawling lagoon.
 ""Infrastructure was not affected (by the war) so the port is
very operational,"" Dosso told Reuters. ""The logistics and men
are there, so we have the capacity to receive these vessels.""

 * Officials stand by commitment to nuclear power
(Adds quote)	
 By Yoko Kubota	
 TOKYO, May 8 (Reuters) - Japanese officials said on Sunday
they were committed to nuclear power after the prime minister
called for a plant to close, but that the target of obtaining
half of Japan's electricity from nuclear power by 2030 needed a
rethink.	
 Prime Minister Naoto Kan has called for the closure of a
nuclear plant in central Japan, citing the risk of another
disastrous quake after the Fukushima Daiichi plant, in the
northeast of the country, was destroyed by the March 11
earthquake and tsunami.	
 Nearly 26,000 people were killed or are still missing after
the quake and tsunami which triggered the world's biggest
nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. The plant is still
leaking radiation.	
 The call to shut down the Hamaoka plant signalled a
potential shift in energy policy, and while the government says
other plants will be unaffected, it could embolden anti-nuclear
movements.	
 Several thousand protesters marched through central Tokyo on
Saturday to welcome Kan's call to shut down Hamaoka and urging
him to push for further closures. [ID:nL3E7G7046]	
 Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshito Sengoku said that
Japan would remain committed to nuclear power, although Trade
Minister Banri Kaieda, who oversees energy policy, said Japan's
target must be reviewed.	
 ""With regard to energy policy, we set the target last June
of increasing nuclear power to 50 percent by 2030, but we will
have to rethink this,"" Kaieda said on Fuji TV.	
 ""We must put more effort into renewable energy, and that
will become one trigger for (economic) growth.""	
 Chubu Electric Power Co is leaning towards closing
the plant as requested and could make the decision at a board
meeting as early as Monday, media said. 
 Asked whether he would seek the closure of other nuclear
plants, Kan told reporters on Sunday: ""That won't be the case,""
adding that Hamaoka had an especially high risk of being hit by
a massive earthquake.	
 
 Japan last year vowed to boost the share of electricity
generation through nuclear power to 50 percent by 2030 from the
current 30 percent by building at least 14 new reactors.	
 Government experts put the chance of a magnitude 8.0 quake
hitting the Hamaoka area in the next 30 years at 87 percent,
which raises questions over why it was built there in the first
place. 
 The magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11 crippled cooling systems
at Fukushima Daiichi, operated by Tokyo Electric Power .	
 Of 54 reactors in commercial use in Japan, 32 are under
planned or unplanned maintenance and operators may face
resistance to restarting them. 
 Board members of Chubu, which serves major manufacturers,
including Toyota Motor Corp , postponed a decision on
Saturday on whether to temporarily close Hamaoka.	
 Chubu spokesman Akio Miyazaki said another board meeting
would be held on or after Monday. The Nikkei business daily said
the board would meet on Monday.	
 Yomiuri newspaper said Chubu was likely to comply with Kan's
request to close Hamaoka, with a capacity of 3,617 megawatts,
pending introduction of quake and tsunami safety measures -- but
only after it finds ways to supply power in a stable fashion.
Two of the plant's three working reactors are in operation.	
 Chubu says it can meet this fiscal year's peak demand of
25,600 MW even if Hamaoka shuts. But the Yomiuri newspaper,
quoting a company executive, says the company may have to
consider ""rolling blackouts"" in very hot weather.	
 Miyazaki said relying on thermal plants to make up
shortfalls if Hamaoka closes would push up costs by 700 million
yen ($8.7 million) per day -- or about 256 billion yen a year.
That could overturn the firm's projected profit of 130 billion
yen in the year to March 31, 2012.	
 Chubu chairman Toshio Mita was in Qatar to discuss possible
procurement of liquefied natural gas, Miyazaki said.

 By Julie Ingwersen
 CHICAGO, May 6 (Reuters) - Corn futures fell 3 percent on
Friday as a surge in the dollar and a downturn in crude oil
triggered a fresh round of long liquidation, one day after the
biggest sell-off in commodities since 2008.
 A pickup in the seeding pace of this year's U.S. corn crop
added pressure as weather conditions in some areas of the
Midwest improved.
 Noted crop forecaster Informa Economics told clients on
Friday that it had raised its estimate of U.S. corn plantings
to 91.9 million acres from 91.758 million in March. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture has forecast 92.2 million acres.
 Front-month corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade fell
9.4 percent for the week, their biggest weekly drop since
October.
 Wheat futures fell 5.8 percent for the week and soybeans
fell 4.9 percent.
 However, wheat and soybeans both closed higher on Friday
following a choppy session.
 CORN MARKET EYES RENEWED DROP IN CRUDE OIL
 Corn rallied early but came under pressure later in the
session, following a setback in crude oil as the dollar rose.
The dollar rallied after a German news report, later denied,
suggested Greece had raised the possibility of leaving the euro
zone.
 ""There is so much uncertainty right now. Crude began
crashing again late and the dollar came back so dramatically,""
said Rich Feltes, vice president of research with R.J.
O'Brien.
 ""The important themes are that the tail wind from capital
inflows to commodities as a preferred asset class -- all of
that is on hold until we can stabilize and establish an
uptrend,"" Feltes said.
 Corn was also hit by chart-based selling as the bellwether
July contract fell below its 100-day moving average at $6.91 a
bushel, a key level for technical traders.
 Earlier in the day, grains and other commodities got a
boost after data showed that U.S. employment increased by more
than expected in April, with employers adding jobs at the
fastest monthly pace in five years.
 The data helped dampen concerns by investors over the
health of the world's biggest economy.
 At the Chicago Board of Trade, July corn settled down
22-1/2 cents at $6.86-1/4 a bushel. July wheat ended up 5-1/2
cents at $7.59-1/2 per bushel and July soybeans ended up 4-1/4
cents at $13.26.
 Wheat drew underlying support from concerns about dry
conditions in the southern U.S. Plains, as well as France and
Germany.
 An annual crop tour of Kansas, the top U.S. winter wheat
grower, on Thursday projected the state's winter wheat output
at 256.7 million bushels, with an average yield of 37.4 bushels
per acre. If realized, the wheat crop would be the smallest in
Kansas since 1996.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - Benchmark copper futures eked out a
modest gain on Friday, after upbeat U.S. employment data helped calm commodity
markets spooked into free fall on Thursday by fears of slowing growth in the
world's No. 1 economy.
 But gains were reversed in after-hours trade, as the U.S. dollar extended
gains against the euro and chatter of a Greek exit from the euro zone
heightened concerns about the sustainability of the global recovery.
 London Metal Exchange (LME) copper for three-month delivery rose $5 to end
at $8,825 a tonne.
 The gains quickly evaporated in late New York trade, with the price dipping
back down below $8,800.
 Sean Corrigan, chief investment strategist with Diapason Commodities
Management said he believed prices could fall further toward $8,000 a tonne.
 ""I think that's a sensible sort of retracement target from this market. If
it gets any worse than that then I think you are in trouble,"" he told Reuters.
 COMEX copper for July delivery fell 2.25 cents to settle at $3.9755 per lb,
placing the contract below its 200-day moving average.
 ""If we break below there and start closing below there, it's going to
become a sell-the-rallies type of market,"" said Matthew Zeman, head of trading
with Kingsview Financial in Chicago.
 ""Right now, it's still a buy-the-dips type of market.""
 The day began with a generally upbeat U.S. employment report that showed
companies created jobs at the fastest pace in five years, pointing to
underlying strength in the economy, even as the jobless rate rose to 9.0
percent.
 ""It's a pretty good number, but we've always made the point that this is
volatile,"" said Michael Shaoul, chairman of Marketfield Asset Management in New
York.
 ""To us, it looks like a good recovery taking place in payrolls, and it goes
against the worries that came about with the jobless claims yesterday.""
 Commodities across the complex showed signs of stabilization after the U.S.
jobs data reassured investors who had been rattled by worries over global
growth and days of sharp price falls.
 Barclays Capital said the sell-off in metals had been overdone, and
presented investors with a new buying opportunity.
 ""Those who do not choose to take advantage of this window are likely to be
disappointed later,"" it said in a note.
 Copper futures open interest figures showed a fall in the near term (the
cash to May contract prompt date) alongside Thursday's falling prices,
suggesting long liquidation. But three-month open interest jumped, which
alongside falling prices suggests fresh short positions.
 In another spot of supportive news, inventories of copper, aluminium and
nickel at LME warehouses saw net outflows, the latest data showed.
 Tin, which fell more than 7 percent on Thursday, rose more than 2 percent
to close at $29,650 a tonne.
 Aluminium shed $27 to close at $2,608 a tonne.

 By Julie Ingwersen
 CHICAGO, May 6 (Reuters) - Grains fell on Friday after a
short-lived rebound from the biggest sell-off in commodities
since 2008 a day earlier, with corn tumbling 2 percent as the
pace of seeding this year's crop picked up.
 Corn was also pressured by renewed long liquidation, with
hedge funds and other financial investors holding a much larger
long position in corn than they do in soybeans or wheat.
 ""There is some planting in the west but not in the east,
and the weather outlooks aren't all that good, so frankly
everyone is a bit puzzled about corn's decline or who's behind
it,"" said analyst Shawn McCambridge of Prudential Bache
Commodities.
 Noted crop forecaster Informa Economics told clients on
Friday that it had raised its estimate of U.S. corn plantings
to 91.9 million acres from 91.758 million in March. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture has forecast 92.2 million acres.
 The sell-off on Thursday provided some investors with a
buying opportunity.
 INVESTORS RELOAD
 ""A lot of people will reload down at these levels. Whether
it will work for them remains to be seen,"" said Tom Uhlmann, an
independent trader at the Chicago Board of Trade.
 Gold, as well as other commodities, got a boost after data
showed that U.S. employment increased by more than expected in
April, with employers adding jobs at the fastest monthly pace
in five years.
 The data helped dampen concerns by investors over the
health of the world's biggest economy.
 At the Chicago Board of Trade, corn posted the biggest
decline, falling 2 percent.
 As of 11:28 a.m. CDT (1628 GMT), July corn was off 16-3/4
cents at $6.92 a bushel. July wheat was down 3-1/2 cents at
$7.50-1/2 per bushel. and July soybeans were down 6-1/4 cents
at $13.15-1/2.
 The tightest U.S. corn supply since the 1930s underpinned
grains, along with concerns about flooding and planting delays
diminishing prospects for the new U.S. corn crop.
 ""The fundamentals around grains and oilseeds complex
haven't changed. It's very bullish for corn in the near term,""
said Adam Davis, senior grains trader at Merricks Capital in
Melbourne, which invests in agricultural commodities.
 ""We still have the U.S. growing season to go through, corn
plantings so far have not been ideal and there is reasonable
value at these levels,"" Davis said.
 Wheat drew underlying support from concerns about dry
conditions in the southern U.S. Plains as well as France and
Germany.
 An annual crop tour of Kansas, the top U.S. winter wheat
grower, on Thursday projected the state's winter wheat output
at 256.7 million bushels, with an average yield of 37.4 bushels
per acre. If realized, the wheat crop would be the smallest in
Kansas since 1996.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - Silver rose 2 percent on
Friday, snapping a five-day losing streak that cut prices by
almost a third, while gold rose after encouraging U.S. jobs
data triggered a broad bounce in beaten-down commodities.
 Silver, hit by a succession of margin hikes that nearly
doubled costs, had suffered the biggest sell-off since prices
collapsed in 1980. Dealers, however, said the 30 percent slide
from last week's record high was overdone.
 Precious metals rallied early with other markets after data
showed private-sector hiring hit a five-year high in April. But
metals pared gains when the dollar surged against the euro
after a German media report suggested Greece had raised the
possibility of leaving the euro zone. Greece denied the report.
[ID:nBAT006205]
 ""There is no reason why silver should have taken such a big
hit. It's all margin-related,"" said COMEX floor option trader
Dominic Cognata.
 ""At some point, it becomes a buying opportunity for people
who missed out on the last silver rally to get back in right
now.""
 Investors also bought bullish silver options as the prices
of options fell heavily over the last week, Cognata said.

 Spot silver  initially traded as low as $33.22, its
weakest since Feb. 25, pressured by follow-through selling
after it plunged 12 percent on Thursday. It was up 1.8 percent
at $35.30 by 4:10 p.m. EDT (2010 GMT). U.S. futures trading was
active, with volume nearly three times its 250-day average.
 COMEX OPEN INTEREST UP
 Open interest in U.S. COMEX silver futures rose 3 percent
on Thursday even as prices fell sharply, a sign the market
remains vulnerable to further selling, traders said.
[ID:nN06236006]
 ""We find it disconcerting for it means that the liquidation
that is needed to clear the market's collective head has not
actually taken place,"" said Dennis Gartman, publisher of the
Gartman Letter.
 The price of the U.S. June silver contract  fell as
much as 13 percent on Thursday, leading a broad decline in the
commodities sector. On Friday, June was down over 2 percent.
 ""There was liquidation, but then there were new people
getting in and going with the momentum trade"" to short-sell
silver, said COMEX options floor trader Jonathan Jossen.
 Silver is heading for its worst week since the Hunt
Brothers collapse in 1980, after shedding 26 percent this week
as higher futures margin requirements prompted speculators to
unwind bullish positions.
 Silver has slumped around 35 percent since touching a
record high of $49.51 an ounce on April 28. A major factor
behind the sell-off was higher margins for silver traded on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group , which raises trading
costs. [ID:nL3E7G5043]
 A record $1 billion outflow from the iShares Silver Trust
 in the week ended Wednesday helped feed silver's torrid
price decline, just as the fund's earlier inflows aided the
prior rally. [ID:nN06293857]
 ""The ease of access from exchange-traded products can be
the tail that wags the dog,"" said Roger Nusbaum, chief
investment officer at Your Source Financial. ETF trading and
share redemptions ""can be a disruptive force in the short term,
but it is the sort of thing that will flame out,"" he said.
 The commodities sector was broadly higher after the
positive U.S. jobs report which suggested the economic recovery
would regain speed this quarter after stumbling in the first
three months of the year. That view suffered setbacks earlier
this week as other reports pointed to a slowing labor market.
[ID:nOAT004799]
 GOLD UP ON PHYSICAL BUYING
 Gold also bounced on Friday as jewelers, physical buyers
and bargain hunters, especially in Asia, took advantage of
lower prices. [ID:nL3E7G617A]
 Spot gold  gained 1.4 percent to $1,491.80 an ounce,
still sharply below a record high of $1,575.79 posted on May 2.
COMEX June gold futures  settled up $10.20 at $1,491.60,
moving in a range from $1,471.10 to $1,498.50.
 For the week, gold lost 5 percent, the worst weekly
performance since late February 2009. Sentiment among precious
metals investors also took a hit after high-profile investor
George Soros, who was bullish on gold and a top investor in
gold funds, has been selling gold and silver in the past month
or so, traders said.
 Indians, the world's biggest buyers of bullion, took gold's
latest tumble as another incentive to buy on Akshaya Tritiya,
one of the major gold-buying festivals, and as India's wedding
season gathered pace. [ID:nL3E7G61MZ]
 Platinum group metals also rose in tandem with gold and
silver. Spot platinum  gained 1.3 percent to $1,782 an
ounce and palladium  was up 0.6 percent at $711.22.

 By Marie-Louise Gumuchian and Sue Thomas
 LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - Base metals turned positive on
Friday after data, showing U.S. employment rose more than
expected in April, calmed commodities markets spooked by fears
of slowing growth in the world's largest economy.
 Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange
closed at $8,825 a tonne, off a session low of $8,657 after
closing at $8,820 on Thursday.
 But the metal is still hovering at around its lowest levels
since December last year, and suffered its biggest weekly loss
since March.
 It could fall further, to around $8,000 a tonne, Sean
Corrigan, Diapason Commodities Management chief investment
strategist, said.
 ""It has to get above $9,000 to trade into the band it's been
in this year pretty quickly,"" he said.
 ""Economic sentiment has swung, people have become more
fearful across all the markets, not just commodities, so this
could easily see further liquidation if there is no rapid
recovery back into the band.""
 U.S. employment increased more than expected in April as
private companies created jobs at the fastest pace in five
years, pointing to underlying strength in the economy, even
though the jobless rate rose to 9.0 percent.
 ""It's a pretty good number, but we've always made the point
that this is volatile,"" said Michael Shaoul, chairman of
Marketfield Asset Management in New York.
 ""To us, it looks like a good recovery taking place in
payrolls, and it goes against the worries that came about with

 Commodities across the complex stabilised after the U.S.
jobs data reassured investors who had been rattled by worries
over global growth and days of sharp price falls.
 Tin, which fell more than 7 percent on Thursday, rose more
than 2 percent to close at $29,650 on Friday from a previous
close of $28,900 a tonne.
 Barclays Capital said the metals sell-off had been overdone,
and opened a buying opportunity.
 ""Those who do not choose to take advantage of this window
are likely to be disappointed later,"" it said in a note.
 One London metals trader said there had been little physical
activity, and that some traders were using the latest bounce to
take profits or cut their losses.
""Most definitely (there is selling into rallies),"" the trader
said. ""Some frustrated longs from yesterday and traders who went
long this morning are taking profits, there's hardly any
physically backed business.""
 Copper futures open interest figures showed a fall in the
near term (the cash to May contract prompt date) alongside
Thursday's falling prices, suggesting long liquidation. But
three-month open interest jumped, which alongside falling prices
suggests fresh short positions.
 
 NO MORE SURPRISES
 ""Clearly what the market doesn't want now is any negative
surprises,"" Corrigan said before the U.S. employment data.
 ""If we can get through that then maybe calm will prevail and
the markets can become slightly more well behaved perhaps.""
 In another spot of supportive news, inventories of copper,
aluminium and nickel at LME warehouses fell, the latest data
showed..
 Aluminium closed at $2,608 from Thursday's close of $2,635.
Zinc, used in galvanizing, was $2,140 from $2,125. It earlier
fell to its lowest since end-November at $2,048 a tonne.
 Battery material lead closed at $2,280 from $2,295. It also

 SINGAPORE, May 6 (Reuters) - Silver rebounded on Friday from

28.	
 Spot silver slumped by 12 percent on Thursday after another
margin hike by the CME Group on its COMEX silver futures
increased the cost of the trading the metal, dragging gold down
3 percent and triggering a brutal sell-off that sent commodities
from oil to copper sharply lower.	
 ""Prices have dropped so much over the past few days and
bargain hunters are in,"" said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip
Futures, adding that the weak outlook for U.S. employment data
helped add to the lure of gold.	
 Spot silver gained nearly 1 percent to $35 an ounce
by 0616 GMT, snapping a five-day losing streak. It is still on
track for a 27-percent weekly loss, its biggest since the early
1980s.	
 The 100-day moving average at $34.39 would lend some
support, traders said. 
 COMEX silver  fell more than 5 percent to $34.27 in
early trade, before regaining some ground to $35.05. It was
poised to lose 28 percent over the week in its sharpest fall
since March 1980, when an attempt by Texas oil tycoons the Hunt
brothers to corner the silver market fell apart.	
 
 A worse-than-expected non-farm payrolls figure, after data
on Thursday showing U.S. payroll growth eased in April, could
further fuel the commodities sell-off by deepening fears that
the world's largest economy is not out of woods yet.	
 Gold though could benefit from its status as a safe haven.	
 ""Gold is a better bet than silver or oil, as losses would be
capped by its safe-haven status,"" said Ong of Phillip Futures.	
 The reaction of the dollar to non-farm payrolls is also
critical. The greenback was down slightly on Friday, after
rising 1.5 percent the previous day, it's biggest gain in over
six months. 
 Investors rushing to exit the market trimmed their positions
in the iShares Silver Trust, the world's biggest silver-backed
exchange-traded fund, by more than 1 percent after a 5 percent
decline the previous day. Holdings stood at 10,268.92 tonne by
May 5, the lowest since early November. 
 Spot gold rose by more than 1 percent to $1,486.96 an
ounce, headed for a 5-percent drop from a week earlier, its
worst week since March 2009.	
 COMEX gold  edged up 0.4 percent to $1,487.20 an
ounce.	
 ""From a fundamental point of view, people are really
starting to question where the U.S. economic recovery is and
whether asset prices should be at such high levels,"" said
Jonathan Barratt, managing director of Commodity Broking
Services in Sydney. 
 ""When we roll off the stimulus in June, what next? Is the
U.S. economy going to fall flat or behave itself?""

after closing below $100 a barrel a day earlier for the first time since March
as a commodities sell-off continued amid persistent worries about economic
growth and tighter monetary
policies. 
 
 FUNDAMENTALS	
 * NYMEX crude for June delivery  was down 24 cents
at $99.56 a barrel by 0007 GMT, after settling down $9.44
at $99.80 a day earlier, the lowest settlement since March.

barrel, after settling down $10.39 at $110.80 a day earlier, the second-biggest

 NEW YORK/LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Copper nosedived more than 3 percent on
Thursday to its lowest level since December as fears about sputtering global
growth and growing inflation risk triggered a vicious cross-commodity crash.
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index was last off almost 5 percent
on the day and 8 percent so far this week, heading for its biggest weekly
decline since December 2008, as prices of oil, metals and grains plunged amid
the widespread liquidation.
 Tepid economic data from top metal consumers the United States and China,
as well as in Europe, have stoked concerns about global growth and the impact
on demand for base metals.
 German industrial orders unexpectedly fell in March while U.S. weekly
jobless claims hit eight-month highs, and productivity growth slowed.
 ""The economically-sensitive commodities just have a tough road ahead of
them because the economy in the U.S. and the global economy are just not going
to be robust,"" said Shawn Hackett, president of Hackett Financial Advisors,
Inc. in Boynton Beach, Florida.
 ""The economy is just not going to provide the cyclical demand for cyclical
commodities that it has in the past.""
 London Metal Exchange (LME) copper for three-month delivery hit a session
trough at $8,744.25 per tonne, its lowest since December, before ending down
$304 at $8,820.
 In New York, the July COMEX copper contract plunged 13.60 cents or 3.3
percent to settle at $3.9980 per lb.
 Copper's losses put it on track for its biggest weekly decline since
mid-March.
 Tin was the biggest loser in the complex, sinking more than 7 percent to
$28,500 at one point, its lowest since March. It closed at $28,900 from
Wednesday's last bid price of $30,950.
 ""It's a broad-based, risk-off selling momentum that has gathered pace,""
said Barclays Capital analyst Gayle Berry.
 ""Something has spooked the market, sentiment has nose dived and I think the
fact that it is sentiment driven is illustrated in that it's not just happening
in the base metals.""
 That ""something,"" Berry said, could include the prospect of easy monetary
policy ending in June, big political developments, including the death of Osama
bin Laden, uncertainties about Chinese monetary policy, as well as faltering
U.S. growth.
 The euro fell against the dollar and headed for its biggest one-day slide
against the U.S. currency since November after the European Central Bank
signaled that interest rates were unlikely to rise next month. [USD/]
 A stronger dollar makes commodities cheaper for holders of other

 DEMAND
 Base metals fundamentals also pointed to faltering demand, with data on
Thursday showing a large 3,525-tonne build in copper inventories, with big
inflows into south Asian locations.
 The build boosted LME copper stock levels to their highest since June 2010,
at 467,450 tonnes.
 ""For a while people ignored the fundamental news, because so much money was
cheap and available,"" Alex Heath, RBC Capital Markets head of base metals,

 By Rene Pastor and David Brough
 NEW YORK/LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Soft commodity futures
were pummeled Thursday as the sugar, coffee and cocoa markets
were caught up in a commodity-wide selling spree.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a global benchmark for
commodities, was headed for its biggest loss in two years on
widespread liquidation.
 World stocks and crude oil prices fell on Thursday after a
report showed U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly jumped to an
eight-month high last week, fuelling demand for safe-haven
assets.
 ""It's just a massive, macro liquidation,"" said Nick
Gentile, the head of trading of commodity fund Atlantic Capital
Advisors.
 ""The day's decline in agriculture is entirely related to
broader markets,"" said Carsten Fritsch, commodity analyst at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt, pointing to the sharp fall in oil and
metal markets.
 All the soft markets declined, with arabica coffee
retreating further from the 34-year high it hit last week and
raw sugar crumbling from investor sales.
 New York's July cocoa contract dropped $156 or by 4.9
percent to end at $3,055 per tonne. London's July cocoa futures
lost 60 pounds or by 3.1 percent to finish at 1,885 pounds per
tonne.
 The July raw sugar contract declined 0.40 cent to trade at
20.95 cents per lb at 12:10 p.m. (1610 GMT), while London's
August white sugar futures fell $10.90 to trade at $581.80 per
tonne.
 The July arabica coffee contract on ICE Futures U.S. slid
7.80 cents to trade at $2.867 per lb at 12:14 p.m., having hit
a session low of $2.841.
 London's July robusta coffee was only down $2 to trade at
$2,575 per tonne, having recovered from a session low of $2,521
during Thursday's session.
 ""It's almost snowballing, the spec liquidation across all
of these markets now,"" said Luis Rangel, vice president for
commodity derivatives with ICAP North America in New Jersey.
 He said the sell-off kicked with the silver market, saying
""it was sort of the ring leader and it's started to spread like
a contagion.""
 Fundamentally, the soft markets present a mixed bag.
 Coffee, especially the arabica market, must contend with
tight supplies of high quality washed beans. Sugar could see
cash activity pick up as prices tumble. Cocoa is looking at a
pickup in exports after a civil war in top grower Ivory Coast.
 Top coffee producer Brazil's harvest could also weigh on
prices in the coming months, Rabobank's soft commodities
analyst Keith Flury said.
 Dealers said they expected Egypt to return to the market
soon with a substantial buying tender, possibly as soon as this
weekend, having cancelled a tender for 200,000 tonnes of raw
sugar earlier this week.
 ""The physical market will dictate how low the futures will
go,"" said James Kirkup, head of sugar brokerage at ABN AMRO
(Markets) UK Ltd.
 But analysts said bumper supplies flowing out of Brazil and
also out of key exporter Thailand should keep the market under
pressure.
 ""From what I am hearing, the centre-south Brazilian harvest
is going off pretty well,"" Flury said.
 ""Prices for coffee and cocoa have to some extent been
speculator driven. For these markets, this was a correction
that was due,"" Fritsch said.

 By David Brough and Sarah McFarlane
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Sugar and cocoa futures fell
sharply on Thursday as the softs markets were caught up in a
commodity-wide sell off.
 Arabica coffee prices were also lower, consolidating below
their 34-year peak.
 World stocks and crude oil prices fell on Thursday after a
report showed U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly jumped to an
eight-month high last week, fuelling demand for safe-haven
assets.
 ""The day's decline in agriculture is entirely related to
broader markets,"" said Carsten Fritsch, commodity analyst at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt, pointing to the sharp fall in oil and
metal markets.
 ""Sugar was already in a downward trend and the commodity
sell-off exacerbates this move.""
 Raw sugar futures slid almost 4 percent to fresh eight-month
lows.
 Upward revisions to estimates for Thai sugar output and
ample supplies of new-crop centre-south Brazilian sugar weighed.
 ""From what I am hearing, the centre-south Brazilian harvest
is going off pretty well,"" Keith Flury, soft commodities analyst
with Rabobank, said.
 ""There doesn't seem like there is a lot that can push prices
higher,"" he added, noting that robust demand for the sweetener
was a supportive factor.
 ICE May raw sugar futures were down 0.42 cent at 20.93 cents
a lb at 1353 GMT, after falling to 20.50 cents a lb earlier in
the session.
 Flury said physical buyers appeared to be holding back,
waiting for prices to fall further.
 ""There does seem to be a pent-up demand to increase
inventories, but no one wants to buy to re-stock supplies,"" he
said.
 Dealers said they expected Egypt to return to the market
soon with a substantial buying tender, possibly as soon as this
weekend, having cancelled a tender for 200,000 tonnes of raw
sugar earlier this week.
 ""The physical market will dictate how low the futures will
go,"" said James Kirkup, head of sugar brokerage at ABN AMRO
(Markets) UK Ltd.
Liffe August white sugar fell $11.70 or 2 percent to $581.00
at 1354 GMT, just above the eight-month low of $571.90 hit
earlier in the session.
 
 COCOA DROPS
 ICE cocoa futures fell sharply as investors liquidated long
positions and hedging weighed.
 ""We've completely lost the upside momentum, there's weak
long liquidation and hedging above the market,"" a London-based
broker said.
 ""The whole commodity complex is coming under pressure.""
 ICE second-month, July cocoa was down $151 at $3,060 per
tonne, while Liffe July cocoa was down 59 pounds or 3 percent at
1,886 pounds a tonne.
 Dealers said that in the longer term, cocoa prices should be
supported by market fundamentals following months of conflict in
top producer Ivory Coast.
 ""The political crisis in Ivory Coast has not helped
improving the husbandry,"" a second London-based broker said.
 ""The bull story is still there... big funds are square for
the moment but they will have to make a decision and take a
position. It's unlikely they will go short.""
 Arabica coffee futures fell, consolidating below the 34-year
high hit earlier this week.
 ""Prices for coffee and cocoa have to some extent been
speculator driven. For these markets, this was a correction that
was due,"" Fritsch said.
 Dealers said that historically high coffee prices are
expected to trigger a supply response that will weigh on prices
going forward.
 ""We see the arabica futures market falling to $2.20-$2.30 a
lb in the next three or four months as funds and speculators
liquidate positions in anticipation of a supply response next
year,"" a Europe-based trader said.
 ""If you look at the rise in prices since the middle of last
year, there's definitely an incentive for producers to increase
plantings and the use of fertilizer and crop maintenance,"" the
trader said.
 Top coffee producer Brazil's harvest could also weigh on
prices in the coming months, Rabobank's Flury said.
 ICE July arabica coffee fell 6.0 cent to $2.8850 per lb at
1356 GMT, below Tuesday's 34-year peak of $3.0890.
 Liffe July robustas were down $39 or 1.5 percent at $2,538 a
tonne.

 By Sue Thomas
 LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - High anxiety about global economic
growth knocked copper to its lowest this year on Thursday,
sweeping the rest of the base metals complex with it in a
broad-based fall across commodities.
 Tepid economic data from top metals consumers the United
States and China, as well as in Europe, have stoked big concerns
about growth, and the impact on demand for base metals.
 In the latest reports, U.S. jobless claims hit an
eight-month high, and productivity growth slowed.
 Copper for three-months delivery on the London Metal
Exchange fell to a low of $8,744 per tonne, its lowest since
December and on track for its biggest weekly loss since
mid-March. It closed at $8,820, from $9,124 on Wednesday.
 Tin was the biggest loser, shedding more than 7 percent, to
$28,500 at one point, its lowest since March, from a last bid of
$30,950 on Wednesday. It closed at $28,900.
 ""It's a broad-based, risk-off selling momentum that has

 Brent and U.S. crude futures tumbled sharply, and silver
fell to a six-week low.
 The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a global

 ""Demand for metals appears to be softening and we're seeing
evidence of that coming out in the data,"" Alex Heath, RBC
Capital Markets head of base metals, said.
 ""These are the kind of numbers that you're expecting to see
at the stage now where people are talking of withdrawing money

 NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - Silver plunged more than 10
percent on Thursday, its biggest one-day drop in dollar terms
since the Hunt Brothers price squeeze, dragging gold over 3
percent lower as panic selling snowballed across the
commodities sector.
 Silver has now lost 30 percent this week, well above the
conventional criteria of 20 percent for a bear market, since it
surged to a record high near $50 an ounce last Thursday.
Silver's plunge for a fifth day led the decline in commodities.
The Reuters/Jefferies CRB index <.CRB> was set for its biggest
weekly fall since late 2008 and U.S. crude oil  fell
below $100 a barrel.
 Speculators in the silver futures market were forced to
liquidate positions after the CME Group  raised margins
five times in under two weeks, an 84 percent rise in trading
costs that has helped provoke a nearly unprecedented sell-off.
 Other factors also weighed on the market, including signals
that the European Central Bank was unlikely to raise interest
rates next month, which triggered the biggest fall in the euro
versus the dollar since November. [FRX/]

 ""It's going to be a long time before silver can find a
bottom to turn higher again,"" said Dennis Gartman, publisher of
the Gartman Letter.
 ""When you have this kind of damage, it will take several
weeks or maybe several months for people to be taken out, and
for confidence to be rebuilt,"" said Gartman. ""It's not the end
of the commodities cycle, not even close.""
 Spot silver  fell as much as 11 percent to a six-week
low of $34.58 an ounce, down almost 30 percent so far this
week. It was near the day's low at $34.97 by 3:19 p.m. EDT
(1919 GMT). The metal is also heading for its biggest weekly
loss since at least 1983.
 U.S. silver futures volume already topped 200,000 lots,
more than three times above its 250-day average and one of the
busiest trading days of 2010.
 Widespread investor liquidation prompted gold to slide more
than 3 percent to $1,461.57 an ounce, its lowest since
mid-April.
 Spot gold  fell 3.2 percent to $1,4671.69 an ounce.
COMEX June gold futures  settled down $33.90 at

 ""This current sell-off is not commodity specific. It's risk
reduction across the market due to sluggish U.S. economic news
such as the PMI and initial jobless claims,"" said Hakan Kaya,
commodities portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, which
manages more than $3 billion in commodities assets.
 ""This is just a temporary leveraging process, not the end
of the bull cycle,"" Kaya said.
 VOLATILITY RISES BEFORE PAYROLLS
 CBOE gold volatility index <.GVX>, a gauge of bullion
investor anxiety, spiked about 6 percent, ahead of Friday's key
U.S. non-farm payrolls data, which should offer evidence of the
ability of the economy to generate jobs, something which the
Federal Reserve has flagged as a key concern. 
 Silver selling pressure was accelerated by extremely
bearish investor sentiment, as global holdings of silver in
exchange-traded funds staged their biggest one-day decline this
year. [ID:nSGE74400Q]
 Silver's decline sent the gold/silver ratio, which measures
how much silver an ounce of gold can buy, to an eight-week high
above 40 from just below 32 last Thursday.
 Technicals were again in focus after silver broke below its
50-day moving average, which had held since February, after it
breached 20-day MA earlier this week. But prices were still
well above the 100- and 200-day averages, after silver rallied
as much as 170 percent over the last 12 months.
 CitiFX chief technical strategist Tom Fitzpatrick said the
only reference available to chart its current path was the
dramatic slide off the previous all-time high in 1980, which
took it down from $50 down to $30 in pretty much a straight
line. [ID:nN04236713]
 ""Was silver a bubble? I think to a large extent it was.
It's notoriously volatile. The fundamentals of silver are
simply not as good as gold's,"" said Stephen Briggs, analyst at
BNP Paribas.
 Investors scrambled out of physical silver, as reflected by
the 15.3 million-ounce fall on Thursday in metal holdings in
global ETFs, with the world's largest -- the iShares Silver
Trust staging the second-biggest one-day fall since its
inception in 2006. [GOL/ETF]
 Also weighing down on investment sentiment was news Mexican

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, May 5 (Reuters) - Spot silver prices dropped
almost 2 percent on Thursday, down 22 percent from a record hit
a week ago, after another hike in margin requirements for U.S.
silver futures squeezed some of the speculative froth out of the
market. 
 Gold held steady, with traders hesitant to take positions
before the European Central Bank's rate decision due later in
the day.	
 The CME Group set successive hikes on COMEX silver
futures margins, effective on Thursday and next Monday, which
combined with three other increases in the past two weeks has
raised the margin requirement by 84 percent, effectively
increasing the cost of trading the metal. [ID:nN04107715]	
 Investors are also scrambling out of silver, with holdings
in the world's largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund,
iShares Silver Trust, down nearly 5 percent on Wednesday, the
second sharpest one-day fall since the fund launched in 2006.	
 The fund's holding peaked at 11,390.6 tonnes on April 25,
the same day that COMEX silver futures hit a 31-year high.	
 ""There is liquidation going on in silver after prices rose
too much and too fast. Nobody knows where the bottom is, but I
don't think there is much room below $35,"" Ronald Leung, a
dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong, said.	
 Spot silver fell by 1.7 percent to $38.66 an ounce by
0743 GMT, after dipping to a one-month low of $38.56. It had
risen 170 percent in a year to a record $49.51 an ounce on April
28.	
 COMEX silver  also fell to a one-month low at $38.57,
and was trading at $38.67, down about 2 percent.	
 
 Spot gold , which lagged silver's stellar rally and is
now lagging its fall, was steady at $1,516.49 an ounce after
three consecutive sessions of declines. Bullion is up 7 percent
this year, versus a 25 percent rise for silver.	
 COMEX gold  was almost unchanged at $1,516.70.	
 ""We expect gold prices to remain pretty resilient, but at
the moment it is probably a little frothy,"" said Ben Westmore,
commodities economist at the National Australia Bank.	
 ""A lot of rise in gold prices was due to safe-haven
investment and weakness in the U.S. dollar.""	
 A more hawkish rhetoric from the ECB and continued weak U.S.
economic numbers has kept the euro near a 17-month high versus
the dollar, lending some support to precious metals. 
 Markets will focus on whether the ECB uses the ""strong
vigilance"" code words to signal a rate rise in June, after a
hike in April. [ID:nLDE74325D]	
 Investors are also watching for a key U.S. employment report
due on Friday, which is expected to show easing payroll growth
in April due to high gasoline prices. [ID:nN03301605]

 By Chris Kelly and Sue Thomas
 NEW YORK/LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - Copper suffered its biggest
one-day loss since early March on Wednesday, as concerns about
inflation-fighting measures in China and disappointing U.S. data
pointed to less demand from the world's top-two consumers.
 Confidence took a hit from a more than two-month low in
China's main stock index, as investors continued to price in more
tightening measures and less economic growth in the
copper-consuming giant.
 China's roaring economy will slow a touch this year, with
inflation staying stubbornly above the government's 4 percent
target, according to a Reuters poll.
 With price pressures likely to prove stubborn, economists
expect China to pull a range of levers in coming months to control
prices: interest rates, the reserve requirement ratio, and the
yuan.
 ""There continues to be concern that the Chinese authorities
may overdo it, or at least, tighten things up even if things slow
down,"" said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy with TD Bank
Financial Group.
 London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month copper shed $226 or
2.4 percent to finish at $9,124 per tonne, its largest daily
decline since March 9, when its lost nearly 2.7 percent of its
value.
 Earlier, it touched a session trough at $9,080, its lowest
since March 15.
 The July COMEX copper contract dropped 11.90 cents or 2.8
percent to settle at $4.1340 per lb, near the bottom half of its
$4.1285 to $4.2545 range.
 Losses mounted in New York after data flagged weakness in the
U.S. economic recovery, with reports showing a sharp slowdown in
the vast services sector and less hiring by private companies in
April.
 ""It's not only every economic miss we get, but every economic
report that is not a home run is now going to be viewed with
skepticism,"" said Zachary Oxman, managing director with TrendMax
Futures in Encinitas, California.
 Copper had been trading in a strong inverse correlation with
the dollar, but the link has weakened recently and on Wednesday
both the metal and the currency fell.
 PROBLEMATIC SUPPLY
 The one cornerstone of the bull story for copper has not
changed -- mine supply remains as problematic as ever.
 Top producers such as Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Xstrata
have reported headline year-on-year drops in copper production of
14 percent, 14 percent and 6 percent respectively.
 Chilean miner Antofagasta said first-quarter production came
in about 29,000 tonnes below initial targets and cut the full-year
target for its flagship Los Pelambres mine.
 Top European copper producer Aurubis expects overall demand
for copper to remain strong this year with prices picking up at
times again to $10,000 a tonne, a senior manager of the company
said.
 Copper stocks hit an 11-month high, the latest data showed,
continuing a rise so far in the second quarter, which is typically
a strong seasonal quarter for demand.
 In other metals, aluminium closed down $47 at $2,750 a tonne,
with rising energy costs and automotive sales preventing further
losses.

 (Adds trade comment, bylines, updates prices)
 By Sarah McFarlane and David Brough
 LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - ICE arabica coffee futures edged
lower on Wednesday but remained within sight of the prior
session's 34-year peak, while sugar fell, weighed by an ample
supply outlook.
 Cocoa futures edged higher, although upside potential
limited by easing political tensions in top grower Ivory Coast
and prospects for a pick-up of cocoa exports later this week.
 In coffee, arabica futures eased below Tuesday's 34-year
high of $3.0890 a lb as tight supplies and strong demand
supported prices.
 ""The outlook for prices is still very bullish, with a
potential short term dip as we come into the Brazilian harvest,""
a London-based fund analyst said.
 ""The roasters are undersupplied on prices for next year ...
they're hoping there's going to be a pullback.""
 Several lower-than-average crops from Colombia, a key
producer of mild washed arabicas, have driven arabica futures to
more than double in price over the past year.
 ""The big question will be Colombia next year,"" the analyst
said. 
 ICE July arabica coffee was down 0.8 cent or 0.26
percent to $3.0535 per lb at 1109 GMT. The contract peaked at
$3.0890 on Tuesday, a 34-year high.
 Liffe July robustas were down $19 or 0.7 percent at $2,592 a
tonne in thin volume of 2,681 lots, having earlier hit a
contract high of $2,624.
 Sugar futures fell, weighed by expectations of ample
supplies from Brazil and Thailand, the possibility that India
could authorise more unrestricted exports of the sweetener, and
a cancelled Egyptian buying tender.
 Egypt's state-owned Sugar and Integrated Industries Company
(SIIC) has cancelled a tender to buy 200,000 tonnes of raw sugar
and is expected to hold another tender soon, European trade
sources said on Wednesday.
 Tunisia tendered this week to buy two cargoes of white sugar
for June and July arrivals, European trade sources said on
Wednesday.
 
 DOWNSIDE PRICE RISK
 Some traders said ICE benchmark front-month July raw sugar
futures could soon test key psychological support at 20 cents a
lb.
 ""The prospects for the bulls are still seemingly worrying as
it seems their best chance of a rebound will be either weather
in Brazil taking a turn for the worse or some unforeseen
political event,"" said Thomas Kujawa of brokerage Sucden
Financial.
 July futures were down 0.26 cent or 1.2 percent at 21.79
cents a lb at 1113 GMT, having dipped to 21.45 cents on Monday,
the lowest level for the front month since September 2010.
 Cocoa futures edged higher, consolidating after dipping
lower on Tuesday, as industry buying supported prices.
 ICE July cocoa was up $12 or 0.4 percent to $3,283 per tonne
at 1115 GMT, while London July cocoa was up 9 pounds or 0.5
percent to 1,993 pounds per tonne in light volume of 2,006 lots.
 ""There is certainly industry buying around,"" a London-based
broker said.
 Dealers were also monitoring developments in Ivory Coast,
where cocoa exports are expected to pick up slowly after months
of inactivity.
 Ivory Coast cocoa exports are likely to resume by Friday,
but forecasts for its mid-crop harvest may be cut by a third
from the expected 300,000 tonnes over security and logistics
concerns in the hinterland.
 ""Cocoa is now at a stage where it's at relatively fair value
considering West African weather will not be as good for the
next crop,"" said a London based broker, adding that the quality
of Ivory Coast's next crop was also likely to suffer after
months of conflict in the country.

 By Melanie Burton and Sue Thomas
 LONDON, May 4 (Reuters) - Copper fell to its lowest since
mid March on Wednesday as investors worried that tightening
monetary measures in China, signs of slowing U.S. growth and
high energy prices will restrain growth and constrict demand.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange touched
$9,100, its lowest since March 15, before recouping some losses
to close at $9,124 compared with Tuesday's close at $9,350 a
tonne.
 The metal used in construction and power fell sharply after
data flagged weakness in the U.S. economic recovery, with
reports showing a sharp slowdown in the vast services sector and
less hiring by private companies in April.
 This added to concerns that China, the world's top consumer
of copper, plans to further tighten monetary policy, despite
manufacturing data that showed its economy is cooling.
 ""It's inevitable that the tightening of monetary policy will
be starting to impact on industrial manufacturing output,"" said
Natixis head of commodities research Nic Brown. 
 ""On top of that you have the potential damage being done by
high energy prices, where we would expect that on its own to act
as a kind of tax on industry as well as households.""
 Oil fell on Wednesday, but is still near 2-1/2 year highs.
 Copper had been trading in a strong inverse correlation with
the dollar, but the link has weakened recently and on Wednesday
both the metal and the currency fell.
 
 MAKES SENSE
""For us if copper prices fall to mid to high $8,000s that
kind of makes sense, those levels are not unreasonable,"" Brown
said.
""The market is still tight. There is still substantial growth
taking place in the developing world, we don't think the bull
story in copper has completely gone away, but clearly the
conditions in the market are quite difficult at the minute.""
A series of earnings reports by copper producers and
consumers on Wednesday underlined a downward trend in copper
output.
 Anglo-Swiss miner Xstrata reported a 6 percent decline in
copper output in the first quarter due to severe weather
conditions at its Collahuasi mine in Chile and lower grades at
its Alumbrera mine in Argentina.
 Chilean miner Antofagasta said copper production in the
first quarter came in about 29,000 tonnes below initial targets
and cut the full-year target for its flagship Los Pelambres
mine.
 Mid-tier producer Kazakhmys PLC also noted a production
shortfall of 5 percent to 74,000 tonnes, but said it remained on
track to meet the full-year target of 300,000 tonnes.
 Top European copper producer Aurubis expects overall demand
for copper to remain strong this year with prices picking up at
times again to $10,000 a tonne, a senior manager of the company
said.
 But many remain unconvinced.
 ""You can read it that it could support prices, but you could
also read that even as production levels have fallen and demand
has picked up, LME stocks are still going up,"" a London trader
said.
 Copper stocks hit an 11-month high, the latest data showed,
continuing a rise so far in the second quarter, which is
typically a strong seasonal quarter for demand.
 Aluminium closed at $2,750 from $2,797 at the close on
Tuesday, with rising energy costs and automotive sales
preventing further losses.
""Strong US auto sales data provided some additional support
for aluminium,"" ANZ said in a note.
 Detroit automakers posted solid U.S. gains in April.
 Battery material lead closed at $2,455 from $2,509. Nickel
fell more than 5 percent to close at $25,825 from $27,325.
 Tin, untraded at the close, was bid at $30,950 from $32,300,
while zinc was $2,190 from $2,245.

 NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - A 5-percent tumble in silver on
Wednesday marked its biggest three-day loss in five years, and
dragged gold down, as speculators continued to dump long
positions after margins requirements were hiked early this
week.
 Silver has now lost 20 percent, the conventional criteria
for a bear market, since it rallied to a record high near $50
an ounce last Thursday. Gold also notched its worst three-day
decline since January despite a broad dollar drop and a ramping
up of gold reserves by Mexico.
 Despite a sharp pullback, silver is still one of the
top-performing commodities of the year with a 30 percent gain.
 But investors remained wary of a market in almost chronic
surplus and a highly volatile price.
 Sentiment among precious metals investors also took a hit
after a report said high-profile investor George Soros, who was
bullish on gold and a top investor in gold funds, has been
selling gold and silver in the past month or so.
 ""With the CME raising three times in a week the margin
requirement of silver, that was enough to disrupt the parabolic
move in silver prices,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment
strategist of broker-dealer Janney Montgomery Scott, which
manages $53 billion in client assets.
 Spot silver  dropped 4.9 percent to $39.58 an ounce
by 3:17 p.m. EDT (1917 GMT), having earlier hit a near
one-month low at $38.95.
 Technicals were in focus after silver broke below its
20-day moving average on Tuesday, which had held since
February. But prices were still well above the 100- and 200-day
averages, after a 170 percent rally over the last 12 months.
 Silver's decline sent the gold/silver ratio to a three-week
high near 40 from just below 32 last Thursday.
 Spot gold  was down 1.6 percent at $1,515.30 an
ounce, having hit a record $1,575.79 on Monday.
 COMEX June gold futures  settled down $25.10, 1.6
percent, at $1,515.30. Gold futures volume topped 230,000 lots,
one-third above its 250-day average.

 Also factoring into gold was news that George Soros' big
$28 billion firm and some hedge funds have been selling gold
and silver, while other notable managers including John Paulson
continued to favor precious metals, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing sources.
 In the third quarter of 2010, Soros reduced some of his big
bets on gold, a market he has called ""the ultimate bubble.""
[ID:nN15263362]
 The bullion market largely ignored news that Mexico's
central bank has beefed up their bullion reserves by buying
over 90 tonnes of gold, more than $4 billion worth, over the
past couple of years to put some of their massive foreign
exchange holdings to work. [ID:nLDE7431OZ]
 ""The size (of the purchase) is certainly pretty chunky to
have been accomplished in that space of time. So it certainly
gives another sizable layer of support to gold's position in
the international reserves system,"" said Credit Suisse precious
metals analyst Tom Kendall.

 SINGAPORE, May 4 (Reuters) - U.S. silver futures dropped
more than 3 percent on Wednesday, down for a third straight
session, and gold faltered as precious metals came under
pressure to correct after a strong rally in the last few weeks.	
 COMEX silver has tumbled 15 percent in the past three
sessions, wiping out gains from a rally that started in
mid-April and pushed prices to a 31-year top just below $50 on
April 25.	
 ""On the way up, it (silver) was too fast and now we are
seeing a general liquidation of long positions,"" said a
Singapore-based trader.	
 ""Silver has been falling much faster than gold, but it
doesn't mean that silver will collapse from here.""	
 The immediate support level for silver is seen around $39,
its 50-day moving average, he added.	
 Spot gold hit record highs in 11 out of the past 14
sessions, and has held relatively steady compared to silver by
falling just under 3 percent from a record of $1,575.79 touched
on Monday.	
 COMEX silver  hit a near three-week low of $40.47
earlier. It shed 3.4 percent to $41.13 an ounce by 0607 GMT,
extending an 8-percent loss from Tuesday, after the CME Group
hiked margin requirement for the third time in a week.	
 Higher margins make speculation more expensive, adding to
the pressure on silver prices.	
 Spot silver fell by 1.3 percent to $41.11.	
 Investment interest in silver ebbed, as holdings in the
iShares Silver Trust , the world's biggest silver-backed
exchange-traded fund, dropped to a seven-week low of 10,909.06
tonnes, 4 percent off the record high hit on April 25. 
 The gold-silver ratio, used to measure how many ounces of
silver is used to buy an ounce of gold, recovered to a one-month
high of 37, from below 32 last week, its lowest since early
1980s.	
 
 Spot gold declined half a percent to $1,532.81 an
ounce, also headed for a third straight day of loss.	
 COMEX gold  lost 0.5 percent to $1,533.20.	
 Beyond the correction, gold and silver are expected to
resume their upward trend, as worries about rising inflation and
ongoing unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as
low U.S. interest rates may continue to drive investors to these
precious metals, traders said.	
 
 CHINA INFLATION OUTLOOK 
 Chinese inflation is expected to moderate in the second half
of the year as government measures to curb price rises hit their
mark, said a senior central bank official. [ID:nL3E7G403Y]	
 The statement is unlikely to dampen the long-term sentiment
in gold, traders and analysts said.	
 ""It doesn't turn the market around. All the actions will
only slow down the pace of inflation,"" said the Singapore-based
trader.	
 China has raised interest rates four times since last
October and hiked banks' required reserve ratio to a record
level, to fight stubborn inflation.	
 ""China's rate hikes tend to have a rather short-lived impact
on global gold market,"" said Li Ning, an analyst at Shanghai
CIFCO Futures. ""The key is when the United States will start
increasing rates.""	
 The European Central Bank, which has raised interest rates
last month, is expected to signal its readiness to hike rates
again when it meets on Thursday. [ID:nLDE7420ZV]

 By Chris Kelly and Sue Thomas
 NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Copper bounced from a seven-week low to end up
on Tuesday, buoyed by surprisingly strong U.S. factory orders data that
underscored recovery optimism in Western economies, even as Chinese growth
slowed.
 Gains fed through across base metals, with aluminum hitting a fresh
three-year high above $2,800 per tonne amid concerns about tight physical
supplies, strong U.S. April auto sales data.
 ""I think that economic news is helping copper and base metals,"" said Justin
Lennon, analyst with Mitsui Bussan Commodities in New York.
 ""It's Western-world focused ... it's aside from China, which is pretty key
because they are determined to restrain themselves and use their existing
inventories until such time they feel they need to come back.""
 The metals rally diverged from losses in most other commodity markets on
Tuesday, as the weight of a firmer U.S. dollar spurred broad-based
liquidation.
 The COMEX July copper contract firmed 5.70 cents, or 1.3 percent, to settle
at $4.2530 per lb.
 London Metal Exchange (LME) copper for three-month delivery ended up $30 at
$9,350 a tonne, recovering from an earlier fall to $9,194.75, which was its
lowest price since March 17.
 Volumes were slow to get going on the first full trading day of the new
month. A little more than 37,300 lots were traded in New York, about 20 percent
below the 30-day norm, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data
 Both the LME and Shanghai exchange were closed Monday for public holidays.
 New orders for U.S. manufactured goods rose 3 percent in April for a fifth
straight monthly increase, reflective of a healthy economic recovery and
potentially more demand for materials.
 ""There was a positive reaction,"" said analyst Andrey Kryuchenkov, ""But at
the end of the day, everybody is still looking at China, and weaker than
expected PMI numbers (showing) manufacturing growth slowing in April outweigh
it.""
 Manufacturing growth in top metal consumer China slowed in April,
suggesting that the government's tightening efforts have weighed on the world's
second-largest economy more heavily than expected.
 HEADY PREMIUMS
 Three month aluminum climbed to its highest since August 2008 at $2,803 a
tonne, before ending up $30 at $2,797.
 Rising energy costs have helped to propel the power intensive metal to its
highest levels in almost three years, while a 26-percent jump in April new car
and truck sales at Detroit-based General Motors Co added to the lightweight
metal's upbeat demand outlook.
 Upward pressure in premiums also point to robust demand revival in South
America, Barclays Capital said in a note.
 ""European aluminum premiums have both set new record highs of 8-9/lb and
$210-235/t, respectively, with U.S. premiums buoyed by strong South American
demand due to weak smelter production growth in the region and rapid growth in
demand,"" it said.

 By Sue Thomas and Melanie Burton
 LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Copper climbed off seven-week lows
to end positive on Tuesday after better-than-expected U.S.
factory orders underlined a recovery in the world's top economy,
although a slowdown in Chinese growth curbed upside momentum.
 Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange
(LME) ended at $9,350 a tonne. It earlier fell to a trough of
$9,194.75 a tonne, compared with a close of $9,320 on Thursday
before a long weekend that ended on Monday.
 ""There was a positive reaction,"" said analyst Andrey
Kryuchenkov, ""but at the end of the day, everybody is still
looking at China, and weaker than expected PMI numbers (showing)
manufacturing growth slowing in April outweigh it."" 
 New orders received by U.S. factories climbed robustly in
March, posting a fifth straight monthly gain that pointed to a
healthy manufacturing sector that is supporting a continuing
recovery, government data on Tuesday showed. 
 Manufacturing growth in China, the world's top consumer of
base metals, slowed in April, a survey showed, suggesting that
the government's tightening efforts have weighed on the world's
second-largest economy more heavily than expected.
 Although China's PMI for its services sector rose in April,
the sub-index for the property sector, a major user of copper,
remained below a 50 level that indicates expansion for the
seventh month.
 Matched with data from the U.S. on Monday that showed U.S.
manufacturing growth continued in April but at a slightly slower
pace, Citigroup said that copper's record high of $10,190 a
tonne in February may prove the top of the cycle. 
 ""PMIs reported over the past several days suggest that
growth in global industrial production will continue to expand
at a healthy rate over the next few months, but well off the
pace recorded last year,"" Citi said in a note.
 ""The PMIs add to the case that suggests that, with China and
other major countries now moving to withdraw very stimulatory
macroeconomic policies, copper (most probably along with other
base metals) has most likely seen its cycle price peak.""
 The dollar edged off three-year lows on Tuesday, as a
build-up of bets to sell it based on loose U.S. monetary policy
ran out of steam. A stronger dollar makes metals more expensive
for holders of other currencies.
 ""Maybe we're looking at a potential inflection point where
we could see some dollar strengthening over the next couple of
months,"" Daniel Brebner, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said.
 ""And with risk perceptions starting to build, the sell in
May and go away mantra may become more popular given some of the
challenges on the macro economic front that could emerge over
the next couple of months.""
 Also weighing on prices, copper's inventories continue to
rise, up by 150 tonnes to 463,800 tonnes, the highest level
since last June.

 HEADY PREMIUMS 
 Three month aluminium climbed to its highest since August
2008 at $2,803 a tonne before ending at $2,797 a tonne.
While rising energy costs have helped to propel the power
intensive metal to its highest levels in almost three years,
climbing premiums also point to robust demand revival in South
America, Barclays Capital said in a note.
 ""European aluminium premiums have both set new record highs
of 8-9/¢lb and $210-235/t, respectively, with US premiums buoyed
by strong South American demand due to weak smelter production
growth in the region and rapid growth in demand,"" it said.
In exchange news, the London Metal Exchange is considering
building its own clearing system, it said on Tuesday, a move
market participants said could help it boost earnings although
it would incur significant start up costs. 
 In other metals, tin ended at $32,300 from $32,050 while
zinc, used in galvanizing, was $2,245 from $2,247 at Thursday's
close.
 Battery material lead finished at $2,509 from $2,491 and

 NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Silver suffered its biggest
two-day loss since October 2008, dragging down gold and other
commodities on Tuesday as speculators rushed to liquidate
positions after COMEX's third margin hike in a week, traders
said.
 The 5 percent slide in silver, which rattled other markets
and exacerbated a retreat in oil prices, came as more analysts
questioned its ability to extend a rally that had lifted prices
by more than 150 percent since last August. Silver hit an
all-time high within a whisker of $50 an ounce just last
Thursday.
 Gold likewise fell for a second day, losing nearly 2
percent and marking its biggest correction since early January.
The death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on Monday prompted
a small measure of profit-taking from the ultimate safe-haven
asset, but silver stole the limelight.
 While silver is a much smaller market more prone to
volatile trade, it had commanded wider attention as it defies
predictions of a collapse when technical indicators began
showing red flags. But three margin hikes that have increased
the cost of trading by 38 percent since last Tuesday has shaken
the market, according to analysts.
 ""We are seeing accelerated margin selling in silver ... and
it's spilling over into gold and crude oil. When you have big
margin selling in one commodity, it has a cascading impact on
the markets,"" said Bill O'Neill, partner of New Jersey-based
commodity investment firm LOGIC Advisors.
 Spot silver  fell 5 percent to $41.70 an ounce by
4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT), having briefly moved higher in
extremely choppy trade. It hit a three-week low of $40.64,
after posting its biggest one-day drop in 29 months on Monday.
 U.S. July silver futures , which had already settled
prior to much of Monday's late losses, fell more than 10
percent to settle at $42.585, with volume topping 170,000 lots,
one of the busiest days of 2011.
 Spot gold  dropped 0.4 percent to $1,537.95 an ounce.
U.S. June gold futures  ended down 1.1 percent at
$1,540.40 after trading from $1,516.20 to $1,551.40. It touched
a record high of $1,575.79 on Monday.
 Silver's decline sent the gold/silver ratio to a three-week
high toward 37 from just below 32 last Thursday. Silver's
sudden drop coincided with the fall of other commodities led by
crude oil's 2 percent decline.
 Silver is still one of the top-performing commodities of
the year, having risen by 35 percent so far in 2011.
 Market participants are waiting for the key U.S. non-farm
payrolls data due on Friday, which should offer evidence of the
ability of the economy to generate jobs, something which the
Federal Reserve has flagged as a key concern. 
 TECHNICAL SELLING
 Silver is now trading below its 20-day average, which it
has largely held since February.
(Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/wuv39r)
 It was still well above its 100- and 200-day averages,
after a 170 percent rally over the last 12 months to a record
high $49.51 an ounce set on April 28.
 ""Silver has been, in the short term, overextended. Its
divergence from its moving averages has been extreme,"" said
Robert Lutts, chief investment officer at Cabot Money
Management which manages $500 million in client assets.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - Gold fell from a record high on Monday and
silver notched its biggest one-day loss in seven weeks after the killing of
Osama bin Laden sapped the safe-haven premium out of precious metals.
 Silver bounced off early lows after falling as much as 11 percent, as
speculators scaled back their bullish bets on increased futures margins and
a technical overhang after a 170 percent rally over the last 12 months to a
record high last week.
 Gold initially rose to a record high for a fourth consecutive session,
but news of the al Qaeda leader's killing by U.S. forces sent gold down
almost 2 percent. The CBOE gold volatility index <.GVX>, a gauge of bullion
investor anxiety, posted its biggest-ever two-session gain since its
inception in September last year.
 ""People are pulling out of gold and going back into the equity market,
as the news had a de-risking effect on the geopolitical environment,"" said
Steven Faber, analyst at Haber Trilix Advisors, which manages $2 billion in
assets.
 Investor buying later lifted bullion off its lows after data showed
U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in April for a second straight month but
input prices reached their highest level in nearly three years.
[ID:nN02208702]
 Spot gold  was down 0.4 percent at $1,558.09 an ounce by 2:26
p.m. EDT (1826 GMT), after hitting a record high for a fourth straight
session at $1,575.79. U.S. June  gold futures settled up 70 cents at
$1,557.10 after ranging from $1,540.30 to $1,577.40.
 Gold's losses were limited by inflation worries, the financial health
of some euro zone economies, jitters over the U.S. budget deficit, and
ultra-accommodative U.S. monetary policy, analysts said.
 Markets across large parts of Asia and much of Europe were closed for
May Day and Labor Day holidays, reducing the number of participants and
making for volatile trading.
 Silver  was down 4.1 percent at $45.82 an ounce, having fallen as
much as $5 to a two-week low of $42.58. U.S. silver futures volume was
nearly three times above its 250-day average, one of the busiest days in
2011.
 ""We see selling from hedge funds and recent buyers placing sell-stops
on the bin Laden news, thinking that risk premiums may be shifting,"" said
George Gero, vice president at RBC Capital Markets.

 SILVER PARES LOSSES, TRACKS GOLD
 Silver's sell-off began last week when U.S. futures margin requirements
were raised twice, and as the metal's failure to extend record highs above
$50 an ounce triggered technical selling.
 Data showed speculators had scaled back their bullish bets recently in
COMEX silver futures and options to the lowest since early February, even
as prices neared the psychological $50 level, U.S. regulator CFTC said
Friday. [ID:nN29175149]
 CME Group Inc  sharply raised its maintenance margins for U.S.
silver futures twice last week, making it more expensive for silver
speculators to trade. [ID:nL3E7FS62K]
 Ole Hansen, senior manager at Saxo Bank, said silver's volatility was
at an unprecedented level.
 GOLD/SILVER RATIO BOUNCES
 Some traders attributed silver's sharp fall to an unwinding of a short
gold-silver ratio position, compounded by automated stop-loss orders.
 The gold-silver ratio, used to measure the number of silver ounces
needed to buy an ounce of gold, rebounded to about 34 from below 32, its
lowest level since the early 1980s.
 ""There is nothing from a fundamental perspective to cause a fall this
large. Silver has been the most rapidly appreciating of the metals in the
past months and if there was one that looked a bit frothy it was silver,""
said Ben Westmore, commodities economist at National Australia Bank.
 ""This is mostly technical. We expect silver to be in relatively close
step with gold and while both have risen strongly, silver may have moved a
bit too far ahead,"" he said.
 Platinum group metals, mainly used as autocatalysts, were mixed after
Honda Motor Co <7267.T> said several models in its line-up, including the
Fit and Civic Hybrid cars, will be in short supply until later this year
due to auto parts shortages in Japan following the earthquake and tsunami.
 Platinum  edged up 0.3 percent to $1,869.50 an ounce, while
palladium  dropped 1.5 percent to $777.22 an ounce.

 By Nick Trevethan and Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, May 2 (Reuters) - Silver prices tumbled on
Monday, making their biggest loss since late 2008, while gold
trimmed losses triggered by news that al-Qaeda leader Osama bin
Laden was killed in a U.S.-led operation in Pakistan.	
 Silver , hit by a recovery in the dollar, increased
futures trading margins and a technical overhang after a 170
percent rally over the last 12 months, fell as much as 10
percent to $43.04 an ounce, its lowest in nearly two weeks,
before recovering to $44.92.	
 COMEX silver futures  tumbled 13 percent to $42.20
earlier in holiday-thinned trade, and trimmed losses to $44.96.	
 ""Silver is an accident waiting to happen, and it seems like
it has incurred 'bumper' damage today,"" said Citigroup analyst
David Thurtell. 
 Gold initially fell more than $5, as bin Laden's death was
seen to take off some of its safe-haven appeal, but traders
expected gold's bullish trend to remain intact, against the
backdrop of the macroeconomic and political environment.	
 ""I'm not too concerned about gold at the moment,"" said
Darren Heathcote, head of trading at Investec Australia, adding
that the continuously weakening dollar and lofty oil prices
would remain supportive of bullion.	
 Spot gold fell over $5 to an intra-day low of
$1,540.39, after hitting a record of $1,575.79 earlier. It was
trading at $1,558.55 an ounce by 0638 GMT, down 0.3 percent from
the previous close.	
 COMEX gold futures  reversed early losses to edge up
0.2 percent to $1,559.20.
 
 
 
 GOLD'S APPEAL SEEN UNDIMMED 
 Concerns that extremist groups might launch reprisal attacks
over the death of bin Laden may brighten gold's safe-haven
appeal.	
 ""The threat from terrorism is not over. Others will fill the
gap he has left. I suspect that his death will trigger a
retaliatory attack in the short term,"" said Thurtell. ""I think
gold's status as a safe haven is intact.""	
 Markets across large parts of Asia and much of Europe were
closed for May Day and Labour day holidays, reducing the number
of market participants and making for volatile trade.	
 Speculators scaled back their bullish bets in COMEX silver
futures and options to the lowest level since early February,
regulator data showed on Friday. [ID:nN29175149]	
 The CME Group Inc said on Thursday it would raise
maintenance margins for COMEX silver futures by 13.2 percent to
$10,750 per contract from $9,500 effective Friday, April 29.	
 Some traders put down silver's spectacular fall to an
unwinding of a short gold-silver ratio position, compounded by
automated stop-loss orders.	
 The gold-silver ratio, used to measure the number of silver
ounces needed to buy an ounce of gold, rebounded to about 35
from below 32, its lowest level since the early 1980s. This
compares with an average ratio of 64 in the past 29 years.

 But in spite of the falls, traders said it was too soon to
close the book on silver's astounding rally over the past 12
months.	
 ""Although that was a brutal wash out of some length, silver
is now back into the original bullish trend channel, so while
$41 holds, the trend is still intact,"" one trader said.

applications, platinum fell 1 percent and palladium
dropped 1.2 percent.

showed on Sunday, suggesting that the government's tightening
efforts have weighed on the world's second-largest economy more

 SINGAPORE, May 2 (Reuters) - Oil fell on Monday for the
first time in four sessions, with U.S. benchmark prices off a
31-month high as NATO air strikes killed one of Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi's sons and after Saudi Arabia increased
production in April.	
 ICE Brent crude for June  fell 51 cents to $125.38 a

 ""What's happening in Libya is probably an event that will
see Gaddafi moved out of his position, so the risk premium which
relates to Middle East concerns will start to erode,"" said
Jonathan Barratt, managing director at Commodity Broking
Services in Sydney, estimating that premium at about $18.	
 Saudi Arabia's crude oil output edged back up in April to
around 8.5 million barrels per day (bpd) from roughly 8.3
million bpd in March as demand picked up, Saudi-based industry
sources said on Sunday. [ID:nLDE74005M]	
 ""Saudi Arabia has increased production, we know that the
dollar is slightly better bid and you have big movements in the
precious metals markets,"" Barratt said.	
 
 The dollar strengthened by nearly 0.3 percent earlier on
Monday following last week's slide, deterring investors from
piling into commodities this week and triggering a 10 percent
plunge in spot silver prices.	
 Last week's Federal Reserve reassurance that economic
stimulus would continue boosted U.S. crude to above $114 on
Friday, the highest since September 2008, and gold to a record
earlier on Monday.	
 Money managers increased their bets on higher U.S. crude oil
prices to a combined record level in New York and London in the

prices rose to their highest level since September 2008.

Libya's conflict have tempered oil trading. The U.S. 30-day

 (Adds analysts' planting progress forecast)
 By Sam Nelson
 CHICAGO, April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures rose by 4
percent on Friday for the best gains in a month as funds came
charging back one day after a massive sell-off took prices to
their lowest level in nearly a month.
 ""The fund selling was overdone yesterday. It was just fund
liquidation and there was bargain buying today,"" said Jeff
Thompson, an analyst for ABN Amro.
 Investors saw Thursday's fund-related breakdown of corn
prices as an opportunity to snap up cheap supplies in view of
outlooks for the U.S. corn stockpile to fall to the lowest
since the 1930s this year.
 Wheat and soybean futures also gained in a recovery after
each market was pounded Thursday as a resumption in corn
planting in western stretches of the Corn Belt alleviated
concerns about supply, traders said.
 But there remains a lot of uncertainty about crop weather,
adding to the volatility in corn, wheat and soybean markets.
 ""Things are going to improve a bit in the western belt, but
could deteriorate late next week and next weekend,"" said Mike
Palmerino, a meteorologist with Telvent DTN.
 Excessive wet weather in the United States has slowed corn
plantings, leading to concerns about a late start for this
year's crop and a potential for reduced production.
 Analysts expect a government report on Monday to show U.S.
corn plantings at only 15 to 19 percent complete versus an
average of about 40 percent for this time of year.
 CBOT July corn was up 27-1/4 cents at $7.56-1/2 per bushel,
July wheat was up 23-3/4 cents at $8.01-1/4, and July soy up
40-1/2 cents at $13.94.
 The falling dollar and short-covering lifted soybean
futures and weather uncertainty remained an issue because
rainfall continued to slow crop planting in much of the eastern
half of the U.S. Midwest crop belt, said Ann Frick, oilseeds
analyst for Prudential Bache Commodities.
 Wheat was down 3.8 percent for the week and was up 0.8
percent for April. Corn was up 2.3 percent for the week and up
8.8 percent for the month. Soybeans were up 0.9 percent for the
week and down 1.2 percent for the month.
 ""There was short-covering after yesterday's big sell-off
and the outside markets are commodity-friendly with the weaker
dollar, higher crude oil and gains in metals,"" said Don Roose,
president and analyst for U.S. Commodities in Des Moines,
Iowa.
 The rebound in grain and oilseed prices on Friday also
stemmed from the U.S. dollar hitting a three-year low against a
basket of currencies on Friday. The dollar will end the month
with its biggest loss since September, with more weakness
expected as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low while
the European Central bank raises them.
 Light to no deliveries also helped the grain market recover
from Thursday's sell-off.
 There were no deliveries on the May futures contracts for
corn and soybeans and only light deliveries for wheat. Light
deliveries on a futures contract indicates that owners of the
commodity want to retain ownership, a bullish signal for
futures prices.
 WET WEATHER CONTINUES TO SUPPORT
 Support also stemming from continued wet weather in the
eastern portion of the U.S. Midwest.
 ""There is more rain forecast for next week in the east and
that will keep plantings to a minimum so that's supportive,""
Roose said.
 Declining open interest after Thursday's big sell-off
indicated the price drops were due to liquidation of long
positions rather than any new net selling, a long-term bullish
indicator for wheat, corn and soybean futures prices.
 Corn saw its largest two-day drop in open interest since
late November and the number of open contracts has fallen
nearly 8 percent in the last six sessions.
 Open interest in soybeans has fallen five days in a row and
six days in a row in wheat.

 By Marcy Nicholson
 NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - Arabica coffee futures
trading on ICE reversed up to close at the highest level in 34
years, while U.S. cocoa ended at a six-week high on Friday,
hitting technical buy signals in its best monthly performance
in 19 months.
 Raw sugar settled at a 6-1/2-month low on supply pressure
and as it continued its downtrend on the last trading day of
the month.
 London-based Liffe soft commodity markets are closed for
British holidays on Friday and Monday, and will reopen on
Tuesday. ICE Futures U.S. will delay the start of electronic
trading for coffee, cocoa and sugar until 7:30 a.m. EDT (1130
GMT) on Monday because of those holidays, it said in a notice.
 U.S. cocoa continued higher, following a technical breakout
and options-related dealings earlier this week that forced many
holding short positions to take cover.
 Key July cocoa futures rose $60, or 1.8 percent, to close
at $3,340 per tonne, the highest settlement for the second
position since March 14.
 ""I think today we have some nervousness about the slowness
of cocoa moving out of the Ivory Coast and the market
rebuilding some risk premium,"" said Sterling Smith, analyst
with Country Hedging in Minnesota.
 Ivory Coast cocoa exports could resume by next week after a
row was resolved over how to make customs payments, two
exporters in the world's top grower nation told Reuters on
Thursday.
 The July contract attracted heavy short-covering on
Wednesday after rising above $3,130, but rising open interest
shows the rally also attracted new longs to the market in the
past two trading sessions. The contract rose above the 50
percent Fibonacci retracement level at $3,323 on Friday,
spurring more buying, dealers said.
 The second position closed the week up 8.2 percent, the
biggest gain since April 2009. It closed the month up 12.6
percent, the strongest month since September 2009.
 Arabica coffee futures reversed higher in thin dealings
with a lift from investor buying and concern about tight washed
arabica supplies, while origin sellers sat on the sidelines,
allowing the market to climb easily.
 July arabica coffee futures inched up 0.65 cent, or 0.2
percent, to $2.9985 per lb, the highest settlement for the
second position since 1977.
 Arabica gained 13.5 percent in April, making it the
third-best-performing commodity this month, next to U.S. and
spot silver. U.S. cocoa was the fourth-best performer with a
13.1 percent gain and raw sugar was second from bottom at a
17.9 percent drop. Cotton fared the worst, down 21.1 percent.
 The market remains underpinned by concerns about tight
supplies of washed arabica beans, closing the month up 12.4
percent, the biggest monthly gain in four months.
 Raw sugar continued to move lower as the market remained
focused on the May delivery, which was expected to be heavy, as
the spot contract expires on Friday. Open interest for May
dropped to 19,306 lots by April 28, down 11,008 lots from the
previous day.
 The May raw sugar contract fell 0.54 cent, or 2.3 percent,
to finish at 23.38 cents a lb. July eased 0.26 cent, or 1.2
percent, to end at 22.25 cents, the weakest settlement for the
second position since Oct. 6.
 The second position finished the month down 11 percent,
marking the third straight month of losses.
 ""Sugar is caught in a downward trend and I think sugar has
more work to do on the downside. We do have the large Brazilian
crop coming into the supply chain,"" Smith said.
 The second position has fallen for three straight months.

 By Chris Kelly
 NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - Copper fell to a six-week low on Friday,
ignoring the often supportive influence of a weaker dollar, as technical
pressures mounted and U.S. data offered further evidence of slowing economic
conditions.
 Copper's losses diverged from U.S. industrial share prices, which were
buoyed by a fivefold increase in quarterly profits from heavy machinery
manufacturer Caterpillar Inc.
 Instead, prices crumbled under a negative price chart picture after the
front-month May contract  broke down below key trendline support around
$4.20 per lb.
 ""The charts do look weak ... I think that the complexion is definitely for
a weaker tone given that it is an industrial metal that is performing poor in a
scenario where most industrial components are doing well,"" said Scott Meyers,
senior trading analyst with Pioneer Futures in New York.
 The most-active July COMEX copper contract slumped to a session low of
$4.1580 per lb, its lowest level since March 15, before ending the day at
$4.1790, down 8.25 cents from Thursday's close.
 It was the second consecutive monthly loss for the metal as concerns about
rising inflation and further rounds of interest rate hikes in Asia, Europe and
Latin America underscored perceptions of lower demand for raw materials at the
start of the year.
 Copper was down overnight after data showed inflation pressures on the rise
in the euro zone, upping the chances of an interest rate increase in June.
 But losses kicked into high-gear after U.S. data showed factory activity in
the country's Midwest slowed this month, as tepid demand in the first quarter
left businesses with less of a need to rebuild inventories.
 ""The Chicago PMI was another one in a string of numbers that have been
disappointing,"" said Sterling Smith, an analyst for Country Hedging Inc in St.
Paul, Minnesota.
 ""It's showing that growth is slowing greatly, if not coming to a complete
stop,"" he explained.
 SHANGHAI SURPLUS
 Copper inventories in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell for the sixth week to their lowest level since mid-February.
 Despite the steady fall of stocks in surveyed warehouses, Standard
Chartered bank warned that China's copper inventories in bonded warehouses were
still on the rise in April.
 Stocks in Shanghai's bonded warehouses were hovering at around 650,000
tonnes, equivalent to roughly four weeks of China's domestic use and higher
than the 200,000-tonne average over the past three years.
 ""What is worrying for bulls is that the majority of these copper stocks are
tied to finance deals, meaning either that they were bought for the purpose of
collecting bank loans, or they were unable to find immediate buyers,"" the bank
said in a report led by analyst Judy Zhu.
 ""Either would indicate that there is no real demand backing these stocks;
hence, we believe a surplus of the metal in China is imminent.""
 The London Metal Exchange (LME) copper three-month delivery contract was
closed Friday for Britain's royal wedding, and will remain shut on Monday for a
public holiday. Shanghai will also be shut on Monday.

 NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - Copper fell to its lowest

soft U.S. economic data that continued to offer proof of
slowing growth in the world's largest economy.
 In New York, the most-active July COMEX copper contract

lowest level since March 15. It was last at $4.1865, down 7.50

for Country Hedging Inc in St. Paul, Minnesota.
 ""It's showing that growth is slowing greatly, if not coming
to a complete stop,"" he explained.
 Separate data showed U.S. consumer spending edged up 0.2
percent in March as households stretched to cover the higher
cost of food and gasoline and inflation posted its biggest
year-on-year rise in 10 months.
 The reports come on the heels of disappointing U.S. growth
figures and weekly jobless claims benefits on Thursday which
cast a long shadow over growth expectations heading into the
second quarter.
 Copper was on track for a second-straight monthly loss,
under pressure from mounting concerns about further interest
rate tightening in Asia, Europe and Latin America.
 Euro zone inflation edged up to 2.8 percent in April, well
above the 2 percent target ceiling of the European Central
Bank, which raised rates for the first time in two years
earlier this month.
 Copper inventories in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange fell for the sixth week to their lowest level
since mid-February.
 Despite the steady fall of stocks in surveyed warehouses,
Standard Chartered bank on Friday warned that China's copper
inventories in bonded warehouses were still on the rise in
April.
 Stocks in Shanghai's bonded warehouses were hovering at
around 650,000 tonnes, equivalent to roughly four weeks of
China's domestic use and higher than the 200,000-tonne average
over the past three years.
 ""What is worrying for bulls is that the majority of these
copper stocks are tied to finance deals, meaning either that
they were bought for the purpose of collecting bank loans, or
they were unable to find immediate buyers,"" the bank said in a
report led by analyst Judy Zhu.
 ""Either would indicate that there is no real demand backing
these stocks; hence, we believe a surplus of the metal in China
is imminent.""
 The London Metal Exchange (LME) copper three-month delivery
contract closed flat on Thursday, its last trading day of the
month, at $9,320 per tonne.
 The most active Shanghai copper contract July, dropped 1.2
percent to 69,200 yuan.

and will remain closed on Monday for a public holiday. Shanghai

 NEW YORK/SINGAPORE, April 29 (Reuters) - Copper sank to a
two-week low Friday morning, hit by weak regional manufacturing
data in the United States that offered further evidence of slowing
economic conditions in the world's largest economy.
 Business activity in the U.S. Midwest grew less than expected
this month as growth in employment and new orders slowed.
 Separate data showed U.S. consumer spending edged up 0.2
percent in March as households stretched to cover the higher cost
of food and gasoline and inflation posted its biggest year-on-year

 In New York, the most-active July COMEX copper contract fell
to a session low of $4.1940 per lb, its lowest level since April
18, before recovering a bit to trade at $4.2015 by 10:25 a.m. EDT
(1425 GMT), down 6.00 cents from Thursday's close.
 Copper's early-morning losses placed it on track for a
second-straight monthly loss, under pressure from mounting
concerns about further interest rate tightening in Asia, Europe
and Latin America.
 Euro zone inflation edged up to 2.8 percent in April, well
above the 2 percent target ceiling of the European Central Bank,
which raised rates for the first time in two years earlier this
month.
 In Asia, the most active Shanghai copper contract, July,
dropped 1.2 percent to 69,200 yuan.
 ""If there are no negative macroeconomic policies announced
over the weekend, I think Shanghai copper should be due for a
rebound next Tuesday. But for now, the market is still concerned
about the tight credit conditions in China and the weak U.S.
economy,"" said Shanghai CIFCO Futures analyst Zhou Jie.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - Gold surged to a record high
on Friday for the third straight day, as investors kept up a
buying frenzy fueled by the outlook for low U.S. interest rates
that has propelled bullion to its seventh consecutive weekly
rise, its longest winning streak since 2007.
 Bullion jumped to $1,569.30 an ounce as U.S. consumer
spending rose for a ninth straight month in March with
inflation at its highest in nearly a year. Platinum group
metals also rose about 2 percent but silver fell 1 percent
after soaring to record high in the previous session.
 Option traders reported strong buying of call options and
call spreads, reflecting bullish market expectations. A gauge
of bullion market volatility also spiked in response to a sharp
price rally.
 ""What has been driving gold is an abundance of liquidity of
Fed policy that remains exceedingly accommodative, which is
going to work against the U.S. dollar,"" said Mark Luschini,
chief investment strategist of broker-dealer Janney Montgomery
Scott, which manages $53 billion in client assets.
 ""There is worry that inflation, which is not a problem
right now, could escalate to become one. And once it does, it
becomes very difficult to put the genie back into the bottle,""
he said.
 The CBOE gold volatility index <.GVX>, which measures
bullion investor anxiety, rose 6 percent to its highest level
in five weeks.

 Spot gold  was last up 1.8 percent at $1,563.30 an
ounce by 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT), having earlier hit an all-time
high $1,569.30. The metal notched a 9 percent monthly gain, its
strongest since November. Bullion also posted its seventh
consecutive weekly rise, its longest winning streak since
2007.
 U.S. June futures  settled up 1.7 percent at
$1,556.40 an ounce, with trading volumes about one-third below
its 30-day average due to a public holiday in London.
 On the options front, heavy buying of outright call options
and bull call spreads of June 2012 calls with strikes $1,800
and $2,000, said COMEX gold options floor trader Jonathan
Jossen.
 Bull call spread is an option play involving the buying of
calls at one strike price while selling them at a higher strike
with the same expiration date. Investors often expect prices to
rise moderately with the strategy.
 A slight drop in the dollar also contributed to bullion's
gains. Earlier in the week, expectations of further weakness in
the dollar were the biggest drive for gold and silver rallies
to records. [FRX/]
 SILVER RETREATS FROM RECORD
 Silver retreated from the record high it set Thursday, but
was still by far the best-performing commodity in April and so
far in 2011. It posted a near 27 percent rise in April, its
biggest monthly gain since April 1987.
 Silver  was last down 0.8 percent at $48.03 an
ounce.
 Silver gained 3 percent this week, although analysts say
its robust performance against the other precious metals may
not be sustainable.
 ""If silver doesn't make a new high and sustain above that,
it may go through a more vicious correction here. So, gold in
the short term could go down in sympathy of that,"" said James
Dailey, portfolio manager of the TEAM Asset Strategy Fund.
 Speculators scaled back their bullish bets in COMEX silver
futures and options to the lowest level since early February,
even as prices neared the psychological $50 an ounce, regulator
data showed Friday. [ID:nN29175149]
 The CME Group Inc , parent of the Chicago Board of
Trade, said on Thursday it would raise maintenance margins for
silver futures by 13.2 percent, its second time this week,
making it more expensive for silver speculators to trade in.
[ID:nL3E7FS62K]
 For platinum group metals, platinum  echoed the
strength in gold, rising 1.9 percent on the day to $1,870.49 an
ounce, while palladium  rose 2.6 percent to $790.97.

 SINGAPORE, April 29 (Reuters) - Silver and gold were within sight of
historic highs on Friday and could resume an uptrend as the U.S. dollar held
near three-year lows against a basket of currencies on hopes U.S. monetary
policy would stay ultra-loose, keeping inflationary price pressures high. 
 A fresh batch of U.S. economic data in the form of rising claims for jobless
benefits failed to rescue the dollar, which had dropped to its weakest level
since July 2008 against other currencies before recovering slightly. 
 Silver barely moved, standing at 48.35 an ounce by 0625 GMT, after
having rallied to a record at $49.51 an ounce on Thursday. Gold eased 75
cents to $1,534.20 an ounce after hitting a lifetime high around $1,538 an ounce
in the previous session. 
 ""If the dollar continues to weaken, then it's only likely to boost gold as
well as silver as the inverse relationship between the two assets persists. I
would say that for gold I am still looking for it to hit $1,600 this year,"" said
Ong Yi Ling, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore. 
 ""In the long term, I think, if we see silver prices at such a high level,
then it could hurt the industrial demand."" 
 But dealers said strong investment demand for silver would keep the metal at
record levels, while a lack of scrap sales in the physical market suggested that
investors expected more gains. Year to date, silver was up almost 60 percent,
sharply above gold's 8 percent gain.	
 
 
 
 A bullish target at $1,549 per ounce is still intact for spot gold ,
based on its wave pattern and a Fibonacci projection analysis, according to Wan
Tao, who is a Reuters market analyst for commodities and energy technicals.	
 ""There's some selling but I would say it's very light,"" said a dealer in
Singapore, who trades gold and silver. ""It had been a very busy week, and I am
glad today is Friday. It's all quiet, finally."" 
 The CME Group Inc , parent of the Chicago Board of Trade, said on
Thursday it would raise maintenance margins for COMEX 5000 Silver <0#SI:>
futures by 13.2 percent, making it more expensive for silver speculators to
trade in. [ID:nL3E7FS62K]	
 Soaring prices hurt the bottom line of certain manufacturers, including
photography company Eastman Kodak , which said on Thursday a hike in raw
material costs, particularly silver, led to a decrease in its film business
revenue. [ID:nN28229826]	
 Trading was subdued in Asia, with Japanese financial markets shut for a
public holiday. UK markets will be closed for the royal wedding. Premiums for
gold bars were steady in Hong Kong and Singapore. 
 The dollar index , which tracks the currency's performance against a
basket of major currencies, was down 0.1 percent at 73.030, having plumbed a
three-year low of 72.871 on Thursday. It is down around 1.4 percent so far this
week, on track for its biggest weekly drop since a 2.5 percent fall in the week
to Jan. 16. 
 Sentiment for the dollar took a hit this week after the Federal Reserve said
it was in no hurry to tighten its ultra-loose monetary policy, a move that gave
investors the green light to keep using the dollar as a funding currency to buy
higher-yielding assets. 
 ""It all depends on the U.S. dollar, but I would say we only see a small
amount of selling in the physical market,"" said a dealer in Hong Kong. 
 In the energy market, crude fell on Friday, after settling at a 31-month
high in the previous session, on concerns that slowing growth in top consumer
United States may pare demand, but a weaker dollar and unrest in the Middle East
helped stem a slide in prices.

 * Plains rain weighs on wheat futures
 * Soybeans lower, following weakness in corn markets
 * Coming up: First notice day for CBOT contracts
(Updates with closing prices, adds new analyst quote, details
on fund selling)
 By Mark Weinraub
 CHICAGO, April 28 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures plunged to
their lowest level in nearly a month on Thursday amid the
biggest fund liquidation this year as a resumption in planting
in western stretches of the Corn Belt alleviated concerns about
supply, traders said.
 Corn fields in parts of north-central Iowa proved drier
than expected, allowing farmers to get back on their tractors
as much as a week earlier than forecast.
 ""The longs have been looking for an excuse to take some
profits,"" said Bob Utterback of Utterback Marketing Services, a
brokerage for farmers.
 CBOT May corn settled down 29-1/4 cents at $7.23 a bushel.
The more heavily traded July corn contract ended down 30 cents,
the daily trading limit, at $7.29-1/4. 
 Beneficial weather for crops also weighed on wheat prices,
which were down for the third straight day. In this case, rain
in key growing areas of the U.S. Plains provided some relief
for the drought-stressed crop, traders said.
 CBOT May wheat was down 34 cents at $7.43 a bushel and has
fallen 10 percent during its three-day losing streak.
 The drop in corn weighed on soybean prices, which reversed
early gains. CBOT May soybeans settled down 27-3/4 cents at
$13.50-1/4 a bushel. 
 ""The biggest factor is commodity funds' wide sell-off in
all the grains,"" said Brian Hoops, president of Midwest Market
Solutions, a brokerage and commodity marketing advisory
service. ""I think it is a combination of the end-of-the-month
selling, along with improving weather (that led to the
declines).""
 Funds sold an estimated net 40,000 corn contracts on
Thursday, according to trading sources on the floor of the
Chicago Board of Trade. That matches the heaviest daily total
of the year. Funds also sold 40,000 contracts on March 15.
 Talk of a large investment fund taking big positions out of
commodities markets helped spark the broad sell-off in
agricultural futures.
 OPEN INTEREST DECLINES
 ""Investors are shifting their money, reducing some of their
exposure to risk,"" said Shawn McCambridge, grains analyst with
Prudential Bache Commodities.
 Traders noted long liquidation as investors exited
positions ahead of first notice day for deliveries on Friday.
 Open interest in CBOT corn fell by 40,125 contracts
Wednesday, the biggest one-day drop since late February,
according to data from the CME Group.
 Trading volume was heavy, with about 560,000 corn contracts
changing hands, the most since February. Soybeans and wheat
also surpassed their 30-day averages.
 ""We are starting to see a little bit of leakage of the
weather-related risk premiums,"" said Karl Setzer, market
analyst with MaxYield Cooperative.
 Rainfall in the Plains this week boosted confidence about
health of the hard red winter wheat crop in Kansas, the top
wheat-producing state. The forecast calls for more storms this
weekend.
 U.S. wheat futures faced more pressure as Ukraine's
Agriculture Ministry boosted its 2011 grain harvest estimate
and forecast a jump in exports. A devastating drought in the
Black Sea region during 2010 decimated the crop there and
raised the profile of U.S. wheat on the world market.

 By Martin Roberts and Naveen Thukral
 MADRID/SINGAPORE, April 28 (Reuters) - U.S. corn and soybean
futures firmed on Thursday as part of a broad-based commodities
rally driven by a sharply weaker dollar, while wheat extended
previous falls on good weather and supply prospects.
 The outlook for U.S. grain exports improved as the dollar
tumbled to a three-year low after Federal Reserve Chief Ben
Bernanke gave no sign on Wednesday that the central bank was
about to tighten monetary policy.
 Chicago Board of Trade actively traded July corn gained 0.6
percent to $7.63½ a bushel by 1222 GMT and soybeans for July
rose 0.6 percent to 13.93¾ a bushel. 
 July wheat fell 0.4 percent to $8.08¾ a bushel, adding to a
4.2-percent drop on Wednesday prompted by forecasts of rain
needed to help the developing hard red winter wheat crop in
Kansas.
 There was additional support for the corn market stemming
from tight global supplies and planting delays for the U.S.
new-crop, analysts said.
 ""We are getting planting delays and the balance sheet even
for the next season looks pretty tight,"" said Abah Ofon, an
analyst with Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore.
 ""Yields could come down because of delays. There is upside
for corn against the backdrop of tight stocks as any adverse
incident is going to push prices higher.""
 There are worries that wet weather in the U.S. Midwest would
delay corn planting at a time when U.S. supplies are the
tightest since the 1930s.
 The U.S. Agriculture Department said on Monday that just 9
percent of intended corn acreage had been seeded as of April 24.
A year ago, corn planting was 46 percent complete and the
five-year average for late April is 23 percent.
 Commodity funds were net sellers of an estimated 15,000
contracts of CBOT corn on Wednesday, trade sources said. They
were net sellers of an estimated 6,000 each of wheat and soybean
contracts.
 
 WHEAT
 Forecasts of improved weather and higher supplies continued
to hammer the wheat market, taking losses sustained over three
days to more than 6 percent, the biggest decline in about two
weeks.
 While fundamentals are bullish for corn, wheat is coming
under pressure with prospects of higher supplies from the Black
Sea region and improved weather forecasts in the United States.
 Kazakhstan wheat output is seen rebounding to 14.5 million
tonnes in 2011 from the drought affected 9.7 million last year
and wheat exports are forecast at 7 million tonnes, an increase
of 2 million from last year.
 ""If you look at the big picture it is one of increasing
supplies,"" Ofon said. ""As we head into the rest of the season,
the market should decline much more sharply than what we have
seen in the last few sessions.""
 Wheat prices in Europe's biggest exporter, France, fell in
line with Chicago and a strong euro made exports from the common
currency zone less competitive on world markets.
 New crop November milling wheat was down 2.50 euros on the
Euronext exchange in Paris, or 1.14 percent, at 217.50 euros
($322.7) a tonne by 1224 GMT, adding to a 4-percent drop on
Wednesday.
 ""In terms of weather market it looks like the situation is
improving. It is raining in the U.S., in China and in Germany,""
a trader said in France.

 By Marcy Nicholson and David Brough
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - ICE arabica coffee
futures shot up above $3 per lb to a 34-year high in thin
dealings on Thursday, bolstered by investor buying as the
dollar sank to a three-year low.
 Raw sugar sank to a 6-1/2-month low, pressured by ample
supplies from Brazil and Thailand, while cocoa surged in heavy
volume as options-related dealings forced shorts to scramble
for cover.
 Liffe's London-based commodity markets are shut on Friday
and Monday due to U.K. public holidays, reopening on Tuesday.
 The dollar index, a measure of the greenback's strength
against a basket of major currencies, fell to a 3-year low
after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it will not reverse low
interest rates to support economic recovery.
 The key July arabica coffee futures surged to a new high of
$3.0340 per lb, buoyed by the weak dollar, tight supplies of
high-quality beans and strong charts.
 ""The weaker dollar -- if it is sustainable -- will help
matters from a speculator's viewpoint,"" said Kona Haque, soft
commodity strategist at Macquarie Bank in London.
 She noted a lack of origin selling and said that if dollar
weakness persisted, the market had room to go higher with a key
near-term resistance level of $3.05 per lb.
 ""I suspect the $3.05 level is as far as it's going to get
before it starts falling,"" Haque said.
 ICE July arabica coffee futures were well off their highs
and up 2.35 cents to $2.9875 per lb at 1546 GMT. Liffe July
robustas gained $18 at $2,554 a tonne at 1546 GMT, having
earlier hit a contract high of $2,572.
 Raw sugar futures on ICE tumbled, weighed by expectations
of ample production of the sweetener from Brazil and Thailand
and the possibility of further unrestricted exports by India.
 India has approved around 30,000 tonnes of unrestricted
sugar exports, kicking off overseas sales of a total 500,000
tonnes given an official green light on April 19, government
sources said on Thursday.
 Dealers focused on the expiry of the ICE May raw sugar
futures contract on Friday and anticipated delivery of
predominantly Thai raws after larger-than-expected output in
the Asian country.
 ICE May raw sugar futures fell 0.64 cent or 2.6 percent to
23.91 cents a lb at 1547 GMT. Open interest fell to 30,314 lots
on April 27, the equivalent of 1.54 million tonnes of sugar and
down roughly 20,000 lots from the previous day.
 Key July dropped 0.54 cent to 22.42 cents per lb, hitting a
6-1/2-month low at 21.94.
 ""The sugar market's going down on momentum,"" the New York
dealer said, adding demand was lower than expected.
 London August white sugar fell $11.50 or 1.8 percent to
$615 per tonne.
 Cocoa futures surged for the second straight day, boosted
by the softer dollar, with the focus on Ivory Coast as dealers
awaited news about the mid crop and the resumption of exports.
 On ICE, delta buying in options forced heavy short-covering
on the futures market, dealers said.
 ""There are lots of options open at $3,300 and I think a
very complacent trade, all short, found themselves scrambling,""
one veteran cocoa dealer said. ""Also, I think there is some
element of cocoa and coffee as safe havens from the volatility
in sugar and cotton.""
 ICE second-month July cocoa futures surged $111 or 3.5
percent to $3,279 per tonne at 1548 GMT. Total volume jumped
above 20,000 lots, the highest in two weeks with two more hours
of trade still remaining.
 Liffe July cocoa jumped 50 pounds or 2.6 percent to 1,977
pounds per tonne.

 By Chris Kelly and Melanie Burton
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Copper erased earlier
gains to end easier on Thursday, influenced by slowing economic
conditions in the U.S. that underscored the bearish sentiment
surrounding demand prospects at the start of the year.
 Copper's mildly negative tone came after U.S. gross
domestic product for the first quarter slowed to a 1.8 percent
annual pace.
 ""Copper at the moment seems to be focusing on the potential
slowing economic conditions in the U.S.,"" said Frank Lesh,
broker and futures analyst with Future Path Trading in Chicago.
The number is ""certainly affecting market psychology.""
 London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark copper eased $1 to
close at $9,320 a tonne. In New York, prices recovered from the
late sell-off in London to end firm, with the most-active July
COMEX copper contract rising 1.50 cents at $4.2615 per lb.
 Still, prices are down more than 8 percent from February's
record highs of $10,190 a tonne and $4.6535 per lb.
 The negative close came a day after the U.S. Federal
Reserve said it would complete its $600 billion bond-buying
program in June and signaled it was in no rush to scale back
its support for the world's largest economy.
 Volumes slowed at the end of a holiday-shortened week in
London, with the London Metal Exchange (LME) set to close its
doors Friday for a royal wedding and again on Monday for a bank
holiday.
 ""Copper is having a hard time being pushed about the
place,"" said Danske Bank analyst Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, adding
players ""are a bit worried at signs that the global recovery
indicators are pointing down.""
 Adding to the economic jitters, U.S. claims for
unemployment benefits jumped to their highest level since
January.
 The U.S. dollar extended losses against the euro and the
yen after the GDP and jobless figures. A softer dollar makes
metals cheaper for holders of other currencies.
 ""Copper is struggling a bit, but each time we get to the
end of the quarter and the mining companies release their
production results, then copper seems to get a bit of a lift
because everyone remembers that there are supply problems,""
said analyst David Wilson of Societe Generale.
 BHP Billiton is ploughing $554 million into boosting output
at Chile's Escondida, the world's No. 1 copper mine, where
output has dwindled in recent years due to declining ore
grades.
 Chile, which holds the world's top copper reserves and is
the No.1 producer, is expected to steadily increase output in
the next two years with new mine projects and upgrades,
although its output fell 0.1 percent in March.
 COPPER STOCKS RISING
 LME copper stocks rose 150 tonnes to 463,650 tonnes, their
highest since mid-June, the latest data showed. The inventories
have climbed by a third since mid-December.
 ""The steady rise in copper, zinc and lead inventories is a
prime cause for concern,"" Commerzbank said in a note. ""If the
increase in stocks is not halted soon, the upbeat view taken so
far of this year's copper market balance -- a large shortfall
in supplies -- may have to be revised, with the corresponding
adverse impact on prices.""
 LME zinc stocks have jumped by nearly 30,000 tonnes this
month.
 Zinc closed up $7 at $2,247 a tonne. Aluminium ended at
$2,767 a tonne from a bid of $2,743.50 on Wednesday. Earlier,
it touched $2,778.80, its highest since August 2008 on
prospects that rising power prices will push up input costs for
the energy intensive metal.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, April 28 (Reuters) - Silver soared to an all-time
high on Thursday and gold rose to another record, as the dollar
fell and as signs that the Federal Reserve would maintain a
loose monetary policy stoked inflation worries.
 Silver briefly climbed to within a whisker of $50 an ounce,
eclipsing the peak hit when Texan brothers William Herbert and
Nelson Bunker Hunt sought to corner the silver market three
decades ago. The metal later pulled back on technical selling.
 Option traders reported strong buying of long-dated
in-the-money silver calls, indicating bullish investor
expectations. Also, the value of gold in terms of silver fell
to less than 32 ounces on Thursday, the lowest on record,
according to Reuters data dating back to 1982.
 ""I don't think the market has topped out. While there are
some inflation concerns similar to what we had back in 1980,
the reality is that metals are going up as an alternative asset
featuring gold, and by proxy silver,"" said Bill O'Neill,
partner at commodities firm LOGIC Advisors.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 Spot silver , which has rocketed nearly 60 percent so
far this year, rose 1.6 percent to $48.53 an ounce by 3:29 p.m.
EDT (1929 GMT), having earlier hit a record $49.51 an ounce,
surpassing a peak of $49.48 on Jan. 18, 1980 set during the
Hunt brothers era.
 A U.S. jury found that the Hunt brothers conspired to
manipulate the prices of silver in 1979-80. During that time
the price of U.S. silver futures soared from below $11 an ounce
to a record $50.35, then tumbled back to around $11.
 Soaring prices hurt the bottom line of certain
manufacturers, including photography company Eastman Kodak
, which said on Thursday a hike in raw material costs,
particularly silver, led to a decrease in its film business
revenue. [ID:nN28229826]
 ""We are indexing our contracts, we are hedging, and we are
moving as fast as we can with the part of the portfolio that is
not silver-dependent,"" Chief Executive Antonio Perez told
analysts, explaining its strategy to manage prices.
 Despite a continued decline in the film photography sector,
which used to be a major silver buyer, industry typically
consumes half of the global supply of the metal.
 U.S. GROWTH SLOWS, INFLATION RISES
 Spot gold  rose to a lifetime high of $1,538.35 an
ounce, breaking records for the ninth time in 10 sessions. It
was later up 0.6 percent at $1,535.60 an ounce. U.S. June gold
futures  settled up 0.9 percent at $1,531.20.
 Precious metals rose after data showed U.S. economic growth
braked sharply in the first quarter as higher food and gasoline
prices dampened consumer spending, sending inflation rising at
its fastest pace in 2-1/2 years. [ID:nCAT005418]
 Adjusted for inflation, however, the current price of
silver is about two-thirds below its record at over $130 an
ounce, while gold was only a third below a peak of $2,200. Both
records were set in 1980.
 Silver has surged 11 percent in just the last two days,
even after Monday's technical failure that almost sent prices
toward $50 before pulling back sharply.
 Year to date, silver was up almost 60 percent, currently
the best-performing commodity, sharply above gold's 8 percent
gain.
 SILVER OPTIONS SEEN BULLISH
 On the silver options front, heavy buying of call options
indicated investors continued to bet silver prices would rise
further.
 ""I am seeing all types of bullish call buying. They are in
the money and far out, including December, March and September
calls,"" said COMEX options floor trader Dominick Cognata. ""They
are looking to buy cheap call spreads because this thing looks
like it may shoot up to to $70 or $80.""
 Gold and silver's rally was supported by follow-up buying
after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled on
Wednesday that the U.S. central bank is in no rush to scale
back its support for the economy. [ID:nN26291565]
 ""The metal markets are recognizing that (Fed policy) and it
is being priced in. What monetization means is that, down the
road, we will have more inflation,"" said Robert Lutts, chief
investment officer of Cabot Money Management, which oversees
more than $500 million in client assets.

 Physical gold buying was seen active in Asia, but scrap
selling was limited, as market participants remained bullish
even after gold has struck record highs in nine of the past ten
sessions, dealers said.	
 ""Gold is still bullish, with the second round of
quantitative easing to be completed on schedule and interest
rates to stay low until at least the end of the year,"" said a
Hong Kong-based dealer. 
 ""Unless we see the job market turn around quickly, interest
rates will stay low for a long time.""	
 A rally of more than 50 percent in silver prices, compared
with a rise of 8 percent in gold this year, has attracted swarms
of investors, who expect silver's dual nature as both
industrial and precious metal to help drive its returns.	
 Spot silver rose by 0.7 percent to $48.07 an ounce,
extending a rally of 6 percent in the previous session. It hit a
31-year high of $49.31 on Monday.	
 U.S. silver futures  jumped as much as 6 percent to
$48.75 in early trade, following a climb of up to 7 percent on
Wednesday. It was trading at $48.04 by 0551 GMT.	
 As silver prices advanced, holdings in the iShares Silver
Trust , the world's largest silver-backed exchange-traded
fund, dipped 1.8 percent to 11,053.20 by April 27, from the
previous session.	
 Gold and silver may both see more upside, but the risk of a
pullback in silver is greater than for gold due to the more
speculative nature of the silver market, traders said.

 * Copper inventories hit 10-month highs
(Recasts and updates with U.S. market activity and prices,
changes dateline to NEW YORK, previously LONDON)
 By Barani Krishnan
 NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - Copper slumped on Wednesday on
nagging doubts over the U.S. economy and fears about tighter
policy in China, but ended off the lows after the U.S. Federal
Reserve gave no indication it was in a rush to raise rates.
 Talk of another round of monetary tightening by China hit
sentiment early in the session. Prices failed to recover losses
even after the dollar slumped as Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke
signaled
he would likely keep U.S. interest rates exceptionally low for an
extended period..
 Earlier, data showing new orders for long-lasting U.S.
manufactured goods rose more than expected in March and bookings
for the prior month were much stronger than initially thought
failed to offset the gloom of a market enduring one of its weakest
seasonal demand periods, analysts said.
 Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange closed down
$224, or 2.2 percent, at $9,321 after stockpiles of the metal at
warehouses monitored by the LME hit 10-month highs. It's down four
percent over the past two sessions, the biggest such loss in a
month hand a half.
 In New York, U.S. copper futures for May delivery on COMEX
settled down 9.10 cents, or 2.1 percent, at $4.2280, but later
pared losses to trade at around $4.2575.
 Investors' concerns on Wednesday centered on a portion of the
Fed statement which said the economic recovery was proceeding at a
moderate pace and was not strong enough to justify raising rates
in the interim period.
 Bernanke reiterated the central bank's stance in its first
post-meeting news conference, during which the dollar fell to a
near record low against a basket of major currencies
 ""The Fed left a bad taste in everyone's mouth about the state
of the economy,"" said Matthew Zeman, head of trading with
Kingsview Financial in Chicago.
 CHINA RATES
 Talk was also swirling that No. 1 copper importer China may
embark on another monetary tightening by the end of this week that
could further hit sentiment in the metal.
 ""It's a cumulative worry that's pulling copper down, if you
consider that people are thinking what the forthcoming U.S. GDP
numbers would be from here and what the Chinese could also do by
the end of this week,"" Sterling Smith, analyst at Country Hedging
Inc. in St. Paul, Minnesota, said.
 ""Also, there's a saying in the copper market about demand
around this time of the year: 'Sell in May and go away.' We are,
in fact, very close to May,"" Smith said.
 LME copper inventories rose 3,400 tonnes to 463,500 tonnes by
the close of Tuesday's business, touching their highest levels
since mid-June last year and after rising in 13 of the last 15
sessions.
 Aluminum, untraded at the close, was bid at $2,743.50 from a
close of $2,747 on Tuesday.
 Key Chinese industrial provinces have been hit by power
shortages which have threatened to shut some small aluminum
smelters, and larger ones face lower prices. Aluminum is one of
the most energy-intensive metals to produce.
 China, the world's biggest market and maker for aluminum and
lead, normally hits peak electricity demand in the summer and can
often face shortages, leading to supply cuts for intensive energy
users.
 Zinc, used in galvanizing, closed at $2,240 from $2,260 at the
close on Tuesday.
 ""Zinc's relative underperformance is in keeping with its
weaker fundamentals ... with LME and SHFE stocks continuing to
rise ...the global market in surplus and output growing strongly,""
Barcap added.
 Tin, untraded at the close, was bid at $31,995 while battery
material lead ended at $2,498 from $2,558. Three-month nickel
finished at $26,630 from $26,650.

 * Coming Up: Weekly USDA export sales report on Thursday

 By Mark Weinraub
 CHICAGO, April 27 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat and corn futures
fell sharply on Wednesday as updated forecasts for improved
weather in key U.S. growing areas prompted investors to reduce
premiums in those markets.
 Calls for rain needed to help the developing hard red
winter wheat crop in Kansas pushed wheat futures down 4.2
percent, their biggest drop in two weeks.
 Corn futures fell on expectations for dry weather west of
the Mississippi River that will allow farmers there to renew
delayed planting activities.
 ""Both markets are trading at very high levels and it looks
to me like we may need to see some consolidation before we can
make the next move higher from here,"" said Doug Bergman, grain
broker with MF. ""Obviously, we have some problems with weather
here in the United States but one small change in one area can
make a big difference.""
 Soybean futures also closed lower, but the decline was
limited by support from a firm crude oil market and a weakening
dollar.
 CBOT May soft red winter wheat settled down 34-1/4 cents at
$7.77 a bushel. Wheat prices closed below key support at their
100-day moving average.
 CBOT May corn was down 14 cents at $7.52-1/4 a bushel. CBOT
May soybeans were 4-3/4 cents lower at $13.78 a bushel.
 WHEAT DECLINE STARTED OVERNIGHT
 Wheat prices have dropped 6.1 percent in two days.
 ""The perception of weather certainly has improved a bit for
wheat,"" said Dan Kuechenmeister, manager of the commodities
department at RBC Dain Rauscher. ""There is a little bit better
chance of rain, maybe some cooler temperatures, which is
certainly welcome news.""
 Some rainstorms hit southern areas of Kansas on Tuesday
night, and there were calls for more precipitation in
drought-stressed areas of the U.S. Plains during the next few
days, said Mike Palmerino, forecaster for Telvent DTN.
 ""It is not going to cure the problem ... but it will
certainly help,"" Palmerino said. ""There is reason to be a
little more optimistic here that we may see a little
improvement in the overall crop conditions.""
 European benchmark wheat futures in Paris fell as the
prospect of rain in key wheat producers Germany and France
helped ease drought worries while a new rise in the euro made
European grains less attractive on world markets.
 Canada's farmers intend to plant more canola, all-wheat and
oats than the trade expected, according to Statistics Canada's
first report on 2011 crop plans, but wet farms have left
seeding plans in doubt.

 * Robusta coffee rises, discount to arabicas very wide
 * Liffe cocoa falls as sterling gains against dollar
(Updates prices)
 By Marcy Nicholson and Nigel Hunt
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 27 (Reuters) - Raw sugar futures
closed lower on Wednesday with the market sliding back towards
a six-month low set early last week, weighed by an improving
supply outlook.
 Trade sources cited stronger-than-expected sugar production
in top grower Brazil and No. 2 exporter Thailand as well as the
prospect of further unrestricted exports from India.
 Arabica coffee futures reversed to close up a shade in
choppy and light dealings, remaining close to a 34-year top set
a week ago. Cocoa jumped as the pound rallied and players
awaited developments on further shipments and the mid-crop in
top grower Ivory Coast.
 May raws on ICE fell 0.39 cent or 1.6 percent to close at
24.55 cents a lb, just up from its six-month low of 24.00 cents
hit early last week. July dropped 0.28 cent to end at 22.96
cents.
 A sharp rise in output in Thailand had weighed on cash
premiums and could lead to the delivery of Thai raws against
the May raw sugar contract on ICE which expires Friday, dealers
said.
 Open interest in the May contract was above 50,000 lots by
April 26. Uncertainty about the quality of Thai raws could
weigh on nearby premiums, dealers said.
 ""With the open interest where it is right now it looks like
someone's going to stop New York,"" said Nick Gentile, head of
trading at Atlantic Capital Advisors in New Jersey.
 ""I'm assuming they have a home for it if they're willing to
take it out of the market place, just in case there could be
some sort of weather event or if we have another backlog of
ships in Brazil,"" he added.
 Raw sugar prices have now fallen by nearly a third after
setting a 30-year high of 36.08 cents on February 2.
 London August white sugar futures dropped $6.60 to settle
at $626.50 per tonne.
 CHOPPY COFFEE
 Arabica coffee turned higher on the heels of the commodity
complex after the Federal Reserve said it will keep the U.S.
interest rate at exceptionally low levels. Tight supplies of
high quality beans remained a background supportive factor.
 Dealers said fund and investors were increasingly
dominating the market with trade participation on the wane,
while roasters were waiting around $2.80.
 ICE July arabica coffee erased early losses to close up
0.10 cent at $2.9640 per lb, still within striking distance of
the 34-year high of $3.0250 touched on April 20.
 Robusta coffee futures on Liffe were higher, hitting a
contract high for the second straight day, and finally gaining
some ground on the arabica market following a prolonged decline
in its relative value.
<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 July robusta coffee futures rose $34 to finish at $2,536 a
tonne after earlier hitting $2,555, the highest level for the
second month since the end of March.
 Cocoa futures on ICE climbed on the strong sterling against
the U.S. dollar and jumped $92 within a minute, taking it
through the 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level. July
gained $75 or 2.4 percent to finish at $3,168 a tonne.
 Prices on Liffe reversed with July finished up 20 pounds at

 By David Sheppard 
 NEW YORK, April 27 (Reuters) - Gold rose to a record high
of almost $1,530 an ounce on Wednesday and silver jumped 6
percent after the Chairman of the Federal Reserve gave no signs
that the central bank would tighten monetary policy, leading
the dollar to a three-year low. 
 It was the eighth record high in nine trading sessions for
the gold, extending a rally that has seen the precious metal
rise by more than $50 an ounce since April 15 and by
more than $200 since the end of January. 
 Spot gold rose more than 1.5 percent to touch a
record $1,529.90 an ounce after the Fed said it would end its
$600 billion bond buying stimulus program in June as planned,
and Chairman Ben Bernanke said he was in no rush to raise to
raise short-term interest rates. Lower interest rates tend to
fuel commodity prices, driving investors into riskier assets
and pushing up prices. 
 ""There was a contingent out there that believed there might
be a hawkish expression in the statement and we didn't see that
and I think gold moved up on that,"" said Bart Melek, director
of commodities with TD Bank Financial Group. 
 Spot gold was last up 1.3 percent at $1,526.91 an ounce by
4:17 p.m. EDT (2017 GMT), easing slightly from the earlier
record. U.S. futures for June delivery were last up 1.6
percent at $1,526.90 in after-hours trade, having also touched
a record of $1,530.70 an ounce. The official settlement for
Wednesday was $1,517.10 an ounce, up $13.60. 
 James Steel, metals analyst and Senior Vice President at
HSBC in New York said the Fed's post-meeting statement had ""put
the nail in the coffin"" of the idea that the Fed could tighten
monetary policy faster than the market had previously thought. 
 ""There will be no speed about reversing policy. Their
accommodative policy has been ascribed in part to concerns
about higher inflation and also have pumped up commodity demand
abroad,"" Steel said. ""Both of those things are good for gold."" 
 Bernanke, speaking at the central bank's first
post-decision news conference, said he expected a relatively
weak number for U.S. GDP in the first quarter, and it would be
at least two more meetings before the Fed considered raising
rates. 
 The dollar fell to a three-year low against a basket of
currencies as Bernanke was speaking. The euro rose
versus the dollar to almost $1.49, the highest level since
December 2009. 
 Credit Suisse analyst Tom Kendall said the weak dollar and
other drivers for the gold price remained in place. 
 ""It is the dollar, it is sovereign debt, whether that is
the U.S. or the periphery of Europe. It is headline rates of
inflation in emerging markets and developed markets and it is a
bit of geopolitical uncertainty."" 
 Spot silver jumped by as much as 6 percent to an
intraday high of $48.24 an ounce but was still below the
31-year peak of $49.31 hit on Monday. It remains on track for a
25-percent gain this month and a near 50-percent rise this
year, which would make it the top performing precious metal and
commodity of 2011. 
 Spot silver was up 5.5 percent at $47.98 an ounce, while
U.S. silver was last up 6.4 percent -- posting its
largest percentage gain this year -- at $47.95 in after-hours
trade. The official settlement earlier was $45.9580 an ounce,
up 90.80 cents. 
 Implied volatility in silver options has been at its
highest this week since November last year as the spot price
has swung from lows around $43 to highs above $49 in the space
of a week. 
 ""The recent sharp increase in volatility is an indication
of the increasing nervousness of market players and could be a
sign that the rally in the silver price is approaching an end,""
said Commerzbank in a note. 
 Platinum was last up 1.5 percent at $1,827.50 an
ounce, while palladium was up 2 percent at $768.00.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, April 27 (Reuters) - - Silver rebounded on
Wednesday from sharp falls in the previous session and gold
inched upwards as investors cautiously awaited the conclusion of
the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting while feeble sentiment
in the dollar lent support. 
 The Fed will probably show no hurry to scale back its
massive support for the economic recovery, but investors are
watching for clues to monetary policy direction from a news
briefing by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke after the meeting.
[ID:nN26273939]	
 The dollar could come under further pressure if the central
bank retained its low interest rates and dovish tone, in
contrast to the European Central Bank, which has hiked rates and
looked poised to deliver more to curb inflation. 
 ""The market is a bit mixed ahead of the Fed meeting, which
will influence the move of the dollar and precious metals,"" said
Peter Fung, head of dealing at Wing Fung Precious Metals based
in Hong Kong.	
 Gold is likely to trade in the range of $1,500 and $1,510
before making a decisive move, Fung said.	
 Spot gold gained 0.5 percent to $1,508.59 an ounce by
0559 GMT. It hit a lifetime high of $1,518.10 on Monday. U.S.
gold futures  inched up 0.4 percent to $1,509.10.	
 Technical analysis suggested that spot gold might head down
towards $1,477, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.
[ID:nL3E7FR03Y]	
 
 SILVER REBOUNDS; PHYSICAL INTEREST REMAINS STRONG	
 Silver, the superstar commodity of the year, rebounded from
its tumble on Tuesday following Monday's rally to near record
levels, with strong support at the $45 level, dealers said.	
 Prices of silver have climbed about 49 percent so far this
year, outpacing gold's 6 percent gain. 
 Spot silver bounced 0.9 percent to $45.88 from a 3
percent dip in the previous session, its biggest one-day loss in
six weeks. 
 U.S. silver  rose as much as 2.6 percent to $46.22,
before easing to $45.88, up 1.8 percent from the previous close.	
 Strong physical demand in Asia helped support the sentiment
in silver.	
 ""I haven't seen much demand for gold or silver from India
until recently, probably triggered by rapidly rising prices,""
said a Singapore-based dealer.	
 MMTC, India's largest bullion importer, plans to double its
silver purchases this fiscal year to 1,500 tonnes, to catch up
with exploding investment interest. [ID:nL3E7FQ05U]	
 The strength in silver prices may sustain, as the metal is
expected to benefit from increasing industrial demand in tandem

 By Carole Vaporean
 NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Copper fell in London on Tuesday, catching
up after a long holiday to steep losses in Asian and U.S. markets, but COMEX
copper ended slightly higher as investors sought bargains at the lows.
 Analysts expected any gains in copper to be limited ahead of the Federal
Reserve's policy announcement and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's press conference
due on Wednesday.
 ""We're bringing some bargain hunting in here. We had beaten up copper,
probably excessively, yesterday. That is making prices attractive to buyers,""
said Sterling Smith, an analyst for Country Hedging Inc. in St. Paul,
Minnesota.
 On Wednesday, Fed officials continue their two-day policy meeting. The Fed
seems certain to stick to its plan to complete a $600 billion bond-buying
program in June, and is unlikely to raise interest rates given an uncertain
U.S. economic outlook.
 Investors in many markets have been on edge and on the sidelines ahead of
Bernanke's press conference, which will be the first ever for a Fed chairman in
the central bank's 97-year history.
 ""I think there's plenty of nervousness in the market and any upside
activity is going to be tempered,"" Smith said. But he said Bernanke's remarks
would probably be restrained.
 ""Mr Bernanke will probably not be saying anything too dramatic. For a first
go, he simply wants it to happen without any errors, glitches or sudden
surprises,"" said Smith.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange ended at $9,545, from
$9,700 a tonne when the market closed on Thursday before the long Easter
weekend began last Friday.
 The metal used in power and construction pared losses, however, from a
session trough below $9,400 a tonne.
 London prices were also weighed down by concerns that rising energy costs
could hinder global growth prospects.
 ""It's clear that inflation that is coming alongside higher energy prices is
not good for base metals. It's expected to accompany further tightening
measures, particularly in the developing world, which will be damaging for
demand,"" analyst Nic Brown of Natixis said.
 In New York, COMEX prices edged higher after the sharp declines on Monday.
COMEX benchmark May copper finished 1.60 cents higher at $4.3190 per lb. Many
players have been rolling into the July contract, with expiration for May just
a month away. July futures also settled 1.60 cents higher at $4.3395.
 Boosting New York copper prices, the dollar declined to a 16-month low
against the euro. Dollar-denominated assets like copper benefit in overseas
markets from the dollar's depreciation. The dollar has dropped on the view that
the Fed will be slower to raise interest rates than other major central banks.
 On Wall Street, the S&P 500 stock index rallied to its highest level since
June 2008 as a flood of positive corporate results added to economic growth
optimism. This also supported industrial metals.
 Metals market investors are not expected to make any aggressive moves
before the long holiday weekend coming up for China's labor day on May 2. Some
participants fear China's central bank may tighten monetary policy, noting that
it has made policy adjustments on previous weekends.
 Tighter policy in China, the world's top consumer, could damage copper's
demand outlook.
 INVENTORIES AND OTHER METALS
 Copper stocks continued their counter-cyclical uptrend this quarter,
pointing to still limp demand reinforced by trade data from China.
 Copper inventories grew by almost 4,000 tonnes to more than 460,000 tonnes,
the latest data showed, and were at their highest levels since mid-June last
year.
 Data also showed China's refined copper imports fell 43 percent in March
from March 2010, due to high stocks and strong international prices.
 Zinc ended at $2,260 from Thursday's $2,360 close. Technical selling was
likely triggered after a breach of the 200-day moving average at $2,290, a key
level eyed by funds.
 Aluminium was $2,747 from $2,745 near last week's 2.5 year summit at $2,757
a tonne.
 Tin ended at $32,700.
 China raised the bar for polluters in a plan that included restricting new
projects for mining tin, tungsten, molybdenum, antimony and rare earths.
 Battery material lead ended at $2,558 from $2,601 and nickel was last seen
at $26,650 from $26,900.

 * Arabicas underpinned by shortage of high-quality beans
 * Cocoa trade tracks progress of West African mid crops
(Recasts, adds byline, dateline, was NEW YORK. Adds analyst

 By Marcy Nicholson and David Brough
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - ICE arabica coffee
futures climbed on Tuesday, erasing early losses and getting
close to last week's 34-year peak as commercials nibbled and
concerns about supplies for high-quality beans lured investor
buying.
 Robusta coffee on Liffe tracked arabica's move and hit a
contract high in its most volatile session in more than two
years as dealers focused on the May/July spread after the spot
contract spent two weeks at a steep premium.
 Raw sugar was mixed in choppy dealings as the market
focused on the May contract expiry on Friday.
 Cocoa inched up in rangebound dealings as dealers awaited
news on the condition of the mid crops in the key producing
region of West Africa and tracked the slow resumption of
exports after a civil war in top grower Ivory Coast.
 Arabica futures turned higher in light volume after testing
lower levels where roaster buying provided a lift. The
greenback fell and helped lift coffee prices, dealers said.
 ""Overall, the market is still in an uptrend mode and we
have been finding very little selling out of origin,"" said
Rodrigo Costa, vice-president of Institutional Sales for
Newedge USA.
 ICE July arabica coffee reversed early losses and climbed
6.55 cents or 2.3 percent to $2.9735 per lb at 1659 GMT, near
the 34-year high of $3.0250 hit on April 20.
 ""It's more about the spec flow. They liquidate, they buy it
back,"" Costa said, referring to Monday's lower dealings.
 The International Coffee Organization has estimated coffee
stocks in producing countries at the beginning of the 2010/11
crop year were at the lowest level since it began keeping
records in 1965.
 Robusta coffee futures surged to a four-week top, trading
in an exceptionally wide $190 range in heavy volume after the
Easter holiday break.
 Dealers said the market continued to keep a close watch on
the May/July spread with the open interest on the front month
still at a comparatively high 27,602 lots one week before first
notice day.
 The spread, which was trading at a backwardation of more
than $100 earlier this month, has now moved to a contango of
around $40, lessening concern about a potential squeeze.
 Liffe July robustas closed $67 firmer at $2,502 a tonne.
 Cocoa futures edged up in light volumes, with the focus on
top producer Ivory Coast as dealers monitored the West African
mid crops, which saw good development in Ivory Coast.
 ICE second-month, July cocoa rose $33 or 1.1 percent to
close at $3,093 per tonne, while London July cocoa climbed 17
pounds to finish at 1,907 pounds per tonne.
 ""Fundamentally it's not really in a bullish place but
people might not yet be willing to buy into the Ivory Coast
situation as settled or things getting back on line as quickly
as some would hope,"" said Bill Raffety, senior analyst for
futures brokerage Penson Futures in New York.
 Raw sugar futures on ICE were choppy, with near-term
pressure on expectations of ample production from Brazil and
Thailand, and the possibility of further unrestricted exports
by India, which would boost supplies to the market.
 Dealers focused on the expiry of the ICE May raw sugar
futures contract on April 29, with open interest just below a
hefty 60,000 lots.
 Nick Penney of brokerage Sucden Financial in London said
the availability of Thai sugars could reduce pressure on
Brazilian ports in meeting international demand.
 ""It seems worries over the knock on effect of large vessel
lineups at Brazilian ports may be holding this (July/October)
spread up,"" he said.
 ICE July raw sugar futures fell 0.11 cent or 0.5 percent to
trade at 23.29 cents a lb at 1702 GMT. London August white
sugar finished down $6 at $633.10 per tonne.

 * Gold, silver volatility related to options activity
 * U.S. stock markets hit year high
(Updates prices, recasts, previous dateline LONDON)
 By David Sheppard
 NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Silver was on course for its
largest one-day fall in six weeks on Tuesday after having hit a
31-year high in the previous session, while gold came under
pressure from investor uncertainty over the likely course of
U.S. monetary policy.
 Spot silver fell by as much as 4.9 percent to a session low
of $44.63 an ounce, after having risen to $49.31 on Monday, its
highest since touching $49.48 in January 1980.
 High volatility and the expiry of U.S. silver options added
to the intensity of the decline, impacting gold, which fell
back from Monday's record of $1,518.10 an ounce ahead of the
outcome of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting on
Wednesday.
 The Fed is expected to indicate it is in no hurry to raise
interest rates, while Chairman Ben Bernanke will deliver the
first regularly scheduled post-decision news briefing in the
bank's 97-year history.
 ""There are quite a few things coming out in the next day or
two -- the FOMC and the GDP release. People are just taking
profits on these markets around that event risk,"" said Standard
Chartered analyst Daniel Smith.
 Silver was last bid at $45.04 an ounce at 11:48 a.m. EDT
(1548 GMT), compared with $46.90 late in New York on Monday,
set for its biggest daily loss since March 15.
 Silver at-the-money implied options volatility has risen by
over 35 percent in the last four trading days to hit its
highest level since mid-November.
 U.S. silver futures saw record volume on Monday, with over
300,000 lots changing hands, with another 225,865 trading
before midday on Tuesday.
 Silver futures for May were down at $45.00 having closed at
$47.15 on Monday.
 The iShares Silver Trust, the world's largest silver-backed
exchange-traded fund, also saw heavy trading, with a record
34.93 million shares trading on Monday and a further 12.6
million shares changing hands in early trading on Tuesday.
 ""Everyone has heard that silver is in a parabolic uptrend,
but it now appears ready to take at least a respite to calm
down a bit,"" wrote Larry McMillan, president of McMillan
Analysis Corp, in a report.
 Gold meanwhile was on course for a second daily decline, in
spite of the weakness in the dollar, which usually acts as an
incentive to non-U.S. investors to buy the metal.
 The spot price was last down 0.7 percent at $1,499.00 an
ounce, while U.S. gold futures for June delivery were down 0.6
percent at $1,499.45.
 DOLLAR LINK WEAKENS
 However, gold's usual inverse relation to the dollar has
been weakening consistently since mid-April, meaning the
bullion price will derive less of a bounce from any softness in
the U.S. currency.
 Tighter U.S. policy would restrict the amount of cash in
the financial system and could temper concern about inflation,
which investors often protect against by buying gold.
 The Federal Open Market Committee meeting started on
Tuesday and concludes on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank is
expected to confirm it will stick to plans to complete its $600
billion bond-buying program.
 Solid earnings from U.S. companies, including Ford, 3M Co
and United Parcel Service lifted stocks on Tuesday, helping the
S&P 500 and the Dow industrials set highs for the year.
 Consumer confidence in the United States also picked up in
April, despite rising gasoline prices. The Conference Board, an
industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose to
65.4 in April from a revised 63.8 in March, though it remains
low by historical standards.
 The dollar fell to a 16-month low against the euro on
expectations that U.S. monetary policy will remain
accommodative compared to the European Central Bank, which has
already begun to raise rates.
 Traders say part of the reason for the volatility in gold
and silver prices is activity related to options -- contracts
which give holders the right to buy or sell the underlying
security at a fixed price in the futures.
 ""There's been a rush to cover exposure to these contracts
ahead of expiry (maturity),"" a trader said. ""It's been more
pronounced in silver futures.""
 Silver prices are still up about 50 percent so far this
year after gains of more than 80 percent last year.
 Platinum was last at $1,807.48 an ounce, down from Monday's
last quote at $1,819.30, while palladium traded at $757.50 an
ounce versus $757.80 on Monday.

 By Mark Weinraub
 CHICAGO, April 26 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures rose to a
two-week high on Tuesday as forecasts for rains in the U.S.
Midwest threatened to further delay spring planting, raising
the value of extremely low old-crop stocks.
 Wheat futures dropped on a profit-taking setback despite a
supportive fundamental picture.
 Soybean futures also were weaker after a three-day winning
streak on concerns that farmers may switch some of their
intended corn acreage to soy if planting delays continue.
 Traders were wary of taking on big positions as the U.S.
Federal Reserve's policymaking committee began a two-day
meeting on Tuesday. The meeting was not expected to lead to a
rate cut or a change to its $600 billion bond buying program,
but a groundbreaking news conference by Chairman Ben Bernanke
was expected to set a tone for the markets.
 Chicago Board of Trade May corn was up 4-1/4 cents at
$7.66-3/4 a bushel at 11:09 a.m. CDT (1609 GMT).
 The CME Group, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade, is
considering widening the daily trading limit in corn to 50
cents per bushel, from the current 30 cents, a spokesman for
the exchange said Tuesday.
 CBOT May wheat was down 6-3/4 cents at $8.19-1/4 a bushel
and CBOT May soybeans were down 10-1/4 cents at $13.79-1/4.
 Damp soil in the Midwest has virtually stalled corn seeding
in some key states with the window for optimum yields narrowing
at a time when the United States needs a bumper crop to
replenish extremely low supplies.
 The U.S. Agriculture Department said on Monday afternoon
that just 9 percent of intended corn acreage had been seeded as
of April 24. A year ago, corn planting was 46 percent complete
and the five-year average for late April is 23 percent.
 ""You are going to see little if any fieldwork getting done
here,"" said Mike Palmerino, forecaster at Telvent DTN. ""There
is just so much (corn) acreage this year that you just wonder
if it is all going to get planted.""
 The slow start to planting dashes hopes that an early
harvest would provide some relief to the tight old-crop supply
situation. Robust demand for U.S. corn has left domestic stocks
at their tightest level since the 1930s.
 ""The fact that the crop is going to be late has pushed more
emphasis back into the old-crop market,"" said Greg Grow,
director of agribusiness at Archer Financial Services. ""In a
crop that is planted early, sometimes you will get early corn
available in late August or early September. That is going to
be tough this year.
 BUMPER S. AMERICAN HARVEST PRESSURES SOY
 Additional pressure on soybeans came as overseas buyers
look to South America to fill their soybean needs amid the
harvest of a bumper crop from Argentina and Brazil.
 ""You are facing a little bit of headwind too from the fact
that you have had some lousy (export) inspections here,"" said
Dewey Strickler, president of Ag Watch Market Advisors. ""We had
been expecting a slowdown (in exports) and we are seeing it.""
 Farmers in the U.S. Plains were facing the opposite problem
of their Midwest counterparts as dry weather stresses the
developing hard red winter wheat crop. Little relief was
forecast during the next 10 days, Palmerino said.
 ""It looks like that the areas that are the driest ... those
areas are going to continue to struggle here,"" Palmerino said.
""That is going to continue to likely allow for further
deterioration in crop conditions.""
 The market had already factored in severe losses in
southern reaches of the Plains but the crop in Kansas, the top
wheat-producing state, was starting to deteriorate as well,
Palmerino said.

 By Mark Weinraub
 CHICAGO, April 26 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures rose on
Tuesday, reversing early losses, as a rainy forecast for the
U.S. Midwest threatened to further delay spring planting.
 Wheat futures dropped on a profit-taking setback despite a
supportive fundamental picture. Soybean futures also were
weaker after a three-day winning streak, with traders noting
some concerns that farmers may devote some of their intended
corn acreage to soybeans if planting delays continue.
 Traders were wary of taking on big positions before the end
of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policymaking committee on Tuesday
and Wednesday. The meeting was not expected to lead to a rate
cut or a change to its $600 billion bond buying program, but a
groundbreaking news conference by Chairman Ben Bernanke was
expected to set a tone for the markets.
 Chicago Board of Trade May corn was up 4-1/4 cents at
$7.66-3/4 a bushel at 10:46 a.m. CDT (1546 GMT). CBOT May wheat
was down 2-3/4 cents at $8.23-1/4 a bushel and CBOT May
soybeans were down 7-1/4 cents at $13.82-1/4.
 Damp soil in the Midwest has virtually stalled corn seeding
in some key states with the window for optimum yields narrowing
at a time when the United States needs a bumper crop to
replenish extremely low supplies.
 The U.S. Agriculture Department said on Monday afternoon
that just 9 percent of intended corn acreage had been seeded as
of April 24. A year ago, corn planting was 46 percent complete
and the five-year average for late April is 23 percent.
 ""You are going to see little if any fieldwork getting done
here,"" said Mike Palmerino, forecaster at Telvent DTN. ""There
is just so much (corn) acreage this year that you just wonder
if it is all going to get planted.""
 BUMPER S. AMERICAN HARVEST PRESSURES SOY
 Additional pressure on soybeans came as overseas buyers
look to South America to fill their soybean needs amid the
harvest of a bumper crop from Argentina and Brazil.
 ""You are facing a little bit of headwind too from the fact
that you have had some lousy (export) inspections here,"" said
Dewey Strickler, president of Ag Watch Market Advisors. ""We had
been expecting a slowdown (in exports) and we are seeing it.""
 Farmers in the U.S. Plains were facing the opposite problem
of their Midwest counterparts as dry weather stresses the
developing hard red winter wheat crop. Little relief was
forecast during the next 10 days, Palmerino said.
 ""It looks like that the areas that are the driest ... those
areas are going to continue to struggle here,"" Palmerino said.
""That is going to continue to likely allow for further
deterioration in crop conditions.""
 The market had already factored in severe losses in
southern reaches of the Plains but the crop in Kansas, the top
wheat-producing state, was starting to deteriorate as well,
Palmerino said.

 * Caution before Fed meeting, China rate talk cool market
 * Wheat crop ratings, slow corn planting underpin prices
 * European wheat firm on weather after Easter closure
 
 (Corrects to $600 billion from $600 million in paragraph 19)
 BEIJING/PARIS, April 26 (Reuters) - Chicago corn and wheat
futures fell on Tuesday as caution ahead of a U.S. interest-rate
decision this week and worries about inflation encouraged
operators to pause after a weather-driven jump a day earlier.
 But Chicago Board of Trade futures trimmed losses as share
and oil prices turned higher, and with persistent worries about
adverse crop weather giving grain prices a firm footing.
 Corn and wheat in Chicago rose 3 percent in the previous
session amid weather concerns, which were underscored by
weekly U.S. crop data released after Monday's market close.
European wheat prices, which resumed trading on Tuesday
after a four-day closure for the Easter holiday, gained ground
in reaction to Monday's U.S. rise and on growing fears about
dryness stressing crops in western Europe.
 Front-month CBOT wheat prices fell 1.00 percent to $8.17-3/4
a bushel by 1215 GMT. CBOT corn dropped 0.69 percent to
$7.57-1/4 while soybeans also lost 0.68 percent to $13.80.
 ""CBOT trading weakened amid a wide commodities sell-off,""
said Ricky Chan, senior account manager with ADMIS Hong Kong
Limited, citing caution ahead of a meeting of the U.S. Federal
Reserve that starts on Tuesday.
 ""There is also market talk that China may raise interest
rates again to curb inflation, which has also pressured metals
and stock markets.""
 
 ADVERSE N. HEMISPHERE WEATHER
 But Chicago grains pared losses during European trading,
helped by a rise in wheat futures in Paris as the European
market remained firmly focused on the weather.
 Weekly data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed
planting of U.S. corn had been stalled by wet weather.
 Wet weather was also hampering sowing of spring wheat while
winter wheat continued to suffer from dry conditions.
 ""We're emerging from a 2010 context where we had the U.S.
and the European Union in a position to export quality wheat,""
Cedric Weber, analyst with French consultancy Offre & Demande
Agricole, said.
 ""Now we have these two producers, on whom we were relying at
least until October when the Russian and Canadian harvests come
in, and which are not looking good in terms of yields.""
 Major European wheat producers France, Germany and Britain
have experienced dry, warm weather this month that has raised
concerns about yield losses, and traders said storms in France
over the weekend were too sporadic to boost grain.
 ""We're talking about scattered and stormy rain: in some
places a lot, in other places not enough and elsewhere nothing
at all,"" a French trader said.
 Benchmark November milling wheat in Paris was up 1.89
percent at 229.00 euros a tonne.
 With U.S. and EU crop yields looking uncertain for the 2011
harvest, global grain markets will be looking closely at the
outlook in Russia and Ukraine, which curbed exports this season
in response to a severe drought in 2010.
 Ukraine's farm ministry said on Tuesday it had recommended
lifting export quotas on maize given ample domestic supply,
 Russia could progressively resume wheat exports later in
2011, which would pressure prices, a U.S.-based consultancy
said.
 The Fed's meeting was not expected to lead to rate cut or a
change to its $600 billion bond buying program, but a
groundbreaking press conference by Chairman Ben Bernanke after
the rate decision is expected to set a tone for markets.
 In China, meanwhile, a state-backed newspaper reported
annual inflation could edge up to 5.5 percent in April, giving
the central bank scope to further tighten monetary policy.
 China has moved aggressively this year to cool inflation and
surprised markets by announcing interest rate hikes and
increases in the amount of cash banks must hold in reserves at
odd times such as weekends and over holidays, leaving investors
concerned Beijing may use the May 2 long weekend to announce
additional tightening.

 (Updates with comment, refreshes prices)
 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - Silver was set for its largest
one-day fall in six weeks on Tuesday after having hit fresh
31-year highs, while gold came under pressure from investor
uncertainty over the likely course of U.S. monetary policy.
 Spot silver  fell earlier by as much as 4.9 percent to
a session low of $44.63 an ounce, after having risen to $49.31
on Monday, its highest since touching $49.48 in January 1980.
High volatility and the expiry of U.S. silver options added
to the intensity of the decline, impacting gold, which fell back
from Monday's record of $1,518.10 an ounce ahead of the outcome
of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Wednesday.
 The Fed is expected to indicate it is in no hurry to raise
interest rates, while chairman Ben Bernanke will deliver the
first regularly scheduled post-decision news briefing in the
bank's 97-year history.
 ""There are quite a few things coming out in the next day or
two -- the FOMC and the GDP release. People are just taking
profits on these markets around that event risk,"" said Standard
Chartered analyst Daniel Smith. ""The key thing for me is any
indication that interest rates might rise.""
 Silver was last bid at $45.77 an ounce at 1400 GMT, compared
with $46.90 late in New York on Monday, set for its biggest
daily loss since March 15.
 Silver at-the-money implied options volatility  has
risen by over 35 percent in the last four trading days alone to
hit its highest level since mid-November 2010.
 ""Silver is the most interesting,"" Standard Chartered's Smith
said. ""Silver is going to be very volatile over the next couple
of weeks from a medium-term perspective, it will be a lot
softer.""
 Gold  meanwhile was on course for a second daily
decline, in spite of the weakness in the dollar, which usually
acts as an incentive to non-U.S. investors to buy the metal.
 The spot price was last down 1 percent at $1,494.00 an
ounce, while U.S. gold futures for June delivery  were
down 0.9 percent at $1,494.50.
 
 DOLLAR LINK WEAKENS
 However, gold's usual inverse relation to the dollar has
been weakening consistently since mid-April, meaning the bullion
price will derive less of a bounce from any softness in the U.S.
currency.
 ""The rally has been strong, it's not surprising to see
profit-taking ahead of the FOMC meeting,"" said Peter Fertig, a
consultant at Quantitative Commodity Research.
 ""Markets expect it will be a dovish statement from the U.S.
Fed, but there are worries about them ending (Quantitative
Easing) ahead of time.""
 Tighter U.S. policy would restrict the amount of cash in the
financial system and could temper concern about inflation, which
investors often protect against by buying gold.
 The Federal Open Market Committee meeting starts later on
Tuesday and concludes on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank is
expected to confirm it will stick to plans to complete its $600
billion bond-buying programme. [USD/]

 Traders say part of the reason for the volatility in gold
and silver prices is activity related to options -- contracts
which give holders the right to buy or sell the underlying
security at a fixed price in the futures.
 ""There's been a rush to cover exposure to these contracts
ahead of expiry (maturity),"" a trader said. ""It's been more
pronounced in silver futures.""
 Silver prices are still up about 50 percent so far this year
after gains of more than 80 percent last year.
 Platinum  was last down 1.2 percent at $1,797.24 an
ounce from $1,819.30, while palladium  was down 1.5
percent at $747.50 an ounce.

 * Beijing plan to restrict new projects for some metals
 * Aluminium approaching new highs since August 2008
 
 (Updates with closing prices)
 By Sue Thomas and Melanie Burton
 LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - Copper fell on Tuesday, weighed
by concerns that rising energy costs could hinder global growth
prospects, while focus shifted to the next phase of U.S.
monetary policy, which may be clarified on Wednesday.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at
$9,545, from $9,700 when the market closed on Thursday before
the long weekend started on Friday.
 The metal used in power and construction pared losses,
however, from a session trough below $9,400 a tonne. It has
fallen around 6 percent from a record high $10,190 hit in
February.
 ""It's clear that the inflation that is coming alongside
higher energy prices is not good for base metals. It's expected
to accompany further tightening measures, particularly in the
developing world, which will be damaging for demand,"" analyst
Nic Brown of Natixis said.
 Brent crude oil futures turned lower on Tuesday in seesaw
trading, following an earlier move by U.S. crude, as investors
took a cautious tack at the start of a Federal Reserve two-day
policy meeting.
 Investors were focused on the U.S. central bank's first
scheduled briefing with reporters in its 97-year history, which
will cap the end of the meeting of the policy-setting Federal
Open Market Committee.
 Investors bet the Fed will keep its easy monetary policy in
place.
 ""It will be a test for Bernanke and ... it will be very
interesting to see exactly what message we get,"" added Brown.
 ""However, whether that is genuinely what the market is
worrying about, or whether it's more what is going on in energy
markets, or a question of what kind of monetary tightening is
going to take place in developing countries is not so obvious.""
 Meanwhile, stocks of copper continued their counter-cyclical
uptrend this quarter, pointing to still limp demand, echoed by
trade data from China, the world's top consumer of base metals.
 Copper inventories grew by almost 4,000 tonnes to more than
460,000 tonnes, the latest data showed, and were at their
highest levels since mid-June last year.
 Data showed China's refined copper imports fell 43 percent
in March from the same month last year due to high stocks and
strong international prices, although the figure was a rebound
from the holiday-shortened month of February.
 ""Perhaps the markets are still digesting what were
definitely not bullish figures for the Chinese trade data,"" said
analyst Stephen Briggs of BNP Paribas.
 A weaker dollar also supported the complex because it makes
commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies. 
 
 VOLATILE
 Base metals trading is expected to remain volatile in
another week shortened by holidays, and the focus is likely to
shift to data over coming days showing how the U.S. and British
economies fared in the first quarter.
""With U.S. GDP, U.S. durable goods orders and Eurozone
industrial new orders in focus, the (base metals) sector has
plenty of information to digest,"" Credit Suisse said in a note.
 ""We think the data could point to a modest slowdown in
economic activity but generally confirm that the recovery
remains on track. That could set a rather positive tone for
trading.""
 The preliminary snapshot of U.S. GDP growth, which a Reuters
survey puts at 2 percent, will be released on April 28.
 Stocks levels would increasingly become an important factor
to watch, Credit Suisse said. ""The positive economic backdrop
will have to be confirmed by declining inventories for the rally
to remain sustainable.""
 Zinc ended at $2,260 from Thursday's $2,360 close. Technical
selling is likely to have been set off once it breached the
200-day moving average of $2,290, a key signal watched by funds.
 Aluminium was $2,747 from $2,745 near last week's 2.5 year
summit at $2,757 a tonne.
 ""Ali is ... holding up fairly well on account of resiliency
in energy as the two commodities are perceived to be linked,""
said MF Global in a research note. ""Two days of closes above
$2,750 could lead to another potential leg higher.""
 Tin ended at $32,700.
 China on Tuesday raised the bar for polluters in a plan that
included restricting new projects for mining tin, tungsten,
molybdenum, antimony and rare earths.
 Battery material lead finished at $2,558 from $2,601 and
nickel was last seen at $26,650 from $26,900.

859,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2011 08:52PM ET</span>",NYMEX-Crude falls on uncertainty ahead of Fed meeting," SINGAPORE, April 26 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures fell in
early trade on Tuesday as investors were uncertain whether the
U.S. Federal Reserve would signal a change in its easy monetary
policy after a two-day meeting of policymakers that concludes on
Wednesday.

 FUNDAMENTALS	
 * NYMEX crude for June delivery  fell 73 cents to
$111.55 a barrel by 0035 GMT, after having dipped 1 cent to
settle at $112.28 on Monday. Brent  fell 57 cents to
123.09 a barrel.	
 * Saudi Aramco's chief executive, Khalid al-Falih, said on
Tuesday Saudi Arabia had enough spare crude capacity to meet
demand, as oil prices extend a rise above $120 per
barrel.[ID:nL3E7FP01S]	
 * Oil prices slipped on Monday in thin, choppy trade as a
sell-off in silver from near record highs lifted the dollar off
its lows, prompting a bout of profit-taking in crude. 
 * The United States is considering sanctions against Syrian
government officials to increase pressure on President Basher
al-Assad to end a violent crackdown on protesters, a U. S.
official said on Monday. [ID:nN25199030]	
 * Refugees fleeing Libya's Western Mountains told of heavy
bombardment by leader Muammar Gaddafi's forces as they try to
dislodge rebels in remote Berber towns. The capture of the
Dehiba-Wazin crossing on the Tunisian border by rebels last week
has let refugees flee in cars or on foot along rocky paths,
swelling the numbers of Libyans sheltering in southern Tunisia
to an estimated 30,000 people. [ID:nLDE73O0I2]	
 * The final stage in Nigeria's long election process begins
on Tuesday with fiercely contested state governorship polls to

 * Drought trimming US HRW wheat prospects
 * Wet weather slows US/Canada spring wheat seedings
 * Wet weather stalling US corn plantings
 * Coming up: USDA's weekly crop progress report
(Recasts to include close of U.S. trading session, adds
details and quotes on crop weather)
 By Sam Nelson
 CHICAGO, April 25 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat jumped 3 percent
to a two-month high on Monday and corn rose 3 percent, notching
its biggest percentage gain in three weeks, as harsh weather
threatened production of both crops.
 ""It's all weather. The two-week forecast doesn't look good
for corn planting. It indicates we could lose corn acreage,""
said Terry Reilly, an analyst for Citigroup.
 Soybean prices rose on spillover buying from the big gains
in wheat and corn.
 While drought is damaging the U.S. winter wheat crop and
threatening production levels, excessively wet weather is
hampering spring seedings of wheat and corn.
 ""Corn planting has stalled as a result of the heavy rains.
The active rains should continue across the Midwest and
northern Delta through mid-week, keeping fieldwork stalled and
flooding prevalent,"" said Don Keeney, agricultural meteorlogist
for MDA EarthSat Weather.
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture was scheduled to release
its updated weekly crop progress report Monday afternoon.
Analysts' on average expected U.S. corn plantings at 13
percent, below the five-year average of 22 percent and well
below the 50 percent planted at this time a year ago.
 Although plantings are behind schedule, there is still time
for farmers to plant corn and realize good yield per acre. As a
general rule, corn yield potential should not decline until
plantings are delayed past mid-May.
 CBOT wheat for May delivery was up 26-1/2 cents per bushel
at $8.26, May corn was up 25-1/4 at $7.62-1/2 and May soy was
up 9 cents at $13.89-1/2.
 Wheat prices are now less than 7 percent below their
post-2008 peak from February. Corn is struggling to restart its
nearly year-long rally that topped out several weeks ago, with
signs of demand rationing in the ethanol and feed industries.
 Keeney said a few showers would move through the U.S.
Plains winter wheat region this week but the rainfall would be
limited.
 ""A dry pattern is expected to return to the central and
southern Plains by next week which will allow moisture shortage
and stress to increase once again,"" he said.
 Kenney also said current dry weather is a problem for crops
grown in the North China Plain and in central and northwest
Europe.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters) - Silver surged as much as 8
percent on Monday before pulling back sharply when a failure to
pierce the all time high from 1980 unleashed a wave of
technical selling amid record volume in U.S. futures.
 After briefly dipping into negative territory midmorning as
speculators sharply took profits near the $50 psychological
level, silver later found its footing again. The metal traded
largely flat, steadying at just below $47 after the CME Group
raised the maintenance margins of silver futures by 9.2
percent. [ID:nL3E7FP2EW]
 Gold prices also recoiled from early gains of nearly 1
percent after touching a seventh successive record high with
volatility spiking to its highest since November.
 The whipsaw in silver prices amid otherwise thin trading
market conditions was a stark reminder of the volatile nature
of this year's best-performing major commodity, which has
gained about 150 percent since the U.S. Federal Reserve
signaled new easing measures last August. Silver has risen for
nine straight days, matching a record winning streak from
2008.

 ""Silver has transformed itself from an inflation hedge to a
speculation tool,"" said Hakan Kaya, commodities portfolio
manager at Neuberger Berman, which manages about $190 billion
client assets. ""At current prices, we find it highly overvalued
with no fundamental reasons backing it up.""
 While often overshadowed by gold, the smaller silver market
has handily outpaced the yellow metal's 25 percent gains over
the same period. Prices look set to challenge the record $49.48
an ounce from three decades ago when Texan brothers William
Hebert and Nelson Bunker Hunt sought to corner the market.
 Spot silver  was up 1.4 percent at $47.34 an ounce by
3:39 p.m. EDT (1939 GMT), sharply below a session high of
$49.31.
 Spot gold  was at $1,509,60 an ounce, up 0.4 percent,
well off an a record high of $1,518.10 set earlier in the
session, in tandem with silver's reversal. U.S. June gold
futures  settled up $5.30 at $1,509.10 an ounce, in a
range from $1,502.20 to $1,1519.20.
 VOLUME AT RECORD HIGH
 U.S. May silver futures  jumped as much as over 8
percent to a intraday high of of $49.82 an ounce, just about 50
cents off its all-time peak for futures at $50.35 hit on Jan.
18, 1980. May settled up $47.149 an ounce, up $1.09.
 U.S. silver volume surged to a record high, topping 300,000
lots, more than doubled gold's turnover, preliminary Reuters
data showed.
 Despite record futures volume, silver's initial rally was
not backed by active trade prior to its sell-off, with markets
in Britain, Canada and Australia shut due to the Easter Monday
holiday.
 Analysts said silver's rally was backed by new source of
demand from solar panel manufacturers in addition to
traditional strongholds including electronics and photography
amid a recovering economy. However, extreme price fluctuations
could hurt demand.
 ""We are constantly researching and developing production
methods to minimize key resource inputs, including silver, to
drive down the costs of production,"" said Stuart Wenham, chief
technology officer of Suntech Power Holdings Co Ltd ,
the world's top solar panel maker.
 Wenham said that the recent rise of silver prices with
increasing volatility highlights the importance of the
company's R&D initiatives.
 OPTION VOLATILITY SPIKES
 COMEX option floor trader Dominic Cognata said that
volatility in silver options ""went through the moon"" ahead of
Tuesday's May option expiration and Wednesday's conclusion of
the Fed's two-day policy-setting meeting.
 Active option trade in iShares Silver Trust , the
world's largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund, also
suggests some traders maybe betting on a sharp reversal after a
huge rally in silver prices.
 A key technical indicator, silver's 14-day relative
strength index, is warning of a further correction in the
silver market after the precious metal got within $1 of its
all-time high on Monday and traded at levels not seen in more
than 30 years. [ID:nN25211877]
 On gold, the CBOE gold volatility index <.GVZ>, a gauge of
bullion investor anxiety, surged to about 17 percent, its
biggest one-day gain since November last year.
 James Dailey, portfolio manager of the TEAM Asset Strategy
Fund  said that silver's technical charts are showing
signs of exhaustion, with strong volume recorded at its sharply
higher open and the subsequent reversal.
 In platinum group metals, platinum  was up 0.6
percent at $1,821 an ounce, while palladium  eased 0.7
percent at $760.47 an ounce.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, April 22 (Reuters) - Spot gold surged to a
lifetime high on Friday in thin holiday trade, hitting a record
for a sixth consecutive session on a weak dollar and factors
ranging from geopolitical uncertainty to inflation concerns.	
 Silver also raced to its loftiest in 31 years, notching the
milestone for a seventh straight day and outstripping gold's
weekly gains by a huge margin. 
 The ongoing euro zone sovereign debt crisis, unrest in the
Middle East and North Africa, rising global inflation, and most
recently worries over the fiscal stability of the United States
have fueled the record-breaking rally in these precious metals.

 Spot gold rose to an record of $1,512.50 an ounce,
before easing to $1,507.69 by 0853 GMT, on track for a weekly
gain of 1.5 percent -- its sixth consecutive week of gains.	
 Spot silver hit $46.69 an ounce, its highest since
1980, on course for a weekly rise of 8.4 percent, its biggest
weekly increase in two months.	
 Silver has gained 51 percent so far this year, and gold 6
percent. This compares with a corresponding 1 percent rise in
the London Metal Exchange price of copper, the bellwether of the
industrial metals complex.	
 Supporting precious metals, the dollar was
languishing near a three-year low against a basket of
currencies, and could take a run at the all-time low hit in
2008, pressured by record low interest rates and the crushing
weight of the U.S. budget deficit. 
 
 So long as the overall environment stays supportive and the
dollar remains weak, gold is expected to retain its strength.
Price of bullion is seen to rise to $1,700 an ounce by 2015,
analysts polled by Reuters said in a poll. [ID:nLDE73K0TT]	
 However, a correction might be on the horizon after the
recent rapid ascent, traders and analysts said.	
 ""Gold is likely to consolidate around the $1,500-level next
week,"" said Li Ning, an analyst at Shanghai CIFCO Futures. ""The
angle of the recent rally is very sharp, and we are bound to see
some correction in the near term.""	
 
 MORE STEAM TO RUN ON?	
 Spot gold has rallied more than $50, or 4 percent, in the
past eight sessions. The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, rose
to nearly 75, a level unseen since October last year, suggesting
the market has been heavily overbought.	
 The RSI on spot silver climbed close to near 89, its highest
since April 1987.	
 The gold market may have topped out, and now is the time to
sell while there are still people willing to buy, said Barry
Schwartz, vice president and portfolio manager at Toronto-based
wealth manager Baskin Financial Services.[ID:nN21263459]	
 However, Shanghai CIFCO's Li said gold has more steam to run
on and expected prices to peak at $1,550 by the end of the
second quarter, buoyed by the Middle East unrest, sovereign debt
concerns on both sides of the Atlantic and inflation worries.	
 The Shanghai Gold Exchange has started a trial for
over-the-counter trading, providing a convenient tool for
institutional clients to trade large quantities of gold, to
catch up with exploding investment demand in China.

 SINGAPORE, April 22 (Reuters) - Spot gold held steady on
Friday in holiday-thinned trade, after hitting record highs in
five consecutive sessions, supported by a weak dollar and a list
of other supporting factors, including geopolitical
uncertainties and inflation concerns.	
 The dollar index , a measure of the greenback's

 By Carole Vaporean and Melanie Burton
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Copper rallied to its highest in more
than a week on Thursday, as supply concerns, a tumbling U.S. dollar, and signs
that economic growth has taken deeper root in the United States all contributed
to its gains.
 Many investors looked past data showing a large drop in Chinese imports of
the metal last month.
 Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange finished at $9,700 a tonne
versus $9,577 at Wednesday's close.
 The red metal, used in power and construction, earlier hit $9,707.75 a
tonne, its highest since April 12, recovering from one-month lows near $9,200
at the start of the week.
 In New York, COMEX Benchmark May copper futures settled 6.05 cents higher
at $4.40 per lb, a 1.39 percent gain. Earlier, it shot to its highest since
April 13 at $4.4030.
 ""We're seeing reduced risk aversion and that's certainly lifted (U.S.)
stocks and also various commodities, including copper,"" said Peter Buchanan,
commodities analyst and senior economist at CIBC in Toronto.
 Stronger U.S. quarterly corporate earnings have turned investor sentiment
in favor of assuming more risk and has contributed to the notion that economic
growth is improving.
 ""Certainly the (U.S.) earnings numbers have lent support to the view that
the economy is on a recovery track in spite of earlier misgivings, and that's
certainly helpful for copper,"" Buchanan added.
 U.S. stocks rose as strong earnings reports lifted big names like Apple
Inc, up 2.7 percent after it posted results that smashed Wall Street's
expectations. The maker of the iPad and iPhone joined Intel, United
Technologies and other names with much-stronger-than-forecast earnings that
increased the perception of a healthy corporate America.
 In the face of potential pick up in copper demand, Anglo American said
floods and heavy rains hampered output in the first quarter. The London-listed
miner's outlook included a 14 percent drop in copper output, reinforcing
worries about tight supply, even though it stuck to its production targets.
 ""Underlying supply tensions in copper are still there, which is the main
theme (supporting prices),"" said analyst Dan Smith of Standard Chartered.
 ""Chinese data today showed quite a lot of weakness in terms of imports, but
despite that copper prices have been quite strong,"" he said.
 China's refined copper imports dropped 43 percent in March from the same
month last year due to high stocks and strong international prices.
 Smith said higher copper prices also reflected weakness of the dollar and
rising equities.
 The U.S. dollar tumbled for the third straight day as super-low interest
rates and the weight of a massive budget deficit pushed the greenback closer to
an all-time low.
 A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper in other
currencies.
 Next week, one key risk for metals markets could be the advanced reading on
U.S. first-quarter gross domestic product, due Wednesday. Economists forecast a
decline to a 2.0 percent growth pace from 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter.
The measure will be closely watched for the timbre of economic health.
 COPPER CONSOLIDATION
 Limiting copper's upside in the short-term, said RBS analyst Daniel Major,
are sovereign debt issues in Europe and worries over rising inventories in Asia
outlook.
 Inventories of copper in LME-registered warehouses rose by 2,575 tonnes to
456,275 tonnes, their highest since last June, the latest data showed.
 Aluminium powered to its highest level since August 2008, as rising costs
of power boosted expectations for the energy-intensive metal's input costs.
 Credit Suisse Private Banking said, in a note, it raised its aluminium
outlook to $2,850 per tonne on a three-month horizon and to $2,950 in 21
months, from prior forecasts of $2,600 and $2,650 per tonne.
 Aluminium ended at $2,745 from $2,730 at the close.
 Tin was untraded, but bid at $32,700/$32,750, from $32,650 at the close on
Wednesday while zinc was at $2,360 per tonne and flat from the day before.
 Lead, which is used to make batteries, slipped back to $2,601 from $2,610
and stainless steel material nickel, was at $26,900 from $26,400 a tonne.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - Gold prices rallied to
record highs on Thursday for a fifth straight session and
silver surged as the dollar index tumbled for a third day
toward an all-time low, prompting investors to buy bullion as a
currency hedge.
 Bullion, which jumped above $1,500 an ounce for the first
time on Wednesday, once again rose in tandem with riskier
assets such as equities on inflation fears.
 ""The U.S. dollar is in the midst of a severe downtrend. So
the dollar is not the safe haven in view of the difficulty the
U.S. government is having in resolving its budget deficit, and
gold is benefiting from that,"" said Leo Larkin, metals equity
analyst at Standard & Poor's.
 Spot gold rose 0.6 percent to $1,507.21 an ounce by 3:22
p.m. (1922 GMT), after hitting a record $1,508.75 an ounce.
U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled up $4.90 an ounce
at $1,503.80.
 U.S. commodity markets will be shut on Friday for the Good
Friday holiday. However, the CFTC Commitments of Traders report
is still scheduled to be released at 15:30 p.m. EDT (1930 GMT)
Friday.
 Silver gained 2.7 percent to $46.44 an ounce. U.S.
silver futures trade was active, with volume topping 170,000
lots.
 The gold/silver ratio -- which shows how much silver an
ounce of gold can buy -- is set to fall for a ninth consecutive
session to below 33, a 28-year low.
 ""Silver continues to attract huge speculative interest.
Even though silver is outperforming gold, the genesis of this
rally is still related to the flight-to-safety factors
supporting gold,"" O'Neill said.
 But a big put option trade on iShares Silver Trust, the
world's largest silver-backed exchange-traded fund, suggests
some traders are betting on a sharp reversal by year's end
after a huge rally in silver prices.
 The big put trade appears to be an outright bearish bet
that silver will come crashing down over the next eight months,
optionMonster analyst Chris McKhann said in comments on the
firm's website.
 ""The SLV doesn't actually need to fall that entire
percentage for these puts to profit, but the trade does
forecast a sharp longer-term decline,"" McKhann said.
 GOLD AS CURRENCY HEDGE
 Gold also benefits as a hedge against U.S. currency
depreciation, as the dollar fell broadly for a third straight
day as record low interest rates and the crushing weight of the
U.S. budget deficit pushed it closer to an all-time trough
against major currencies.
 S&P warmed on Monday that it could cut its long-term rating
on U.S. Treasury debt if the government cannot find a way to
slash its massive debt. Such a move would weigh heavily on the
U.S. dollar and threaten economic stability throughout the
world -- a perfect recipe for gold rally.
 Gold prices have risen more than 5 percent so far this
month and posted a sixth straight week of gains, reflecting
strength across the commodity markets.
 Investors have rushed into risky assets due to strong U.S.
corporate earnings and signs the global economy is chugging
along even as the Federal Reserve stays very cautious about
when it will start to unwind its super-loose policy. 
 The metal is expected to be underpinned by uncertainty over
how the United States will adjust monetary policy after the
Federal Reserve's $600 billion government bond-buying program
-- known as quantitative easing -- comes to an end in June. 
 Among other precious metals, platinum rose 1.2 percent to
$1,813.24 an ounce, while palladium gained 2 percent to
$766.97.

 By Marcy Nicholson and David Brough
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - ICE arabica coffee
futures closed weak on Thursday, after Wednesday's 34-year high
was viewed as overdone, while cocoa fell in thin volume as
dealers squared positions before the Easter holiday break.
 Sugar inched higher in rangebound business.
 ""You're seeing a bit of a pull-back in the softs and the
energy markets today, I think, just ahead of the long weekend,""
said Luis Rangel, vice president for commodity derivatives with
ICAP North America in New Jersey. ""Traditional buyers may be
extending the weekend a day early.""
 ICE July arabica coffee dropped 4.9 cents or 1.6 percent to
close at $2.9455 per lb, after climbing to $3.0055. The
contract had risen above the psychological $3 level to peak at
$3.025 a lb on Wednesday, supported by a shortage of mild
washed arabicas and a weak dollar. Total volume was light at
just over 11,000 lots, the lowest in seven weeks, preliminary
Thomson Reuters data showed.
 ""If you see the kind of delivery notices that are being
thrown out in the market, it definitely makes things a little
bit heavy,"" Rangel said.
 ""When you see weakening spreads, you start to get concerned
that the bull story is less convincing than it was.""
 On April 20, there were 1,608 delivery notices, the highest
for the May contract in two years. There were more than 500
notices on Thursday, ICE data showed.
 Dealers said the high prices were causing roasters to buy
hand-to-mouth, eschewing longer-term forward coverage.
 ""There's more than enough coffee to fulfill demand ... It's
just the crop of tenderable washed arabica coffee is small,"" a
European trader said.
 Liffe July robustas dropped $47 or 1.9 percent to close at
$2,435 a tonne.
 ICE Futures U.S. coffee, cocoa and sugar markets will be
closed for Good Friday and the electronic platform will reopen
late on Monday at 7:30 a.m. EDT (1130 GMT). Open outcry will
see regular hours on April 25. The Liffe agricultural markets
will be closed both Friday and Monday for the Easter holiday.
 Cocoa futures eased in the lightest total volume since Dec.
28 at just over 7,000 lots, with eyes on top producer Ivory
Coast where Belgian shipper Safmarine loaded its first cocoa
exports there since the end of the country's export ban, the
company's head of commodity sales said.
 ""I don't see shipping on a big scale until banks open and I
don't see much on that front while it's still violent. Middle
class Abidjan people aren't going to work yet,"" one New York
dealer said.
 U.S. cocoa futures ignored the sharply higher pound against
the dollar as book-squaring ahead of the long weekend
contributed to pressure on the market.
 ""Ghana sold yesterday and maybe today at the highs. Left
over hedges are being put down which is why London is weaker
than New York,"" the trader said.
 ICE second-month, July cocoa closed down $18 at $3,088 per
tonne, while London July cocoa fell 32 pounds to settle at
1,890 pounds per tonne.
 ""Now the question is, what will the arrivals be like in the
next few weeks from the midcrop,"" said Keith Flury, a soft
commodities analyst with Rabobank in London.
 ""The talk is that there is good supply from the midcrop --
some 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes of beans should make it to the
ports -- so the price risk is to the downside.""
 Raw sugar futures on ICE turned higher in rangebound
dealings after Wednesday's jump, with upside potential seen
limited by expectations of ample production of the sweetener
from Brazil and bumper supplies from major exporter Thailand.
 ""We expect the steadiness (in prices) to continue in the
short term, but believe that, ultimately, supplies will
increase and producer hedging will become heavier,"" said Nick
Penney of brokerage Sucden Financial.
 ICE July raw sugar futures rose 0.27 cent to finish at
23.80 cents. London August white sugar settled up 40 cents at
$639.10 per tonne.

 By Karl Plume
 CHICAGO, April 21 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures rose 1.8
percent on Thursday as poor weather threatened crops in key
production areas of North America and Europe and as the dollar
fell to its lowest point in nearly three years.
 Corn rebounded from the prior session's 2 percent slide as
wet weather stalled early planting in the U.S. Midwest, but
prices drifted from early highs amid uncertainty over forecasts
calling for drier weather in May.
 Soybeans added 1.3 percent as traders unwound corn/soybean
spreads they had entered on ideas that the slow start to corn
planting would siphon more acres into soy cultivation. Stronger
than expected weekly export sales data and a weak dollar added
support.
 ""We're bouncing back on the weather. Despite forecasts for
better conditions by the middle of May, the weather looks to be
pretty bad through then. And a lower dollar certainly isn't
hurting anything either,"" said Jack Scoville, analyst with The
Price Futures Group.
 The U.S. dollar on Thursday fell to a near-three-year low
against a basket of currencies as investors fretted over low
interest rates and the threat of a U.S. credit rating
downgrade.
 Dollar-denominated commodities such as grains tend to rise
when the greenback sinks, partly because it increases the
buying power of those holding other currencies.
 Corn prices dropped to their lowest levels in nearly three
weeks on Wednesday as investors exited long positions on
forecasts for drier weather over the U.S. corn belt eased some
concerns about delayed spring planting.
 Updated forecasts for weekend rains in some areas renewed
worries about a late start to seeding at a time when corn
stocks are projected to be the tightest since the 1930s.
 But some investors sought to unwind their corn/soybean
spreads ahead of the three-day weekend, with markets closed on
Friday for the Good Friday holiday, leading to choppy trade.
 Soybeans climbed to near-two-week highs and were in
position for their strongest weekly gain in at least 1-1/2
months, helped by U.S. Department of Agriculture data showing
heavier than anticipated export sales last week.
 ""There were solid export sales, better than expected in
spite of all of the cancellation talk. I also think some of
them were short beans and didn't want to stay that way going
into the weekend,"" said Dan Dempsey, an analyst for Iowa Gain.
 Chicago Board of Trade corn for May added 0.2 percent to
$7.34 a bushel by 12:25 p.m. CDT (1725 GMT) while May soybeans
rose 1.3 percent to $13.76 a bushel, the largest percentage
gain in two weeks.
 WEATHER LIFTS WHEAT
 CBOT soft red winter wheat futures for May added 1.8
percent to $7.99-1/4 a bushel. The market was led by gains in
higher-protein wheat varieties traded on the Kansas City Board
of Trade and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange which have been
threatened by adverse weather.
 Prolonged drought conditions through Texas, Oklahoma and
southern areas of Kansas, the top U.S. winter wheat growing
state, have left wheat industry experts fearing there is little
hope for much of the new wheat crop due to be harvested this
summer.
 Meanwhile, soggy conditions have delayed the start of
spring wheat seeding in the northern U.S. Plains.
 KCBT May hard red winter wheat rose 1.4 percent to $9.33 a
bushel, while MGE May spring wheat climbed 1.4 percent to
$9.53.
 CBOT wheat was poised to notch its largest weekly gain
since late January, while KCBT and MGE wheat were set for their
strongest week since early December.

 (Updates with closing prices)
 By Melanie Burton and Silvia Antonioli
 LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Copper rallied to its highest
in more than a week on Thursday as supply concerns and a weak
U.S. dollar lifted prices, while investors shrugged off data
showing a large drop in Chinese imports of the metal last month.
 Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange finished at
$9,700 a tonne versus $9,577 at the close on Wednesday.
 The red metal, used in power and construction, earlier hit
$9,707.75 a tonne, its highest since April 12, after having
recovered from one-month lows near $9,200 at the start of the
week.
 Anglo American said floods and heavy rains hampered output
in the first quarter, including a 14 percent fall in copper
output, reinforcing worries about tight supply, although the
London-listed miner stuck to its production targets.
 ""The underlying supply tensions in copper are still there,
which is the main theme (supporting prices),"" said analyst Dan
Smith of Standard Chartered.
 ""Chinese data today showed quite a lot of weakness in terms
of imports, but despite that copper prices have been quite
strong,"" he said.
 ""That reflects the weakness of the dollar and rising
equities on the back of expectations that rates won't rise in
the U.S. soon.""
 China's refined copper imports dropped 43 percent in March
from the same month last year due to high stocks and strong
international prices, although the figure was a rebound from the
holiday-shortened month of February. 
 The U.S. dollar tumbled for a third straight day on Thursday
to near an all-time low against a broad measure of currencies. A
weaker dollar makes commodities cheaper in other currencies.
 U.S. stocks, which had been buoyant on improved earnings
results, pared some gains after data showed the pace of factory
activity in the mid-Atlantic region fell far more than expected
in April.
 Next week, one key risk for the metals markets could be U.S.
advance first-quarter gross domestic product data on Wednesday,
which will be closely watched for the timbre of economic health.
 ""Our U.S. macro guys think that number will surprise on the
downside. It could take the market by surprise in terms of being
less than people expect,"" said Standard Chartered's Smith.

 COPPER CONSOLIDATION
 Sovereign debt issues in Europe and worries over rising
inventories in Asia are weighing on copper's short-term outlook,
said RBS analyst Daniel Major.
 ""We are going to see consolidation between $9,000-10,000 in
the near term and higher levels in 18-24 months,"" he said.
 Inventories of copper in LME-registered warehouses rose by
2,575 tonnes to 456,275 tonnes, their highest since last June,
the latest data showed.
 Aluminium powered to its highest level since August 2008 as
rising costs of power boosted expectations for the
energy-intensive metal's input costs.
 ""We think the sector is preparing for a more significant
move higher,"" said Credit Suisse Private Banking in a note as it
raised its aluminium forecasts.
 It now sees aluminium at $2,850 on a three-month horizon,
rising to $2,950 in 21 months, from prior forecasts of $2,600
and $2,650.
 Aluminium ended at $2,745 from $2,730 at the close on
Wednesday.
 Tin was untraded but bid at $32,700/$32,750, from $32,650 at
the close on Wednesday while zinc was at $2,360 and flat from
the day before.
 Lead, which is used to make batteries, slipped back to
$2,601 from $2,610 and stainless steel material nickel, was at
$26,900 from $26,400.

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, April 21 (Reuters) - Bullion powered to a
lifetime high for a fifth consecutive session on Thursday on a
sharply weaker dollar, while lingering tensions in the Arab
world, worries about the euro zone crisis and U.S. fiscal health
offered additional support.	
 Gold's decade-long bull run could continue in the next four
years, though at a slower pace, with positive inflation risks
partially cooled by a shift towards more normal economic
conditions, analysts polled by Reuters said. [ID:nL3E7FL0K8] 
 Silver roared to its highest in more than three decades as
it tracked a rally in gold, which was also spurred by a threat
of a downgrade to the United States' triple-A credit rating. The
gold-silver ratio -- the number of silver ounces needed to buy
an ounce of gold -- was at its lowest since 1983.	
 Spot gold rose to a record high of $1,508.50 an ounce
and stood at $1,506.70 an ounce by 0607 GMT, up $8.55 an ounce.
U.S. gold futures  also hit a lifetime high at $1,509.5
an ounce. 
 ""The U.S. effectively lost its triple-A rating in the eyes
of investors that really matter quite some time ago, back when
gold broke $1,000 an ounce,"" said Fat Prophets commodities
analyst David Lennox. 
 ""We don't think America's perceived rating will improve
anytime soon and this is the driving force behind our
expectation of gold's continued price strength. Our next target
for gold is $1,590 an ounce.""	
 A bullish target at $1,518 per ounce remains intact for spot
gold as indicated by an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern and
its wave pattern, said Wang Tao, a Reuters market analyst for
commodities and energy technicals. [ID:nL3E7FL06M]	
 
 Spot silver rose as high as $46.05 an ounce, its
strongest since 1980, when the Hunt Brothers of Texas cornered
the silver market. 
 The dollar tumbled to a three-year low against a basket of
currencies on Thursday, with market players selling the
greenback to buy buoyant risky assets in a move that threatens
to drive the dollar index towards its historic low. 
 The dollar index fell 0.6 percent from late New York
trade to 73.898, the lowest since August 2008 -- just before it
surged during the Lehman Brothers collapse as investors
scrambled for safe-havens. 
 The physical market in Asia saw limited selling of scrap as
investors waited for bigger gains. Dealers noted physical buying
from India in the previous session ahead of a key religious
festival, suggesting that consumers had no choice but to buy
bullion at higher prices.	
 India, the world's largest gold consumer, celebrates Akshaya
Tritiya on May 6, when consumers buy gold to invoke prosperity.

 ""Sentiment is still bullish, we can say. The dollar is
weakening and there is no solution to the situation in Libya.
There's a downgrade in the U.S. rating and there's still
uncertainty in the euro zone. It's messy around the world,"" said
Ronald Leung, director of Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.	
 ""But I think gold is rising too fast. We are waiting for
some kind of correction in the near future, hopefully next
week.""	
 France promised Libyan rebels on Wednesday it would
intensify air strikes on Muammar Gaddafi's forces and send
military liaison officers to help them as fighting raged in
Misrata. [ID:nLDE73J1M3] 
 Gaddafi's government is circumventing international
sanctions to import gasoline to western Libya by using
intermediaries who transfer the fuel between ships in Tunisia.
[ID:nN20168707]	
 Brent crude climbed above $124 a barrel on Thursday as U.S.
crude inventories fell unexpectedly last week and a sharply
weaker dollar triggered a rush into riskier assets.

873,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2011 09:04PM ET</span>",NYMEX-Crude gains as U.S. stockpiles drop ," SEOUL, April 21 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures extended
gains in early Asian trade on Thursday, buoyed by a drop in
domestic crude and oil product inventories last week and a
broader commodities buying binge sparked by a weaker dollar. 
 
 FUNDAMENTALS	
 * NYMEX crude for June delivery  was up 48 cents
at $111.93 a barrel by 0034 GMT, after settling up $3.17
at $111.45 a day earlier.

barrels last week, bucking average analyst forecasts in a
Reuters poll for a 1.1 million barrel increase. It was the first
drawdown since the week to Feb. 25. 
 * OPEC sees oil prices between $80 to $90 as ""adequate"" and
has no plans for an emergency meeting because the market is well
supplied despite unrest in Libya, Ecuador's oil minister said on
Wednesday. [ID:nN20155751]

intensify air strikes on Muammar Gaddafi's forces and send

international sanctions to import gasoline to western Libya by
using intermediaries who transfer the fuel between ships in
Tunisia. [ID:nN20168707]	
 * High oil prices have hurt demand in top consumers China
and the United States, and OPEC needs to raise output around
June to stem further price rises, the International Energy
Agency's executive director said on Wednesday. [ID:nL3E7FK15D]

after hitting record highs for four consecutive sessions, fueled

(Updates prices, comments; rewrites throughout, changes byline and dateline
from previous LONDON)
 By Carole Vaporean and Melanie Burton
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - Copper rose to its highest in a week
on Wednesday after the U.S. housing market showed more signs of revival, strong
earnings boosted U.S. equities and the dollar hit a 15-month low against the
euro.
 Signs that demand may be picking up also boosted aluminium to 2-1/2-year
highs.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange ended at $9,577 per tonne
from a close of $9,340 on Tuesday.
 Copper, used in power, construction and electronics, had fallen to a
one-month trough at $9,207 a tonne on Monday.
 In New York, May copper futures rallied 2.60 percent to $4.3395 per lb, an
11-cent increase. Earlier, they hit a one-week high at $4.3480 a lb.
 ""Copper's getting a boost with everything else. After IBM, Intel and Yahoo
all beat the Street, we saw equities go on a tear. So, the strong belief in
global recovery will continue to press on. Plus, the dollar is getting killed,""
said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist with Lind Waldock.
 Strong profits and outlooks from tech and manufacturing companies propelled
U.S. stocks higher, delivering the biggest lift to sentiment since quarterly
earnings reports began a week ago. Leading the rally were Intel Corp, the most
actively traded stock on the Nasdaq, and Dow component United Technologies
Corp.
 ""The LME complex is trading higher as improved economic data in the U.S.
and Europe adds to the impact of good first-quarter earnings reports,"" Citi
analyst David Thurtell said.
 Meanwhile, the euro soared against the dollar, boosted by an increased risk
appetite and after a bond auction from Spain was well received by investors.
 Dollar-denominated metals generally fare well when the greenback declines,
this time by 1.2 percent against the euro.
 Sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose more than expected in March, a
trade group said, raising cautious optimism a recovery may be in sight for the
housing market.
 ""It is very good news, and it really shows that the improvement we've seen
on the employment front is finally finding its way in areas outside of just the
malls,"" said Burt White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial in Boston.
 Data on Tuesday showed U.S. housing starts and permits for future home
construction rose more than expected in March, raising prospects that
consumption in the world's second-biggest market for metals was gathering
pace.
 Risk sentiment improved, underpinning investor appetite for metals. Upbeat
U.S. and European corporate earnings also helped soothe market jitters after
Standard & Poor's this week warned it could cut a U.S. sovereign credit rating
and as speculation intensified that Greece would need to restructure its debt.
 ""A lot of people got spooked out of the market the other day when S&P put
the credit outlook for U.S. debt on notice. That pulled the rug out from under
a lot of people and they panicked,"" Streible said.
 ""Now, they're getting back in.""
 ALUMINIUM HITS FRESH HIGHS
 Aluminium, used in transport, construction and packaging, received a lift
from rising power prices, which account for about 35 percent of aluminium
smelting costs.
 A Chinese directive to pare back new smelting plants may also have helped
fuel its advance, Citi's Thurtell said.
 China, in a circular posted on a government website, called on central and
provincial authorities to stop approving the construction of new aluminium
smelting capacity.
 ""(The move) limits the probability of Chinese expansions taking the world
into chronic oversupply,"" he said.
 In 2010, China accounted for two-thirds of global output.
 Aluminium closed at $2,730 a tonne, up from $2,714 at the close on Tuesday.
It earlier hit its highest level in 2-1/2 years at $2,745 a tonne.
 Zinc closed at $2,360 a tonne from $2,329, despite a large 26,550-tonne
shipment of the metal into New Orleans warehouses. LME stockpiles now stand at
812,100 tonnes, their highest level since 1995.
 Tin closed at $32,650 from $32,400 while stainless steel material nickel
changed hands at $26,400 from $25,300.

 By Marcy Nicholson and Sarah McFarlane
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - Arabica coffee prices
closed at a 34-year high but pared gains after jumping above $3
per lb on Wednesday, on a high-quality bean shortage, bullish
charts and a broad commodities rally fueled by a weaker
dollar.
 Sugar surged in its biggest one-day percentage gain in more
than three months after falling 15 percent in the past two
weeks on improving investor sentiment.
 Cocoa settled mixed as dealers awaited news of top producer
Ivory Coast's resumption of exports and the condition of its
mid crop.
 Gold jumped to record highs above $1,500 an ounce while oil
jumped 3 percent and other commodities rose too as a weaker
dollar fed risk appetite among investors.
 ICE arabica coffee futures prices broke above the
psychological $3.00 a lb, maintaining their upward momentum
that has seen a 17 percent lift in the past two weeks.

 ""People just want to buy, that's basically it. The dollar's
at a new low. People want to own things. You don't want to be
short,"" said Nick Gentile, head of trading at Atlantic Capital
Advisors in Jersey City.
 The euro surged to its highest in 15 months against a
weaker dollar, boosted by higher risk appetite and after a bond
auction from Spain was well received.
 ""On the upside, potential above the recent high could be
for even further extension toward $3.2949/lb,"" brokerage Sucden
Financial said.
 Benchmark July arabicas on ICE climbed 5.20 cents or 1.8
percent to finish at $2.9945 per lb, the highest settlement for
the second position since 1977, after surging to $3.0250 a lb
earlier in the session.
 While global coffee supplies are adequate, there
availability of mild washed arabica remains limited after
several smaller-than-average crops in key producer Colombia.
 ""The funds continue to view coffee as a long-term buy while
producer selling is limited and scale-up,"" a London-based
broker said.
 July robusta coffee gained $30, or 1.2 percent, to settle
at $2,482 a tonne.
 Indonesia robusta beans stayed at premiums to London
futures as purchases from domestic roasters stirred trade,
while Vietnam could be under pressure from the prospect of a
bigger output in the next crop, dealers said.
 Sugar futures saw a short-covering bounce on the heels of
the rebound in crude oil, equities and the sharply weaker
dollar. Total volume for raw sugar, however, was at the lowest
level in more than two weeks, preliminary Thomson Reuters data
showed.
 ""Sugar is caught up in a commodities wide bounce,"" said
James Kirkup, head of sugar brokerage at ABM AMRO (Markets) UK
Ltd.
 Dealers noted tight supplies of ethanol in top sugar
producer Brazil could encourage mills to maximize ethanol
production in the cane crush.
 They said ample cane supplies in the pipeline from Brazil
and Thailand put price risk to the downside for sugar futures.
 The ICE May raw sugar contract jumped 0.93 cent to end at
25.20 cents per lb, while benchmark July surged 0.91 cent, or 4
percent, to finish at 23.53 cents. This was the second
position's biggest daily percentage gain since Jan. 1.
 NYSE Liffe August white sugar futures climbed $13.70 or 2.2
percent at $638.70 a tonne.
 COCOA EXTENDS GAINS
 Cocoa prices extended gains, fueled by the commodities
rally, strong support at the 200-day moving average, and as
dealers awaited news on the resumption of exports and the
condition of the mid crop in top grower Ivory Coast.
 ""The fundamentals are bearish but at these prices there
should be industry buying here to support the market, unless
we're looking at a maybe 200,000-tonne surplus,"" Gentile said.
 The country is beginning to recover from a violent
post-election power struggle that ended last week with the
arrest of former President Laurent Gbagbo. The first shipments
of cocoa are expected within days although normal volumes are
not expected before the end of April.
 ""Supply risk plummets, but uncertainty persists in Cote
d'Ivoire,"" said Abah Ofon, commodities analyst at Standard
Chartered Bank.
 ICE July cocoa futures rose $39 to finish at $3,106 a
tonne, while NYSE Liffe July cocoa reversed to close down 7

(Recasts, adds quotes, details, updates prices)
 By Karl Plume
 CHICAGO, April 20 (Reuters) - U.S. wheat futures surged 1.5
percent on Wednesday in a broad-based commodities rally fueled
by a sinking dollar, higher stock markets and adverse weather
which threatened wheat production across the globe.
 Gold jumped to record highs above $1,500 an ounce while oil
jumped 3 percent, helping to send grain markets higher from the
opening bell.
 But as soybeans clung to early gains, up 1.6 percent, corn
turned lower as a drier U.S. Midwest weather forecast eased
concerns about corn planting delays which could have shifted
more U.S. acreage to soybean cultivation.
 ""The midday weather forecasts are starting to show a little
change in pattern from May 1 forward. The European model is
basically saying we're turning more toward warmer and drier,""
said Charlie Sernatinger, analyst with ABN AMRO.
 ""There's liquidation of corn/wheat and corn/beans (spreads)
going on today,"" he said.
 Corn gained on soy this week on worries that wet weather
and cooler-than-normal temperatures would delay planting in the
U.S. Midwest, potentially threatening yields in the world's top
exporter at a time when supplies are exceptionally tight.
 ""It is definitely very wet there now and should remain wet
there through the first week in May. However, our current
forecast does begin to trend that area drier by mid May,""
Donald Kenney, senior agricultural meteorologist for Cropcast
Inc, told the Reuters global ag forum on Wednesday.
 Chicago Board of Trade corn for May delivery fell 0.7
percent to $7.44 a bushel by 12:24 p.m. CDT (1724 GMT), while
May soybeans climbed 1.2 percent to $13.58 a bushel in its
strongest advance in nearly two weeks.
 WHEAT WEATHER WOES
 But as weather fears eased in corn, wheat rallied for a
fourth consecutive day as dry weather scorched developing
winter wheat crops in the United States and Europe and soggy
conditions delayed seeding of spring-planted wheat in the
United States and Canada.
 ""We're into a weather market and it's expected to hurt
winter wheat,"" said Virginia McGathey, a wheat options trader
and president of McGathey Commodities.
 ""There had been a big position short May wheat and long May
corn and they're unwinding that now. They're unwinding
corn/wheat spreads and that is adding support to wheat,""
McGathey said.
 CBOT May wheat rose 0.8 percent to $7.92-1/4 a bushel,
extending a four-day rally that was the largest in two weeks.

several smaller-than-average crops in key producer Colombia.

producer selling is limited and scale-up,"" a London-based
broker said.
 July robusta coffee gained $37, or 1.5 percent, at $2,489 a
tonne at 1524 GMT.
 Indonesia robusta beans stayed at premiums to London
futures as purchases from domestic roasters stirred trade,
while Vietnam could be under pressure from the prospect of a
bigger output in the next crop, dealers said.
 COCOA EXTENDS GAINS
 Cocoa prices extended gains, fueled by the commodities
rally, strong support at the 200-day moving average, and as
dealers awaited news on the resumption of exports and the
condition of the mid crop in top grower Ivory Coast.
 ""The fundamentals are bearish but at these prices there
should be industry buying here to support the market, unless
we're looking at a maybe 200,000-tonne surplus,"" Gentile said.
 The country is beginning to recover from a violent
post-election power struggle that ended last week with the
arrest of former President Laurent Gbagbo. The first shipments
of cocoa are expected within days although normal volumes are
not expected before the end of April.
 ""Supply risk plummets, but uncertainty persists in Cote
d'Ivoire,"" said Abah Ofon, commodities analyst at Standard
Chartered Bank.
 ICE July cocoa futures gained $50, or 1.6 percent, at
$3,117 a tonne at 1522 GMT, while NYSE Liffe July cocoa inched
up 6 pounds or 0.3 percent to 1,935 pounds a tonne.
 Sugar futures saw a short-covering bounce, helped by the
rebound in crude oil, equities and the weaker dollar.
 ""Sugar is caught up in a commodities wide bounce,"" said
James Kirkup, head of sugar brokerage at ABM AMRO (Markets) UK
Ltd.
 Dealers noted tight supplies of ethanol in top sugar
producer Brazil could encourage mills to maximize ethanol
production in the cane crush.
 They said ample cane supplies in the pipeline from Brazil
and Thailand put price risk to the downside for sugar futures.
 ICE May raw sugar futures jumped 0.59 cent, or 2.4 percent,
at 24.86 cents a lb, while benchmark July rose 0.56 cent, or
2.5 percent, to 23.18 cents per lb at 1521 GMT. NYSE Liffe
August white sugar futures climbed $10 or 1.6 percent at
$635.00 a tonne in moderate volume of 2,500 lots.

 LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - Arabica coffee prices hit a
34-year high on Wednesday, supported by a commodities rally
fuelled by a weaker dollar, stronger oil and equities, bullish
technicals, and by a shortage of high quality beans.
 Cocoa extended gains amid the commodities rally and as
dealers awaited news of top producer Ivory Coast's resumption of
exports and the condition of its mid crop. Sugar also rose on
improving investor sentiment toward riskier assets.
 Upbeat earnings from companies lifted stocks and boosted
appetite for riskier assets on Wednesday, driving commodities
higher and the Australian dollar to a 29-year high versus the
dollar.
 ICE arabica coffee futures prices broke above the
psychological $3.00 a lb, maintaining their upward momentum.
 ""People just want to buy, that's basically it. The dollar's
at a new low. People want to own things. You don't want to be
short,"" said Nick Gentile, head of trading at Atlantic Capital
Advisors in Jersey City.
 The euro surged to its highest in 15 months against a weaker
dollar on Wednesday, boosted by higher risk appetite and after a
bond auction from Spain was well received by investors.
 ""On the upside, potential above the recent high could be for
even further extension toward $3.2949/lb,"" brokerage Sucden
Financial said.
 Benchmark July arabicas on ICE traded up 7.05 cent or 2.4
percent at $3.0130 a lb at 1407 GMT, after peaking at $3.0245 a
lb earlier in the session.
 While there are adequate global supplies of coffee to meet
demand, there continued to be limited availability of mild
washed arabica, after key producer Colombia had several
smaller-than-average crops.
 ""The funds continue to view coffee as a long-term buy while
producer selling is limited and scale-up,"" the broker said.
 July robusta coffee traded up $30, or 1.2 percent, at $2,482

 The first shipments of cocoa are expected within days, but
after months of stalled trade, normal export volumes from Ivory
Coast are not expected to be reached any sooner than the end of
April.

 ""The dollar is quite a bit weaker. The stock market is

 (Updates prices)
 By Jan Harvey
 LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - Gold rose above $1,500 an ounce
on Wednesday for the first time ever as the dollar wilted, oil
rose, worries over the U.S. economic outlook boosted demand for
the metal as a haven and rising inflation lifted Asian demand.
 The Reuters-Jeffries CRB index was on track for its biggest
one-day gain in a fortnight as commodity prices rallied.
 Spot gold 
 Silver tracked gold higher, extending a stellar performance
that has seen the grey metal outperform other precious metals
this year. Silver hit a 31-year high at $44.79 an ounce and was
later bid at $44.72 against $43.89.
 Gold prices are up 5 percent in April and look set to extend
gains as the metal's appeal as a haven from risk was boosted by
talk that Greece may have to restructure its debt and Standard &
Poor's threat to downgrade America's triple-A credit rating.
 ""Gold has been acting as a currency in its own right, and
that is why we are up at $1,500,"" said Simon Weeks, head of
precious metals at the Bank of Nova Scotia. ""There is an awful
lot of bad news in the price. The S&P comment the other day has
given us the final kicker to get up here.""
 While investors in the United States and Europe are seeing
the metal chiefly as a safe store of value and a hedge against
currency devaluation, stronger inflation and rising consumer
incomes in China and India are also boosting demand there.
 ""The theme of longer term higher inflation than we have seen
in the last 10 years in China is a pretty solid view, so gold is
going to be an asset class that is probably going to be more in
favour in China than it has been in the past,"" said Macquarie
analyst Hayden Atkins.
 China is the world's second-biggest gold consumer behind
India, as well as being the biggest producer.
 
 RISING OIL, WEAKER DOLLAR
 In the short term, losses in the dollar on Wednesday are
supporting the precious metal above $1,500 an ounce. The dollar
is usually sold off when risk appetite firms, as reflected in a
rise in stock markets on Wednesday.
 The dollar slid to its lowest in 15 months against the euro
as the single currency was boosted by higher risk appetite and
after a bond auction from Spain was well received by investors.
 Weakness in the dollar boosts gold's appeal as an
alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper
for holders of other currencies. Gold priced in euros and
sterling remained off recent highs on Wednesday.
 Oil prices also recovered, rising back towards the
multi-year highs they hit earlier this year as unrest in the
Middle East and North Africa sparked fears of a supply outage.
 Higher oil prices tend to benefit gold, both because they
can boost commodities as an asset class and lift interest in
gold as a hedge against oil-led inflation.
 The gold:silver ratio -- the number of silver ounces needed
to buy an ounce of gold -- meanwhile fell to its lowest since
1983 below 34.
 ""The last time silver was this expensive in relation to gold
was almost 28 years ago,"" said Commerzbank in a note. ""Both
precious metals are still reaping the benefit of the news of
recent weeks and days.""
 Platinum was at $1,800.99 an ounce against $1,761.50, while
palladium was at $754.97 against $726.95.

 By Melanie Burton
 LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - Copper rose to its highest in
a week on Wednesday after U.S. housing sector data showed more
signs of revival in that market and the dollar weakened, while
aluminium hit new two-and-a-half-year highs.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at
$9,577 per tonne from a close of $9,340 on Tuesday.
 Copper, which is used in power and construction, had fallen
to a one-month trough at $9,207 a tonne on Monday.
 ""The LME complex is trading higher as improved economic data
in the U.S. and Europe adds to the impact of good earnings
reports for the first quarter,"" Citi analyst David Thurtell
said.
 Sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose more than expected
in March, a trade group said on Wednesday, raising cautious
optimism a recovery may be in sight for the housing market.
 Data on Tuesday showed U.S. housing starts and permits for
future home construction rose more than expected in March,
raising prospects that consumption in the world's second major
market for metals was gathering pace.
 In broader markets, risk sentiment improved, underpinning
investor appetite for the metals, and the dollar weakened,
making metals cheaper for holders of other currencies.
 The euro surged to its highest in 15 months against the
dollar boosted by higher risk appetite and after a bond auction
from Spain was well received by investors.
 Upbeat U.S. and European corporate earnings also helped
soothe market sentiment shaken after rating agency S&P warned it
could cut U.S. sovereign credit rating and as speculation
intensified that Greece would need to restructure its debt.
 ""In Europe, they're persistently hawkish, but there is
massive concern regarding peripheral debt...the dollar has a big
chance of rebounding in the second half of the year,"" said
Andrey Kryuchenkov at VTB Capital.

 ALUMINIUM HITS FRESH HIGIHS
 Aluminium, which is used in transport, packaging and
construction, has been lifted by rising power prices, which
account for about 35 percent of aluminium smelting costs.
 A Chinese directive to pare back new smelting plants may
also have helped fuel its advance, Citi's Thurtell said.
 ""The aluminium market has hit new highs for the cycle as the
LME complex lifts and as Beijing looks to limit new capacity in
the domestic aluminium industry,"" he said.
 China on Wednesday, in a circular posted on a government
website, called on central and provincial authorities to stop
approving the construction of new aluminium smelting capacity.
 ""(The move) limits the probability of Chinese expansions
taking the world into chronic oversupply,"" he said.
 ""The authorities are concerned that artificial tightness
induced by financing/rent deals in the Western world could
encourage over-expansion and an eventual bust.""
 China accounted for around two-thirds of global aluminium
output last year.
 Aluminium closed at $2,730 a tonne, up from $2,714 at the
close on Tuesday. It earlier hit its highest level in two and a
half years at $2,745 a tonne. 
 Zinc closed at $2,360 a tonne from $2,329, despite a large
26,550-tonne shipment of the metal into New Orleans warehouses.
LME stockpiles now stand at 812,100 tonnes, their highest level
since 1995.
 ""Galvanised production is not doing too badly but zinc is a
supply driven market... and there is just too much out there,""
said Michael Widmer, analyst at BoA-Merrill Lynch.
 Tin closed at $32,650 from $32,400 while stainless steel
material nickel changed hands at $26,400 from $25,300.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, April 20 (Reuters) - Spot gold prices breached
$1,500 for the first time and silver hit a 31-year high on
Wednesday, supported by a weak dollar and concerns over a
sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone.	
 Lofty oil prices, inflation concerns, worries over the euro
zone sovereign debt crisis as well as political tensions in
places like the Middle East should keep gold strong for the time
being, analysts said.	
 ""There are not a great deal of reasons to sell it at the
moment, apart from concerns that there are a lot of longs in the
market and there is a risk of sell-off at some point,"" said
Darren Heathcote, head of trading at Investec Australia.	
 Spot gold rose to $1,500.16 an ounce before easing
slightly to $1,499.10 by 0513 GMT, up 0.4 percent. U.S. gold
futures  rose to a record of $1,500.90.	
 The dollar index , a measure of the greenback against
a basket of currencies, softened towards its 16-month low hit
last week, boosting the appeal of gold in non-dollar denominated
currencies. 
 Technical analysis also points to a further rally in gold
targeting $1,518, according to Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.
[ID:nL3E7FK04D]	
 
 Some market watchers see gold consolidating at its current
level as it waits for the next reason to push higher.	
 ""I don't see prices convincingly past that level in the next
few days unless we see something very negative, probably related
to the euro zone sovereign debt. But we do see gold very well
supported at the $1,490 level,"" said Natalie Robertson,
commodities strategist at ANZ.	
 Fears over a potential downgrade of the U.S. credit rating
eased after U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner tried to
reassure investors the country's two parties were making
progress on reducing the deficit, she added. [ID:nN19146862]

 SILVER HITS 31-YEAR HIGH 
 Silver continued to charge ahead, rising to a 31-year high
for the fifth consecutive session, as investors continued to
favour gold's less expensive cousin.	
 Spot silver rose to $44.34, a level unseen since
1980, before easing slightly to $44.25, up 0.8 percent.	
 Analysts and traders expected silver to continue to shine,
as investors favour the metal, which benefits both from safe
haven demand and growing industrial consumption. [ID:nL3E7FI1AA]	
 ""Silver is still in a clear bull trend that targets $50.00
next,"" said Taso Anastasiou, a UBS technical strategist.	
 He said the medium-term trend was bullish, but warned that
silver might go through a correction in the near term as the
metal has been very overbought.	
 ""My key medium-term support level lies at $33.00 and while
it is difficult to identify what would cause silver to sell off
aggressively, there is an increased chance we will see
a correction towards the $35.00 to $33.00 area.""	
 The Relative Strength Index on spot silver rose to above 84,
a level unseen since February 2008, indicating a heavily
overbought market.

 By Carole Vaporean and Silvia Antonioli
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Copper closed higher on
Tuesday, regaining some ground after six straight losing sessions
as a weaker dollar lent early support and robust U.S. housing
starts pushed prices to session highs.
 Investors remained cautious amid debt problems in the United
States and Europe, limiting the red metal's gains.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange finished at
$9,340 a tonne from $9,225 at the close on Monday. U.S. May copper
futures ended 3.15 cents, or 0.75 percent, higher at $4.2295 per
lb.
 ""I think copper's getting a bounce off of positive housing
numbers today. Earnings have been pretty good. Unfortunately, we
have these debt problems and we'll see how those shake out. But
for now, the market is choosing to look past it,"" said Matthew
Zeman, head of trading with Kingsview Financial in Chicago.
 U.S. housing starts and permits for future home construction
rose more than expected in March, snapping back from the prior
month's winter-depressed levels, government data showed.
 U.S. housing starts rose 7.2 percent in March to an annual
rate of 549,000 units, up from February's upwardly revised pace of
512,000 units and up from the 520,000-unit rate forecast.
 ""Although small in magnitude, any gain will suffice given
February permits sank to what was originally thought to be a
record low of 517,000. Therefore, the slightest increase in volume
is good news,"" said Vimombi Nshom, economist at IFR Economics, a
unit of Thomson Reuters.
 In the previous session, copper fell almost 2 percent to its
lowest in a month.
 ""The market panicked a bit yesterday, and they're feeling a
little less panicked today,"" said BNP Paribas analyst Stephen
Briggs.
 ""The reserve requirement rise in China and the S&P move was
something (metals) had to react to, but the default position is
that things are not as bad as all that.""
 Standard & Poor's threatened on Monday to downgrade the U.S.
prized AAA credit rating, raising concerns over the debt situation
of the world's largest economy and second largest consumer of
copper.
 Earlier this week, China's central bank announced an increase
in bank reserve requirement ratios (RRR).
 A report that Greece may have to restructure its debt also
weighed on market confidence.
 But world markets bounced back from the previous session's
trouncing after better-than-expected earnings results from
investment banking bellwether Goldman Sachs.
 In metals markets, expectations of a supply deficit this year
and an optimistic long-term demand outlook provided support.
 COPPER CONTANGO
 Increasing copper inventories, however, have raised concerns
about some short-term demand weakness from China. Inventories of
copper on the London Metal Exchange rose 175 tonnes to 451,950
tonnes, its highest since June, the latest data showed. Inventory
levels have been on the rise since December.
 ""Either demand for copper is lower than expected, off-exchange
inventory is being moved on-exchange, or supply is greater than
expected,"" said Bernstein Research in a note.
 ""Two of these three possible reasons would imply that there is
a significant downside to copper prices from current levels.""
 The latest data showed copper was in a $21.50 contango, which
is a discount for cash over three-month material, versus
December's $70 backwardation, which is a premium for cash over
three-month copper, reflecting a dearth of nearby demand.
 Tin traded at $32,600 from $32,350, while zinc changed hands
at $2,330 from $2,325, Monday's close.
 Inventories of zinc on the London Metal Exchange rose 21,300
tonnes to 785,600, the most recent data showed, and are now within
2,000 tonnes of 2004 peaks.
 Battery material lead traded at $2,552 from $2,528. The price
of metal for tomorrow versus next day delivery traded as high as
$10, indicating a lack of immediate supply.
 Aluminium recovered to $2,682 from $2,674.
 Nickel was bid at $25,500 from $25,500.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Copper rose close to 1 percent on
Tuesday, clawing back some ground after six straight sessions of losses, helped
initially by the weaker dollar, then pushed to session highs after
stronger-than-forecast U.S. housing starts.
 Investors remained nervous about debt problems in the United States and
Europe, limiting the red metal's gains.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange traded last traded at
$9,340 a tonne at 1649 GMT (1249 EDT) from $9,225 at the close on Monday. U.S.
copper futures were up 3.60 cents, or 0.86 percent, at $4.23.30 per lb.
 ""For the most part I think copper's getting a bounce off of positive
housing numbers today. Earnings have been pretty good. Unfortunately, we have
these debt problems and we'll see how those shake out. But for now, the market
is choosing to look past it,"" said Matthew Zeman, head of trading with
Kingsview Financial in Chicago.
 U.S. housing starts and permits for future home construction rose more than
expected in March, snapping back from the prior month's winter depressed
levels, government data showed.
 The Commerce Department said housing starts rose 7.2 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 549,000 units.
 In the previous session, copper fell almost 2 percent to its lowest in a
month.
 ""The market panicked a bit yesterday, and they're feeling a little less
panicked today,"" said BNP Paribas analyst Stephen Briggs.
 ""The reserve requirement rise in China and the S&P move was something
(metals) had to react to, but the default position is that things are not as
bad as all that.""
 Standard & Poor's threatened on Monday to downgrade the U.S. prized AAA
credit rating, raising concerns over the debt situation of the world's largest
economy and second largest consumer of copper.
 Earlier this week, China's central bank announced an increase in bank
reserve requirement ratios (RRR).
 ""Yesterday the bombshell of the U.S. downgrade caused mayhem in the market.
Today copper bounced back, supported by technicals but it is still vulnerable,""
an LME ring trader said.
 A report that Greece may have to restructure its debt also weighed on
market confidence.
 But world markets bounced back from the previous session's trouncing after
better-than-expected earnings results from investment banking bellwether
Goldman Sachs.
 In the metals markets, expectations of a supply deficit this year and an
optimistic long-term demand outlook provided support.
 ""The physical market looks quite good despite high inventory levels,"" said
Daniel Briesemann, an analyst at Commerzbank.
 ""We expect China to be a stable market player over the next few months. We
certainly do not expect demand from China to collapse.""
 COPPER CONTANGO
 Increasing copper inventories, however, have raised concerns about some
short-term demand weakness from China.
 Inventories of copper on the London Metal Exchange rose 175 tonnes to
451,950 tonnes, its highest since June, the latest data showed. Inventory
levels have been on the rise since December.
 ""In a market that is supposedly in deficit, it remains unclear why copper
inventories held on exchange have been increasing,"" said Bernstein Research in
a note.
 Either demand for copper is lower than expected, off-exchange inventory is
being moved on-exchange, or supply is greater than expected, it said.
 ""Two of these three possible reasons would imply that there is a
significant downside to copper prices from current levels.""
 Copper was in a $21.50 contango, which is a discount for cash over
three-month material, versus December's $70 backwardation, which is a premium
for cash over three-month copper, the latest data showed, reflecting a dearth
of nearby demand.
 Tin traded at $32,600 from $32,350, while zinc changed hands at $2,330 from
$2,325, Monday's close.
 Inventories of zinc on the London Metal Exchange rose 21,300 tonnes to
785,600, the most recent data showed, and are now within 2,000 tonnes of 2004
peaks.metal for tomorrow versus next day delivery traded as high as $10,
indicating a lack of immediately available supply.
 Aluminium recovered to $2,682 from $2,674.
 Nickel was bid at $25,500 from $25,500.

 LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Copper rose more than 1 percent
on Tuesday, clawing back some ground after six straight sessions
of losses as risk sentiment improved and the focus shifted to
long-term supportive fundamentals.
 But investors remained nervous about debt problems in the
United States and Europe.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at
$9,340 from $9,225 at the close on Monday, while aluminium
nudged to new two-and-a-half year highs.
 In the previous session, copper fell almost 2 percent to its
lowest in a month.

 Aluminium rebounded to $2,714 from $2,674, having hit
$2,724, the highest since August 2008 in the aftermarket.
 The metal used in transport, packaging and construction has
been boosted by rising power prices, which account for about 35
percent of total aluminium smelting costs.
 Tin ended at $32,400 from $32,350, while zinc closed at
$2,329 from $2,325, Monday's close.
 Inventories of zinc on the London Metal Exchange rose 21,300
tonnes to 785,600, the most recent data showed, and are now
within 2,000 tonnes of 2004 peaks.
 Battery material lead finished at $2,557 from $2,528. The
price of metal for tomorrow versus next day delivery traded as
high as $10, indicating a lack of immediately available supply.
 Senior traders said on Tuesday that Barclays Capital was
holding a dominant position in the lead market, controlling
80-90 percent of lead stock warrants and cash contracts on the
London Metal Exchange.
 Barclays declined to comment.

 Nickel closed at $25,300 from $25,500.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - Gold futures hit an all-time
high above $1,500 an ounce on Tuesday and silver surged on a
combination of dollar decline, crude oil gains and worries
about sovereign debt problems in Europe.
 After being initially pressured by technical selling,
bullion rose to a record for a second straight day on market
jitters after Standard & Poor's on Monday revised the credit
outlook of the United States to negative from stable.
 U.S. gold futures activity was quieter than usual as global
stock markets steadied following the previous session's equity
sell-off on S&P's move. The CBOE gold volatility index <.GVZ>,
a gauge of bullion investor anxiety, fell 2 percent after
surging to its highest level in four months on Monday.
 ""There is gaining evidence that the governments are not
gaining control of spending and the monetization of debt is in
full force. The world is starting to look more critically at
these things ... which are becoming real issues,"" said Robert
Lutts, chief investment officer of Cabot Money Management, a
wealth manager with $500 million in client assets.
 U.S. gold futures for June delivery  settled up $2.20
at $1,495.10, having earlier hit a record $1,500.50 an ounce.
 Spot gold  gained 0.11 cents to $1,495.19 an ounce by
3:03 p.m (1903 GMT), bouncing off a high of $1,499.31. Bullion
rose for a fifth consecutive session.
 Gold benefited as a safe haven from economic uncertainty
after fears mounted that Greece will have to restructure its
debt, maybe as early as this summer, and S&P threatened to cut
the United States' AAA credit rating on Monday.
 Silver  set a 31-year high of $43.92 an ounce, and
was later up 1.3 percent at $43.90.
 Silver has outperformed gold this year, up more than 40
percent so far against gold's 5 percent rise. The gold/silver
ratio slipped to a 28-year low below 35 on Monday.

 CRUDE OIL GAINS, DOLLAR DROPS
 Rising U.S. crude prices also lifted gold, which is often
seen as a hedge against oil-led inflation. Signs that inflation
is becoming a major issue in emerging markets, particularly
China, has been identified as another support to the precious
metal.
 Gold remained far below its all-time inflation-adjusted
high, estimated at almost $2,500 an ounce, set in 1980, an era
of Cold War tension, oil shocks and hyperinflation.
 Cabot's Lutts said that gold could benefit from an
increasing allocation by institutional investors as a wealth
preservation strategy. Many pension plans and school endowment
funds invest primarily in equities and fixed-income securities
and have not yet ventured into gold.
 Bullion also benefited from a stronger euro against the
dollar after the euro zone composite PMI private-sector
economic indicator nudged up. [FRX/]
 Dennis Gartman, publisher of the Gartman Letter, said that
he will buy gold in euro terms  on any correction
toward 1,025 euros after a breach of 1,050 euros on Monday.
Euro-priced gold traded at around 1,040 euros on Tuesday.
 Among other precious metals, platinum  slipped 0.4
percent to $1,766.24 an ounce, while palladium  dropped
1.3 percent to $730.47.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, April 19 (Reuters) - Spot gold firmed slightly
below its record high on Tuesday, as worries over sovereign debt
in both Europe and the United States continued to lure investors
to bullion.	
 Spot gold gained nearly 1 percent in early trade,
before trimming gains to $1,490.95 an ounce by 0559 GMT, up 0.7
percent. It hit a record high of $1,497.20 in the previous
session. U.S. gold futures  were little changed at
$1,492.10.	
 Concerns about inflation also helped gold shine.	
 ""There is so much news that is in favour of gold,"" said a
Singapore-based dealer.	
 ""Gold is still the safe-haven of choice."" 
 Just as talk heated up on whether Greece might need to
restructure its debt, Standard & Poor's threatened to cut the
United States' prized AAA credit rating, sending the
19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index down 1 percent
on Monday. 
 The CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street's favorite barometer
of investor anxiety known as the VIX , jumped as much as
24.5 percent on Monday after S&P warned about the towering U.S.
budget deficit. [ID:nN18211358][ID:nN18212074] 
 China raised banks' reserve requirement ratio on Sunday to a
record level in its fourth such move this year aimed at
wrestling down inflation, while some U.S. Federal Reserve
officials have warned about more pressing inflation risks in
coming months. [ID:nN18212836]	
 But there is little sign the Fed could cut short its $600
billion bond purchase programme, due to be completed in June.	
 Crude oil prices extended losses on worries that high oil
prices would threaten global economic recovery, which supports
the strength in gold prices.	
 Technical analysis indicated gold's bullish target remained
intact at $1,518, according to Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.
[ID:nL3E7FJ02A]	
 
 CORRECTION LOOMS	
 Spot gold marched up about $40 over the last seven days, and
silver hit 31-year highs in the past three consecutive sessions.
Although the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment supports
safe-haven demand in such metals, a correction may be looming,
some traders and analysts said.	
 ""We may see a correction before the Easter holiday,"" said
Ronald Leung, a dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.
""Prices have been rising too fast and too much.""	
 Downside room will be limited for both gold and silver, with
$1,480 providing strong support to gold, and $40 to silver,
traders said.	
 Some physical selling was spotted, as market participants
took profit and waited for the next buying opportunities when
prices pull back, dealers said. 
 Spot silver declined 0.8 percent to $42.96 an ounce,
after hitting a 31-year high of $43.51 in the previous session,
as weakness in the equities market weighed on precious metals
with industrial applications, such as silver and platinum group
metals.	
 Spot palladium fell to a nearly one-month low of
$728.64, before regaining some lost ground to $732.72, down 1
percent from the previous close.

 By Chris Kelly and Rebekah Curtis
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Copper fell for the
sixth straight session on Monday to a one-month low after a credit
agency's negative credit outlook for the United States added to
concerns about demand prospects.
 Mounting concerns about Europe's debt problems added to that
uncertainty, as unease over Greek debt and Portugal's pending
bailout by the European Union exacerbated anxiety over how
European policymakers will handle the region's festering debt and
bank problems.
 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's revised its credit outlook on
the United States to negative from stable, citing a ""material
risk"" that policymakers may not reach agreement on a plan to trim
the country's large budget deficit.
 ""It just kind of pulled the rug out from under everything,""
said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist with Lind Waldock
in Chicago.
 Copper was already under some mild pressure overnight after
China, the world's largest consumer, moved to raise banks' reserve
requirements for the fourth time this year, extending its fight
against excessive liquidity and stubbornly high inflation.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index lost more than 1 percent
Monday in its sharpest one-day loss in about a week.
 London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month copper hit a session
trough at $9,207 a tonne, its lowest since March 17, before ending
down $180 at $9,225.
 COMEX May copper dropped 5.95 cents, or 1.4 percent, to settle
at $4.1980 per lb, near the bottom of its $4.1720 to $4.2880
session range.
 Trading volumes picked up in the sell-off, with a little more
than 61,600 lots traded by 2:05 p.m. EDT (1805 GMT), about 35
percent above the 30-day average, according to preliminary Thomson
Reuters data.
 The S&P's worrisome outlook for long-term U.S. debt added
another head wind to a market still coping with sluggish physical
demand from China's monetary tightening campaign and economic
recovery uncertainties tied to Japan's earthquake and subsequent
tsunami last month.
 ""This provided a bit of a negative backdrop because obviously
the U.S. is still a significant consumer (of copper) and it is a
driver of financial sentiment,"" said Credit Agricole analyst Robin
Bhar.
 Bart Melek, vice president and director of commodities, rates
research & strategy with TD Bank Financial Group, agreed.
 ""Eventually, this kind of stuff has an impact on the real
economy, and it's the real economy that drives everything.""
 The United States is the second-largest copper consumer, with
North America accounting for some 13 percent of global refined
consumption. But China eclipses that by far, accounting for 38
percent.
 PHYSICAL INTEREST
 The amount of copper held to back the physical exchange-traded
product of ETF Securities rose more than 250 tonnes to 3,251.550
tonnes on Monday, the company's website showed on Monday.
 But this was more than overshadowed by the 1,350-tonne build
in LME copper warehouses, bringing total inventory levels to
451,775 tonnes, their highest since June 2010.
 The majority of these inflows went into warehouses in Asia,
supporting investor fears of a sustained softness in Chinese
demand.
 Also, the potential that stockpiles of copper held in bonded
warehouses in Shanghai could be unlocked and released to the
market created additional concerns.
 ""We believe there is around 550,000 tonnes of copper sitting
in bonded warehouses as of mid-April 2011, virtually unchanged
from mid-March this year, but significantly higher than the level
at end 2010 of estimated 400,000 and averaging 200,000-300,000 in
the past,"" said Macquarie bank in a note.
 ""Most of the material ... is available for sale, so once the
arbitrage starts to move in favour of import, the bonded stock
could easily become customs cleared and sold onto the domestic
physical market,"" it added.

 By Marcy Nicholson and Sarah McFarlane
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Coffee and sugar
futures reversed lower on Monday after Standard & Poor's
revised its ratings outlook on the United States to negative
from stable, hitting investor confidence.
 Cocoa prices closed lower in thin volume on pressure from
the weak macroeconomic scene as well as expectation that
exports from top grower Ivory Coast appear likely to resume in
the near future after a ban of nearly three months from a
bitter power struggle there was recently lifted.
 The U.S. dollar pared gains against the euro and hit
session lows against the yen, while gold prices hit a record,
after Standard & Poor's revised its rating outlook on the U.S.,
prompting aversion for riskier asset classes including
commodities. S&P affirmed the 'AAA/A-1+' sovereign credit
rating of the U.S.
 ""People are turning negative on commodities in general,
particularly as economies are slowing and U.S. growth will be
disappointing,"" Jonathan Kingsman, head of the Swiss-based
Kingsman SA consultancy said. ""It's possible that commodities
generally are going off the boil.""
 ICE July arabica coffee reversed earlier gains to trade
down 4.40 cents or 1.5 percent at $2.8670 per lb at 1642 GMT.
Liffe July robustas closed down $43 or 1.7 percent at $2,425 a
tonne.
 ""All risky assets would drive away a little bit of
interest,"" said Rodrigo Costa, vice-president of Institutional
Sales for Newedge USA. ""That would be the reason to see coffee
down, and sugar too.""
 July arabica hit a five-week high at $2.9310 per lb earlier
in the session, flirting with last month's 34-year top for the
second position at $2.9665 per lb, but fell easily on
profit-taking and risk aversion, dealers said.
 ""There's some negative macro news out there today. It
certainly helps to take some chips off the table where you
can,"" one U.S. dealer said.
 In sugar, dealers saw additional downside price risk due to
expectations of ample global supplies and saw key support in
ICE July raw sugar futures at 21 cents a lb.
 ICE May raw sugar futures fell 0.17 cent or 0.7 percent to
24.42 cents a lb, after hitting a five month low at 24.00.
London August white sugar fell $10.70 or 1.7 percent to close
at $622.00 per tonne as the market digested the May delivery
data from NYSE Liffe.
 Liffe said 375,150 tonnes of white sugar were delivered
against the expiry of the May contract including Thai sugars.
 IVORY COAST WATCH
 Top cocoa producer Ivory Coast was in focus as dealers
awaited news after president Alassane Ouattara said last
Wednesday that everything was in place for the immediate
resumption of cocoa exports.
 French container shipping group CMA CGM said on Monday its
first ship would arrive in Ivory Coast on April 19 following
the group's resumption of services to the country.
 ""The ships are going to start to export. It's only going to
help to loosen up the price a little bit, loosen up the
switches. Psychologically it gives some weight to the market as
well,"" the U.S. dealer said.
 ICE July cocoa futures tumbled $100, or 3.2 percent, to
settle at $3,057 a tonne, while Liffe cocoa dropped 48 pounds,
or 2.4 percent, to end at 1,931 pounds per tonne.
 ""Volumes are terrible, so any weak selling can trigger
stops,"" a second London-based broker said, adding people were
reluctant to trade cocoa without more information on Ivory
Coast.
 News on the state of the country's coming mid crop was also
keenly awaited, traders said.

 By Sarah McFarlane and David Brough
 LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Cocoa prices fell on Monday on
thin volumes as dealers awaited news on the situation in top
producer Ivory Coast, where cocoa exports are yet to resume.
 Arabica coffee prices edged towards a 34-year high hit in
March as bullish technicals supported the market, while sugar
was steady as a larger-than-expected Thai crop weighed.
 Top cocoa producer Ivory Coast was in focus as dealers
awaited news on the resumption of trade activity after president
Alassane Ouattara said last Wednesday that everything was in
place for the immediate resumption of cocoa exports.
 ""It's still a volatile situation ... it's probably going to
take a while for things to normalise,"" a London-based broker
said, adding it would be surprising if exports resumed within
the next couple of days.
 ICE July cocoa futures fell $38, or 1.2 percent, to $3,119 a
tonne at 1126 GMT.
 ""Volumes are terrible, so any weak selling can trigger
stops,"" a second London-based broker said, adding people were
reluctant to trade cocoa without more information on Ivory
Coast.
 News on the state of the country's coming mid crop was also
keenly awaited.
 Liffe July cocoa was down 19 pounds at 1,960 pounds a tonne.
 
 COFFEE, SUGAR
 Coffee prices edged higher as dealers said the market looked
overbought but technicals remained bullish.
 ""It's a question of whether it could break the recent high;
for the moment it looks like it could get there,"" a London-based
broker said referring to the 34-year high of $2.9665 a lb hit on
March 9.
 A bullish target at $2.9685 per lb is unchanged for New
York coffee based on its wave pattern and a Fibonacci projection
analysis, Reuters analyst Wang Tao said.
 ""A lot of the move is being led by speculators and funds,""
the broker said.
 Dealers said that while there was enough coffee available to
meet global consumption, there remained a shortage of
high-quality beans deliverable against the ICE arabica contract.
""They (ICE) definitely need to widen the scope of the
contract,"" a London-based analyst said.
 ICE July arabica coffee rose 0.10 cents or 0.03 percent to
$2.9120 per lb at 1128 GMT, while Liffe July robustas were up $4
or 0.2 percent at $2,472 a tonne.
 ICE July raw sugar futures were slightly higher as a bumper
Thai crop capped gains.
 ""A larger-than-expected Thai crop is keeping a lid on the
market,"" a sugar futures dealer said, adding that the cane
harvest in the centre-south of Brazil, the world's top producer
and exporter of the sweetener, appeared to be progressing well.
 Thailand, the world's second-biggest sugar exporter, expects
record output of 9.0 million tonnes in its current 2010/11 crop,
up 30 percent from the previous crop, senior officials and
traders said on Monday.
 ICE May raw sugar futures rose 0.15 cent or 0.6 percent to
24.74 cents a lb. 
 Dealers saw downside price risk due to expectations of ample
global supplies and saw key support in ICE July raw sugar
futures at 21 cents a lb.
 On the white sugar market the focus was the delivery against
expiry of the London May contract on April 15.
 Dealers said they believed that just over 350,000 tonnes had
been delivered in total, and probably included Indian, Thai and
Guatemalan sugars.
 An announcement on delivery details was expected from Liffe
later on Monday.
 London May white sugar fell $0.10 or 0.02 percent to $632.60
per tonne.

 NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - Gold prices rallied to a
record high $1,497.20 an ounce on Monday after Standard &
Poor's downgraded its credit outlook for the United States and
as investors worried about debt in the euro zone and inflation
in China.
 S&P said it might eventually cut its long-term rating on
the United States within two years, prompting investors to buy
gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty. The ratings
agency cited a risk that policymakers may not reach agreement
on a plan to slash the huge federal budget deficit.

 The CBOE gold volatility index <.GVZ>, a bullion market
fear gauge, surged to its highest level in four months, up 8
percent for its biggest one-day rise since March 1.
 ""It's a wake up call that we need to do something in the

 Spot gold  rose 0.8 percent at $1,495.20 an ounce by
2:52 p.m. EDT (1852 GMT), its fourth session of gains.
 U.S. gold futures for June delivery  settled up $6.90
an ounce at $1,492.90, with volume approaching a busy 200,000

 Gold rose even as the Reuters/Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>

 ""The U.S. debt situation got a reality check this morning
from the move by S&P,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again
Capital in New York.
 ""Only precious metals will be seen as attractive in the
aftermath of the outlook downgrade. The overall economic
outlook becomes more opaque with this; equities and energies
will be very much under pressure now,"" Kilduff said.
 Gold prices were also underpinned after Atlanta Federal
Reserve President Dennis Lockhart said economic growth may have
been slower than expected early this year. Investors took this
as an indication that the Fed is not likely to rush to scale
back its vast support for the economy. [ID:nN18212836]
 Bullion prices have almost doubled since the Fed cut
interest rates to the bone in 2008 to boost economic growth.
 DOLLAR RISE, CHINA TIGHTENING
 Gold gained support from talk that Greece may be forced to
restructure its debt and on uncertainty over a bailout for
Portugal. [ID:nLDE73H0IC]
 ""There is ongoing concern that the (European) debt problems
haven't been fixed. The negative outlook just undermines the
role of the dollar as a safe-haven currency,"" said Leo Larkin,
metals equity analyst of Standard & Poor's.
 Defying market expectations, the dollar remained broadly
higher as mounting concerns about Greece's fiscal conditions
more than offset S&P's move. [FRX/]
 Larkin, whose work is separate from that of S&P's sovereign
rating unit, said he expected gold to hit a record $1,600 an
ounce by year-end on inflation worries and low real interest
rates.
 Gold remained far below its all-time inflation-adjusted
high, estimated at almost $2,500 an ounce, set in 1980, an era
of Cold War tension, oil shocks and hyperinflation. (Graphic:

 Gold also got a boost from concerns about inflation in
emerging markets. China raised banks' required reserves on
Sunday for the fourth time this year, extending the fight
against stubbornly high inflation. [ID:nL3E7FH05Y]
 Among other precious metals, silver  gained 0.5

 By Rebekah Curtis and Silvia Antonioli
 LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Copper fell to a one-month low
on Monday after rating agency Standard & Poor's revised its
outlook on the United States, the world's largest economy, to
negative and under the pressure of a stronger U.S. dollar.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell to
$9,207 a tonne, its lowest since March 17. It then closed at
$9,225 a tonne from Friday's close at $9,450.
 In downgrading the outlook for the United States to
negative, S&P said it believes there is a risk U.S. policymakers
may not reach agreement on how to address the country's
long-term fiscal pressures.
 ""This provided a bit of a negative backdrop because
obviously the U.S. is still a significant consumer (of copper)
and it is a driver of financial sentiment,"" said Credit Agricole
analyst Robin Bhar.
 ""I don't think this a huge supply problem but nevertheless
every shifting view is a bit of a shock,"" he said. 
 The U.S. is the second-largest copper consumer, with North
America accounting for some 13 percent of global refined
consumption. But China eclipses that by far, accounting for 38
percent.
 Copper was already lower on Monday after China raised banks'
reserve requirements on Sunday for the fourth time this year,
extending its fight against excessive liquidity and stubbornly
high inflation.
""We expect limited upside for base metals in the short term,
as high oil prices, the earthquake in Japan and tighter monetary
policy in China and Western Europe take some heat out of the
market,"" Citi analysts said in a note.
 ""The recent record highs could be revisited in H2 provided
monetary policy tightening in China is not excessive.""
 Also weighing on metals, the dollar strengthened against a
basket of major currencies, softening metals demand from
non-U.S. investors. Also keeping sentiment in check, European
equities fell on increased talk that Greece will be forced to
restructure its debt and uncertainty over a bailout for Portugal
which dampened risk appetite.
 
 COPPER STOCKS
 Stocks of copper in LME warehouses last rose 1,350 tonnes to
451,775 tonnes, their highest since June 2010. 
 The majority of these inflows went into warehouses in Asia,
supporting investors' concerns that Chinese demand is
lacklustre.
 Also, the potential that stockpiles of copper held in bonded
warehouses in Shanghai could be unlocked and released to market
was also creating concerns.
""We believe there is around 550,000 tonnes of copper sitting
in bonded warehouses as at mid April 2011, virtually unchanged
from mid March this year, but significantly higher than the
level at end 2010 of estimated 400,000 and averaging
200,000-300,000 in the past,"" said Macquarie bank in a note.
 ""Most of the material... is available for sale, so once the
arbitrage starts to move in favour of import, the bonded stock
could easily become customs cleared and sold onto the domestic
physical market,"" it added.
 The differential between LME and Shanghai copper prices has
narrowed over the last week from $335 to around $132 for the
most liquid June 2011 contract, according to Standard Bank
figures.
 Aluminium closed $2,674 from $2,690 a tonne.
 Zinc ended at $2,325 from $2,398 a tonne. Stocks of the
metal rose 50 tonnes to a seven-year high of 764,300 tonnes.
 Battery material lead tumbled almost five percent to its
lowest in over a month at $2,520 a tonne. It then closed at
$2,528 from $2,651 a tonne, while tin finished at $32,350 from
$33,100 a tonne and nickel ended at $25,500 a tonne from
$26,155.

 SINGAPORE, April 18 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures slipped
below $109 a barrel on Monday after three days of gains, as
fears that high prices would dampen demand overrode concerns of
a cut in Saudi oil output. 
 Saudi Arabia's oil minister said on Sunday the kingdom had
slashed output by 800,000 barrels per day in March due to
oversupply, sending the strongest signal yet that OPEC will not
act to rein in soaring prices. [ID:nLDE73G0AA]	
 ""The market had a great run on Friday, but oil continues to
underpin inflationary fears as people start to worry how high
it's going to get,"" said Ben Le Brun, market analyst with CMC
Markets in Sydney.	
 Oil prices fell early last week on concern that demand may
be eroding under pressure from high prices, but rebounded on
Friday following encouraging U.S. economic data. Prices have
retreated after hitting a 2-1/2 year peak of $113.46 earlier
this month. 
 Traders said the unwinding of positions ahead of the May
contract's expiry on Tuesday would have contributed to the
weakness.	
 U.S. crude futures  for May fell 71 cents to $108.95 a
barrel by 0136 GMT.	
 ICE Brent crude  for June was down 47 cents at
$122.984 a barrel by 0659 GMT after gaining as much as 21 cents
earlier.

 SAUDI OUTPUT 
 Oil Ministers from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
echoed Saudi Arabia's Ali al-Naimi's concerns about oversupply
and said rocketing crude prices were out of the hands of OPEC,
which next meets in June.	
 Naimi's words are the clearest indication yet that OPEC is
unconvinced there is a need for more oil despite the civil war
that has slashed Libyan output and expectations Japanese demand
will rise as the country scrambles to rebuild its
earthquake-shattered electricity grid. 
 ""The Saudis believe that there is a massive premium because
of tensions in the Middle East and that demand is waning at
these prices. We think the premium is around $15-$20 a barrel,""
said Le Brun.	
 The conflict in Libya escalated over the weekend, after
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's forces fired rockets on Sunday
at rebels stationed along the edge of Ajdabiyah, sending some
residents fleeing from the eastern town, witnesses said.

 CHINA RAISES BANK RESERVES 
 China raised banks' required reserves on Sunday for the
fourth time this year to curb inflation, but the impact on oil
prices is expected to be muted as it was widely expected,
analysts said.	
 ""The market would have taken the news in its stride. I don't
think there will be any significant impact on prices as it's a
move that was widely anticipated,"" said Michael Lo, a Hong
Kong-based analyst with Nomura Securities.	
 The reserve rate rise, which followed an increase in
benchmark bank interest rates on April 5, was the seventh since
China stepped up efforts against inflation in October and
underscored the government's determination to keep the economy
on an even keel. [ID:nL3E7FH05Y]	
 Asian equities edged up on Monday, receiving a boost from a
strong Wall Street close, riding on the back of encouraging U.S.
data. 
 The market will be closely watching a clutch of key U.S.
corporate earning during this holiday-shortened week to gauge
the impact of high oil and commodities prices on the world's
bigger energy consumer.

 SINGAPORE, April 18 (Reuters) - Spot gold hit a record high
and silver rose to a 31-year high on Monday, fuelled by concerns
of rising inflation globally, and as a lingering euro zone
sovereign debt crisis continued to boost safe-haven demand in
precious metals. 
 Spot gold hit a record of $1,488.50 an ounce, before
easing to $1,484.29 by 0252 GMT. U.S. gold futures  were
nearly flat at $1,486.60. 
 ""It wouldn't be a surprise to see gold push higher in the
current environment,"" said Darren Heathcote, head of trading at
Investec Australia, adding that investors were concerned about
inflation, especially when oil prices remain high. 
 U.S. crude futures  headed lower on Monday below $109
a barrel after three days of gains, but had gained nearly 20
percent this year. 
 Inflation accelerated in Asia and Europe in March while the
United States bucked the global trend with underlying price
pressures largely in check, leaving monetary policy on diverging
paths around the world.[ID:nL3E7FF17] 
 The lingering euro zone debt crisis also helped lift gold
prices. [ID:nTOPEURO] 
 Technical analysis indicated that gold may target $1,518 an
ounce, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. [ID:nL3E7FI041] 
 
 
 
 Reflecting growing investment interest, holdings in the SPDR
Gold Trust , the world's largest gold-backed
exchange-traded fund, jumped 1.5 percent to a nearly three-month
high of 1,231.159 tonnes. 
 
 SILVER RISES TO 31-YEAR HIGH 
 Spot silver rose to 31-year highs for the third
consecutive session, hitting $43.34 an ounce. It was trading at
$43.28. 
 ""Silver's rally has been dumbfounding,"" said a Tokyo-based
trader. ""Bears are very weak now after silver has steadily
climbed from under $30 to $43 in less than two months.""	
 But he said that investors' enthusiasm had eased slightly
since silver breached above the $40 threshold last week.	
 Holdings in the world's largest silver-backed
exchange-traded fund, iShares Silver Trust , gained 0.64
percent to 11,044.07 tonnes by April 15, down 1.5 percent from a
week earlier.	
 Gold-silver ratio, used to measure how many ounces of silver
is needed to buy an ounce of gold, fell to below 35, its lowest
since the early 1980s.	
 It compares to an average of 65 over the past three decades.
But the ratio could drop further as investors continue to favour
silver. 
 Spot silver has rallied 40 percent so far this year, making
gold's 4.6 percent gain negligible.

899,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2011 07:24PM ET</span>",NYMEX-Crude lower toward $109/bbl after 3-day gains," TOKYO, April 18 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures headed lower
on Monday towards $109 a barrel, after three days of gains,
despite comments by Saudi Arabia confirming a cut in crude
production to counter an oversupplied market.	
 
 FUNDAMENTALS	
 * NYMEX crude for May delivery , which expires on
Tuesday, was down 47 cents at $109.19 a barrel by 2311 GMT,
after settling up $1.55 at $109.66 on Friday.	
 The contract has fallen from an April 11 intraday peak of
$113.46, its highest level since September 2008, amid
expectations the conflict in Libya would lead to a prolonged
disruption of the OPEC nation's supplies.	
 * In London, ICE Brent crude for June delivery  was
trading at $123.48, up 3 cents.	
 * Saudi Arabia's oil minister said on Sunday the kingdom had
slashed output by 800,000 barrels per day in March due to
oversupply, sending the strongest signal yet that OPEC will not
act to quell soaring prices. [ID:nLDE73G0AA]	
 ""The market is overbalanced ... Our production in February
was 9.125 million barrels per day (bpd), in March it was 8.292
million bpd. In April we don't know yet, probably a little
higher than March,"" Ali al-Naimi told reporters in Kuwait.	
 Consumers have urged the exporters' group to pump more crude
to put a cap on London's Brent oil, which surged to more than
$127 a barrel this month, its highest level in 2-1/2 years amid
unrest in North Africa and the Middle East.	
 * UAE Oil Minister Mohammed bin Dhaen al Hamli said on
Sunday that current oil prices do not reflect market
fundamentals and that demand was being met with adequate
supplies, according to the United Arab Emirates' official news
agency WAM. [ID:nWNA6371]	
 * The world's oil markets are oversupplied and OPEC should
not increase production to counter high prices, Kuwait's oil
minister said on Sunday. [ID:nWNA6374]	
The minister said Kuwait was currently pumping 2.2 million
bpd of oil.	
 * OPEC should be flexible in the future with its supply
policy, the managing director of the International Energy Agency
said on Sunday, but he stopped short of calling on the group to
add supply to the market. [ID:nWNA6372]	
Nobuo Tanaka told reporters he was worried about the effect
of the current price of oil on economic growth and said the
market was getting tighter.	
 * Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's forces fired rockets on
Sunday at rebels stationed along the edge of Ajdabiyah, sending
some residents fleeing from the eastern town, witnesses said.
[ID:nLDE73G06Y]	
 A sandstorm whipped up during the morning, obscuring the
flat expanse of desert stretching west to the oil town of Brega.
Rebel fighter Ahmed al-Zuwaihi blamed the weather for a lack of
air strikes on Gaddafi's armour by NATO warplanes.	
* In the week to April 12, money managers cut their net long
positions in crude futures and options by 23,718 positions as
prices fell, according to the the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. [ID:nEMS2IIFAP]

 MARKETS NEWS	
 * Encouraging economic indicators sent U.S. stocks higher on
Friday, but the market's recent struggles are set to continue
into this week when more than one-fifth of S&P 500 companies
report results.	
The S&P 500 fell for a second straight week, and some in the
market pointed to strong resistance building around 1,340. The

 By Sam Nelson
 CHICAGO, April 15 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures fell 2
percent on Friday, notching their first weekly decline in five
weeks as the market lost favor with investors after another
downbeat outlook from Goldman Sachs.
 Futures also declined on talk that hog feeders in the U.S.
Southeast were importing Canadian feed wheat as a substitute
for corn. Long-liquidation of the spot May contract also
pressured that contract, as investors rolled long holdings of
May into the new-crop December and other months.
 Analysts cited substantial profit-taking of bull spreads in
corn (May/Dec) and profit-taking of bear spreads in soybeans
(Nov/May).
 Corn ended the week down 3.7 percent, wheat down 6.6
percent and soybeans down 4.4 percent.
 ""The big elephant in the room is Goldman and their second
recommendation this week to exit commodities. It appears
Goldman has lost their bull flavor,"" said Don Roose, analyst
and president of U.S. Commodities, Des Moines, Iowa.
 Goldman had been bullish on commodities from last summer
through the winter, buying everything from crude oil to corn.
 But the influential banking and securities firm on Monday
recommended commodity investors take profits, and that knocked
down everything from crude oil to grains. On Friday the firm
recommended investors underweight commodities over a three- to
six-month horizon, saying oil prices are higher than justified
by supply and demand.
 Wheat and soybeans fell early on the Goldman advice but
turned positive in choppy trade on positioning and bargain
hunting ahead of the weekend.
 Corn was weak relative to soy and wheat since there had
been a larger buildup of long positions in the corn market
during corn's 25 percent rise this year to a record peak on
Monday.
 CBOT May corn was down 12-1/4 cents per bushel at $7.42,
May wheat was up 3-3/4 cents at $7.44-1/4 and May soybeans were
up 3/4 cent at $13.31-3/4.
 FUNDAMENTALS TURNING BEARISH?
 Prospects for the tightest corn stocks in the United States
since the 1930s had driven the corn market to a record highs,
most recently on Monday. But some traders and analysts caution
that global production of feed grains and oilseeds is on the
rise, which could put pressure on futures markets.
 ""Fundamentals have turned bearish. Australia's wheat crop
was up, South America had a big crop harvest so global
production has improved,"" Roose said.
 Markets are expected to remain volatile next week because
of harsh weather in the United States.
 A drought has been stressing the hard red winter wheat crop
in the U.S. Plains as it enters its critical growth period, but
some rain is beginning to move into the region.
 There were concerns that many U.S. farmers face delays in
sowing corn because of excessively wet fields. The U.S. corn
crop must be planted from roughly mid-April through early May
to achieve the best yields, and delays into mid-May or later
can reduce the crop's potential.
 ""That leaves weather as a wild card and it doesn't look
like there will be much corn planted for at least 10 days.
We're not off to a fierce fast pace,"" Roose said.
 U.S. farmers were expected to plant the second largest land
area to corn since 1944.

 CHICAGO, April 15 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures fell 1
percent on Friday and were on track for their first weekly loss
in five weeks as the market lost favor with investors after
another downbeat outlook from Goldman Sachs.

 Corn was weak relative to soy and wheat since there had

 Long-liquidation of May corn and rolling or spreading of
longs from the May to deferred months also weighed on the spot
May corn futures contract.
 There also was profit taking of corn/wheat and corn/soybean
spreads.
 Corn and wheat were on track to post their first declines
in five-weeks, and some bargain buying surfaced in soybeans as
the market tried to consolidate near a one-month low.
 Soybeans also garnered some support from news on Friday
that China, the world's largest soy importer, bought some soy
from the United States despite a glut of soy and soy products
after a bumper harvest in South America.
 At 10:32 a.m. CDT (1532 GMT), CBOT May corn was down 8
cents per bushel at $7.46-1/4, May wheat was up 1 cent at
$7.41-1/2 and May soybeans were up 1-3/4 at $13.32-3/4.

 ""That leaves weather as a wild card and it doesn't look

new-crop December corn and pressuring new-crop November
soybeans,"" Roose said.
 At 10:21 a.m. CDT (1521 GMT), new-crop December CBOT corn
was down 2-1/2 cents per bushel at $6.53, but it had gained
roughly 6 cents versus spot May.
 In contrast, new-crop November soy lost about 5 to 6 cents
versus the May.
 If U.S. farmers cannot plant corn due to the wet weather
they may shift plantings to soybeans, which could pressure
new-crop soybeans and lift new-crop corn.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, April 15 (Reuters) - Gold rose 1 percent to a
record and silver soared on Friday, as inflation worries amid a
crude oil rally and a downgrade of Ireland's sovereign debt
powered bullion to its fifth consecutive weekly gain.
 Silver rose to its highest in 31 years on speculative
buying and tight supplies, and as data showing rising U.S.
consumer prices prompted investors to buy precious metals.
Silver's outperformance over bullion sent the gold/silver ratio
below 34 for the first time in nearly 30 years.
 ""People are buying gold and silver as a protection against
inflation. If the Fed doesn't start raising rates, inflation is
really going to hit hard and cripple the economy,"" said Miguel
Perez-Santalla, vice president of sales at Heraeus Precious
Metals Management.
 Spot gold  rose 0.9 percent to $1,485.70 an ounce by
3:28 p.m. EDT (1928 GMT), having hit a record $1,487.90. U.S.
gold futures for June delivery  settled up $13.60 at
$1,486.
 Gold remained far below its all-time inflation-adjusted
high, estimated at almost $2,500 an ounce set in 1980, an era
of Cold War tension, oil shocks and hyperinflation.
 (Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/ren88r )
 Silver  gained 1.4 percent to $42.68, notching a
third straight weekly gain. The gold-to-silver ratio -- showing
the relative strength between the two metals -- fell to its
lowest since the early 1980s.
 (Graphic: http://link.reuters.com/vaq98r )
 In the week ended April 12, speculators in U.S. gold
futures and options cut their net long positions from the
highest level since October, and they reduced their silver
bullish bets to the lowest since February, a report by the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed. [ID:N15277343]
 (Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/buv87r )
 The small rise in U.S. core inflation, and data showing
moderation in long-term inflation expectations may be seen as
vindication for Federal Reserve officials who have viewed the
recent energy price spike as having a temporary effect.
 ""This should help to ease inflation concerns at the Fed.
With food and energy cutting into consumer spending power, it's
difficult for sellers of other goods and services to pass price
increases through to the consumer,"" said Nigel Gault, chief
U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight.
 Gold prices have almost doubled since the Fed cut interest
rates to the bone in 2008 in an attempt to shock the economy
back to life after the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression.
 A third straight daily gain in U.S. crude oil stoked
inflation worries, as improving consumer confidence and
industrial production boosted the outlook for oil demand.

 EUROPEAN DEBT CRISIS EYED
 Gold also drew support from safe-haven bids on worries over
the euro zone financial crisis, after more talk that Greece may
be set to restructure its debt and a Moody's downgrade of
Ireland. [ID:nLDE73E1QM]
 ""The market has been reacting to (the credit issues in
peripheral Europe) by looking for ways to protect themselves
from these types of risks, and gold is seen as a way to do
that,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Daniel Brebner said.
 Brebner said gold would benefit if there were another
bailout in Europe and if European Union monetary policy
remained accommodative because of fiscal troubles in the bloc.
 Among other precious metals, platinum  eased 50 cents

 (Recasts, updates with closing prices)
 By Rebekah Curtis
 LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - Copper closed almost flat on
Friday, as the dollar pared gains and data showed improved U.S.
consumer sentiment, but investors worried high inflation in
China would lead to monetary tightening and erode demand.
 Copper for three-months delivery on the London Metal
Exchange (LME) closed at $9,405 a tonne from Thursday's close of
$9,410.
 Chinese consumer price inflation sped to 5.4 percent in the
year to March, the fastest since July 2008 and topping market
forecasts for a 5.2 percent increase. Gross domestic product
eased a touch in the world's top copper buyer.
 ""The market is gradually getting a little bit more worried
about what Chinese growth is going to look like over the medium
term because of the ongoing tightening,"" Jesper Dannesboe,
senior commodity strategist at Societe Generale, said.
 ""Growth is going to slow down quite significantly, it's
going to be very bumpy.""
 Putting more pressure on metals prices, China's production
of refined copper and primary aluminium rose 23.7 percent and
7.4 percent respectively from a year earlier in March, hitting
monthly records for both metals on expanded capacity and
sufficient supply of raw materials.
 Copper inventories at LME warehouses fell 375 tonnes to
450,425 tonnes, a small respite in an upward trend that has seen
stocks of the metal used in power and construction climb by a
fifth so far this year.
 
 DATA SLEW
 Rising food and gasoline costs lifted U.S. consumer prices
overall in March, but underlying inflation pressures were
contained and consumer confidence rose in April.
 But earlier, data showed inflation in the euro zone climbed
higher than expected in March to 2.7 percent year-on-year,
adding to the case for further rises in interest rates.
 ""...we might not see a decent pick-up in demand until the
second half of the year, which leaves prices vulnerable in Q2,""
Standard Bank analyst Leon Westgate said in a note.
 ""That said, ample liquidity, dollar weakness, inflation
concerns, and bullish perceptions of the longer term
fundamentals, are likely to keep investment money flowing,
likely resulting in a particularly volatile couple of months to
come.""
 Also knocking sentiment, Moody's cut Ireland's sovereign
rating by two notches to the verge of junk status and kept its
outlook on negative, pushing the euro lower, which deterred
European investors from metals.
 Meanwhile, finance leaders from the Group of 20 advanced and
developing economies attempted on Friday to flesh out a plan to
build a global economy less prone to the booms and busts of
recent decades.
 Aluminium closed at $2,690 a tonne from $2,664. Zinc was
$2,398 a tonne from $2,400 and battery material lead was at
$2,651 a tonne from $2,613.
 Tin was at $33,100 a tonne from $32,225 and nickel was at
$26,155 a tonne from $25,800.

 * Coming Up: U.S. consumer prices March; 1230 GMT

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, April 15 (Reuters) - Gold jumped to another
record high on Friday after the dollar fell to its lowest since
late 2009 against a basket of major currencies, taking silver to
a 31-year high, while inflation pressures in China also helped
lift bullion's appeal. 
 China's turbo-charged growth eased just a touch in the first
quarter, while its inflation jumped to a 32-month high, putting
pressure on the government to do more to rein in prices and keep
the economy on an even keel. [ID:nL3E7FF0AC]	
 Spot gold was steady at $1,472.50 ounce by 0824 GMT,
having hit a record high of $1,479.01 an ounce. 
 Gold is still far below its all-time inflation-adjusted
high, estimated at more than $2,000 an ounce set in 1980 as a
result of heightened geopolitical pressure and hyper inflation. 
 ""We see gold peaking at $1,500 an ounce. We think there
could be some more upside in gold in the short term, especially
in this environment of high inflation and rising oil prices,""
said"" Natalie Robertson, commodities strategist at ANZ.	
 ""There is a lot more upside,"" said Robertson, adding that
the peak of $1,500 would be reached by the end of 2011.	
 Dealers said worries about inflation had spurred steady
physical demand from China, where the government has vowed to
use all tools at its disposal, including bank reserve
requirements, interest rates and the yuan's exchange rate, to
wrestle inflation under control. [ID:nL3E7FD1LJ] 
 Gold's rise to a record only attracted light selling from
Thailand and Indonesia, suggesting that investors remained
bullish on the outlook. Premiums for gold bars were steady at
between 70 cents and $1 an ounce in Singapore.	
 ""Generally, higher consumer prices could still be a boost
for gold. Going forward, we will be looking at inflation figures
from the United States, and if we see an upside surprise, gold
can even go higher,"" said a dealer in Singapore.	
 ""If you look at recent price action when China announces
interest rate hikes, it hasn't affected commodities that much.
Also, because of the fact that gold prices are already so
expensive, investors are looking at silver as a store of value.""	
 Spot silver rose as high as $42.41 an ounce, its
strongest since 1980, with physical dealers in Singapore also
reporting buying from speculators. 
 IShares Silver Trust said its holdings edged up to
10,974.26 tonnes by April 14 from 10,969.71 tonnes on April 13.
The holdings hit a record of 11,242.89 tonnes hit on April 8. 
 The dollar dropped to its lowest in more than a year, under
pressure from expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will not cut
short its $600 billion debt-buying programme despite the recent
surge in oil prices. [ID:nN14167673]	
 U.S. consumer price inflation numbers due at 1230 GMT will
be closely watched for signs inflation may be rising faster than
the Fed may expect. 
 U.S. gold futures for June rose as high as $1,480.5
an ounce, a lifetime high. 
 The Singapore Mercantile Exchange (SMX) started trading
cash-settled gold futures on Friday, with the contract for June
delivery opening at $1,475 an ounce on low volumes.
[ID:nL3E7FF03J] 
 ""They need sufficient liquidity before people start looking
at the contracts,"" said the Singapore-based dealer. 
 ""It's always difficult to get people to adopt a new
contract. You'd always stick to traditional, old benchmarks,
such as COMEX gold."" 
 Brent crude held steady above $122 a barrel on Friday after
China's economic growth beat forecasts despite government
efforts to cool expansion and put the brakes on inflation.

 * Added weight on wheat from Plains rain forecast
 * Waning soy crush, exports weighing on soybeans
 * Corn fundamentals bullish but profit-taking weighs
 * Coming up: US planting weather, Plains rains eyed
(Recasts, updates prices, market activity; new byline, changes
dateline, previously SINGAPORE/MADRID)
 By Sam Nelson
 CHICAGO, April 14 (Reuters) - U.S. grain markets tumbled on
Thursday, with wheat futures plumbing a two-week low as
investors cashed out profits amid forecasts for rain in
drought-hit areas of the U.S. Plains.
 Wheat, corn and soybean futures markets, loaded with net
long positions by speculators, remained under pressure from a
Goldman Sachs recommendation to clients this week to bank
profits on crude oil and some other commodities.
 A Chicago Board of Trade floor broker said if it were not
for climbing crude oil prices, grains prices would fall
further.
 ""I think investors are losing some or their enthusiasm for
ownership of commodities"" in general, he said.
 Crude oil turned firm after falling in early dealings and
its volatility was unnerving some potential investors in grain
and soy.
 Soybeans slipped to a one-month low on signs of slowing
U.S. demand for the oilseed and puny export sales of U.S. soy.
 Corn was finding spillover selling pressure from falling
wheat and soybeans despite soggy weather that is slowing early
corn seedings and despite continued robust export sales of U.S.
corn at prices near record highs.
 ""We've had the rain forecasts for the wheat belt for two
days in a row now, so that's obviously pressuring the wheat
market,"" said Rich Nelson, research director for Illinois
advisory and research firm Allendale, Inc.
 Dry weather has been stressing the wheat crop in the
Plains, causing irreparable damage to portions of it. But rains
will nourish some of the crop ahead of its critical growing
season.
 Telvent DTN weather forecaster Mike Palmerino told Reuters
global ag forum the major shift in the weather pattern for the
central United States will bring beneficial rains to the wheat
crop in Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado Thursday and again early
next week. Oklahoma and Texas will miss out, Palmerino said.
 US SOY CRUSH AND EXPORTS WANING
 Soybean futures were floundering as U.S. soybean crushers
slow down their processing of soy into soymeal and soyoil due
to a buildup of supply of each product as end-users enjoy a
glut of soy and soy product this season from Brazil and
Argentina.
 ""Soybeans have a domestic problem,"" Nelson said. ""The NOPA
crush was down 10 percent from a year ago and we think USDA
will have to lower their crush forecast by 20 million
bushels.""
 The National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) said the
U.S. soy crush in March totaled 134.391 million bushels, above
an average of analysts' estimates for 133.19 million but well
below March last year of 149.627 million bushels.
 Mary Ann Kwiatkowski, of Amber Trading, attributed the
losses to long liquidation, adding that the NOPA March soymeal
export numbers were ""bad for soybeans.""
 NOPA reported March soymeal exports at 518,861 tons, down
from 663,586 tons in February.
 Analysts said soybean crush margins soon will come under
renewed pressure from bumper South American crops and on
competition from distillers dried grain.
 ""Today's bean export number was low so we'll have to see if
sales can keep up with USDA's projection,"" Nelson said.
 USDA on Thursday said export sales of U.S. soybeans last
week totaled just over 79.0 million tonnes, below estimates for
100.0 to 400.0 million.

 * U.S. weekly initial jobless claims rise unexpectedly
 * Copper warehouse inventories rise
 
 (Updates prices, adds detail)
 By Sue Thomas and Rebekah Curtis
 LONDON, April 14 (Reuters) - Copper fell to its lowest in
more than a week on Thursday, as reports of quickening inflation
in top consumer China pointed to more monetary tightening, which
investors worried would hit demand for industrial metals.
 Also pressuring industrial metals, U.S. equities fell after
an unexpected rise in jobless claims and concerns about higher
inflation overseas.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was at
$9,410 a tonne from $9,515 at the close on Wednesday.
 ""Especially in copper, there's a fear of possible rate hikes
in China,"" Eugen Weinberg, an analyst at Commerzbank, said.
Chinese inflation in March accelerated to as fast as 5.4
percent from a year earlier, Hong Kong media said on Thursday,
reinforcing concerns about the government tightening monetary
policy.
 The official release of the data is due on Friday.
 Premier Wen Jiabao has also warned about inflation risks due
to soaring global commodity and oil prices, pointing to another
interest rate hike.
 China's central bank has increased benchmark interest rates
four times since last October and has required the country's big
banks to put a record high of 20 percent of their deposits with
the central bank as reserves.
 The market also focused on open interest in copper, which
has fallen since mid-January, reflecting investor caution and a
steady rise in warehouse inventories since December.
 LME copper open interest has fallen more than 10 percent
from its peak of 324,420 lots on Jan. 14 to 289,215 lots on
Tuesday.
in LME warehouses rose 875 tonnes to 450,800 tonnes, data on
Thursday showed.
 Zinc stocks rose some 3.6 percent, registering their biggest
daily percentage increase since early December. Zinc fell to
$2,400 a tonne from a close of $2,421.
 ""It just demonstrates that the market has generally been
oversupplied outside of China since the recession,"" said Giles
Lloyd, an analyst at CRU.
 The International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG) forecast
a surplus of almost 200,000 tonnes this year, the fifth year
running of oversupply.
 Lead was at $2,613 a tonne from $2,679.5. The ILZSG raised
its forecast for a global surplus of refined lead production for
2011 to 123,000 tonnes from around 90,000.
 Tin was at $32,225 a tonne from $32,250, aluminium was at
$2,644 a tonne from $2,642, while nickel was $25,800 a tonne

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - Gold rose over 1 percent to
a near-record and silver surged on Thursday as dollar weakness,
inflation worries and a European debt crisis powered bullion to
its biggest one-day gain in about seven weeks.
 Silver futures soared to their highest since 1980, rising
more than 4 percent for their biggest one-day gain since
November, as strong investment and speculative buying sent the
gold/silver ratio to a low.
 Gold received a boost from inflation worries triggered by a
crude oil rally and data showing rising U.S. core producer
prices in March, and as higher-than-expected jobless claims
knocked the dollar. [ID:nN14146589]
 ""The combination of higher oil prices, weaker dollar and
the resurrection of discussions of Greek sovereign risk
problems has galvanized the gold market. It's particularly
impressive because we ran into selling above the market
yesterday,"" said James Steel, chief commodity analyst at HSBC.
 Spot gold  rose 1.4 percent to $1,474.30 an ounce by
4:02 p.m. EDT (2002 GMT), within striking distance of its
record $1,476.21 set on Monday. U.S. gold futures for June
delivery  settled up $16.80 at $1,472.40 an ounce.
 Investors grew jittery on talk of debt restructuring by
Greece, the first euro zone member to receive a bailout a year
ago in the crisis that has driven Ireland and Portugal to seek
aid and forced draconian budget cuts in Spain. [ID:nLDE73D0XQ]
 The European debt crisis has boosted gold this year and
also helped power the metal's 30 percent gain last year.
 Bullion investors took heart as the dollar fell broadly,
reaching a record low against the Swiss franc, with more
weakness likely so long as U.S. Federal Reserve and European
Central Bank policies continue to diverge. [FRX/]
 The recent surge in oil prices is no prelude to broader
price increases that would force the Fed to raise interest
rates, top Fed officials said on Thursday in what appeared to
be the predominant view at the central bank. [ID:nN14167673]
 Comments by the Fed officials strengthened expectations the
central bank will stay on course with its $600 billion
debt-buying program and not look to reverse its super-easy
monetary policy any time soon.
 Gold prices have almost doubled since the Fed cut interest
rates to the bone in 2008 in an attempt to shock the economy
back to life after the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression.
 SILVER RATIO LOWEST IN NEARLY 3 DECADES
 Silver  climbed 3.5 percent to $42.03, having hit a
31-year high at $42.07 an ounce. (Factbox: [ID:nLDE73D1BQ])
 The spread between gold and silver -- showing the relative
strength between the two metals -- has nearly halved since last
August. The gold-to-silver ratio fell to just above 35, the
lowest since the early 1980s.
 (Graphic: http://link.reuters.com/cum98r)
 ""Silver continues to attract a very large speculative bid.
Even though silver is far out-gaining gold, the reasons why
precious metals rally are related to the financial factors that
surround the gold market,"" said Bill O'Neill, partner at
commodities firm LOGIC Advisors.
 Silver has rallied about 35 percent year-to-date on talk of
near-term supply tightness as a recovering global economy
boosts demand for the industrial metal.
 ""There is still a lot of speculative, investment money
coming into the gold market. Until there is a clear technical
signal that the situation is reversed, the momentum of silver
remains intact,"" HSBC's Steel said.
 Platinum  gained 1.2 percent to $1,791.24, while
palladium  rose 1.4 percent to $771.50.

"
914,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2011 04:56AM ET</span>",SOFTS-Cocoa rises after grind data; sugar firms," Below are highlights for the cocoa, coffee and sugar
markets:
 
 COCOA
 ICE cocoa futures rose after Europe's first-quarter grind, a
measure of demand, rose 3.5 percent on the year-earlier period
to 353,103 tonnes, at the higher end of analysts' and dealers'
expectations.
 
 * Grinding capacity utilisation in Europe was forecast to
have increased due to a lack of activity in Ivory Coast because
of a power struggle in the top producer.
 
 * Cocoa futures were underpinned by worries about possible
disruptions to the mid-crop harvest in Ivory Coast even as
exports were set to resume from the country after months of
political turmoil.
 
 * Germany's first-quarter 2011 cocoa grind rose 22.7 percent
on the year to 108,816 tonnes, the association of German
confectionery producers BDSI said on Thursday. The association
said the large rise was partly due to a change in statistical
calculation, because more companies were contributing grinding
data than in the first quarter of 2010.
 
 * ICE second-month, July cocoa was up $9 or 0.3 percent to
$3,079 per tonne in modest volume of 490 lots at 0833 GMT, below
the 32-year high of $3,775 per tonne touched on March 4.
 
 * London second-month, July cocoa was up 2 pounds or 0.1
percent to 1,948 pounds per tonne in light turnover of 336 lots.
 
 SUGAR
 * Raw sugar futures on ICE firmed in early trade, with
upside potential limited by bigger-than-expected Thai output.
ICE raw sugar futures closed on Wednesday at their lowest level
in six months, weighed by expectations of large Brazilian and
Thai supplies.
 
 * ICE May raw sugar futures rose 0.13 cent or 0.5 percent to
24.92 cents a lb at 0836 GMT.
 
 * Dealers said a focus in the market was on how much sugar
would be delivered when London's May white sugar contract goes
off the board on Friday.
 
 * London May white sugar fell $3.60 or 0.5 percent to
$687.80 per tonne in slim volume of 734 lots.
 
 COFFEE
 * Arabica coffee futures on ICE were little changed in light
early volumes, underpinned by tight global supplies of high
quality beans.
 
 * ICE July arabica coffee fell 0.95 cents or 0.3 percent to
$2.8275 per lb at 0837 GMT.
 
 * Liffe July robustas were down $10 or 0.4 percent to $2,490
a tonne in modest volume of 1,831 lots.
 
 OTHER MARKETS
 * The dollar hit a fresh 16-month low against a basket of
currencies as expectations grew the Federal Reserve would keep
its loose monetary policy, widening interest rate differentials
in favour of higher-yielding currencies.
 * Asian stocks slipped as the market consolidated after a
recent run-up to near three-year highs, although Singapore's
impressive growth data underscored investor confidence in the
region.
 * Brent crude fell, trading below $123 a barrel on concerns
about the impact of high prices on demand, although continued
unrest in the Middle East and a sharp fall in U.S. gasoline
stocks limited losses.
 * European shares were seen opening slightly lower,
reversing the previous day's gains to track weakness in Asia,
with heavyweight mining shares set to slip as copper prices
eased on tightening worries in China.
 * U.S. stocks finished mostly flat in a choppy session on
Wednesday as investors bet on strong technology earnings even as
JPMorgan Chase's numbers weighed on other market sectors.

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, April 14 (Reuters) - Gold rose for a second day
on Thursday as the U.S. dollar fell to a 16-month low against a
basket of currencies on expectations the Federal Reserve will
lag global central banks in raising interest rates.	
 Bullion held within $20 of the record high of $1,476.21 an
ounce struck at the start of the week, with declines in exchange
traded fund holdings suggesting investors are keen to book
profits. 
 A dip from all-time highs would spur physical purchases from
jewellers in Asia. Worries about inflation have also ensured
steady demand from China, which will release consumer prices and
other key data such as GDP on Friday that will offer clues on
Beijing's next monetary policy move.	
 Hong Kong's Phoenix TV on Thursday said annual inflation
accelerated to between 5.3 and 5.4 percent in March, without
citing a source for the information. [ID:nB9E7EN026]	
 Spot gold rose $8.69 to $1,463.30 an ounce by 0632
GMT as technical buying accelerated after prices breached
Wednesday's intraday high. 
 ""Gold could be supported by the weak dollar and the loose
monetary policy from the Federal Reserve,"" said Ong Yi Ling,
investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.
    ""Asian buying may resurface upon dips in prices. Chinese
demand for gold is expected to remain strong. Amidst rising
inflation and a lack of investment alternatives, gold is sought
as a store of value.""	
 Economists polled by Reuters had expected annual inflation
in March to run at 32-month high of 5.2 percent, up from
February's 4.9 percent.[ID:nL3E7F70G2]	
 Gold's decade-long price rally could take the metal above
$1,600 an ounce by year-end, metals consultancy GFMS said in a
widely anticipated industry report on Wednesday, as investor
appetite for gold sharpens further. [ID:nLDE73C1Q0]	
 The dollar index , which measures its strength against
major currencies, fell to 74.676, bringing its losses this year
to around 5 percent. 
 ""There's steady buying from China. They don't seem to be
affected by the price movements. I think the government still
encourages people to buy gold instead of property,"" said a
dealer in Hong Kong, referring to Beijing's move to rein in the
red-hot property sector.	
 ""Silver is in good demand from India. Maybe because the
price of gold is too high, and they turn to silver. Demand
started to appear two weeks ago."" 
 India has shown steady interest in silver since early this
year, although it was not clear whether the metal was now used a
substitute for gold. India is in the midst of the wedding
season, with gold jewellery a common gift. 
 Spot silver rose 71 cents to $41.33 an ounce, not far
from a 31-year high at $41.93 struck on Monday. 
 ""Prices are extremely high, currently, so perhaps it could
take a breather,"" said a dealer in Singapore. ""But if gold goes
up, silver is likely rise as well. I continue to look for silver
taking its cue from gold."" 
 IShares Silver Trust said its holdings slipped to
10,969.71 tonnes by April 13 from 11,212.53 tonnes on April 12,
and a record of 11,242.89 tonnes hit on April 8. 
 The world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR
Gold Trust , said its holdings extended losses and fell to
1,212.964 tonnes by April 13, their lowest in a week, from
1,216.299 tonnes on April 12. 
 U.S. gold futures for June rose $8.8 an ounce to
$1,464.4 an ounce. 
 The Singapore Mercantile Exchange will launch cash-settled
gold, silver and copper futures contracts on April 15, the
exchange said in a press release, which may carve out a new
market for speculators seeking arbitrage opportunities.

 In other markets, Japan's Nikkei average inched up, while
Brent crude fell to trade below $123 a barrel on concern about
the impact of high prices on demand.

 By Rene Pastor and Sarah McFarlane
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 13 (Reuters) - Cocoa futures climbed
on Wednesday due to worries about possible disruptions to the
mid-crop harvest in Ivory Coast even as cocoa exports were set
to resume from the world's top grower after months of political
turmoil.
 Coffee futures also rose, with arabicas pushing up on
mostly spread trade, while sugar stumbled as raws closed at its
lowest level in six months.
 Cocoa futures have slid around 25 percent since peaking at
a 32-year high in March as Ivory Coast has looked closer to
resuming exports after the civil war there was resolved with
the arrest of leader Laurent Gbagbo.
 ""Now that everything is settling down in the Ivory Coast,
there may be more of a normality in the market,"" said Nick
Gentile, head of trading at commodities fund Atlantic Capital
Advisors.
 New York's July cocoa contract on ICE Futures U.S. gained
$14 to end at $3,070 per tonne. London's July cocoa rose 9
pounds to close at 1,946 pounds per tonne.
 The market's focus shifted to the first-quarter European
cocoa grind data and U.S. cocoa grind data. Both key indicators
of demand are due out on Thursday.
 ""We'd expect it to be a little bit up due to the fact
there's been no grinding in Ivory Coast. If it's not up, it's
bearish,"" the dealer said, estimating grindings would increase
by 2 percent or 3 percent.
 A second dealer said, ""We expect ECA grindings to be
slightly better due to replacement from Ivory Coast.""
 International trade house and cocoa processor Archer
Daniels Midland Co. (ADM), whose operations in Ivory Coast have
been suspended since the first week of March, said in an
emailed statement: ""We're currently leveraging our cocoa
processing operations in Ghana, Singapore, Brazil, the United
States and Europe to meet our customers' needs.""
 Ivory Coast's major port of Abidjan remained shut on
Wednesday as staffing and logistical issues meant operations
could not resume, shipping sources said.
 ""The trade has bought so much cocoa from Ghana, from Togo,
to hedge against Ivory Coast, now they've got their hedges and
they've got their cocoa from Ivory Coast too. Now they have too
much of everything so they are moving out of their positions,""
a long-time U.S. based analyst said.
 U.S. cocoa futures were also bolstered by technical
strength after rising above the 200-day moving average and
after the 20-day and 100-day moving averages crossed above the
market late last week.
 COFFEE SURGES, SUGAR OFF
 Coffee prices vaulted higher, although analysts feel the
strong advance in arabica futures was caused more by spread
business than any fundamental factor in the market.
 ""Most of it is spread related. Ten percent of the volume is
outright volume. A lot of people (are) watching more than doing
anything,"" said Rodrigo Costa, vice-president of Institutional
Sales for Newedge USA.
 New York's July arabica contract rose 6.80 cents to finish
at $2.837 per lb. London's July robusta coffee contract added
$74 to finish at $2,500 per tonne.
 The May robusta robusta in London contract went to a
discount against key July for the first time since March 8.
 ""Unless there's a marco event, I don't see coffee breaking
down,"" said Gentile, adding the fundamental outlook for coffee
remained constructive.
 Sugar futures fell as dealers kept a close watch on the oil
market and economic developments, noting concerns over risks to
global economic growth.
 Gentile said with back months staying weak in the raw sugar
market, ""we could trade down to 21 to 23 cents.""
 New York's May raw sugar contract fell 0.79 cent to end at
a 6-month low at 24.79 cents per lb. London's May white sugar
futures slid $6.90 to end at $691.40 per tonne.

 By Melanie Burton and Sue Thomas
 LONDON, April 13 (Reuters) - Copper reversed gains on
Wednesday on concerns about demand after U.S. auto sales fell
and on reports China would move to quell inflation, lessening
the country's appetite for commodities.
 LME copper closed at $9,515 a tonne, from $9,630 at the
close on Tuesday after hitting an intra-day high of $9,633.75
 ""I think at this point the market is waiting for some kind
of stronger direction,"" said Standard Chartered analyst Daniel
Smith.
 ""I think we will go higher; it's just a question of timing.
But for now, with all these worries about China and to some
extent the problems in Japan, the market is in a bit of a
wait-and-see mode,"" he said.
 China's Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday that the
the government would use everything at its disposal to stabilise
prices and bring inflation under control.
 Xinhua said the government would use ""a mix of tools such as
reserve requirements and interest rates and further improve the
yuan exchange rate formation mechanism to control social
financing aggregate at a reasonable level"".
 China's first-quarter GDP growth is seen slowing and
inflation accelerating to a 32-month high in March. Its GDP and
March economic indicators are due out on Friday.
 Japan's government on Wednesday downgraded its assessment of
the economy for the first time in six months to reflect last
month's earthquake and tsunami. Japan's auto industry, a big
metals consumer, has been badly hit.
 In the United States, the world's largest economy, sales at
retailers rose slightly less than expected in March and auto
sales plunged, a government report showed, pointing to slower
consumer spending in the first quarter.
 Danske Bank analyst Christin Tuxen said risk appetite and
aversion would continue to sway the market, with the week's
earnings and data reports key signals on the state of the global
economic recovery.
 Tuxen said U.S. data such as retail sales could refocus
markets on the possibility of demand destruction if the recovery
in the world's biggest economy begins to give way.
 ""The market is taking stock of what happened in the oil
market yesterday, where we saw a risk-off attitude ... and a
massive sell-off in oil prices that drove both aluminium and
copper lower as well.""
 Oil rose towards $123 on Wednesday, partly reversing the
deep sell-off, after U.S. gasoline stocks dived and talks on
Libya showed divisions among foreign powers seeking an end to
the violence racking the OPEC member.
 For the longer term, falling ore grades and a lack of new
large-scale mines have narrowed the copper supply pipeline,
which is also helping copper prices, Deutsche Bank analyst
Daniel Brebner said.
 Global miner Rio Tinto forecast a 10 percent drop in
refined copper output for this year to 350,000 tonnes, in its
latest production report.
 
 NICKEL SURPLUS
 The International Nickel Study Group (INSG) said it expected
the global nickel market to record a 60,000 tonne surplus this
year, compared with a deficit of 30,000 tonnes in 2010.
 Traders said that demand for the metal most commonly used in
stainless steel remains lacklustre, with orders weak going into
the second quarter. Stocks rose on the LME, the latest data
showed.
 LME nickel closed at $26,250, compared with $26,700 at
Tuesday's close.
 LME copper inventories also rose in latest data by 3,225
tonnes and have now surged by more than 100,000 tonnes from
mid-December, taming upside price potential.

 By Carole Vaporean
 NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Wednesday,
recovering from its biggest one-day drop in nearly a month,
boosted by the dollar's early fall on expectations the U.S.
Federal Reserve will maintain a loose monetary policy despite
signs of price pressures.
 Spot gold  was at $1,457.30 an ounce by 2:39 p.m. EDT
(1839 GMT), up slightly from $1,453.95 an ounce late Tuesday.
It was in the middle of a new, higher plateau, a day after
selling off from a record peak at $1,476.21 hit on Monday.
 U.S. gold futures for June delivery  closed up $2 at
$1,455.60 an ounce, then rose further in after-hours trade.
 Gold got a boost from the Fed's Beige Book report, which
noted signs that higher raw material and energy costs were
adding to price pressures.
 The Fed's anecdotal report said the U.S. economy kept
improving over the past month on gains in manufacturing, but it
said companies are feeling higher energy and raw material
costs. [ID:nWALDFE767]
 Meanwhile, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said in an
article published on Wednesday that the U.S. central bank risks
employing a monetary policy that is too expansive and that
allows inflation to run out of control. [ID:nLDE73C0MF]
 ""I see the risk that we don't manage to keep inflation
under control,"" Fisher wrote in an opinion piece published in
Germany's Handelsblatt business daily, pointing to firming
price pressures across the world.
 Analysts said fears inflation may be picking up is one
factor underpinning gold prices and even spurring new buying.
 ""The Fed is starting to have some dissension on inflation,
Fisher came out and said inflation could ramp up in a
meaningful way if the Fed doesn't address it,"" said Adam
Klopfenstein, Senior Market Strategist at Lind-Waldock in
Chicago.
 ""Until you address the underlying factors that are driving
gold prices up, they will not meaningfully adjust,"" he added.
 Gold fell below $1,445 an ounce on Tuesday as falling oil
prices knocked commodities, but worries over unrest in North
Africa and euro zone debt, plus expectations the Fed would lag
other central banks in tightening monetary policy, pulled
precious metal prices back up on Wednesday.
 ""It looks like gold held the $1,444 (support level) rather
well yesterday,"" said Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS
Finance. ""(There was) some demand out of India on the physical
front since yesterday. It feels okay here, although it is
eyeing oil and silver rather closely.""
 The prospect that the Fed could rein in its accommodative
monetary policy is a potential stumbling block for gold, which
as a non-yielding asset has a higher opportunity cost when
interest rates rise.
 The metal has risen this year as rate rises in the euro
zone, China and Australia benefited other currencies versus the
dollar, but Fed policy is being eyed.
 ""The direction of U.S. monetary policy is the key theme
this quarter, and the uncertainty surrounding this includes
both the timing of any tightening decision as well as its
implementation,"" said UBS analyst Edel Tully in a note.
 ""This means that gold's movements in the coming weeks will
be highly sensitive to the debates among Fed members.""
 GFMS SEES GOLD ABOVE $1,600/oz
 Metals consultancy GFMS said in a widely watched industry
report that gold's decade-long price rally could take the metal
above $1,600 an ounce by year-end, as investors' appetite for
gold sharpens further. [ID:nLDE73C1Q0]
 The company sees gold prices averaging $1,455 an ounce this
year and sticking to a range of $1,319-1,620 an ounce,
executive chairman Philip Klapwijk told delegates at the launch
of its Gold Survey 2011.
 Investment demand for gold exchange-traded funds softened.
Holdings of the largest, New York's SPDR Gold Trust ,
slipping by nearly a tonne on Tuesday. [GOL/SPDR]
 Holdings of the largest silver ETF, the iShares Silver
Trust , eased around 30 tonnes from a record on the same
day, its biggest one-day outflow in about a month.
[ID:nL3E7FB00Y]
 Hefty inflows into the fund this year have accompanied a
sharp rise in silver prices, which peaked at 31-year highs of
$41.93 earlier this week.
 Silver  was bid higher at $40.53 an ounce against
$40.04 previously. Platinum  was higher at $1,771.49 an
ounce against $1,765.70, and palladium  advanced to
$764.47 against $761.40.

 SINGAPORE, April 13 (Reuters) - Gold bounced higher on
Wednesday after posting its biggest decline in a month in the
previous session, shrugging off falls in exchange traded fund
holdings and gaining support on inflation concerns in major gold
buyer China.	
 Silver was within sight of its highest level in more than
three decades as steady physical demand from India helped it
regain $40 an ounce. The gold-to-silver ratio was at a 28-year
low.	
 Spot gold added $2.81 to $1,456.76 an ounce by 0558
GMT after falling as low as $1,443.49 an ounce on Tuesday,
tracking declines in oil prices.	
 Bullion hit a record around $1,476 an ounce on Monday on the
prospect of more declines in the dollar. 
 ""You can say that we're going through a consolidation phase.
Physical demand is still certainly out there,"" said Jonathan
Barratt, managing director of Commodity Broking Services.	
 However, Barratt said a client note by Goldman Sachs to lock
in recent commodity price gains could serve as a ""wake up"" call
on price levels.	
 Goldman Sachs expects Brent crude to fall towards $105 in
coming months, according to a note e-mailed to clients, after
recommending on Monday they close trades on a basket of
commodities that include U.S. crude. [ID:nN12164096]
[ID:nLDE73B02E] 
 But steady physical buying from China, the world's second
largest gold consumer, showed that inflation was a concern, with
crude oil prices still above $100. 
 China's central bank raised interest rates on April 5 for
the fourth time since October, underlining Beijing's
determination to clamp down on inflation. [ID:nSGE735004] 
 China is due to release key economic data including March
inflation, industrial output as well as the economic growth for
the first quarter on Friday, which may give investors clues on
Beijing's next policy move. [ID:nL3E7F70G2]	
 South Korea's central bank on Wednesday lifted its forecast
for 2011 consumer inflation while maintaining its economic
growth projection, a day after it kept interest rates unchanged
despite high inflation pressure. [ID:nL3E7FC36I]	
 Central banks turned net buyers of gold last year and cut
exposure to debt issued by euro zone members Greece, Ireland and
Portugal, an annual survey of the world's reserve managers
showed. [ID:nL9E7F802W]	
 Spot gold is expected to fall more to $1,437 per
ounce based on an ascending trendline and a Fibonacci
retracement analysis, according to Wang Tao, Reuters market
analyst for commodities and energy technicals.

 PHYSICAL MARKET 
 Activity in the physical market had yet to pick up on
Wednesday after light overnight buying from India, the world's
largest consumer. 
 ""We've seen some gold buying from China, but there's not
much activity today because Thailand is on holiday. Indonesia is
also on the sidelines because the price is stuck at the current
level. They don't want to either buy or sell,"" said a dealer in
Singapore.	
 ""There was light buying from India last night but the demand
for silver is growing, even though silver is getting more
expensive."" 
 Spot silver rose 32 cents to $40.36 an ounce, not
far from a 31-year high at $41.93 struck on Monday. 
 Dealers said India has showed steady interest in silver
since early this year, although it was not clear whether the
metal was now used a substitute to gold. India is in the midst
of the wedding season, with gold jewellery a common gift.	
 Holdings on gold and silver ETFs slipped as investors booked
profits from recent peak. The world's largest gold-backed
exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust , said its holdings
slipped to 1,216.299 tonnes by April 12 from 1,217.209 tonnes on
April 7. 
 IShares Silver Trust said its holdings fell to
11,212.53 tonnes by April 12 from a record of 11,242.89 tonnes
hit on April 8. 
 U.S. gold futures for June rose $4.4 an ounce $1,458
an ounce. 
 In other markets, Tokyo shares nudged higher, with Tokyo
Electric surging on a report that its liabilities
stemming from the nuclear crisis may be capped, while the euro
held steady against the dollar after touching a 15-month high of
$1.4520 on Tuesday on trading platform EBS.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2011 08:52PM ET</span>",NYMEX-Crude extends falls for 3rd day on demand concerns," TOKYO, April 13 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures extended
their declines into a third day on Wednesday, falling to $106 a
barrel, down more than 6 percent from a 32-month peak marked
this week on concerns -- heightened by a warning from Goldman
Sachs -- that prices had risen too far and could curb demand.	
 U.S. crude's 5.8 percent slide over the past two sessions
was the biggest two-day percentage decline since May 2010, when
the debt crises in Greece and the wider euro zone pulled down
commodities.	
 
 FUNDAMENTALS

 * Saudi Arabia is ready to sell more of its new crude oil
blend in the coming months if demand is there, and it will be
available on the spot market, a market source said on Tuesday.
[ID:nLDE73B0MM]

crude oil and buying fuel on behalf of the rebels trying to
overthrow Muammar Gaddafi, throwing a vital lifeline to the
embattled anti-government forces. [ID:nN12189914]	
 * High petroleum prices will cut into global oil demand but
not until next year, the U.S. government's energy forecasting
agency said on Tuesday. [ID:nN12189731]	
 * High oil prices are beginning to put the brakes on the
rapid pace of global economic growth and erode demand for fuel,
the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday in a report that
added to a steep selloff in crude oil prices. [ID:nLDE73B0MO]

projects and sending more liquefied natural gas from the

gained broadly as profit taking on short positions took off on
the back of renewed risk aversion, while investors also favoured
the Swiss franc as a safe-haven currency. 
 * U.S. stocks dropped on Tuesday on worries that falling oil
prices could set off a reversal in the high-flying energy
sector, while Alcoa's leaner-than-expected revenue disappointed.

in early 2011 and showing signs of a slowing in the global
recovery. [ID:nN12253400]

923,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2011 03:56PM ET</span>","GRAINS-Tumble the most in a month on Goldman, Japan"," * Goldman Sachs recommends taking profits
 * Japan's nuclear crisis ranked on par with Chernobyl
 * July corn dips by daily 30-cent limit, recovers slightly
 * Coming up: U.S. corn planting weather eyed
(Recasts to include close of U.S. Tuesday trading session,
fresh analyst quotes)
 By Sam Nelson
 CHICAGO, April 12 (Reuters) - U.S. grain markets posted
their biggest drop in almost a month on Tuesday as investors
cashed out of commodities, with corn plunging 3 percent.
 Some in the market linked the sell-off to Japan upgrading
the severity of its nuclear crisis to the same level as the
1986 Chernobyl disaster, the world's worst nuclear accident.
 Japan is the world's top importer of corn and a major buyer
of wheat and soybeans from the United States.
 For the first time since 1996, spot wheat futures fell
below those for corn due to tight supplies that have triggered
record-high corn prices -- a situation that could prompt
livestock feeders to switch from corn to wheat.
 That supply tightness also helped corn futures show some
resiliency on Tuesday as the market by the close recaptured
roughly 25 percent of the earlier declines that had driven some
months down by the daily limit of 30 cents per bushel.
 Wheat futures at the Chicago Board of Trade fell nearly 5
percent, while soybeans slid 3 percent in a second day of
selling that started when long-time commodity bull Goldman
Sachs told clients to take profits.
 ""Goldman started it when they said to take profits. A lot
of markets were overbought and what you saw was a lot of
profit-taking and fund long-liquidation,"" said Dax Wedemeyer,
analyst for U.S. Commodities in Des Moines, Iowa.
 Speculators had been adding to their holdings of corn as
prices climbed to record levels.
 The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said that, as
of a week ago, speculators were net long CBOT corn futures by
266,089 contracts, up 33,129 contracts from the previous week.
 GOLDMAN FOLLOW-THROUGH
 Goldman Sachs on Monday recommended closing its CCCP basket
trade first recommended on Dec. 1, 2010. That basket included
crude oil, cotton, copper, platinum and soybeans. Goldman said
crude oil, cotton and copper had substantially exceeded the
firm's targets while platinum and soybean prices lagged.
 Goldman has long been known as a commodity bull. On April
1, the firm raised its forecast for Chicago Board of Trade corn
futures to $8.60 from $6.20, citing bullish data in a U.S.
government stocks report.
 Goldman's advice to bank profits did not directly mention
grain but those markets were spooked anyway after corn hit a
record high of $7.83-3/4 early this week.
 Crude oil plunged nearly 4 percent and the benchmark
Reuters/Jefferies CRB index shed nearly 2 percent after gaining
almost 10 percent since the beginning of 2011.
 Traders and analysts said Goldman's recommendation, while
central to the sell-off, was not the only reason for the
decline in grains and soy.
 Japan, the world's third-largest economy and the biggest
importer of corn, continued to deal with a devastating
earthquake and tsunami of a month ago, raising the severity of
radiation leaks from a damaged nuclear reactor.
 ""Japan's situation is having an impact on futures. They are
a large importer, especially of corn, so any change in the
nuclear problem there will affect the market,"" said Jason
Holthaus, an analyst for Country Hedging, Minneapolis,
Minnesota.

 By Sam Nelson
 CHICAGO, April 12 (Reuters) - U.S. grain markets fell on
Tuesday in a broad commodities sell-off, with corn futures
sinking as investors cashed out profits from its recent surge.
 For the first time since 1996, spot wheat futures fell
below those for corn due to tight supplies that have triggered
record-high corn prices -- a situation that could prompt
livestock feeders to switch from corn to wheat.
 Wheat futures at the Chicago Board of Trade fell nearly 5
percent, while soybeans slid 3 percent in a second day of
selling that started when long-time commodity bull Goldman
Sachs told clients to take profits in oil.
 The two-day sell-off in grains comes after a recent rally
in prices, led by corn futures which hit record highs.
 Speculators had been adding to their holdings of corn as
prices climbed to record levels.
 The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said that, as
of a week ago, speculators were net long CBOT corn futures by
266,089 contracts, up 33,129 contracts from the previous week.
 Wheat and soybeans posted their biggest two-day drop in a
month and corn was down 3 percent from its record high of
$7.83-3/4 hit early on Monday.
 Futures also were weighed down by Japan upgrading the
severity of its nuclear problem. It put the crisis on par with
the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986, the world's worst
nuclear disaster.
 GOLDMAN FOLLOW-THROUGH
 ""The Goldman recommendation started to break crude oil
yesterday, there is follow-through today and that's affecting
grains as well,"" said Jason Holthaus, an analyst for Country
Hedging in Minneapolis.
 Goldman Sachs has long been known as a commodity bull. On
April 1, the firm raised its forecast for Chicago Board of
Trade corn futures to $8.60 from its previous outlook for
$6.20, citing bullish data in a U.S. government stocks report.
 Goldman's advice to bank profits spooked grains markets
after corn hit its record high early this week.
 At 11:13 a.m. CDT (1613 GMT), CBOT May corn was down 19
cents at $7.57 and July was lower but off initial losses when
it traded down the daily 30 cent limit.
 May wheat was down 41 at $7.57-1/4 and soybeans for May
delivery were down 36-1/2 cents at $13.32.
 Crude oil plunged nearly 4 percent and the benchmark
Reuters/Jefferies CRB index shed nearly 2 percent after gaining
nearly 10 percent since the beginning of 2011.
 Traders and analysts said Goldman's recommendation, while
central to the sell-off, was was not the only reason for the
decline in grains and soy.
 Japan, the world's third largest economy and the largest
importer of corn, continued to deal with a devastating
earthquake and tsunami of a month ago, raising the severity of
radiation leaks from a damaged nuclear reactor.
 ""Japan's situation is having an impact on futures. They are
a large importer, especially of corn, so any change in the
nuclear problem there will affect the market,"" Holthaus said.
 CORN FUNDAMENTALS REMAIN BULLISH
 Despite Tuesday's decline, fundamentals in the corn market
remain bullish with strong demand from food and fuel sectors
amid the tightest stocks since the 1930s.
 Traders said the corn market should continue to attract
investors as the outlook for strong demand remained intact.
 ""The fundamentals for corn are very supportive. Corn might
break down for the near-term but I don't think there will be
any big selling until the crop gets planted,"" Holthaus said.
 The United States, the world's largest grain exporter, runs
the risk of depleting its corn supplies before the autumn
harvest unless demand wanes.
 U.S. farmers have planted 3 percent of intended corn
acreage so far this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said
after the market closed on Monday.
 Record futures prices for corn and tight global stocks
prompted farmers in southern stretches of the Corn Belt to
start their planting a little bit early as many hope to boost
their total corn acreage this year. But wet conditions
prevented most farmers in key corn-producing states such as
Illinois and Indiana from getting an early start on their
planting.

 (Updates prices)
 By Silvia Antonioli and Rebekah Curtis
 LONDON, April 12 (Reuters) - Copper fell on Tuesday as
investors fretted about softness in demand from top metals
consumer China, while the deepening nuclear crisis in Japan and
recent strength in oil prices also knocked the demand outlook.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell to
close at $9,630 a tonne from $9,855 at the close on Monday.
 Market sources think China's copper imports are unlikely to
surge in April after a 29.2 percent rise in March since
importers are worried about high stocks in Shanghai.
[ID:nL3E7FB1K9
 ""Confidence has taken a hit now,"" said Alex Heath, head of
base metals at RBC Capital Markets. ""The off-systems volumes
have been very low,"" he added of Tuesday's trade.
 Long-term, copper looked supported by a broadly expected
supply deficit. However, there are concerns in the market that
this deficit may not be as strong as previously expected.
 ""You'll probably see some revisions from the banks and
consultancies,"" Carl Firman, an analyst at Virtual Metals, said
of the copper deficit forecasts.
 Also triggering some selling, long-term commodity bull
Goldman Sachs on Monday advised its clients to take profits as
there was a strong chance that oil and other commodity prices
may reverse.
 Soaring oil prices and inflation in emerging economies pose
new risks to global recovery but are not yet strong enough to
derail it, the International Monetary Fund said on Monday.
 Meanwhile, the economic damage from Japan's massive
earthquake and tsunami last month is likely to be worse than
first thought as power shortages curtail factory output and
disrupt supply chains, a minister warned.
 
 RISING ALUMINIUM COSTS
 Higher inventories of copper in LME warehouses also
pressured prices, fanning concerns about Chinese demand.
 Stocks have been rising since mid-December and last rose
1,000 to 446,700 tonnes, the highest level since July 1.
 Aluminium stocks fell 2,275 tonnes to 4,575,250 tonnes but
stayed near a record 4,640,750 tonnes hit on Jan. 20 last year.
 Nonetheless, soaring power costs, lucrative bank deals that
keep metal away from the market and strong demand growth are
likely to boost aluminium prices this year.
 ""Despite recent increases in aluminium prices stimulated by
cost push support, we remain bullish as aluminium stays well
below its 2008 premium over marginal cost levels,"" said Metal
Bulletin Research analyst Kamil Wlazly.
 ""Having said that, we remain cautious about the impact of
widespread inflationary pressures in emerging economies and high
oil prices which could dampen global demand for industrial
metals.""
 Aluminum giant Alcoa Inc reported a first-quarter profit
that beat estimates on Monday.
 China is considering plans to either scrap or reduce export
tax rebates on some aluminium extrusion products, the China
Securities Journal reported.
 This comes after China decided to halt plans to build new
aluminium plants to tackle serious overcapacity in the industry.

 ""China is trying to keep inflation stable and keep the metal
inside the country. It will definitely have some impact,"" Wlazly
said, adding that while domestic prices would likely stabilise
or even soften, lower Chinese exports may support global prices.
 Aluminium closed at $2,660 a tonne from $2,689. Tin closed
at $32,550 a tonne from a last bid at $33,290 on Monday while
zinc was at $2,469 a tonne from $2,545.
 Lead was at $2,725 from $2,855 and nickel traded at $26,700

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, April 12 (Reuters) - Gold dropped 1 percent on
Tuesday for its biggest fall in a month, as a sharp drop in
crude oil on a bearish forecast from Goldman Sachs dragged the
metal further from record highs.
 Rallying prices of U.S. government debt also took some
safe-haven bids away from gold, which fell for a second
straight day, after Japan raised the severity level of the
crisis at its quake-stricken nuclear plant. [US/]
 Bullion has risen 11 percent since late January as rallies
in oil and grains stoked inflation worries. After hitting
31-year highs on Monday, silver also fell but less than gold
despite the white metal's higher price volatility.
 ""That (Goldman report) has given enough reasons for
investors to trim their positions, in particular for those
markets that have gone parabolic. That's enough to cool
enthusiasm for commodities at the moment,"" said Mark Luschini,
chief investment strategist of broker-dealer Janney Montgomery
Scott with $53 billion of assets under management.
 But he added: ""I don't think this is the end of the
commodity bull market.""
 Spot gold  dropped to $1,451.73 an ounce by 3:44 p.m.
EDT (1944 GMT), having earlier hit a one-week low of $1,443.49.
On Monday, gold hit a record at $1,476.21.
 U.S. gold futures for June  settled down $14.5 at
$1,453.60 an ounce, with trading volume rebounding after
slower-than-normal activity in the last several sessions.
 SILVER OUTPERFORMING GOLD
 U.S. silver trade was also heavy for a second straight day
to top 130,000 lots, preliminary Reuters data showed, one of
the busiest days of 2011.
 Silver  reversed earlier gains to trade down 0.5
percent at $39.96 an ounce, and was about 5 percent below
Monday's 31-year high at $41.93.
 The spread between gold and silver -- showing the relative
strength between the two metals -- has nearly halved since last
August.
 Luschini cited strong demand from retail investors and
silver exchange traded funds for the metal's outperforming
gold.
 ""It's a higher beta for silver, which outperforms on the
upside and tends to come back harder on the downside,"" said
Luschini, referring to a high correlation between the return
from silver to that of the commodities market.
 BULLION FALLS AS GOLDMAN WARNS
 Goldman Sachs  called a near $20 fall in the price of
Brent crude  in the coming months, saying speculators
have pushed prices ahead of fundamentals. [ID:nN12168871]
 It was the second warning of a steep market reversal from
the firm, which has been a long-term commodity bull, in as many
days.
 In December, Goldman forecast gold prices to peak near
$1,750 an ounce in 2012 on rising U.S. real interest rates,
even as the metal's rally is expected to continue in 2011 due
to loose monetary policies. [ID:nN01207723]
 Gold is used as a safe haven particularly in times of
financial and geopolitical uncertainty. It's rise to record
highs during Japan's crisis coincided with historic rallies in
many commodities, most of which fell on Tuesday as investors
shed riskier assets and opted for the U.S. Treasury bonds.
 The correlation between gold and oil tightened to 0.7 on
Tuesday, approaching its strongest level in nearly three
months, as recent crude rallies have increased gold's
inflation-hedge appeal.

 SINGAPORE, April 12 (Reuters) - Gold slipped nearly 1
percent on Tuesday, hovering below a record high and silver was
off a 31-year peak hit in the previous session after long-term
commodity bull Goldman Sachs advised investors to lock-in
trading profits before oil and other markets reverse.	
 But a weaker dollar could cushion the fall as two top U.S.
Federal Reserve officials, Janet Yellen and William Dudley, said
the central bank should stick to its super-easy monetary policy,
with inflation not a threat and unemployment too high.
[ID:nN11296347] 
 Spot gold fell $10.66 an ounce to $1,456.09 an ounce
by 0535 GMT. Bullion struck a lifetime high above $1,476 an
ounce on Monday on the prospect of a weaker dollar.	
 ""Some people may take profits and reduce positions.
Everybody knows that Goldman Sachs recommended to reduce
positions. That's why the market is a bit scared,"" said Dick
Poon, manager of precious metals at Heraeus in Hong Kong.	
 ""I think sentiment is still bullish. It's still
consolidating right now."" 
 Dealers also noted some selling related to escalating fears
over radiation in Japan, but the physical market still attracted
bargain hunting from speculators and jewellers. 
 Japan raised the severity of its nuclear crisis to the
highest level on Tuesday, putting it on a par with the world's
worst nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in 1986 because of the
amount of radiation released into the air and sea.
[ID:nLDE73B01P]	
 Spot gold may end the current retracement around
$1,444 per ounce and resume its uptrend thereafter, according to
Wang Tao, who is a Reuters market analyst for commodities and
energy technicals.	
 For a 24-hour gold technical outlook: 
 http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/WT1/20111204090716.jpg 
 Spot silver hardly changed at $40.12 an ounce, below
a 31-year high at $41.93 struck on Monday. 
 Goldman noted ""nascent signs of oil demand destruction in
the United States"" that could drag prices down, as well as the
possibility of a Libya ceasefire. Nigeria's elections, which had
added further risk to oil markets, had thus far not caused
supply disruptions, it added. [ID:nN11303064] 
 ""Some investors are using the Goldman Sachs recommendation
as a reason to take profits. I would put the support level at
around $1,450 level and of course, it is breached, we could see
a much sharper retracement all the way to about $1,430 or even
less than that,"" said a dealer in Singapore.	
 ""I think the fundamentals for gold remain strong. This is
just profit taking after a huge run-up. The outlook for the
dollar is also still shaky.""	
 Concerns about inflation also remain, traders said.	
 The International Monetary Fund on Monday said soaring oil
prices and inflation in emerging economies pose new risks to
global recovery but are not yet strong enough to derail it.

 U.S. gold futures for June dropped $10.6 an ounce

January high of $1.4582 remains in play.

 By Sam Nelson
 CHICAGO, April 11 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures notched
another record high on Monday as strong demand across the
livestock, ethanol, export and investment sectors faced the
tightest stocks since the 1930s.
 But soybeans saw their biggest decline in a month, tumbling
nearly 2 percent as South America harvests a bumper crop and
concerns mounted that China may slow its soy buying.
 New-crop corn futures came under pressure as U.S. farmers
appear to be off to a fast start seeding this year's crop. They
are expected to plant the second largest area to corn this
spring since World War Two.
 The dwindling U.S. corn supply lifted futures to a record
high of $7.83-3/4 in overnight Globex trade.
 ""Funds keep building a longer position in corn. If there
are any issues in the upcoming planting season it will be
pretty explosive; with stocks the way they are we can't have a
hiccup,"" said Dan Dempsey, an analyst for Iowa Grain.
 A government report later in the day was expected to show
the fastest start ever in U.S. corn seedings.
 Corn rose for the second straight trading session, nearing
$8 a bushel and on track to post gains for five consecutive
weeks after government reports showed demand from all sectors
despite record high prices.
 ""The fundamentals are still taking the lead on corn, the
interest is still there to own corn,"" said Dax Wedemeyer, an
analyst for U.S. Commodities in Des Moines, Iowa.
 CBOT May corn closed up 8 cents per bushel at $7.76. May
soy was down 23-3/4 at $13.68-1/2 and May wheat was up 3/4 at
$7.98-1/4.
 Wheat was firm, following corn. However, gains in Chicago
Board of Trade wheat were slowed by forecasts for showers in
drought-plagued areas of the U.S. Plains that could enhance
development of the struggling hard red winter wheat crop grown
in that region. That weighed on the HRW wheat contract traded
at the Kansas City Board of trade.
 Traders said unwinding of KCBT/CBOT and MGEX/CBOT spreads
lifted Chicago wheat at the expense of the higher protein wheat
contracts traded on the KCBT and MGEX.
 INVESTORS TO KEEP FOCUS ON CORN DEMAND
 Traders said the corn market should remain on investors'
radar until there are signs demand is cooling off.
 The United States, the world's largest grain exporter, runs
the risk of depleting its corn supplies before the autumn
harvest unless demand wanes.
 The 2011 U.S. corn crop must be seeded in a timely manner
to ensure an adequate supply for next year.
 Wet weather in the Midwest is slowing spring fieldwork but
plenty of time remains to plant the 2011 crop. The bulk of U.S.
corn plantings usually occur in late April and early May.
 The May/December corn spread remained at a lofty $1.20-1/4
per bushel, premium May. In early March, that spread widened to
a life-of-contract high $1.30-3/4 per bushel, premium May.
 The big premium for May reflects shrinking old-crop stocks
and outlooks for farmers to plant the second largest U.S. corn
area since 1944.
 ""The spread will remain wide unless we see some planting
problems and December could then begin recovering against May,
which would narrow the spread,"" Wedemeyer said.
 POOR MARGINS IN CHINA
 Soybeans fell more than 1 percent as the harvest of South
America's bumper soy crop advanced, some buyers took profits,
and traders worried about demand from China, the world's
leading soybean importer.
 ""As for soy, news that China might cancel cargoes is the
impetus behind lower prices,"" said Matt Pierce of
GrainAnalyst.com.
 An official with China's state-owned trading house COFCO Co
Ltd attributed a possible slowdown in soy imports to poor
crushing margins. In addition, he said soy supplies are
expected to be ample in the first half of the year.

 NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - Gold and silver hit new
highs on Monday before falling in tandem with crude oil, as
safe-haven bids faded after a peace plan surfaced to end
Libya's two-month-old civil war.
 After hitting a record high $1,476.21 an ounce earlier,
gold was pressured on an African Union's Libya peace initiative
and as investors heeded a recommendation from long-term
commodities bull Goldman Sachs. Silver also backed off a
31-year high.
 ""The war premium in the metals seems to have diminished as
news that a possible ceasefire in Libya and the willingness to
negotiate a settlement is weighing on the market,"" said George
Nickas of commodities futures broker FC Stone.
 Spot gold was down 0.4 percent at $1,466.59 an ounce by
2:21 p.m. EDT (1821 GMT). U.S. gold futures for June delivery
settled down $6 at at $1,468.10.
 Investors cautiously eyed the peace plan, which collapsed
within hours after Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's forces
shelled a besieged city and rebels warned of no deal unless he
was toppled.
 Bullion was also under heavy pressure after Goldman claimed
there was a strong chance that commodities prices might reverse
and recommended clients take profits on what has been a hugely
profitable trade.
 Spot silver retreated from a session high of $41.93, the
strongest since 1980. It later fell 0.4 percent to $40.68 an
ounce. May silver settled up 0.4 cent at $40.612.
 The gold-to-silver ratio -- showing the relative strength
between the two metals -- fell to 36 Monday, approaching its
lowest level in recent decades at just above 32, set in 1983
after the Hunt Brothers cornered the silver market.
 The spreads between gold and silver have nearly halved
since last August.
 ""After three years of undervaluation, silver is now looking
expensive again. Silver will also be more vulnerable than gold
to a slowdown in the global economy,"" Capital Economics
strategists said in a note.
 Fund managers said silver was expected to outperform gold
in a bull metals markets because the white metal bears a higher
risk and price volatility than gold.
 'RETAIL FLOWS INTO SILVER'
 Despite Monday's decline, investor money has flowed into
precious metals so far this month as investors worried about
the potential for rising inflation in developing markets and
changes to monetary policy in the United States.
 Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange traded
fund, SPDR Gold Trust, climbed 6 tonnes to about 1,217 tonnes
as of Friday -- the strongest level in nearly a month.
 No. 1 iShares Silver Trust said holdings held at a record
at 11,192.80 tonnes.
 ""There is a lot of retail flows into silver products,
particularly coins. Many smaller investors are allocating more
of their portfolios to silver today,"" said Robert Lutts, chief
investment officer of Cabot Money Management, a wealth manager
with about $500 million in client assets.
 Dollar weakness initially lifted gold. Analysts said the
dollar could further weaken because of the widening interest
rate differentials after the European Central Bank's interest
rate hike last week.
 Meanwhile, the U.S. central bank's ultra-loose monetary
policy remains appropriate, given high unemployment and tame
underlying inflation trends, said Janet Yellen, the Federal
Reserve's vice chair, echoing views expressed by Chairman Ben
Bernanke.
 Gold has been a major beneficiary since the Fed has kept
short-term rates near zero since December 2008.
 Among other precious metals, platinum was down 1.2 percent
at $1,781.74 an ounce, while palladium dropped 0.8 percent to
$784.47.

 By Chris Kelly and Pratima Desai
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - Copper retreated from an earlier
five-week high on Monday, snapping a four day rally as the struggling dollar
strengthened and a strong aftershock in Japan unnerved some investors.
 Losses sped up later in the session after long-term commodity bull Goldman
Sachs advised its clients in a note to close their long copper positions,
which returned 23 percent since the investment bank's first recommendation to
go long in October 2010.
 ""If one of the biggest players isn't buying and gets out of the market,
we'll set back,"" said Frank Lesh, broker and futures analyst with Future Path
Trading in Chicago.
 London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month copper peaked at $9,944.75 a tonne,
its priciest level since March 4, before ending with a $20 loss, at $9,855.
 COMEX May copper shed 4.15 cents to settle at $4.46 per lb, near the bottom
of its $4.4555 to $4.5330 session range.
 Trading volumes remained brisk. More than 50,500 lots exchanged hands by
2:25 p.m. EDT (1825 GMT), in excess of 20 percent above the 30-day norm,
according to Thomson Reuters preliminary data.
 The day began with Chinese trade data for the month of March, showing the
metal-consuming giant's appetite for copper recovered strongly from February's
weaker tone.
 Copper initially jumped on the back of the data, but with little
follow-through buying, gains were quickly rolled back as reports of another
powerful aftershock in Japan surfaced.
 ""All the markets were up overnight and after good Chinese data,"" said RBC
Capital's head of base metals Alex Heath.
 ""The aftershock was unnerving a market that was probably uncomfortable with
the early gains on the back of so little news this morning.""
 Concerns about the sustainability of the global economic recovery from the
International Monetary Fund added to the bearish tone.
 With little in the way of fresh fundamental news, investors were left to
take their directional cues from the currency markets.
 The dollar bounced against the euro in a relief rally after the U.S.
government averted a potential shutdown, triggering losses across the broader
commodity spectrum.
 Furthermore, stocks of copper in LME warehouses climbed 1,525 tonnes to
445,700 tonnes, up nearly 18 percent since the end of last year and the highest
since early last July.
 NEGATIVE ANOMALY
 A 29.2 percent rise in copper imports during the month of March extended
copper's rally overnight and many hold a positive outlook for demand and
prices.
 ""Copper looks set to test the $10,000 a tonne mark again, supported by
strong import figures from China,"" Commerzbank said in a note. ""February
appears to have been a negative anomaly ... and fears of a downturn of demand
have not been confirmed.
 The metal hit a record at $10,190 in February.
 The data alleviated some fears that China's absence from the copper market
would be prolonged, but doubts remain and many point to high stocks in
Shanghai.
 China is the world's largest consumer of copper, accounting for about 40
percent of global demand estimated at around 21 million tonnes this year.
 Aluminum jumped to $2,720 a tonne, a level last seen in August 2008, before
ending down $24 at $2,689 a tonne.
 China's decision to halt plans for new aluminium plants in the country to
tackle serious overcapacity added a positive tone for the market, traders
said.
 Tin hit a record at $33,600 a tonne as rains and police raids on illegal
tin miners have hampered mining in Indonesia.

 CHICAGO, April 11 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures rose on
Monday but held below a new record high posted overnight as
traders bet on higher prices to preserve dwindling supplies in
the United States, the top exporter of the feed grain.
 The tightest U.S. corn stocks since the 1930s lifted
futures to a new high of $7.83-3/4 in overnight Globex trade.
 A government report later in the day is expected to show
that U.S. farmers are off to their fastest start on record in
seeding this year's corn crop.
 Corn rose for the second day in a row, closing in on $8 per
bushel and on track to post gains for five consecutive weeks
after government reports showed that demand from exporters,
feeders and ethanol makers remains robust despite record high
prices.
 ""The fundamentals are still taking the lead on corn, the
interest is still there to own corn,"" said Dax Wedemeyer, an
analyst for U.S. Commodities, Des Moines, Iowa.
 Soybeans fell over 1 percent as the harvest of South

 POOR MARGINS IN CHINA
 An official with China's state-owned trading house COFCO Co
Ltd attributed a possible slowdown in soy imports to poor
crushing margins. In addition, he said soy supplies are
expected to be ample in the first half of the year.
 U.S. wheat turned firm, following the rally in corn, after
moving lower in earlier dealings because of a sag in the high
protein top-quality hard red winter wheat traded on the Kansas
City Board of Trade.
 Wheat was pressured by forecasts for showers over the next
week in drought-plagued areas of the U.S. Plains hard red
winter wheat growing region, which could improve the condition
of the developing wheat crop.
 At 10:36 a.m. CDT (1536 GMT), CBOT May corn was up 4-1/2
cents per bushel at $7.72-1/2, May soy was down 24 cents at
$13.68-1/4 and May wheat was up 1/2 cent at $7.98.
 INVESTORS TO KEEP FOCUS ON CORN DEMAND
 Traders said the corn market likely would remain on
investors' radar until there are signs that demand is cooling
off.
 The United States is the world's largest grain exporter and
runs the risk of depleting its corn suppplies before the autumn
harvest unless demand is curbed.
 There is a need for the 2011 U.S. corn crop to be seeded in
a timely manner to ensure an adequate supply for next year.
 Wet weather in the Midwest is currently slowing spring
field work but there is still plenty of time to plant the 2011
corn crop. The bulk of U.S. corn plantings usually occur in
late April and early May.
 The May/December corn spread widened to a life of contract
high $1.30-3/4 per bushel, premium May in early March and
remained at a lofty $1.21 per bushel premium May on Monday.
 The big premium for May is a reflection of the shrinking
old-crop stocks and the outlooks for farmers to plant the
second largest U.S. corn area since 1944.
 ""The spread will remain wide unless we see some planting
problems and December could then begin recovering against May,
which would narrow the spread,"" Wedemeyer said.

 By David Brough and Sarah McFarlane
 LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - ICE cocoa futures extended
gains on Monday on concerns over the supply outlook from top
producer Ivory Coast despite the lifting of European Union
sanctions on four entities.
 Coffee futures prices dipped on light producer selling,
while sugar rose on investor buying, as dealers eyed the expiry
of the London and ICE spot contracts later this month.
 In cocoa, the EU lifted sanctions on Friday on Abidjan and
San Pedro ports as well as on the Ivorian Refining Company and
the Coffee and Cocoa Trade Management Committee, following a
request from presidential claimant Alassane Ouattara.
 However, fighting between forces loyal to Ouattara and
incumbent Ivory Coast leader Laurent Gbagbo continued in the
commercial capital Abidjan. 
 U.N. and French helicopters attacked forces loyal to Gbagbo,
damaging the presidential residence in Abidjan and destroying
heavy weapons after U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon ordered them
silenced.
 Dealers and analysts said physical cocoa was unlikely to
flow from Ivory Coast until the fighting stops and the banking
system is restored, despite the EU sanctions move. Ivory Coast
accounts for about 40 percent of world supplies.
 ""Getting the banking system up and running is the key,"" said
a European analyst with a leading trade house.
 ""Nothing will start moving until the banks are back
operating. Until you can pay for goods, nothing will really
move. How quickly this will happen is very hard to predict.""
 ICE second-month, July cocoa was up $47 or 1.6 percent to
$3,032 per tonne in modest volume of 1,026 lots at 1053 GMT,
below the 32-year high of $3,775 per tonne touched on March 4.
 London second-month, July cocoa was up 31 pounds or 1.6
percent to 1,920 pounds ($3,142) per tonne in moderate turnover
of 1,689 lots.
 Coffee prices eased, stuck within a tight range as dealers
said light producer selling weighed and prices remained below
the 34-year high of $2.9665 a lb touched on March 9.
 ""Prices will struggle to push up too high again because
you've got a lot of producer selling coming over the next few
months ... prices above $2.70 a lb are encouraging producer
selling,"" said a London-based broker.
 ICE July arabica coffee fell 2.35 cents or 0.85 percent to
$2.7550 per lb at 1055 GMT.
 ICE coffee prices rose over 5 percent last week, triggering
producer selling, to peak at $2.8125 a lb on Friday, their
highest since March 11.
 ""Over the last two weeks the coffee markets have been so
volatile, it's been more technical than fundamental,"" the broker
said.
 Liffe July robustas were down $18 or 0.7 percent to $2,429 a
tonne in modest volume of 1,766 lots.
 
 SUGAR EXPIRIES
 Sugar futures rose on options-related buying as dealers
focused on expiry of the London May white sugar contract on
April 15 and of the ICE May raw sugar futures contract on April
29. Options expiry on the May New York contract takes place on
Friday.
 Dealers talked of delays in harvesting of the cane crop in
the centre-south of Brazil, low global stocks and
larger-than-expected production in Thailand
 ICE May raw sugar futures rose 0.26 cent or 1 percent to
26.92 cents a lb at 1056 GMT.
 London May white sugar rose $1.60 or 0.2 percent to $701.30

 LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - Copper reached five-week highs
on Monday as a weaker dollar and robust imports by top consumer
China boosted investor appetite for the metal, but then turned
lower after news of another strong earthquake in Japan.
 Initially tracking copper, aluminium jumped to $2,720 a
tonne, a level last seen in August 2008, and lead touched $2,904
a tonne, its highest since April 2008. Tin hit a record high of
$33,600 a tonne.
 Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange hit $9,944.75
a tonne, the highest since March 4. The metal used in power and
construction closed at $9,855 a tonne from $9,875 at the close
on Friday.
 The dollar was hovering near last week's 16-month lows
against a basket of currencies, making metals priced in the U.S.
currency cheaper for holders of other currencies.
 ""All the markets were up overnight and after good Chinese
data. They were all following the dollar,"" said RBC Capital's
head of base metals Alex Heath, adding that the latest
earthquake in Japan had then spurred some selling.
 ""The aftershock was unnerving a market that was probably
uncomfortable with the early gains on the back of so little news
this morning,"" he added, underlining that lately, investment
demand for metals has pushed prices above the levels expected
from the fundamentals alone.
 A big tremor shook buildings in Tokyo and a wide swathe of
eastern Japan on Monday, knocking out power to 220,000
households and causing a halt to water pumping to cool three
damaged reactors at Fukushima.
 The latest earthquake rattled investors after the March 11
quake and tsunami sparked the worst nuclear crisis since
Chernobyl, a trader said.
 ""Coming (the new earthquake) on top of everything else in
Japan, it does beg the question of the impact on growth. Japan
is a key cog in the world economy,"" the trader said.
 He added that rising copper stocks were also weighing on
sentiment. Stocks of copper in LME warehouses at 445,700 tonnes
are up about 18 percent since the end of last year and the
highest since early last July.
 
 NEGATIVE ANOMALY
 Helping sentiment was a 29.2 percent rise in imports of
copper by China to 304,299 tonnes in March from 235,469 tonnes
in the previous month.
 Copper imports to China include anode, refined, alloy and
semi-finished copper products.
 ""Copper looks set to test the $10,000 a tonne mark again,
supported by strong import figures from China,"" Commerzbank said
in a note. ""February appears to have been a negative anomaly ...
and fears of a downturn of demand have not been confirmed.
 The metal hit its high of $10,190 in February.
 The data alleviates some fears that China's absence from the
copper market would be prolonged, but doubts remain and many
point to high stocks in Shanghai.
 China is the world's largest consumer of copper, accounting
for about 40 percent of global demand estimated at around 21
million tonnes this year. 
 ""The picture (for Chinese imports) is similar with
aluminium,"" Commerzbank said.
 China is also the world's largest producer and consumer of
aluminium used in transport, construction and packaging.
 Aluminium has been boosted in recent weeks by surging power
costs, which account for about 35 percent of smelting costs. It
closed at $2,689 a tonne from $2,713 at the close on Friday.
 China's decision to halt plans for new aluminium plants in
the country to tackle serious overcapacity is also a positive
for aluminium, traders said.
 Lead finished at $2,855 from $2,850 a tonne. Prices have
been reinforced by expectations of strong demand for
battery-powered electricity in Japan where the earthquake and
tsunami have crippled nuclear power plants.
 Tin, untraded in rings, was bid at $33,290 a tonne from
$33,050. Falling supplies of tin ore to independent smelters in
Bangka island because of rain and police raids on illegal miners
have hampered mining in Indonesia, the world's largest exporter,
and raised concern about world supplies.
 Zinc finished at $2,545 a tonne from $2,532, and nickel
ended at $27,705 from $27,600.

 NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - Signs of a possible Libyan
peace deal knocked gold down from a record high hit early on
Monday on the back of a weaker dollar and inflation worries,
while silver backed off from a 31-year high but was still on
track for its ninth straight gain.
 Fading safe haven demand undermined bullion after it hit
$1,476.21 an ounce for the first time, and weaker oil was also
a negative after the African Union signaled progress in Libyan
peace talks.
 Spot gold  was down 0.5 percent at $1,465.76 an ounce
by 12:37 p.m. EDT (1637 GMT). U.S. gold futures for June
delivery  were last off $7.50 at $1,465.90.
 Spot silver  retreated from its session high $41.93,
the strongest since 1980. May silver  recovered from a
brief dip into negative territory and was up 11.7 cents at
$40.725.
 The gold-to-silver ratio -- the number of silver ounces

 SINGAPORE, April 11 (Reuters) - Gold jumped to a record high
for a fifth straight trading day on Monday as the prospect of
more declines in the U.S. dollar drove investors into the
precious metal, with record exchange traded fund holdings
helping silver to its highest in more than three decades.	
 Heightened inflationary threats despite interest hikes by
China and the European Central Bank boosted gold's safe haven
appeal, while silver also attracted buying from investors
looking for a cheaper alternative to bullion. The gold-to-silver
ratio was at a 28-year low around 35. 
 Spot gold was steady at $1,472.80 an ounce by 0335
GMT, having risen as high as $1,476.21 as the euro jumped to a
15-month high against the U.S. dollar. 
 ""I think there is a good chance that gold could hit $1,500
an ounce within this quarter. And perhaps even higher if we see
the weakness in the dollar persist and the Federal Reserve
continues their relatively easy monetary policy,"" said Ong Yi
Ling, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.	
 ""This week, perhaps, the focus could be on whether the
Federal Reserve actually indicates to the market whether they
will be exiting their loose monetary policy, and whether they
display any hawkish signals."" 
 Gold has gained more than 10 percent since late January when
political unrest began to flare in the Middle East and North
Africa. 
 But Monday's gains could be capped by a drop in energy
prices. Brent crude  fell below $126 after the African
Union said Muammar Gaddafi has accepted a roadmap to end the
civil war in Libya, including an immediate ceasefire in the
North African producer. 
 The metal is still far below its all-time inflation-adjusted
high, estimated at almost $2,500 an ounce set in 1980, an era of
Cold War tension, oil shocks and hyperinflation.	
 Spot gold is heading towards $1,518 per ounce based
on its wave pattern and a Fibonacci projection analysis,
according to Wang Tao, a Reuters market analyst for commodities

prices before cashing in. Premiums were steady at between 70
cents and $1 an ounce to the spot London price in Singapore. 
 ""Selling started last week, but I don't think the quantity
is huge. Thailand has quietened down a lit bit and I think
because people are still bullish about gold,"" said a dealer in
Singapore.	
 ""My premiums are unchanged at 70 cents,"" he added.	
 Another Singapore-based dealer said selling picked up from
Indonesia on Monday, but it had little no impact on premiums. 
 ""I sold my last deal into Thailand at 80 cents, so I presume
the premiums are about there,"" he added.	
 In other markets, the Nikkei edged lower after Citigroup

 SINGAPORE, April 11 (Reuters) - Gold jumped to a record high for a fifth
straight trading day on Monday as the euro hit a 15-month high against the U.S.
dollar, while an increase in exchange traded fund holdings to an all-time high
helped silver to its highest in more than three decades. 
 Heightened inflationary threats despite interest hikes by China and the
European Central Bank boosted gold's safe haven appeal, while silver also
attracted buying from investors looking for a cheaper alternative to bullion.
The gold-to-silver ratio was at a 28-year low around 35. 
 Spot gold added $2.40 an ounce to $1,475.10 an ounce by 0133 GMT,
having risen as high as $1,476.21. 
 ""I think there is a good chance that gold could hit $1,500 an ounce within
this quarter. And perhaps even higher if we see the weakness in the dollar
persist and the Federal Reserve continues their relatively easy monetary
policy,"" said Ong Yi Ling, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.	
 ""This week, perhaps, the focus could be on whether the Federal Reserve
actually indicates to the market whether they will be exiting their loose
monetary policy, and whether they display any hawkish signals."" 
 Spot gold is heading towards $1,518 per ounce based on its wave
pattern and a Fibonacci projection analysis, according to Wang Tao, a Reuters
market analyst for commodities and energy technicals.

 By Chris Kelly and Silvia Antonioli
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 8 (Reuters) - Copper ended up over 2
percent on Friday, posting its biggest weekly advance since early
December, as the dollar weakened and investor demand for the metal
increased with inflation fears mounting.
 The gains ran far and wide in the base metals complex, with
another record tin price, a three-year peak in the price of lead
and aluminum touching its loftiest level since August 2008.
 Interest rate hikes by China and the European Central Bank
this week failed to contain the bullish momentum, as investors
eyeing greater inflationary threats in emerging and developed
economies alike continued to flock to hard assets like copper,
precious metals and crude oil as hedges.
 ""It's an across-the-board surge in all the commodities. Gold,
oil ... they're all up. People are dumping the dollar and buying
commodities,"" said MF Global senior commodity analyst Edward
Meir.
 London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month copper rallied $205 to
close at $9,875 per tonne, near a session peak of $9,896 -- its
highest in more than a month.
 COMEX May copper surged 8.50 cents, or 1.9 percent, to settle
at $4.5015 per lb.
 For the week, prices were up about 5.7 percent -- their
largest weekly gain since the first week of December 2010.
 The recent bout of price strength placed both London and New
York copper contracts a little more than 3 percent away from their
mid-February records at $10,190 per tonne and $4.6575 per lb,
respectively.
 Even a sustained softness from Chinese consumers at the start
of the year and uncertainties surrounding the true amount of
off-exchange, bonded warehouse stocks in China -- estimated at
more than 600,000 tonnes -- have failed to alter longer-term
demand perceptions and stem the amount of money flowing into the
complex this week as a hedge against inflation.
 ""You have speculative money investing in copper in a
protection against inflation, and that seems to be testing
resistance at $10,000 (per tonne) and negating the problems
associated with off-exchange, bonded material in China,"" said
Justin Lennon, analyst with Mitsui Bussan Commodities (U.S.A.)
Inc.
 Traders were also seeking protection Friday against a
depreciation in the U.S. dollar, which fell to a 15-month low
against the euro as the prospect of a U.S. government shutdown
loomed.
 Looking ahead, all eyes will be on Chinese import data on
Monday, which should show the metal-consuming giant's appetite for
copper, iron ore and coal imports in March rebounded from
multimonth lows posted in February, a holiday-shortened month.
 STOCKS
 Reinforcing the near-term sluggishness in demand, stocks of
copper saw another 1,800 tonnes flow into LME warehouses on
Thursday, bringing total levels to 444,175 tonnes, their highest
since July 2010.
 But a big 4.8 percent withdrawal in copper inventories in
warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange pointed to
healthier demand prospects into the seasonally better second
quarter.
 ""We have seen a decent outflow of stocks in Shanghai. It would
suggest that post Chinese New Year buyers are coming back into the
market,"" Daniel Major, an analyst at RBS, said.
 Furthermore, copper scrap arrivals into China are likely to
rise in late April and May after importers placed more spot orders
in the past month as domestic stocks fell, supplier and buyer
sources told Reuters.
 In other metals, aluminum peaked at $2,715 per tonne, its
highest since August 2008, before ending up $41 at $2,713.
 Tin extended gains after the close to a fresh record at
$33,100 per tonne, It closed the kerb up $500 at $33,050. Lead hit
a three-year high of $2,870, and closed up $60 at $2,850.

 * Tight supplies underpin arabicas market
 * Favourable weather augurs for ample Ivorian cocoa output
 
 (Adds quote, updates prices)
 By Sarah McFarlane and David Brough
 LONDON, April 8 (Reuters) - ICE cocoa futures edged lower
after Ivory Coast presidential claimant Alassane Ouattara called
for an end to sanctions against the leading producer.
ICE arabica coffee futures rose, supported by a weak dollar
and tight supplies of high-quality beans, while sugar extended
losses, with a focus on a larger-than-expected harvest in
Thailand and news of bookings of Thai sugar for Russia.
 In Ivory Coast, Ouattara sought to assert his grip on power
after weeks of fighting that has left his rival Laurent Gbagbo
isolated behind a military cordon in his bunker.
 Cocoa trade has been paralysed due to the power struggle
following fiercely disputed elections on Nov. 28.
 Ivory Coast supplies about 40 percent of the world's cocoa.
Dealers said that as cocoa trade there picked up again, the
market focus would shift increasingly to fundamentals and
favourable weather augured for ample production.
 ""Since November when we've had this risk premium the
fundamentals have actually improved,"" a Europe-based commodity
analyst at an investment fund said.
 The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) said in its
latest monthly market review that the political crisis in Ivory
Coast continued to instil nervousness among market participants.
 ""Should the dispute be resolved, significant volumes of
cocoa will flow from the country after the logistical issues
have been addressed,"" the London-based ICCO said.
 ""Such a development could lead to a likely decline in prices
as a result of the bearish fundamental outlook of the cocoa
market.""
 ICE July cocoa was down $34 or 1.1 percent at $2,968 a tonne
in modest volume of 8,792 lots at 1437 GMT.
 ICE cocoa futures prices have fallen by a fifth since
hitting a 32-year high at $3,775 per tonne a month ago.
 Liffe July cocoa was down 30 pounds or 1.6 percent to 1,884
pounds per tonne in slim volume of 2,847 lots.
 
 COFFEE FIRMER
 Arabica coffee futures on ICE edged higher, supported by the
weakening dollar, having surged to close up 3 percent in heavy
volume on Thursday as funds added positions. 
 The arabicas market is underpinned by tight global supplies
of high quality beans.
 ICE July arabica coffee rose 3.3 cents or 1.2 percent to
$2.7895 per lb at 1205 GMT.
 Liffe July robustas were up $17 or 0.7 percent to $2,460 a
tonne in moderate turnover of 5,462 lots.
 Last week's pullback in prices has stimulated buying on the
physical market as roasters expand their cover, although
Thursday's rebound has dampened interest, dealers said.
 ""There was some demand for arabica coffee when New York was
trading below $2.60 a lb for June and July shipment,"" a European
trader said.
 Market technicals, based on historical prices charts, have
turned bullish after Thursday's rally, dealers said.
 Raw sugar futures on ICE fell, underpinned by news that Thai
raw sugar shipments had been booked for Russia, undercutting
traditional supplier Brazil, and signalling less congestion at
Brazilian ports later this year.
 ICE May raw sugar futures extended losses as the dollar
dropped against a basket of currencies, falling 0.48 cent or 1.8
percent to 26.02 cents a lb at 1440 GMT.
 
 THAI SUGAR FOR RUSSIA
 Dealers focused on news of bookings of Thai sugar for
Russia, undercutting traditional supplier Brazil.
 Raw sugar shipments from Thailand's larger than expected
crop have been booked for Russia for April loading and May
arrival, European trade sources said on Friday.
 Physical dealers that if Thai sugar undercut Brazilian
supplies to Asian markets such as Indonesia and Malaysia, the
strain on Brazilian port capacity will be less this year than
last year.
 ""It (big Thai crop) will take pressure off Brazil, but we
still think there will be congestion issues in Brazil,"" one
European trade source said.
 Dealers said the focus in the market was on how much sugar
would be delivered when London's May white sugar contract goes
off the board on April 15.
 London May white sugar was down $3.10 or 0.4 percent to
$704.60 per tonne in thin turnover of 3,710 lots.

 (Updates with closing prices)
 By Silvia Antonioli and Sue Thomas
 LONDON, April 8 (Reuters) - Copper rose to its highest level
in more than a month on Friday as a weaker dollar lifted the
metal's appeal for holders of other currencies and ahead of
trade data from China on Monday.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at
$9,875 per tonne, up from a close of $9,670 on Thursday.
Earlier, it touched $9,896 a tonne, its highest in more than a
month.
 Copper's gains were echoed through the base metals complex,
with three-month tin on the London Metal Exchange hitting a
record, lead at a three-year high and aluminium touching its
highest since August 2008.
 ""It's an across-the-board surge in all the commodities.
Gold, oil, they're all up. People are dumping the dollar and
buying commodities,"" said MF Global senior commodity analyst
Edward Meir.
 ""We are waiting for Monday when we get the Chinese import
data for a variety of commodities and I think that should
establish short-term direction.""
 China's copper, iron ore and coal imports in March are
expected to rebound from multi-month lows posted in February, a
holiday-shortened month.
 ""Positive sentiment is feeding through. Technical levels
have been broken. A weaker dollar is also supporting copper,""
said Daniel Major, an analyst at RBS. ""Investors' money is
coming back into the sector after a risk aversion period.""
 Violence in Libya, political unrest in North Africa and the
Middle East, and Japan's March 11 earthquake had hit consumers'
confidence and eroded confidence in commodities perceived as
risky such as base metals.
 But optimism in global economic growth has since returned,
lifting world shares to their highest level in more than three
years, and leading to gains in commodities.
 The euro rose to a 15-month high against the dollar,
supported by expectations of more euro zone interest rate hikes.
A weak dollar makes commodities priced in the U.S. unit cheaper
for holders of other currencies. 
 
 STOCKS
 But in signs demand for copper remains weak, inventories of
the metal in London Metal Exchange warehouses rose 1,800 tonnes
to 444,175 tonnes, their highest since July 2010, the latest
data showed.
 But data also showed a big fall in copper inventories in
warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
signalling improved demand in top consumer China.
 ""We have seen a decent outflow of stocks in Shanghai. It
would suggest that post Chinese New Year buyers are coming back
into the market,"" Major said.
 Inventories of aluminium fell 2,700 tonnes on the London
Metal Exchange to 4,581,775 tonnes, the latest data showed.
 Aluminium closed at $2,713 from Thursday's $2,672 close, off
its highest since August 2008 at $2,715 a tonne. Tin closed at a
record $33,050 from $32,550.
 Lead, which is used in batteries, hit a three-year high of
$2,870 and closed at $2,850 from $2,790. Zinc, used in
galvanizing, closed $2,532 from $2,453.
 Nickel was $27,600 from $26,800.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - Gold fell for a third session
on Monday, weighed down by economic optimism as investors bet
debt-laden Greece would take action needed to avoid a default,
pressuring safe-haven demand.
 Gold's response to Greece's debt crisis has so far been
erratic. Last week, the metal notched its worst performance in
eight weeks as fears of economic slowdown pressured bullion
prices along with other risk markets such as equities. In the
past, gold tended to benefit as a safe haven in times of
economic uncertainty.
 ""A possible solution to the Greece debt situation ... may
dampen the need for safe-haven buying as the euro rebounded and
currencies are less volatile,"" said George Gero, vice president
of RBC Capital Markets. ""Investors are buying stocks as they
were more appealing.""
 Spot gold  was down 0.3 percent at $1,495.55 an ounce
at 3:26 p.m. EDT (1926 GMT). U.S. gold futures for August
delivery  settled down $4.50 an ounce at $1,496.40, after
trading between $1,490.80 and $1,506.10.
 Silver  was down 2 percent at $33.58 an ounce,
reflecting losses in other industrial metals.
 Wall Street rebounded more than 1 percent, led by banks
after global banking regulators in Basel announced global
capital rules that investors viewed as less onerous than
previously expected. [ID:nLDE75O053]
 Safe-haven buying also eased as political talks to avoid a
damaging U.S. debt default resumed on Monday, RBC's Gero said.
 President Barack Obama is confident Democrats and
Republicans can cut a ""significant deal"" to trim the U.S.
deficit and to work toward an agreement to raise the debt
ceiling, the White House said. [ID:nN1E75P06P]
 Gold fell as low as $1,490.90 an ounce in early trade as
oil and industrial metals extended last week's hefty drop.
Despite the recent retreat in prices, gold was still one of the
best performing commodities in the second quarter, rising 4
percent while most other goods dropped in price. (Graphic:

 DOLLAR STRENGTH IN FOCUS
 With less than a week until the end of the Federal
Reserve's second quantitative easing program, bullion's 3
percent fall over the past two days has raised questions about
whether its years-long boom has stalled. After reaching a high
of $1,575.79 on May 2, gold has struggled.
 It also remains uncertain if gold could benefit from
further European debt woes should investors shun risky
investments and buy the U.S. Treasuries.
 The dollar gained around 1 percent last week versus the
euro on worries that Greece's parliament will not approve a
package of austerity measures. The U.S. currency also
strengthened after the Federal Reserve last week offered no
hope for additional monetary support.
 On Monday, the euro, however, rose against the greenback as
investors bet Greece's parliament would approve a fiscal
austerity package needed for the country to receive emergency
aid and avoid defaulting on its debt.
 Some of the investment industry's heavyweights said
Greece's debt crisis could be the beginning of a bigger
structural problem.
 Deutsche Bank's  CEO described the situation in
Greece as critical and warned contagion to other euro zone
members could lead to a crisis bigger than the one sparked by
the collapse of Lehman Brothers. [ID:nLDE75Q152]
 On Sunday, billionaire investor George Soros thinks a
country will eventually exit the euro zone and urged
policymakers on Sunday to come up with a ""plan B"" that could
rescue the European Union from looming economic collapse.

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, April 8 (Reuters) - Gold struck a record high on
Friday, and silver hit $40 an ounce for the first time since
1980, as a weaker dollar and concerns about inflation sent
investors piling into precious metals.	
 Silver exchange traded fund holdings jumped to an all-time
high and gold holding rose to their largest since mid-March as a
surge in oil and other commodity prices threatens to bolster
already rising inflation. 
 Investors are also looking to the prospect of more declines
in the dollar following the European Central Bank's first rate
hike since 2008.	
 Spot gold rose as high as $1,466.40 an ounce, on
track for a gain of 1 percent this week.	
 ""Corrections from here are likely to be shallow, with fresh
investment demand emerging on all dips. $1,500 an ounce is
around the corner and may be hit in the next few sessions,"" said
Pradeep Unni, senior analyst at Richcomm Global Services in
Dubai. 
 The world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR
Gold Trust , said its holdings rose to 1,217.209 tonnes by
April 7, their highest since mid-March. 
 ""Maybe there is some dollar-related buying because it's
weakening. People see the ETF increasing a bit, so they want to
buy some gold,"" said Ronald Leung, director of Lee Cheong Gold
Dealers in Hong Kong.	
 ""There's a small amount of physical buying. Jewellers are
covering shorts, but it's a very small amount. Everybody is
looking for a new high, maybe $1,500 or $1,600."" 
 Spot gold is poised to rise to $1,477 per ounce based
on its wave pattern and a Fibonacci projection analysis,
according to Wang Tao, a Reuters market analyst for commodities
and energy technicals.	
 
 Dealers noted selling of gold scrap from Indonesia and
Thailand, but the light volume had little impact on prices,
keeping premiums for gold bars steady in Singapore at between 70
cents to $1 an ounce. 
 Main buyer India, which is the midst of the busy wedding
season, was on the sidelines after prices surged to a record. 
 Spot silver , seen as a cheaper alternative to gold,
hit an intraday high of $40 an ounce, and is set to rise 6
percent this week. 
 IShares Silver Trust said its holdings hit 11,192.80
tonnes by April 7 from 11,162.45 tonnes on April 4.
[ID:nL3E7F800Y] 
 U.S. gold futures for June hit $1.468 an ounce, a
record high.	
 The euro showed resilience and touched a 15-month high
against the dollar on Friday, bouncing back after dipping the
previous day in a sell-the-fact type of reaction to a
widely-expected rate rise by the European Central Bank. 
 The ECB raised interest rates for the first time since the
2008 financial crisis on Thursday and signalled it was ready to
tighten policy further if needed to check rising prices.
[ID:nLDE7351QH]	
 U.S. and Brent crude futures climbed to their highest in
2-1/2 years as supply worries stemming from attacks on Libyan
oil fields and unrest in the Middle East offset demand concerns
spurred by a major aftershock in Japan. 
 Japan's Nikkei advanced nearly 1.5 percent on Friday, with
active short-covering by players including commodity trading
advisers detected, after no further damage was reported at the
crippled nuclear plant in northeast Japan following last night's
aftershock. 
 ""I would say the quake has little impact, but we do see
selling from the physical market which cuts the premium,"" said a
dealer in Tokyo, referring to sales of gold bars as bullion
prices rose. [ID:nL3E7F72Y2]	
 Gold bars were offered at a discount of 25 cents to spot
London prices, having been quoted on par earlier this week.

 SINGAPORE, April 8 (Reuters) - Gold struck another record
high on Friday as the dollar weakened against the euro, while
silver hit a 31-year high after ETF holdings jumped to an all

 By Chris Kelly and Rebekah Curtis
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 7 (Reuters) - Copper ended up for a
third straight day on Thursday, hitting its priciest level in
about two weeks, as investors once again ignored an in-line
interest rate hike and continued to bet on the global economic
recovery.
 Copper's bullish momentum spread to other base metals,
boosting the price of tin to within $10 of its mid-February record
and pushing nickel up nearly 4 percent at one point.
 Markets barely flinched after the European Central Bank raised
rates for the first time since July 2008 by 25 basis points to
1.25 percent.
 ""I think people are continuing to bet big on the global
recovery ... everything is hanging in there even though we are
looking at additional rate hikes,"" said Matthew Zeman, head of
trading with Kingsview Financial in Chicago.
 ""From an inflation-fighting standpoint, things are going to
have to get a lot more serious before it starts to spook
investors. A 25 basis-point hike is not going to have a huge
imapct.""
 London Metal Exchange (LME) copper for three-month delivery
peaked at $9,753 a tonne, its highest in two weeks, before ending
up $65 at $9,670 a tonne.
 COMEX May copper climbed 4.65 cents to settle at $4.4165 per
lb.
 As prices extended their gains this week, trading volumes saw
a slight uptick. More than 50,500 lots traded by 2:11 p.m. EDT
(1811 GMT), nearly 17 percent above the 30-day norm, Thomson
Reuters preliminary data showed.
 Copper traders have been feeding off of a generally optimistic
tone emanating from the CESCO/CRU mining conference in Santiago,
Chile, this week, where many executives and industry heavyweights
are predicting a tighter supply base and a resurgence in Chinese
demand in 2011.
 ""I think Rio Tinto has really lit a fire under this market
with their commentary,"" Kingsview's Zeman said.
 The company's copper unit chief executive said the global
copper market could see a supply deficit of half a million tonnes
this year and that the shortage may extend beyond 2013.
 This view is wider than the market consensus of around a
400,000-tonne deficit and extends longer than forecasts by many
other players who predict a more balanced market in 2013.
 ""I think people are basically thinking that demand is going to
remain very robust even in the face of potential rate hikes,""
Zeman said.
 But that demand optimism was held in check by another large
build in LME copper warehouse stocks. Inventories rose 1,500
tonnes to 442,375 tonnes, their highest level since early July
after rising steadily since December.
 Investors also welcomed news that debt-ridden Portugal will
make a formal request for European aid.
 ""The fact that Portugal accepted the bail-out calmed markets
down. What Trichet said about Portugal was also positive,"" said
VTB Capital analyst Andrey Kryuchenkov.
 Prices eased off of their session highs after an earthquake of
magnitude 7.4 shook the northeast of Japan and a tsunami warning
was issued for the coast, already devastated by last month's quake
and tsunami.
 TIN NEARS RECORD
 Tin hit a session high of $32,790 a tonne, just $9 off a
record peak set in mid-February, before ending up $450 at
$32,550.
 Prices are expected to rise to a range of $36,000 to $38,910
per tonne over the next four weeks, as indicated by a rising
channel and its wave pattern on price charts, according to Reuters
technical analyst Wang Tao.
 Aluminum edged up $2 to $2,672 a tonne, supported by the
ongoing unrest in the Middle East/North African region, VTB
Capital's Kryuchenkov said.
 He said some aluminium refiners at risk of disruption in the
area as political tensions continue.

 By Michael Hogan and Manolo Serapio Jr
 HAMBURG/SYDNEY, April 7 (Reuters) - Chicago corn futures
reached fresh record highs on Thursday on thin U.S. stocks and
expectations of firm Chinese demand, ahead of key U.S. inventory
data due later this week.
 Corn has gained more than 15 percent since last Thursday
after U.S. data showed dangerously low stocks as of March 1, and
analysts expect the U.S. Department of Agriculture to further
slash its end-of-season inventory forecast on Friday.
 U.S. corn for May delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade hit
a new record of $7.73-1/4 a bushel in European trade on
Thursday.
 This broke Tuesday's record of $7.70-3/4 a bushel, which in
turn trumped the $7.65 high hit during the global food crisis in
2008.
 ""Corn prices are actually being driven by robust demand,""
Germany's Commerzbank said in a report, adding: ""A rise to $8 (a
bushel) is quite possible in the days ahead.""
 At 1035 GMT the May corn contact was slightly off the
session highs at $7.69-1/2 a bushel.
 ""Corn prices will certainly remain elevated until the U.S.
finds a way to ration demand"", to deal with tight supplies, said
Victor Thianpiriya, agricultural commodity analyst at ANZ in
Melbourne.
 ""Whether that comes out of feed use and probably some
reduced ethanol use, it's hard to say how they will do it, but
at some point the U.S. is going to have to ration corn demand.""
 A Reuters poll forecast U.S. corn stocks would drop to
a new 15-year low this summer, with the stock-to-use ratio the
tightest since the 1930s amid strong demand for use in food and
fuel even at record high prices.
 Surging corn prices provided spillover support to other
grains, traders said. Chicago May wheat was up 0.7 percent at
$7.87-3/4 a bushel. European benchmark milling wheat for May
delivery in Paris was up 0.1 percent at 250.75 euros.
 Chicago soybeans were up 0.3 percent at $13.81-1/2 a bushel.
 Meanwhile, expectations of more Chinese demand also
supported corn prices.
 The USDA this week announced sales of U.S. corn to an
unknown destination, stirring talk that China may be the buyer.

 The U.S. Grains Council said on Tuesday that China may
import an additional 2-3 million tonnes of corn by September,
which could further tighten already thin corn stocks.
 ""If we start to see more corn business into China, then
that's just going to put even further strain on an already tight
balance sheet,"" said ANZ's Thianpiriya.
 From a technical viewpoint, corn can rise further to
$7.84-1/4 per bushel as long as valid support at $7.55 holds
firm, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.
 ""We remain positive on corn price prospects on continued
demand strength, dangerously low U.S. inventories, increased
Chinese import demand and robust ethanol demand,"" Barclays
Capital said in a note.

 (Updates with closing prices)
 By Rebekah Curtis and Silvia Antonioli
 LONDON, April 7 (Reuters) - Copper reached its highest price
levels in about two weeks on Thursday after Portugal announced
it would accept a bailout from the European Commission, but then
pared some gains as a new earthquake hit Japan.
 Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange (LME) closed at $9,670 a tonne, from a close of $9,605
on Wednesday.
 It hit a two-week high at $9,753 a tonne as markets welcomed
debt-ridden Portugal's announcement it would make a formal
request for European aid.
 ""The fact that Portugal accepted the bail-out calmed markets
down. What Trichet said about Portugal was also positive,"" said
VTB Capital analyst Andrey Kryuchenkov.
 The European Central Bank (ECB), headed by Jean-Claude
Trichet, acknowledged it had encouraged Portugal to seek aid in
view of the country's financial situation.
 But the metal used in power and construction then slipped
back after an earthquake of magnitude 7.4 shook the northeast of
Japan and a tsunami warning was issued for the coast, already
devastated by last month's quake and tsunami.
 ""It is quite surprising that the market has not moved more,""
said Kryuchenkov.
 In line with expectations, the ECB raised its key interest
rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent, tightening to counter
price pressures in the region.
 Expectations of healthy copper Chinese import data for March
supported market sentiment.
 ""The numbers are expected to show a rebound from depressed
February levels, although the possibility of a disappointment
cannot be ruled out,"" MF Global said in a note.
 Capping gains, the euro fell against the dollar after
Trichet said the ECB did not decide whether the interest rate
hike was the first in a series.
 A stronger U.S. dollar makes it more expensive for holders
of other currencies to buy dollar-priced commodities.
 Copper was little changed after data showed that new U.S.
claims for unemployment benefits fell by slightly more than
expected last week, pointing to firming labour market
conditions.
 
 TIN NEARS RECORD
 Tin hit a session high of $32,790, just $9 off a record peak
in mid-February. The metal later closed at $32,550 a tonne from
$32,100.
 Keeping optimism about nearby demand in check, copper
inventories at LME warehouses rose 1,500 tonnes to total 442,375
tonnes, at their highest since early July after rising steadily
since December.
 But long-term fundamentals remained positive for copper as a
supply deficit is expected this year, analysts said.
 Rio Tinto's copper unit chief executive said the world
copper market could see a supply deficit of half a million
tonnes this year and that the shortage may extend beyond 2013.
 Aluminium closed at $2,672 a tonne from $2,670.
 ""Ali is still strong because of unrest in the MENA region,""
Kryuchenkov said adding that there are some aluminium refiners
at risk of disruption in the area as political tensions
continue.
 Zinc closed at $2,453 a tonne from $2,450.
 Battery material lead finished at $2,790 a tonne, from
Wednesday's close of $2,820, while nickel ended at $26,800 a
tonne from $26,425.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, April 7 (Reuters) - Gold hit a record high for a
third straight session Thursday on inflation worries and
expectations that the European Central Bank's first rate hike
since the 2008 financial crisis would weaken the dollar.
 Bullion came off its all-time high $1,464.80 an ounce after
news another strong earthquake hit Japan. The precious metal
was up 0.1 percent in late trade after retreating from the
session high along with global equities and agricultural
commodities.
 Trading in the U.S. futures market was half the average,
but a bullish technical formation more than offset low volume.
 ""You're back to a dollar story for the first time in a long
time."" said Frank McGhee, head precious metals trader of
Integrated Brokerage Services. ""Gold prices and the dollar both
benefit from that rate hike because it increases the
differentials between euro zone and the U.S. interest rates.""
 Rising interest rates generally are negative for gold, but
investors bet the dollar would weaken after the ECB rate hike.
 Spot gold  gained 0.1 percent to $1,459 by 2:41 p.m.
EDT (1841 GMT). U.S. gold futures for June delivery 
settled up 0.1 percent at $1,359.30 an ounce.
 The traditional inverse correlation between gold and the
dollar appeared to be strengthening to a negative 0.8, as gold
hit successive records. A correlation of minus 1 indicates a
perfect inverse link, while a correlation of plus 1 indicates
that both are moving in perfect tandem. (Graphic:
http://link.reuters.com/vus88r)
 The ECB raised rates by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent to
counter inflation pressure. Gold has risen more than 2 percent
this week, benefiting from rallies in crude oil and corn and as
Portugal requested a European Union rescue package.
 ""Of course the ECB will be vigilant in monitoring inflation
developments very closely. But it is more inflation
expectations that made the ECB concerned, and less the actual
increase"" in inflation, said Peter Fertig, a consultant at
Quantitative Commodity Research.
 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said the rate hike was
not necessarily the start of a series, disappointing some who
had expected a more hawkish tone. [ID:nLDE7351QH]
 The gold market is also monitoring the U.S. budget crisis.
The mood shifted from optimism to pessimism as Democratic and
Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress sought a deal to avert
a looming U.S. government shutdown. [ID:nN07296632]
 Gold has benefited from worries that growing U.S. fiscal
imbalance would lead to inflation.
 TECHNICAL PATTERN SUPPORTS
 On charts, gold notched slim gains amid below-average
volume despite a third consecutive record high.
 ""A neutral day with light volume, after the kind of run
that we've seen, is not detrimental to the market or the chart
pattern at all,"" said Scott Meyers, senior analyst at MF
Global's Pioneer Futures division.
 Gold posted a higher high and higher low, a bullish
technical pattern referring to Thursday's high and low above
the previous session's, Meyers said.
 Among other precious metals, silver  gained 0.3
percent at $39.56 an ounce, just off the previous session's
31-year high at $39.75.
 Silver has not shaken its image of an unpredictable metal
with high volatility and chronic oversupply, but investors seem
set on driving prices beyond the recent 31-year high.
[ID:nLDE7361L3]
 On fundamentals, industrial demand for silver is expected
to rise less than 10 percent this year, after prices more than
doubled to 31-year highs since late 2010, the head of metals
research and consultant GFMS said on Thursday. [ID:nN06606268]
 Platinum  was down 0.2 percent to $1,783.50 an ounce,
while palladium  shed 0.5 percent to $774.47.

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, April 7 (Reuters) - Gold ticked lower to hover
below a record on Thursday ahead of an expected euro zone
interest rate hike, while ETF holdings dropped to their lowest
in almost a year as investors shifted some of their money into
other markets. 
 Despite selling in the physical market, bullion was still
supported by inflation concerns driven by the deadly unrest in
Libya and the Middle East as well as soaring food prices. Silver
barely moved after hitting a 31-year peak on Wednesday. 
 Spot gold eased $2.31 to $1,454.69 an ounce by 0607
GMT, after striking a record of $1,461.91 on Wednesday as the
U.S. dollar slipped to a 14-month low against the euro. 
 Gold is far below its all-time inflation-adjusted high,
estimated at almost $2,500 an ounce set in 1980 as a result of
heightened geopolitical pressure and hyper inflation.	
 ""Moms and dads are moving out, out of gold and into the
equities. But our expectations for gold moving higher has more
to do with inflationary concerns, I think, particularly in
China,"" said Jonathan Barratt, managing director of Commodity
Broking Services.	
 ""Market is looking at not just oil, it's looking at food and
I think that's important, particularly when corn reached a
record high. Expectations are that foodstuff will continue to
rise."" 
 Spot silver hardly changed at $39.30 an ounce, within
sight of a 31-year peak of $39.75 struck on Wednesday.	
 The European Central Bank is poised to raise interest rates
from a record low 1.0 percent on Thursday and more is likely to
follow but, fearful of heaping more pain on the euro zone's
stragglers, it will give few clues about when the next move will
come. [ID:nLDE7351QH]	
 The euro was down a quarter point on the day at $1.4297
, having risen to $1.4350, its highest since late January
2010, on Wednesday, while Japan's benchmark Nikkei average
closed up 0.1 percent at 9,590.93. 
 In the grains market, Chicago corn futures edged up to near
record highs as thin U.S. stocks and expectations of firm
Chinese demand helped purge early losses ahead of key U.S. data
later this week. 
 ""There's some profit taking at the high end. I think people
are shifting money into stocks because the U.S. economy seems to
be improving. I don't think the ETF is giving you better
returns,"" said a bullion dealer in Hong Kong.
 ""Also I think the gold market is moving too slowly after
reaching the high."" 
 In Singapore, a centre for bullion trading in Southeast
Asia, dealers noted sales of scraps from Thailand and Indonesia
as holders cashed in on bullion's rise to a record.	
 The world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR
Gold Trust , said its holdings fell to 1,205.467 tonnes by
April 6, their lowest level since May last year, from 1,212.745
tonnes on April 5. 
 U.S. gold futures for June fell $2 to $1,456.5 an
ounce. Gold's volatility index dropped more than 2
percent on Wednesday, suggesting that the market was not
expecting wild price movements in the future.	
 Brent crude dipped on Thursday after five straight days of
gains on concern that rising prices will hurt demand from the
world's top oil consumers the United States and China, but
unrest in North Africa and the Middle East cushioned the fall.

 * Coming up: ECB rate hike decision on Thursday

 By Chris Kelly and Sue Thomas
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 6 (Reuters) - Copper ended sharply higher on
Wednesday, posting its biggest one-day gain in two weeks as currency-related
buying and perceptions of healthier Chinese purchases fed the rally.
 Copper's strength fed through to the broader base metals complex, with
nickel rallying as much as 4.3 percent, lead extending a five-day rally, and
aluminium hitting its priciest level since September 2008.
 The more-optimistic tone followed a strong performance in Chinese equities,
one day after the country raised interest rates for a fourth time since
October. This strength indicated to investors that the tightening measures will
not thwart demand from China, analysts said.
 ""The evidence to this point is that the Chinese rate hikes have kind of
controlled things and slowed things down a bit, but they haven't had a material
impact on demand for commodities in general,"" said Bill O'Neill, partner of
LOGIC Advisors in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey.
 London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month copper rallied 2.3 percent or $215
higher, to close at $9,605 per tonne, its biggest daily percentage gain since
March 23.
 COMEX May copper shot up 10.55 cents to settle at $4.37 per lb, as the
momentum pushed the contract up near its trendline resistance.
 ""If we have some extension tomorrow and Friday to the upside, we're
probably going to take out that trendline and work toward $4.45 (per lb),"" said
Scott Meyers, senior trading analyst with Pioneer Futures in New York.
 ""If we take out $4.45 on a settlement, I think there is room for $4.55 and
then the contract highs ... it's really setting up for that kind of move right
now.""
 Steve Platt, futures analyst with Archer Financial Services in Chicago, saw
support from the currency markets, where the euro climbed against the dollar to
its highest in more than a year ahead of an expected rate hike by the European
Central Bank on Thursday.
 Copper prices now stand within 6 percent of their mid-February records at
$10,190 per tonne in London and $4.6575 per lb in New York, as investors bet
that China's economy, which expanded by 10 percent in 2010, will need greater
amounts of raw materials to satisfy that rate of growth.
 ""I still think the major mistake the bears are making is the same mistake
they were making when copper was $2.50 (per lb), that is demand is much greater
than people anticipate,"" LOGIC Advisors' O'Neill said, adding that bullish
comments from some of the world's leading producers at the CESCO/CRU mining
conference in Chile this week reinforced this view.
 ""The fundamental demand is still there (China). The credit situation in
China, when that changes, has a short-term effect, but the underlying growth
story in demand is still there,"" Xstrata Copper Chief Executive Charlie Sartain
said on the sidelines of the CRU conference.
 ""Internationally we see a recovery in other markets not as significant as
China,"" he added. ""In markets such as the U.S., we see a recovery there.""

 IMPORT REBOUND?
 Furthermore, expectations are building for a rebound in China's copper,
iron ore and coal imports in March, with shipments of refined copper expected
to rise from February's 27-month low.
 ""The general expectation is that those numbers will be reasonably positive
because we know that some imports were delayed from February to March due to
the Chinese New Year holiday,"" said David Wilson, director of metals research
at Societe Generale.
 China's General Administration of Customs will publish preliminary import
data for March on April 11.
 Aluminium rose to $2,685 a tonne, its highest since September 2008, before
ending up $29 at $2,670.
 Open interest on aluminium LME contracts is near its highest since the
middle of January.
 Latest data showed inventories of the metal in LME warehouses were down
4,175 tonnes at 4,589,000, but remained consistently high and within reach of a
record high 4,640,750 tonnes hit in January last year.

 * Arabica coffee falls back after sharp advance on Tuesday
 * Sugar prices remain rangebound
(Updates prices, table)
 By Marcy Nicholson and Sarah McFarlane
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 6 (Reuters) - Cocoa futures ended
firmer on Wednesday, recouping recent losses as the prolonged
conflict between presidential rivals in top grower Ivory Coast
failed to be resolved as quickly as hoped.
 Tuesday's optimism for a near-term resumption of cocoa
exports dimmed as forces loyal to presidential claimant
Alassane Ouattara launched a heavy attack on the bunker where
Laurent Gbagbo was defying efforts to force him to cede power.
 Coffee and sugar markets weakened.
 ICE July cocoa gained $21 to finish at $3,014 a tonne in
above-average volume, with position rolling out of the spot
contract boosting activity ahead of its first notice day April
15.
 Liffe July cocoa rose 10 pounds to close at 1,921 pounds a
tonne.
 ""It's a combination of profit-taking and a short-covering
rally and Gbagbo still has not formally accepted surrender
terms imposed by Ouattara and the U.N.,"" said a veteran cocoa
dealer in New York.
 A slower return to normal business than the market had
expected in Ivory Coast and a weaker U.S. dollar also helped
lift prices, he said.
 Negotiations led by the United Nations and France aimed at
securing the departure of Gbagbo have failed, French Foreign
Minister Alain Juppe said, although the conflict was believed
to be near a conclusion by many within the cocoa industry.
 The market has stabilized after the July contract fell to
$2,940 on Friday, the lowest level for the second month since
mid-January, and remains about 20 percent below a 32-year peak
set in early March at $3,775 per tonne.
 Prices rose early last month as the conflict and related
European Union sanctions kept exports from Ivory Coast at a
virtual standstill, leaving an estimated 450,000 tonnes sitting
in warehouses in the world's top grower.
 Jonathan Parkman, joint head of agriculture at Marex
Financial, told Reuters Insider on Wednesday 100,000-150,000
tonnes of the cocoa was unhedged and this could have a bigger
impact on prices than the resumption of shipmentswhen holding
physical cocoa. Increased hedging is likely to weigh on futures
prices.
 ""Most of the reports say the damage has not been too bad,""
Parkman said, referring to the roughly 450,000 tonnes believed
to be in warehouses. ""It will be usable.""
 SUGAR SLIPS
 Sugar futures reeled from investor liquidation, spread
trade and arriving supplies from the harvest in the important
center-south region of top grower Brazil.
 May raws on ICE dropped 0.84 cent or 3 percent to finish at
26.71 cents per lb, as strong technical resistance at around 28
cents remained. May whites on Liffe dropped $16.50 or 2.3
percent to close at $705.80 a tonne.
 ""There's been a lot of spreads, a lot of liquidation trade.
We're getting into the Brazil harvest. That's keeping a lid on
this thing,"" said Jack Scoville, analyst for brokers The Price
Group in Chicago.
 A bigger-than-expected Thai crop and talk that the world's
second-biggest producer India could authorize more sugar
exports weighed on prices. Modest volumes of activity made the
market vulnerable to choppy trade, dealers said.
 ""A further failure to close above 28.00 cents (on May raws)
tonight will probably give the bears impetus to flush out
recent longs. Overall it seems safer to sell a rally than buy a
dip at present,"" brokers Sucden Financial said in a market
note.
 Top sugar grower Brazil wants to increase regulation of the
domestic ethanol market to ensure output, signaling a move that
could have major implications for global sugar supplies.
 Sugar can be processed into the alternative energy source
ethanol.
 Arabica coffee futures on ICE corrected lower after surging
nearly 5 percent on heavy short-covering on Tuesday.
 May arabicas fell 3.10 cents or 1.2 percent to close at
$2.6515 per lb.
 Robusta coffee futures on Liffe also corrected lower, after
the May premium over July more than tripled to $100 on
Tuesday.
 May robusta coffee futures fell $26 to close at $2,472 a
tonne while July eased $9 to end at $2,389 per tonne.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Gold rose to an all-time high
for a second straight day on Wednesday as the U.S. dollar fell
to a 14-month low against the euro ahead of an expected
interest rate hike from the European Central Bank (ECB).
 Silver surged to a 31-year peak for a third consecutive day
as holdings of the world's largest silver exchange-traded fund
hit a record. Precious metals also drew support from renewed
sovereign debt fears amid Portugal's financial crisis and
inflation worries as crude oil and corn gently pulled back from
new peaks.
 On the silver options front, investors used bullish
strategies such as call spreads buying and put selling, even as
implied volatility stayed largely flat, a sign that the metal
is building momentum for another upward move.
 ""It is unquestionable that the demand for precious metals
derives from the devaluation of the leading currencies -- the
dollar, the pound and the euro,"" said Angelos Damaskos, a fund
manager at Sector Investment Managers.
 Spot gold  hit a record $1,461.91 an ounce before
easing to $1,458.90 an ounce, up 0.6 percent, by 2:40 p.m. EDT
(1840 GMT). U.S. gold futures for June delivery  settled
up 0.4 percent to $1,458.50.
 The traditional inverse correlation between gold and the
dollar appeared to be strengthening this week to a negative
0.8, as gold rose to successive records, but the link between
the two could be erratic in the near term. A correlation of
minus 1 indicates a perfect inverse link, and vice versa.
 Gold remained far below its all-time inflation-adjusted
high, estimated at almost $2,500 an ounce set in 1980 as a
result of heightened geopolitical pressure and hyperinflation.
<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/ren88r
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 Gold was boosted as the euro climbed against the dollar to
its highest in more than a year. The ECB was widely expected to
raise its benchmark rate 25 basis points on Thursday, its first
hike since the global economic crisis three years ago.
 Higher interest rates usually weigh on gold, but the metal
could gain if rate differentials weaken the U.S. dollar.
 SILVER SOARS NEAR $40, GOLD RATIO FALLS
 Strong investment demand drove silver up more than 1
percent to a high of $39.75 -- its best since January 1980,
when the Hunt Brothers corned the market. Silver  eased
off the session high to trade at $39.52 an ounce, up 0.7
percent.
 ""Either way, you are going to see a significant move from
here. Even though we were up this much, I think you are going
to see an even bigger move,"" said Dominick Cognata, a COMEX
gold and silver options floor trader.
 Holdings of silver in the iShares Silver Trust  ETF
are at a record 11,162.45 tonnes, up more than 240 tonnes so
far this year.
 The gold-silver ratio, which shows how many silver ounces
are needed to buy an ounce of gold, fell to a 28-year low at
below 37. Silver outperformed gold in the first quarter, rising
22 percent, while gold rose 0.7 percent.
 ""Silver has outperformed gold, but the real leader of this
rally is gold. Uncertainty in the Middle East, the euro zone
sovereign debt crisis and inflation are all reasons why gold is
higher,"" said Bill O'Neill, partner of commodities firm LOGIC
Advisors.
 Reflecting the pick-up in investor demand for gold was the
first inflow of the metal into the SPDR Gold Trust since March
16.  For details, see [ID:nLDE7351UG] and [ID:nSGE73500B]
 Investors remained focused on Thursday's policy meetings by
the ECB and by two other major central banks. The Bank of Japan
and the Bank of England are expected to hold rates steady.
 In the United States, some Federal Reserve officials
believe they would have to maintain easy monetary policy beyond
this year, while a few said the central bank should move to
tighter conditions before year-end. [ID:nN05140054]
 Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Atlanta Fed, said on
Wednesday the U.S. economy remained too fragile for the Fed to
begin raising interest rates. [ID:nN06207079]
 Gold has been a major beneficiary since the Fed has kept
short-term rates near zero since December 2008.
 For platinum group metals, spot platinum  rose 0.1
percent to $1,787.99 an ounce, while palladium  slipped
0.5 percent to $782.22.

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, April 6 (Reuters) - Gold held on Wednesday near a
lifetime high hit in the previous session as lingering worries
about inflation and tensions in the Arab world offset China's
latest move to raise interest rates.	
 Silver hit another 31-year peak as the metal attracted
interest from investors looking for a cheaper alternative to
gold as a hedge against inflation. The gold:silver ratio dropped
to a 28-year low at 36.93. 
 Spot gold added $2.90 an ounce to $1,453.50 by 0601
GMT -- not far from a record of $1,456.85 hit on Tuesday on
rallies in corn and oil prices and a downgrade in Portugal's
credit rating that highlighted euro zone debt worries. 
 ""Gold is still looking to hit another record. Tensions in
the Middle East and North Africa are not solved yet. Secondly,
there are new uncertainties in the euro zone. These all will
benefit gold,"" said Ronald Leung, director of Lee Cheong Gold
Dealers in Hong Kong.	
 ""The only thing is that the increase in Chinese interest
rates will be a negative factor for a little while."" 
 The world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR
Gold Trust , said its holdings inched up to 1,212.745
tonnes by April 5 from 1,211.229 tonnes on March 31. 
 Spot gold may hover around $1,452 per ounce for one
trading session before climbing towards $1,477, according to
Wang Tao, a Reuters market analyst for commodities and energy
technicals. 
 For a 24-hour gold technical outlook:

 U.S. gold futures for June rose $2.50 an ounce to
$1,455.0 an ounce.	
 China's central bank raised interest rates on Tuesday for
the fourth time since October, underlining Beijing's
determination to clamp down on inflation. [ID:nSGE735004] 
 The increase comes before an expected rate hike by the
European Central Bank on Thursday -- which would be the first
since the global financial crisis, showing how inflation is
rising to the top of the global policy agenda. 
 China's interest rates hike often triggers fears of a
slowdown in the country's demand for commodities, including gold
and industrial metals, but London copper futures firmed on
Wednesday and ignored Beijing's latest move. 
 The 25 basis point rise announced by Beijing was viewed as
just the latest step in a tightening cycle which has been going
on for some time and was expected to continue.	
 Investors will still focus on the unrest in the Middle East
and North Africa, which has also spurred buying in silver and
pushed up oil prices. [ID:nLDE7342BL] 
 Spot silver rose to as high as $39.42 an ounce, its
highest level since early 1980, extending Tuesday's gains. 
 ""There's buying in silver but we don't really know whether
it's coming from China or anywhere else. We can say silver is
cheaper to buy compared to gold,"" said a dealer in Hong Kong.	
 ""Silver will go up to $40 and it could rise to $100 in the
next few years."" 
 Other dealers said India showed some interest in silver
during the wedding season, when parents give jewellery, mostly
gold, to their daughters. 
 In other markets, the yen fell as the Bank of Japan began a
meeting on Wednesday that may signal its readiness to further
loosen monetary policy to support the earthquake-hit economy,
while Asian stocks were muted after the interest rate rise in
China.

 SINGAPORE, April 6 (Reuters) - - Gold firmed on Wednesday
and held near a lifetime high hit in the previous session as
lingering worries about inflation and tensions in the Arab World
offset China's latest move to raise interest rates.	
 Silver hit another 31-year peak as the metal attracted
interest from investors looking for a cheaper alternative to
gold and also a hedge against inflation.	
 Spot gold added $2.13 an ounce to $1,452.63 by 0350
-- not far from a record of $1,456.85 hit on Tuesday on rallies
in corn and oil prices and a downgrade in Portugal's credit
rating that highlighted euro zone debt worries. 
 ""Gold is still looking to hit another record. Tensions in
the Middle East and North Africa are not solved yet. Secondly,
there are new uncertainties in the euro zone. These all will
benefit gold,"" said Ronald Leung, director of Lee Cheong Gold
Dealer in Hong Kong.	
 ""The only thing is that the increase in Chinese interest
rates will be a negative factor for a little while."" 
 The world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR
Gold Trust , said its holdings inched up to 1,212.745
tonnes by April 5 from 1,211.229 tonnes on March 31. 
 Spot gold may hover around $1,452 per ounce for one
trading session before climbing towards $1,477, according to
Wang Tao, who is a Reuters market analyst for commodities and
energy technicals.

 U.S. gold futures for June rose $1.5 an ounce to
$1,454.0 an ounce.	
 China's central bank raised interest rates on Tuesday for
the fourth time since October, underlining Beijing's
determination to clamp down on inflation. [ID:nSGE735004] 
 The increase comes before an expected rate hike by the
European Central Bank on Thursday -- first since the global
financial crisis, showing how inflation is rising to the top of
the global policy agenda. 
 China's interest rates hike often triggers fears of a
slowdown in the country's demand for commodities, including gold
and industrial metals, but London copper futures firmed on
Wednesday and ignored Beijing's latest move. 
 The 25 basis point rise announced by Beijing was viewed as
just the latest step in a tightening cycle which has been going
on for some time and was expected to continue.	
 Investors will still focus on the unrest in the Middle East
and North Africa, which has also spurred buying in silver and
pushed up oil prices. 
 The head of Libya's rebel army has condemned NATO for its
slow chain of command in ordering air strikes to protect
civilians, saying the alliance was ""letting the people of
Misrata die every day"". [ID:nLDE7342BL]	
 Spot silver rose to $39.41 an ounce, its highest
level since early 1980, extending Tuesday's gains. 
 ""There's buying in silver but we don't really know whether
it's coming from China or anywhere else. We can say silver is
cheaper to buy compared to gold,"" said a dealer in Hong Kong.	
 ""Silver will go up to $40 and it could rise to $100 in the
next few years."" 
 Other dealers said India showed some interest in silver
during the wedding season, when parents give jewellery, mostly
gold, to their daughters. 
 In other markets, the yen fell as the Bank of Japan began a
meeting on Wednesday that may signal its readiness to further
loosen monetary policy to support the earthquake-hit economy
while Asian stocks were muted after an interest rate rise in
China.

 * China raises interest rate, fourth since October
 * N. Africa, Middle East unrest remain supportive to oil
 * Coming up: EIA inventory data, 1430 GMT

 PERTH, April 6 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures extended
losses early Wednesday ahead of a government inventory report
expected to show a rise in crude stockpiles, but persistent
supply worries stemming from unrest in the Middle East and North
Africa limited losses. 
 Brent crude also slipped, after touching a 2-1/2-year peak
above $122 a barrel on Tuesday as geopolitical tensions more
than offset China's latest interest rate hike. 
 Data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed U.S.
crude inventories fell unexpectedly by 2.8 million barrels last
week and gasoline stocks posted a surprise build. 
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release oil
inventory data at 1430 GMT on Wednesday. 
 
 FUNDAMENTALS 
 * On the New York Mercantile Exchange, May crude was
trading at $107.93 a barrel, down 41 cents, by 0106. Monday's
close at $108.47 was the highest for front-month NYMEX crude
since September 2008. 
 * In London, ICE Brent crude for May delivery was
trading at $121.74 a barrel, down 48 cents. It climbed to
$122.89 on Tuesday, the highest front-month price since August

for the fourth time since October, raising suspicions that data
next week may show inflation rose more than expected in March.
[ID:nSGE735004]	
 * Average U.S. gasoline demand dropped 1.2 percent week over
week to 9.19 million barrels per day last week as pump prices
rose, MasterCard Advisors' SpendingPulse report showed Tuesday.

crude cargo since unrest shut down exports in early March, with
mystery surrounding the potential buyer of oil from the
rebel-held territory. [ID:nLDE7342BL] 
 * NATO has been forced to change bombing tactics in Libya as
Muammar Gaddafi's forces used civilians as human shields and hid
armour in populated areas. [ID:nLDE7340IZ] 
 * Yemen's President Alli Abdullah Saleh urged his opponents
to join talks in Saudi Arabia to try to end weeks of turmoil and
violence. [ID:nLDE7340JH]

 MARKETS NEWS 
 * Japan's Nikkei average opened slightly higher on
Wednesday at 9,668.11, but was seen stuck in a narrow range,
with resource-related shares seen climbing on surging commodity
prices and blue-chip exporters supported as the yen weakened
against the dollar. 
 * The Japanese yen extended its decline early in Asia on
Wednesday, hitting fresh 11-month lows against the euro and the
Australian dollar and looking to deepen its losses as technical
support levels threaten to give way. 
 * Gold firmed on Wednesday and held near a lifetime high hit
in the previous session as inflation fears lingered after crude
and corn rallied to new peaks, while silver edged down, having
risen to its strongest level in more than three decades. 
 * Copper ended higher on Tuesday, after a much-anticipated
rate hike in China failed to rattle the market, even as the
metal-consuming giant's appetite for the metal has softened at
the start of the year.

963,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2011 03:08PM ET</span>",SOFTS-Cocoa falls as Ivory Coast deal nears,"
 * Cocoa prices expected to weaken further
 * Robusta, arabica coffee exports seen ample
 * Spot raw sugar seen in 26-28 cents/lb range
(Updates prices, adds graphics links)
 By Marcy Nicholson and Sarah McFarlane
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - ICE cocoa futures
closed lower in heavy volume on Tuesday, as the embattled
leader in top producer Ivory Coast negotiated the terms of his
departure, which would allow exports to resume soon.
 ICE arabica coffee futures surged in its biggest one-day
percentage gain in five months on a flurry of short-covering in
heavy volume that was nearly double the average.
 Raw sugar futures eased, under pressure from a stronger
dollar and weaker oil prices.
 Ivory Coast's Laurent Gbagbo was negotiating the terms of
his surrender following a fierce assault by forces loyal to his
rival, backed by U.N. and French helicopter airstrikes.
 ICE May cocoa closed down $45 at $2,975 a tonne, while
Liffe May cocoa finished off 44 pounds at 1,912 pounds per
tonne.
 Dealers said the developments in Ivory Coast could lead to
further losses in the cocoa market as exports, banned for more
than two months, are expected to resume within weeks, if Gbagbo
leaves.
 ""I expect prices to weaken but I don't expect them to fall
off a cliff ... the sell-off that we saw last week reduced an
awful lot of the long exposure,"" said Jonathan Parkman, joint
head of agriculture at Marex Financial Ltd in London.
 ""Since the election, fundamentals have definitely become
more bearish, which is important in trying to determine where
prices might end up,"" Parkman said, adding he expects London
prices to fall to between 1,700 and 1,800 pounds a
tonne.McDougall, vice president of brokers Newedge USA.
 Cocoa prices have fallen 23 percent since hitting a 32-year
high at $3,775 per tonne a month ago.
 In Ivory Coast, forces loyal to presidential claimant
Alassane Ouattara launched an offensive that brought them to
Gbagbo's doorstep.
 They captured the key cocoa-exporting port of San Pedro,
where about one-half of the country's bean exports are shipped
out. Traders said that indicated supplies were likely to flow
out soon, dispelling fears of supply disruptions.
 Dealers voiced concerns over stores of about 500,000 tonnes
of cocoa believed to have accumulated in Ivory Coast while
exports are banned.
 ""Once the fighting has stopped, within 10 or 15 days you'll
probably get cocoa coming out, vessels are being lined up. San
Pedro presumably could start sooner because they ought to be
making the preparations now,"" a Europe-based fund analyst
said.
 The European Union said it was ready to move rapidly to
remove sanctions on Ivory Coast once power is handed over to
Ouattara.
 COFFEE EXPORTS
 Arabica coffee futures surged in the highest volume since
Feb. 15 above 30,000 lots on waves of short-covering and fresh
buying after triggering key support levels $2.5780 and $2.6235,
basis May, dealers said.
 ICE May arabicas jumped 12.20 cents or 4.8 percent to close
at $2.6825 per lb, in the biggest one-day percentage change
since November 2010. Liffe July robustas closed up $90, or 3.9
percent, at $2,398 per tonne.because of chart patterns and
macro pullback, but the market was deep into roaster support
and eventually trade and fund shorts started to cover,"" one
dealer said.
 Raw sugar futures were softer on investor sales, but
players were content to wait for more news on the upcoming cane
harvest of Brazil's prime center-south region.
 Newedge's McDougall said the focus in the market will be on
how much sugar will be delivered when London's May white sugar
contract goes off the board on April 15.
 ICE May raw sugar fell 0.45 cent to close at 27.55 cents
per lb, while Liffe May white sugar finished up $6.10 at
$722.30 per tonne.
 Nick Penney of broker Sucden Financial said, ""We are
testing the upper end of the recent range in both markets
(whites and raws) and should there be a failure to make
headway, we suspect that given the better medium/long term
picture, values may retrace sharply.""

 * U.S. corn sees profit-taking after surge
 * Traders eye further cut in U.S. corn supply estimate
 * Wheat prices climb on dire crop ratings
(Updates with opening of U.S. markets, changes dateline from
previous SYDNEY/MILAN)
 By Carey Gillam
 KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures hit
a record high on Tuesday as concerns over tight supplies
persisted, while soy fell as China, the world's top oilseed
importer, raised interest rates.
 Wheat edged higher amid dry weather in the southern Plains
growing region, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture saying
the winter wheat crop was in the worst shape in nine years.
 Corn, which matched the record high price set in June 2008
on Monday, remained in focus ahead of this Friday's USDA April
report that is expected to reduce the government's estimate of
ending stocks, already at the lowest in 15 years.
 Corn has gained about 15 percent since last Thursday after
a U.S. Agriculture Department report showed U.S. stockpiles at
surprisingly low levels, prompting funds to plow billions of
dollars into a market driven by strong demand from ethanol
producers and Chinese importers.
 Some traders saw the market as overbought after a rise to
record highs on Monday, and profit-taking kept further gains in
check.
 Also providing some pressure was news that China's central
bank was raising interest rates in a bid to control inflation.
 At 10:04 a.m. CDT, (1504 GMT), corn for May delivery on the
Chicago Board of Trade was up 2-3/4 cents at $7.63 a bushel in
mixed trade that saw the nearby contract range early from
$7.54-1/2 to a new high of $7.66-1/4.
 ""The immediate impact of the rate hike has seen corn drop
into negative territory, but the market is strong and buyers
will only take advantage of potential further price decreases
during today's session,"" said Gunter Tschiderer, fund manager
at BNP Paribas' Theam Commodities.
 Tschiderer expects July corn to rise to $8.00 this week.
 The USDA has said corn inventories will hit their lowest
level in 15 years at the end of the current season. Data last
week showed unexpectedly low supplies as of March 1 and may
force USDA to make a further significant downgrade of
end-season stock estimates when it updates its monthly report
on Friday, adding volatility to the market.
 EYES ON WEATHER
 Rainy weather in the U.S. Midwest kept the market on edge,
and wet conditions could delay seeding of new crop corn.
 Conversely, weather conditions were too dry for the new
U.S. winter wheat crop, and a new crop condition rating issued
Monday showed the new crop in the worst shape in nearly a
decade.
 Only 37 percent of the U.S. winter wheat crop was rated in
good to excellent condition as of April 3, compared with 65
percent in that category a year ago, according to the USDA's
first weekly crop progress and condition report of the season.
That is the worst condition at this point in the growing season
since 2002, when production was the lowest of the last ten
years. and
 In Kansas, the top wheat producing state, the crop was
rated at only 31 percent good to excellent condition, down from
69 percent a year ago.
 Wheat prices reflected the concerns. Kansas City Board of
Trade May hard red winter wheat was up 3-1/4 cents at $9.51-1/4
early, and CBOT May soft red winter wheat was up 2-1/2 cents at
$7.92-1/2 a bushel.
 Meanwhile, soybeans for May delivery fell 8-1/4 cents to
$13.75-3/4 per bushel.
 China's inflation-cooling move weighed on soybeans as well
as corn. The advancing harvest of what is expected to be a
record South American soybean crop also was a pressure point.
As well, talk that soy orders may be switched from the U.S. to
South America weighed on prices.

 * Chinese interest rates up 0.25 percent, fourth rise since
Oct
 
 (Updates with closing prices)
 By Rebekah Curtis and Sue Thomas
 LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Copper rose on Tuesday on
prospects for improved demand in Asia, recovering from losses
earlier in the day after China announced an interest rate hike.
 Copper for three-months delivery on the London Metal
Exchange (LME) closed at $9,390 a tonne from a close of $9,330
on Monday.
 China's central bank raised interest rates for the fourth
time since October in a bid to cool stubborn price pressures.
Analysts said the moved had been expected.
 ""Most participants are of the opinion that the drop within a
few minutes of the announcement was exaggerated,"" said
Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann.
 ""The interest rate hike should not come as a surprise,
because I don't think there was anyone who was not expecting an
interest rate hike,"" he added.
 Indeed, a government researcher said in remarks published on
Friday that China's central bank might have to raise interest
rates and reserve requirements in April.
 Helping to lift sentiment, China's state-owned Chinalco said
growing global copper consumption and strong fundamentals were
expected to support the price this year, although the market
would be volatile.
 Comments from the CRU conference in Chile, the world's
biggest copper industry gathering, also improved the mood.
 The head of Anglo American's copper business, John
MacKenzie, said copper stocks held by Chinese investors were
unlikely to flood the market any time soon.
 There are concerns that rising stocks held by investors as
collateral in China, not immediately visible to the market,
could significantly reduce an expected copper deficit that has
catapulted prices to record highs this year.
 The latest data shows stocks of copper in LME warehouses
rose 4,425 tonnes to 442,325 tonnes, their highest since early
July 2010. On Monday 6,000 tonnes of stock entered in South
Korea, extending a recent rise in LME copper stocks in Asia.
 Chinese markets were closed on Tuesday for Tomb-Sweeping
Day.
 
 STOCKS
 Worries about demand remain.
 ""Copper's on the weak side, not helped by that increase in
stocks in Korea overnight,"" said Stephen Briggs, an analyst at
BNP Paribas. ""It's likely to be Chinese material, and that's a
pattern that we've seen this year.""
 The metal used in power and construction has shed more than
8 percent since hitting a record high of $10,190 a tonne on Feb.
15 as the price strength has deterred Chinese purchases.
 Keeping a lid on gains, oil prices rose to 2-1/2 year highs
as unrest in oil-exporting countries in the Middle East and
Africa outweighed China's interest rate hike.
 Aluminium closed at $2,641 a tonne from Monday's final bid
of $2,632 a tonne.
 Zinc was at $2,425 from Monday's close of $2,417 a tonne and
battery material lead was at $2,790 from $2,752 a tonne.
 Tin was $31,605 a tonne from $31,625 and nickel was at
$25,405 a tonne from $25,500.
 ""We remain cautious about the short-term outlook,"" MF Global
said in a note about base metals.
 ""In particular, the spectre of rising interest rates
practically the world over, has us the most concerned, as it
will most likely dent growth prospects going into the second
half of the year.""

966,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2011 08:24AM ET</span>",SOFTS-Cocoa falls as I.Coast resolution seen closer," * Cocoa prices expected to weaken further
 * Robusta and arabica coffee exports seen ample
 * Raw sugar seen in 26-28 cents/lb range
 
 (Adds trade comment, updates prices)
 By Sarah McFarlane and David Brough
 LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - ICE cocoa futures fell around 3
percent on Tuesday before paring losses, as the crisis in top
producer Ivory Coast looked close to being resolved.
 ICE arabica coffee futures were steady, while raw sugar
futures eased, under pressure from a stronger dollar and weaker
oil prices.
 Ivory Coast's Laurent Gbagbo was negotiating the terms of
his departure on Tuesday following a fierce assault by forces
loyal to his rival, backed by U.N. and French helicopter
airstrikes.
 ICE May cocoa was down $60 or 2 percent at $2,960 a tonne at
1413 GMT, after touching a session low of $2,927.
 Liffe May cocoa was down 43 pounds or 2.2 percent to 1,913
pounds per tonne.
 Dealers said the developments in Ivory Coast could see
further losses in the cocoa market.
 ""I expect prices to weaken but I don't expect them to fall
off a cliff... the sell-off that we saw last week reduced an
awful lot of the long exposure,"" Jonathan Parkman, joint head of
agriculture at Marex Financial Ltd in London said.
 ""Since the election, fundamentals have definitely become
more bearish, which is important in trying to determine where
prices might end up,"" Parkman said, adding he expects London
prices to fall to between 1,700 and 1,800 pounds a tonne.
 Dealers voiced concerns over stores of around 500,000 tonnes
of cocoa believed to have accumulated in Ivory Coast while
exports are banned.
 ""The cocoa can be used. The problem is the longer it's
stored at origin, there's a higher risk of mould becoming an
issue and it will probably have to be blended with better
quality cocoa,""a Europe-based fund analyst said.
 ""Once the fighting has stopped, within 10 or 15 days you'll
probably get cocoa coming out, vessels are being lined up. San
Pedro (port) presumably could start sooner because they ought to
be making the preparations now.""
 The European Union said on Tuesday it was ready to move
rapidly in removing sanctions on the Ivory Coast once power is
handed over to presidential claimant Alassane Ouattara.
 
 COFFEE EXPORTS
 Coffee futures were steady, as the stronger dollar and brisk
exports from producing countries weighed.
 ""If you look at the export figures there have been some
pretty big numbers from Vietnam and Indonesia on the robusta
side, Brazil is exporting record volumes and there are big
numbers coming out of Colombia and Honduras,"" the fund analyst
said. ""There doesn't appear to be a shortage.""
 ICE July arabicas were up 0.65 cent or 0.3 percent to
$2.5935 per lb at 1417 GMT, while Liffe July robustas were up
$24 or 1 percent at $2,332 per tonne.
 ICE raw sugar futures edged lower but remained at the upper
end of a recent 26-28 cents a lb trading range, underpinned by
delays in harvesting of cane in the centre-south of top producer
Brazil.
 Pierre Sebag of consultant Sugar K Ltd said the market had
become difficult to track at present because of the high
intra-day volatility in moderate volumes.
 ICE May raw sugar was down 0.12 cent or 0.4 percent to 27.87
cents a lb at 1419 GMT, while Liffe May white sugar was up $8.40
or 1.2 percent to $724.60 per tonne.
 Nick Penney of broker Sucden Financial said, ""We are testing
the upper end of the recent range in both markets (whites and
raws) and should there be a failure to make headway, we suspect
that given the better medium/long term picture, values may
retrace sharply.""

(Adds options comment in paragraph 7)
 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Gold jumped to an all-time
high above $1,450 an ounce on Tuesday, as peak crude and corn
prices fanned inflation fears and a downgrade of Portugal's
credit rating drew attention to euro zone problems.
 Bullion rose more than 1 percent, its biggest gain in more
than a month of range-bound trading. Silver soared to a 31-year
peak. Both drew support from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke's comments late on Monday suggesting he was committed
to completing a $600 billion stimulus program as scheduled in
June.
 On technical charts, gold broke above a recent double-top
technical formation around $1,440 an ounce. This added to a
rush of buying triggered by news that Portugal's leading banks
threatened to stop buying government debt hours after a Moody's
downgrade. [ID:nLDE7340WP]
 ""Bernanke's comment makes inflation a more real event in
the United States. He at least acknowledged the fact that the
Fed needs to monitor inflation very closely, and that spooked
investors into gold,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment
strategist at broker-dealer Janney Montgomery Scott with $53
billion in assets under management.
 Spot gold  gained 1.1 percent to $1,452.31 an ounce
at 3:16 a.m. EDT (1916 GMT), off the session high, a record
$1,455.06 an ounce.
 U.S. gold futures for June delivery  settled up 1.4
percent at $1,452.50, with trading volume approaching 160,000
lots, about one-fourth below the 30-day average but sharply
higher than that of Monday's.
 COMEX gold options floor trader Jonathan Jossen said
options volatility was subdued despite a rally in underlying
futures. However, quiet options trade has in the past
foreshadowed a sharp move in gold prices, Jossen said.
 Investor Dennis Gartman, publisher of the Gartman Letter,
said gold was free from liquidation pressure once it breached
$1,441 an ounce, a level which had triggered selling.
 ""It appears that gold is beginning a new up-trend after its
recent consolidation,"" said Adam Sarhan of Sarhan Capital. ""If
gold negates this breakout and falls back below $1,440 to
$1,430, one would expect sideways action to continue.""
(Graphic: http://link.reuters.com/dak88r )
 Silver  gained 1.8 percent to $39.12 an ounce, after
hitting a session high of $39.25. That was the highest since
the Hunt Brothers cornered the market in the early 1980s, when
silver briefly hit a record of just below $50 an ounce.
 Silver outperformed gold in the first quarter, rising 22
percent while gold rose 0.7 percent. The gold:silver ratio,
which shows how many silver ounces are needed to buy an ounce
of gold, fell to a 28-year low at 37.3. (Graphic:
http://r.reuters.com/seh88r )
 UBS said silver investors show no sign of being ready to
sell, even though there is a ""real danger that silver prices
have travelled too fast, too soon."" Silver at $40 an ounce
appears inevitable in the near term, UBS said.
 Rising oil and grain prices boosted gold's appeal as an
inflation hedge. Brent crude rose to a 2-1/2-year highs on
geopolitical risks to supply from the Middle East, while corn
futures hit a record high on persistent worries over tight
supplies. [O/R] [GRA/]
 FED MONETARY POLICIES EYED
 On Monday, Bernanke said an increase in U.S. inflation has
been driven primarily by rising commodity prices globally, and
was unlikely to persist. He said the Fed would monitor
inflation and inflation expectations very closely.
 ""What it shows is that big money continues to believe gold
will go higher...because Bernanke wants to grow at any cost,""
said Axel Merk, portfolio manager of the Merk Mutual Funds,
which manages more than $600 million of fund assets.
 Gold rose more after the Fed released minutes of its March
15 meeting, showing some Fed officials believed they would have
to hold to an easy monetary policy course beyond this year,
while a few said the central bank should move to tighter
conditions before year-end. [ID:nN05140054]
 Last November, the Fed initiated a $600 billion bond buying
program. The program is scheduled to end in June. Gold has been
a major beneficiary since the Fed has kept short-term rates
near zero since December 2008.
 Gold is also benefiting from concerns that some smaller
euro zone economies such as Portugal and Ireland will keep
struggling with sovereign debt, and from jitters over Western
air strikes in Libya and unrest in the Middle East.
 Earlier in the session, gold fell in tandem with other
commodities after China raised interest rates for the second
time this year.
 Gold has largely ignored previous monetary tightening from
China, which tends to weigh more heavily on industrial
commodities like copper. In addition, official data from China
shows that inflation appears to be tapering off after its
series of rate hikes this year. (Graphic of China rate hikes:
http://r.reuters.com/veh88r )
 Investors will seek more clues from an interest rate
decision from an European Central Bank policy meeting on
Thursday. The ECB is widely expected to raise its benchmark
rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent.
 Higher interest rates usually weigh on gold, but the metal
could gain if rate differentials weaken the U.S. dollar.
 For platinum group metals, platinum  rose 0.4 percent
to $1,786.99 an ounce, while palladium  also gained 0.9
percent to $786.22.

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, April 5 (Reuters) - Silver jumped to its highest
since early 1980 on Tuesday on inflation concerns, a rise in ETF
holdings to another record and growing industrial demand, while
gold hardly moved as the euro held below this week's five-month
high versus the dollar. 
 In addition to rising investment demand for silver as a
cheaper alternative to gold, an expected increase in physical
buying from China was likely to support the metal, which gained
22 percent in the first quarter -- its ninth consecutive
quarterly increase. 
 Silver , widely used in electronics manufacturing,
rose as high as $38.73 an ounce and was quoted at $38.64 an
ounce by 0301 GMT, up 22 cents. 
 ""We do see a lot of demand for silver from China, so we
think silver used in solar panels have increased. We think China
will have a lot of demand for silver in the medium to long
term,"" said Natalie Robertson, commodities strategist at ANZ in
Melbourne.	
 ""With China focusing more on renewable energy, especially
after the nuclear crisis in Japan, they will probably be
developing a lot more solar panels. Fundamentally, the silver
picture looks very strong as well."" 
 IShares Silver Trust said its holdings rose to a
record at 11,162.45 tonnes by April 4 from 11,139.52 tonnes on
March 24. [ID:nL3E7F5019]	
 But some analysts remain wary of silver's extreme
volatility, which has led to some heart-stopping reversals in
recent years. When commodities sold off heavily in mid-March,
silver dropped nearly 5 percent in a single day, versus gold's 2
percent fall. For BUY OR SELL, click: [ID:nLDE7331DB]	
 Gold added 30 cents to $1,436.85 an ounce -- below a
lifetime high around $1,447 an ounce struck last in March.
Trading was slow, with financial markets closed in Hong Kong and
mainland China.	
 ""I think China has turned to silver jewellery since last
year because it's cheaper. I do see demand for silver from China
for jewellery and I also heard China is buying silver for
hedging purposes,"" said a physical dealer in Singapore.	
 ""Gold is very quiet, although I do see light physical buying
from Thailand."" 
 U.S. gold futures for June rose $4.5 an ounce to
$1,437.5 an ounce.	
 The euro held below this week's five-month high against the
dollar and 11-month peak versus the yen as investors paused to
assess how much it can make in fresh gains given that
expectations for interest rate rises have largely been priced
in. 
 The Nikkei slipped on Tuesday with the mood soured by Tokyo
Electric Power's fall to an all-time low, but was set to stick
to a tight range for a third day as a post-quake rebound looks
to have run its course. 
 U.S. crude oil futures slipped early Tuesday, but still
hovered around the Monday's 2-1/2 year high as geopolitical
risks amid fighting in Libya, unrest in Yemen and stalled
elections in Nigeria continued to support prices.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Copper ended lower on Monday, failing
to sustain an earlier rise as investors weighed the potential bullish impact of
a big mining acquisition against a more subdued Chinese presence at the start
of 2011.
 Copper's seemingly indecisive mood was exacerbated by a two-day market
holiday in top consumer China and the week-long CESCO/CRU mining conference in
Chile, where the industry's biggest and brightest are gathered to discuss
market trends.
 London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month copper backed away from a session
peak at $9,475 per tonne to close at $9,330, down slightly from Friday's last
bid at $9,359.
 LME lead hit a three-year high of $2,835 per tonne on expectations of
increasing demand in Japan for batteries to provide back-up power to help cope
with the effects of the country's damaged nuclear reactors.
 In New York, COMEX copper for May delivery eased 0.35 cent to settle at
$4.2550 per lb.
 Trading volume in New York slowed to around 26,700 lots by 2 p.m. EDT (1800
GMT), a little more than 40 percent below the 30-day norm, Thomson Reuters
preliminary data showed.
 ""When the Chinese are absent ... the markets tend to get a drifting
feeling,"" RBC Capital's head of base metals, Alex Heath, said.
 ""It's just the short-term picture that's a bit cloudy at the moment,"" Heath
added.
 Copper prices shot higher overnight after news that Minmetals Resources,
China's biggest metals trading firm, had offered to buy Equinox Minerals for
$6.5 billion.
 Even as copper's shorter-term price trend remained unclear in recent weeks,
the hint of increased merger and acquisition activity underlined a healthier,
longer-term demand view from the metal-consuming Asian giant.
 ""It's a bullish story ... the fact that these companies are still being
acquired when copper is over $9,000 (per tonne) suggests that future valuation
is higher,"" said Justin Lennon, analyst at Mitsui Bussan Commodities in New
York.
 In the last few months, poor spot demand for copper in China caused prices
to pull back as much as 12 percent from record highs in mid-February, at
$10,190 per tonne in London and $4.6575 per lb in New York.
 That recent price drop may prove temporary if the Chinese economy continues
to grow, according to Chile Mining and Energy Minister Laurence Golborne.
 In addition, the country's central bank raised its average copper price
forecast to $4.20 per lb for 2011, from a previous view of $3.30 per lb, and
predicted copper prices would average $4.00 in 2012.
 ""We still expect reasonably resilient growth for commodities such as copper
even though we won't see the sort of growth that we saw last year,"" said Daniel
Major, analyst at RBS, adding that 2010 growth came from a low base in 2009.
 ""Underlying fundamentals for copper are reasonably supportive.""
 COPPER STOCKS
 LME copper warehouse stockpiles fell by 950 tonnes to 437,900 tonnes, the
latest data showed, following a rare weekly decline of just over 1,000 tonnes
last week.
 Copper inventories in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell 6 percent last week, but failed to ease mounting concerns about unreported
inventory builds.
 This led Diego Hernandez, head of the world's top copper producer, Codelco,
to state his concern over the country's abnormally high stockpile on Monday.
 Copper demand is generally slower in the first quarter and picks up in the
second quarter. Expectations are for more outflows of inventories over the next
few weeks.
 The amount of copper held to back the physical copper exchange-traded
product rose on April 4 more than 250 tonnes to 2,604.391 tonnes, ETF
Securities' website showed.

(Updates with midday market action, fresh quote)
 By Carey Gillam
 KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 4 (Reuters) - Corn futures rallied
on Monday, matching the record-high price set during the 2008
global food crisis and extending sharp gains posted last week
due to very tight supplies.
 Futures added over 3 percent to a rally that began on
Thursday when the U.S. Department of Agriculture pegged
quarterly corn stocks as of March 1 at levels well below trade
expectations. The tightening supply underscored the strong
demand for the feed grain.
 The market was also supported by the prospect of delays in
spring plantings in the United States due to rains.
 Corn prices have jumped over 14 percent since the rally
started Thursday, and all signs point to even bigger gains.
 ""There are no signs saying corn won't go higher. Stocks
were bullish for corn and now planting weather doesn't look
good,"" said Mario Balletto, analyst for Citigroup.
 Analysts said it could take years to replenish corn stocks,
which USDA predicts will hit their lowest levels in 15 years
this summer. The estimate will be updated in a government
report on Friday.
 The USDA last week pegged quarterly U.S. corn stocks as of
March 1 at 6.523 billion bushels, below estimates for 6.690
billion and down 15 percent from a year ago. Strong demand from
the livestock sector, ethanol distillers and importing nations
have drawn supplies down, the government said.
 The tight stocks estimate raises prospects that any
production hiccups over the course of 2011 will make feed grain
supplies critically tight over the next year, analysts said.
 The USDA last week pegged U.S.corn plantings this spring at
92.2 million acres, above an average trade estimate for 91.839
million acres and the second-highest since 1944.
 Some analysts were eyeing the potential for planting
delays, however, amid forecasts for a cool, wet spring. Those
worries only accelerated the rally.
 WINTER WHEAT WORRIES
 Wheat futures were also rallying as dry weather conditions
in the U.S. Plains threatened production of the largest U.S.
class of wheat. Extended drought conditions were limiting
production potential of hard red winter wheat, particularly in
western growing areas.
 ""Wheat has an issue with conditions,"" said Roy Huckabay, an
analyst for The Linn Group. ""I have some clients saying they
might have to tear up their crop.""
 Soybean futures opened higher but gains faded rapidly. The
market was pressured by favorable harvest weather in Argentina
and in southern Brazil, and by talk that China may be shifting
soybean orders from the U.S. to Brazil, traders said.
 At 11:41 a.m. CDT, the most-active Chicago Board of Trade
corn for May delivery was up 3.7 percent at $7.63 a bushel,
after hitting a new high for the May contract and matching the
all-time high of $7.65. Prices are at their highest levels
since summer 2008 and are poised to set new records.
 Chicago Board of Trade soft red winter wheat was up 2.5
percent at $7.78-3/4 after rising as high as $7.85-1/2 early.
Kansas City Board of Trade hard red winter wheat futures led
wheat gains, rallying 3.8 percent early.
 Soybeans futures, meanwhile, were lower, with the May
contract down 6-1/4, or 0.5 percent, at $13.87.

 By Marcy Nicholson and Sarah McFarlane
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Cocoa futures were
little changed after climbing earlier on Monday, as many waited
out the latest assault by presidential claimant Alassane
Ouattara to remove Laurent Gbagbo in top grower Ivory Coast,
which underpinned the market.
 Forces backing Ouattara began a fresh assault to remove
Gbagbo from his last stronghold in Abidjan while France ordered
more troops into the West African country to protect
civilians.
 Sugar futures rose on investor buying supported by other
commodity markets, and coffee fell on investor liquidation,
bringing the premium of the robusta's spot contract down more
than 80 percent from last month's peak.
 Cocoa prices pared earlier gains after market expectations
of a resolution to Ivory Coast's conflict were not met, and as
ICE futures held key support and saw a volume boost from
May/July spreading ahead of the spot contract's first notice
day April 15.
 ""We're seeing a continuation to the upside just on
technical buying,"" said Boyd Cruel, softs analyst for Vision
Financial Markets in Chicago.
 Strong support at $2,900-$2,925 per tonne, basis May, kept
the market firm after falling nearly 23 percent from the March
4 32-year high at $3,775.
 ICE May cocoa futures were down $8 at $3,003 a tonne by
1608 GMT. Liffe July cocoa settled up 5 pounds at 1,955 per
tonne.
 ""On Friday some big cities were being controlled by
Ouattara's soldiers and everybody was expecting Abidjan to fall
during the weekend. It didn't, so the market has bounced,"" a
London-based broker said, explaining the higher prices earlier
in the day.
 ""If the situation was to come back to normal we would see
the market coming back down to around 1,850 pounds a tonne.
Industry cover is at around six months which is fairly standard
... it's fairly comfortable.""
 BRAZIL CANE HARVEST DELAY
 Raw sugar futures on ICE rose, tracking gains in other
commodity markets, such as metals, and dealers saw key
resistance at 28.20 cents a lb.
 ""It seems safer to sell a rally than buy a dip at present,""
said Thomas Kujawa of brokerage Sucden Financial.
 ICE May raw sugar futures rose 0.44 cent or 1.6 percent to
27.88 cents a lb at 1605 GMT. The contract remains technically
neutral as a consolidation between 26.37 cents to 28.20 cents
per lb continues, Reuters market analyst Wang Tao said.
 The contract has recently found good support around 26.50.
 ""It led to some technical buying here the last few days,""
Cruel said.
 Liffe May white sugar was up $6.10 or 0.7 percent to
$719.30 per tonne.
 Dealers kept a close watch on the harvest outlook in top
producer Brazil where rains have caused some harvest delays.
 ""The delay in the Brazilian harvest and a long tail (late
harvesting) in Thailand are cancelling each other out in terms
of their market impact,"" one sugar futures dealer said.
 ICE arabica and robusta coffee fell on investor liquidation
in modest volumes.
 ""We've seen a fairly big amount of speculator liquidation
in New York and London,"" the London-based broker said.
 The widening spread between London and New York prices
could relate to Brazil's impending frost season which can see a
risk premium become factored into arabica prices, although this
is a seasonally lower time for arabica.
 In robustas the May premium over July collapsed to around
$30, after trading as wide as around $200 intraday last month,
as selling pressure weighed.
 ""There's been both selling of May flat prices and the
May/July switch,"" a London-based broker said.

 By Sarah McFarlane and David Brough
 LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - ICE cocoa futures were little
changed on Monday, underpinned by a standoff between
presidential rivals in top grower Ivory Coast.
 As fighters loyal to rivals Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane
Ouattara held their respective positions across the main city
Abidjan, expectations of a quick resolution to the conflict
ebbed. The impasse has brought exports to a virtual halt.

 (Updates with closing prices)
 By Silvia Antonioli and Rebekah Curtis
 LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - Copper fell on Monday, reversing
early gains as investors shifted their focus from upbeat U.S.
economic data to recent softness in demand from China, where the
markets will be closed until Wednesday.
 Battery material lead touched a three-year high of $2,835 a
tonne on expectations of increasing Japanese demand for
batteries to provide back-up power to help cope with the effects
of damage to nuclear power plants.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) closed
at $9,330 a tonne, off a session high of $9,475 and versus a
last bid at $9,359 on Friday, when it touched a two-week low of
$9,263.25.
 In the last few months poor spot demand for copper in China
caused some to think the supply deficit will be lower than
previously expected but most analysts still predict a
substantial deficit this year.
 The world's top copper producer, Chile, forecast in January
a copper supply deficit of 466,000 tonnes in 2011, up from a
shortfall of 90,000 tonnes in 2010.
 Trading volumes were light during a two-day market holiday
in China.
 ""When the Chinese are absent... the markets tend to get a
drifting feeling,"" RBC Capital's head of base metals, Alex
Heath, said.
 ""It's just the short-term picture that's a bit cloudy at the
moment,"" Heath added.
 Strong data on the labour market and manufacturing from the
U.S. earlier helped bolster investor sentiment about demand for
industrial metals.
 ""I'm fairly positive on the state of the U.S economy in the
near-term,"" Carl Firman, an analyst at Virtual Metals, said,
although he added that the world's top economy still faced
headwinds.
 ""Chinese demand appears soft, Firman added ""There's reports
of high stock levels in bonded warehouses.""
 But he also voiced optimism about the country's demand
longer-term, saying ""the bull market in China is still very much
alive.""
 Meanwhile, Japan's industry was hit hard by the earthquake
and tsunami three weeks ago that also crippled a nuclear plant
and started an energy crisis in the country.
 ""We still expect reasonably resilient growth for commodities
such as copper even though we won't see the sort of growth that
we saw last year,"" said Daniel Major, analyst at RBS, adding
that 2010 growth came from a low base in 2009.
 ""Underlying fundamentals for copper are reasonably
supportive.""
 
 COPPER STOCKS
 Inventories of copper at the London Metal Exchange fell 950
tonnes to 437,900 tonnes, latest data showed. Copper stocks are
up by about a quarter from mid-December.
 Copper stocks in China are abnormally high and need to be
watched carefully as some companies use the metal as a financing
tool, the head of the world's top copper producer, Codelco, said
on Monday.
 Copper demand is generally slower in the first quarter and
picks up in the second quarter and expectations are for more
outflows of inventories over the next few weeks.
 Lead rose more than 5 percent to touch its highest since
April 2008. The metal later closed at $2,752 a tonne from $2,698
at the close on Friday.
 Tin closed at $31,625 from a last bid of $31,500 while zinc
was at $2,417 from $2,390 a tonne at Friday's close. 
 Aluminium, untraded at the close, was last bid at $2,632
from $2,631 and nickel closed at $25,500 from $25,600.
 Minmetals Resources, China's biggest metals trader, on
Monday offered $6.5 billion to buy Equinox Minerals which has
copper assets in Zambia and Saudi Arabia.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - Gold rose and silver surged
to 31-year highs on Monday, as fresh gains that pushed oil and
grain prices to their highest since 2008 stoke inflation
worries.
 While silver streaked ahead, rising to its strongest
relative to gold since 1983 after the Hunt Brothers cornered
the silver market, bullion prices have struggled for the past
month to sustain new highs.
 Activity in the U.S. futures market on Monday was less than
half the average, set to be one of the weakest this year, as
the metal struggled to extend its record high $1,447.40 an
ounce set on March 24.
 ""There is no question that the inflation factor is
supporting gold,"" said Bruce Dunn, vice president of precious
metals dealer Auramet Trading. ""Both gold and silver are
benefiting from speculative buying and good demand from
physical bars and coins.""
 Spot gold  rose 0.4 percent to $1,433 an ounce by
3:34 p.m. EDT (1934 GMT), off an earlier high of $1,438.55 an
ounce.
 U.S. gold futures for June delivery  settled up 0.3
percent to $1,433. Total COMEX trade was less than 82,000 lots,
one of the quietest sessions this year, preliminary Reuters
data showed.
 Rising oil and grain prices boosted gold's inflation hedge
appeal. U.S. oil rose to a 2-1/2-year highs on geopolitical
risks to supply from the Middle East, while corn futures
rallied to the highest level since the 2008 global food crisis
due to very tight supplies. [O/R] [GRA/]
 Silver  climbed to its highest in 31 years at $38.58
an ounce, sending the gold-to-silver ratio to its lowest level
in 18 years. It was later up 2 percent at $38.48.
 Silver prices are fast closing in on $40 an ounce, lifted
by interest in the metal as a cheaper proxy for gold and
expectations that industrial demand is set to improve. But
analysts remain wary of silver's extreme volatility, which has
led to some heart-stopping reversals in recent years.
[ID:nLDE7331DB]
 ""There is a huge amount of speculative drive behind silver,
and that is off the back of gold,"" said Societe Generale
analyst David Wilson.
 ECB RATE HIKE, DOLLAR STRENGTH EYED
 Bullion rose as the the euro hovered near a five-month peak
against the dollar, with the ECB expected to raise rates by 25
basis points from a record low in reaction to rising
inflationary pressures in the euro zone, with two more 25 basis
point hikes factored in by year-end.  [FRX/]
 Bullion investors chose to side with expectations of a
weakening dollar after the ECB meeting this week, as rising
interest rates are generally negative for gold, as they raise
the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets.
 Even as most economists agree the Fed will not tighten
monetary policy in the short term, recent hawkish comments by
top Fed officials are weighing on bullion investor sentiment.
 On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on
Monday U.S. inflation is likely to remain low for now, but
policymakers will keep a close eye on potentially
self-fulfilling consumer expectations for higher prices.
[ID:nN04244409]
 Last November, the Fed initiated a $600 billion bond buying
program -- dubbed QE2 because it is the second round of
quantitative easing -- which is scheduled to end in June. Gold
has been a major beneficiary since the Fed has kept short-term
rates near zero since December 2008.
 Gold is also benefiting from concerns some smaller euro
zone economies such as Portugal and Ireland will continue to
struggle with sovereign debt, and from unrest in the Middle
East and North Africa.
 For platinum group metals, platinum  rose 1 percent
to $1,782 an ounce, while palladium  gained 1.5 percent
to $781.22.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, April 4 (Reuters) - Spot gold edged up on Monday,
as higher oil prices amid the ongoing Middle East crisis and a
firm euro on expectations of a European Central Bank rate hike
lent support.	
 Upbeat U.S. employment data last Friday, indicating that the
global economy was likely on a firm footing, shaved some lustre
off gold's demand, but the ongoing Middle East crisis continued
to support the precious metal's safe-haven appeal.	
 ""We saw the continuous geopolitical risk in the Middle East
crisis, and oil prices going higher. It certainly looks to me
that gold has been tracking both oil and euro quite closely in
past few days,"" said Darren Heathcote, head of trading at
Investec Australia.	
 The euro hit fresh 11-month highs against a broadly weaker
yen early in Asia on Monday and held firm against the dollar
with markets all but certain the European Central Bank will
raise interest rates this week. 
 Rate hikes usually dampen sentiment in gold, seen as an
inflation hedge. But in the long run, rising inflation benefits
gold.	
 ""A great deal of expectations dictate that the ECB will
raise interest rates very soon, and probably will continue to
raise rates for the rest of the year. A lot of that you may
consider already priced in,"" said Heathcote.	
 Spot gold inched up 0.2 percent to $1,430.40 an ounce
by 0636 GMT, after ending the first quarter up 0.7 percent.	
 U.S. gold  gained 0.2 percent to $1,431.90.	
 Spot gold is still biased to rise to $1,447.40 per
ounce even after a sharp retracement to $1,412.55 on Friday,
said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.	
 The ongoing turmoil in the Middle East buoyed oil prices,
pushing U.S. crude prices to a 2-1/2 year peak.

 ""Gold is still holding its ground and will probably be
range-bound,"" said a Singapore-based dealer, adding that gold is
expected to trade in a range $1,410 and $1,445.	
 Gold hit a record high at $1,447.40 on March 24.	
 Speculators in gold futures and options raised their net
long positions as prices rose to fresh records, data from the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.[ID:nN01152819]

 Spot silver rose as high as $38.10, just a few cents
off a 31-year peak at $38.13. Silver has been the best performer
in the precious metals complex, up 23 percent so far this year. 
 Speculative long positions in U.S. gold futures and options
rose on high prices, while slipped in silver, according to the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

 * Fierce fighting rocks Ivorian capital
 * Limited availability underpins coffee markets
(Adds updates on prices and price table, recasts and changes
dateline)
 By Rene Pastor and David Brough
 NEW YORK/LONDON, April 1 (Reuters) - Cocoa prices climbed
on Friday as oversold bean futures staged a rebound while
fighting spread between forces loyal to presidential claimant
Alassane Ouattara and incumbent Laurent Gbagbo in top producer
Ivory Coast.
 Bitter fighting spread across the Ivorian capital of
Abidjan as forces loyal to Gbagbo fended off attacks by those
seeking to install Ouattara.
 New York's May cocoa futures rose $59 to end at $3,011 per
tonne. The market had lost almost 10 percent in value the
preceding three days as the prospect of Ouattara ousting Gbagbo
increased, raising the prospect that cocoa will begin flowing
after being stalled by the power struggle there.
 The unwinding of market long positions built up by fear of
cocoa supply disruption could be seen as open interest in U.S.
cocoa hit a three-year high at 168,846 lots.
 The July cocoa contract on London's Liffe market rose 32
pounds to end at 1,947 pounds a tonne.
 ""It's a wait-and-see situation,"" said Keith Flury, soft
commodities analyst with Rabobank in London. ""We've seen a lot
of liquidation already. People in the market are now
consolidating.""
 ""The market tipped so far to the sell side,"" said Sterling
Smith, an analyst for brokers Country Hedging Inc. in St. Paul,
Minnesota. ""It's overdone. We added a few shorts on the way
down.""
 Market players reacted cautiously to news that Nasdaq OMX
and IntercontinentalExchange unveiled a rival bid to buy NYSE
Euronext for about $11.3 billion in cash and stock, a 19
percent premium to the offer made by German competitor Deutsche
Boerse.
 COFFEE DOWN, SUGAR HIGHER
 Coffee futures stumbled on late investor liquidation, with
robustas appearing to hit automatic sell order stops on the way
down, dealers said.
 New York's May arabica coffee futures lost 4.15 cents to
trade at $2.60 per lb. London's May robusta coffee contract
fell $107 to end at $2,421 a tonne.
 Sugar futures moved higher, buoyed in part by
short-covering and trade buying in the market.
 ""We expect the ranges to be maintained until further
fundamental news emerges,"" said Nick Penney of brokerage Sucden
Financial.
 The May raw sugar futures rose 0.45 cent to trade at 27.56
cents per lb. London's May white sugar contract added $1.50 to
finish at $713.20 per tonne.

 * Analysts positive on copper longer-term
 
 (Updates prices, adds data)
 By Sue Thomas and Rebekah Curtis
 LONDON, April 1 (Reuters) - Copper hit a two-week low on
Friday, extending the first-quarter's 2.4-percent loss as a lull
in Chinese demand worried investors, and as strength in the
dollar eclipsed economic optimism supported by U.S. jobs data.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was at
$9,306 a tonne at 1412 GMT and hit a session low of $9,279.75,
from $9,430 at the close on Thursday. In the first three months
of the year it recorded its first quarterly loss since June.
 Base metals have fallen this year on softness in Chinese
demand, as well as turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa
which has boosted oil prices and stoked inflation concerns.

 ""People are still nervous,"" Charles Kernot, an analyst at
Evolution Securities, said. ""It's still a very fragile market.""
 U.S. employment recorded a second straight month of solid
gains in March and the jobless rate fell to a two-year low of
8.8 percent, marking a decisive shift in the labour market that
supported sentiment towards the economy and metals demand. 
 ""The survey today should help things,"" Kernot added.
 Though upbeat for sentiment, the data also propelled the
dollar higher versus a basket of major currencies, removing some
support from metals by making them costlier for non U.S.
investors. 
 Other data was less positive, showing the U.S. manufacturing
sector grew at a marginally slower pace in March, while U.S.
construction spending fell more than expected in February to its
lowest level since October 1999.
 Japan's nuclear and humanitarian crisis is in its third
week, with radiation still leaking from a crippled nuclear power
plant, thousands of homeless people struggling to rebuild their
lives, and little hope exists of a quick resolution to either.

 
 STOCKPILES
 Hefty copper stockpiles in China have slowed demand from the
world's top metals consumer, compounding concerns about weak
physical demand and keeping prices in a tight range. Imports of
refined copper fell 36 percent to a 27-month low in February,
recent data showed.
 Latest data shows LME stocks of copper fell 1,000 tonnes to
total 438,850 tonnes, but have been steadily climbing since
December.
 Longer-term analysts are still positive about the outlook
for copper, especially because there is a deficit.
 ""In the short term supply is going to be fairly tight,"" said
Peter Archbold, European head of basic materials at Fitch
Ratings. ""I'm very positive about copper this year. It could get
closer to $11,000 a tonne due a deficit in supply.""
 Aluminium was at $2,607 a tonne, from $2,645 at the close on
Thursday. Zinc was $2,327 a tonne from $2,362 at the close on
Thursday and battery material lead was at $2,676.75 a tonne from
a close of $2,695.
 Tin was $31,375 from $31,800 a tonne. Nickel was at $25,400
from $26,095 a tonne.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, April 1 (Reuters) - Gold slipped on Friday as an
encouraging U.S. jobs report boosted the dollar, though euro
zone debt worries and unrest in the Middle East lifted bullion
off lows.
 Positive nonfarm payrolls and manufacturing data confirmed
a strengthening U.S. economy, but economists said the news was
not enough to push the Federal Reserve away from an ultra-easy
monetary stance that has helped gold hit record highs.
 ""As economic conditions appear to be improving, evidenced
by today's data, gold suffers as a store of value in times of
fiscal or financial uncertainties,"" said Mark Luschini, chief
investment strategist at broker-dealer Janney Montgomery Scott
with $53 billion in assets under management.
 Spot gold  dropped 0.6 percent to $1,428.20 an ounce
as of 2:01 p.m. EDT (1801 GMT), sharply off its low at
$1,412.55 hit earlier in the session.
 Bullion has risen about 0.5 percent this week for its
second consecutive weekly gain. It hit a record $1,447.40 an
ounce last week.
 U.S. gold futures for June delivery  settled down 0.8
percent at $1,428.90, with COMEX trading volume slightly below
its 30-day average after strong turnover earlier this week
partly due to contract rollover.
 Gold recorded a 10th consecutive quarter of gains in the
first three months of 2011, but it was the smallest rise since
the financial crisis gripped markets in late 2008.

 ""Just because we had a good payrolls number today, that
doesn't mean that one data point makes things all well and
good,"" Luschini said.
 Luschini said political unrest in the Middle East and euro
zone sovereign debt issues underpinned gold, and end-of-quarter
fund allocation also boosted the metal earlier this week before
the trade unwounded on Friday.

cull expectations it will soon join the euro zone bailout list,

 Despite a rally in energy prices, stagnant growth in wages
does not bode well for gold's inflation-hedge appeal, said
Peter Buchanan, senior economist at CIBC World Markets.
 HAWKISH FED COMMENTS, ECB IN FOCUS
 Even as most economists agree the Fed will not tighten
monetary policy in the short term, recent hawkish comments by
top Fed officials are weighing on bullion investor sentiment.
 Jeffrey Lacker, Richmond Fed president, said the U.S.
central bank could raise interest rates by the end of the year
to curb rising inflation. [ID:nN01191151]
 Gold tends to suffer when rates climb, as the opportunity
cost of holding non-yielding assets increases.
 Nick Moore, head of commodity strategy at RBS, said gold
prices were likely to suffer further from expectations that the
European Central Bank will raise interest rates this month.
 Investment products such as gold-backed exchange-traded
funds saw less interest, with the No. 1 SPDR Gold Trust 
reporting its biggest ever quarterly outflow in the first
quarter.

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, April 1 (Reuters) - Gold dropped on Friday before
the release of U.S. non-farm payrolls report which could
underpin the dollar and weigh on bullion, while ETF holdings
posted their biggest quarterly decline ever.	
 Investors were cautious ahead of the data due at 1230 GMT,
which should provide more clues on the health of the world's
largest economy. Signs of improving business activity and rising
inflation globally have led a number of central banks either to
tighten policies or talk tough on inflation.	
 Spot gold fell $2.88 an ounce to $1,433.60 an ounce
by 0618 GMT, having risen about half a percent on Thursday on
inflation worries sparked by rallies in oil and grain prices,
notching a 10th straight quarterly gain. 
 ""I am still positive about gold, but I think it will take
time to consolidate. But there's not much going on, especially
on the physical side and we are also waiting for the non-farm
figure tonight,"" said Dick Poon, manager of precious metals at
Heraeus in Hong Kong.	
 ""The premiums are also stable at 90 cents to $1,"" said Poon,
referring to premiums for gold bars.	
 
 Gold struck a lifetime high at $1,447.40 last week, when a
falling dollar, violence in the Middle East and North Africa, as
well as renewed concerns over debt crisis in Europe spurred
investors to buy.	
 In Singapore, a centre for bullion trading in Southeast
Asia, premiums for gold bars were also steady at 90 cents to the
spot London prices. Dealers noted early buying from Indonesia
but main consumer India was on the sidelines. 
 The high-demand season is underway in India, where jewellery
is the most common gift during religious events and weddings.	
 
 BULLISH TARGET INTACT 
 A bullish target at $1,447.40 per ounce was unchanged for
spot gold , based on its wave pattern and a triple-bottom
pattern, according to Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 U.S. gold futures for April dropped $4.4 to $1,434.5
an ounce.	
 The world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, New
York's SPDR Gold Trust , posted in the first three months
of 2011 its biggest quarterly drop since inception in November
2004 as the prospect of interest rate hikes and gains in other
commodities, such as oil, drove investors to sell. 
 The dollar steadied against the euro and particularly
against commodity currencies after Minneapolis Federal Reserve
President Narayana Kocherlakota said rates should rise by up to
75 basis points by year-end if core inflation and economic
growth picked up as he expected. 
 A stronger-than-expected payrolls data later in the day
could add more weight to recent hawkish comments from Fed
officials. 
 U.S. nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased a solid
190,000 after rising 192,000 in February, according to a Reuters
survey, with the unemployment rate seen holding steady at a near
two-year low of 8.9 percent. [ID:nN31253973]	
 ""After adding 192,000 jobs in February, this would indicate
the economy is finally gaining some flying speed; but if the
jobs figure falls significantly short of 200,000, the economic
recovery is in a lot of trouble,"" said Peter Morici, an
economist at the University of Maryland business school.	
 ""If the economy created less than 165,000 jobs in March, it
is at peril of a second recession."" 
 In other markets, Asian shares rose on Friday, looking to
extend three straight quarters of gains, while oil kicked off
the new quarter in positive fashion with U.S. prices climbing
after closing at their highest in 2-1/2 years on Thursday
against the backdrop of fighting in Libya and unrest in the
Middle East.

987,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2011 03:40PM ET</span>","GRAINS-Surge on shrinking US stocks, corn limit up"," * Corn limit up, rises 4.5 pct on bullish USDA stocks data
 * Soybeans up 2.8 pct on lower stocks, acreage decline
 * Wheat follows corn, soy higher despite bearish USDA data
(Updates with closing prices)
 By Karl Plume
 CHICAGO, March 31 (Reuters) - Grains surged on Thursday,
with corn rallying 4.5 percent as strong demand whittled down
stocks even as farmers geared up to plant the second-largest
area since 1944.
 Soybeans soared to a seven-week high after the U.S.
Agriculture Department reported on Thursday
lower-than-anticipated stocks and spring seedings that were
below expectations.
 Wheat rose 5 percent, following soaring corn and soybeans
despite a bearish stocks estimate and a larger-than-expected
jump in the USDA's spring wheat seedings forecast.
 ""Even though we've seen food inflation and everything else
that has taken place, the demand has not backed away. Even at
these lofty prices, we're still seeing strong demand in the
U.S. and in world markets for agricultural commodities,"" said
Shawn McCambridge, analyst with Prudential Bache Commodities.
 ""Farmers are following what the market is telling them to
do. The acreage numbers we saw today tell us that this battle
for acreage will continue going forward and there is not that
much acreage out there that is free and available,"" he added.
 Thursday's rally put a positive end on what has been the
weakest quarter since mid-2010 as it looked like the surge in
grains prices had topped out on expectations of large U.S.
crops.
 Chicago Board of Trade May corn futures closed up the
30-cent daily limit at $6.93-1/4 per bushel, the strongest gain
in nearly two weeks. The contract traded synthetically through
options as high as $7.32 a bushel, according to traders, which
would be a three-week high.
 CBOT May soybeans rose 38-1/4 cents to $14.10-1/4 a bushel,
a 2.8 percent gain that was the largest in two weeks, after
earlier hitting a seven-week high of $14.32.
 CBOT May wheat jumped 36 cents, or 5 percent, to a
three-week high of $7.63-1/4 a bushel. The largest percentage
gain in two-weeks was also fueled by technical buying as the
contract broke through its 200-day moving average.
 Spot month corn gained 10.2 percent in the quarter, while
soybeans eked out a 1.2 percent gain and wheat fell 3.9
percent.
 CORN STOCKS DECLINING
 Corn stocks were shrinking faster than anticipated despite
prices near highs not seen since the record-setting rallies of
2008.
 ""The big number was USDA's corn stocks number, which is a
reflection of demand and how much corn is moving into the
marketing channel,"" said Jerry Gidel, analyst for North America
Risk Management Inc.
 ""The number suggests feed demand has not declined as some
had expected and it suggests ethanol production is staying very
strong,"" he said.
 The USDA has already forecast end-of-marketing-year corn
stocks at the lowest level in 15 years, but Thursday's low
quarterly stocks estimate hinted at an even tighter supply.
 ""The trade is now wondering if new-crop stocks, which were
going to be slightly higher than this year, may now only be
equal to this year so people are suggesting new-crop futures
need to be at $7 (a bushel),"" said Rich Nelson, director of
research with consultancy Allendale Inc.
 USDA pegged March 1 corn stocks at 6.523 billion bushels,
below the range of trade estimates.
 BULLISH STOCKS TRUMP ACREAGE
 Investors were focused more on the USDA's bullish March 1
corn and soybean stocks estimates than on prospective plantings
forecasts that were within the range of pre-report estimates.
 Farmers may yet adjust the area devoted to each crop in
coming weeks. Such changes will show up in the USDA's acreage
report on June 30.
 USDA's March 1 soybean stocks estimate of 1.249 billion
bushels was below the range of trade estimates, but the
oilseed's advance on Thursday was less aggressive than that in
corn, which had been trending lower ahead of the report in
anticipation of a big increase in acres at the expense of soy.
 USDA's eagerly awaited prospective plantings report on
Thursday pegged corn seedings at 92.178 million acres and
soybean plantings at 76.609 million acres, both within the
range of pre-report estimates.

 By Chris Kelly and Rebekah Curtis
 NEW YORK/LONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - Copper closed slightly higher on
Thursday but ended the first quarter of 2011 with a 2.4 percent quarterly loss,
its first such decline since the second quarter of 2010, as concerns about
softer Chinese demand and rising warehouse stocks weighed on sentiment.
 Traders cited book squaring and the weak dollar for Thursday's higher
close. For the quarter, copper diverged from the broader base metals complex,
with tin rallying 18.3 percent, aluminium up 7.2 percent, and lead and nickel
each about 5 percent firmer.
 Copper prices are off more than 7 percent from their record highs hit last
month at $10,190 per tonne in London and $4.6575 per lb in New York. With
sustained softness in Chinese buying and a buildup in London warehouse stocks,
prices are expected to remain weak in the near-term.
 ""The Chinese market has hit a soft spot lately, reflected in the sharp fall
of physical premiums and more metal delivered in LME and Shanghai warehouses,""
said Duncan Hobbs, an analyst at Macquarie.
 ""All these things reflect that the market is definitely soft at the
moment.""
 London Metal Exchange (LME) copper for three-months delivery rose $49 for
the day to end at $9,430 a tonne. For the quarter, that was down 2.4 percent
from the final three months of 2010, its first quarterly loss since June.
 COMEX May copper settled up 3.35 cents at $4.3075 per lb. It finished the
quarter down 3 percent.
 ""We're still all wondering where is the Chinese buying that we were all
looking for ... the fact is they have adequate supplies, so they can let the
price come to them,"" said Frank Lesh, broker and futures analyst with Future
Path Trading in Chicago.
 High bonded stocks in China, estimated at about 600,000 tonnes, were seen
discouraging fabricators from building copper stocks.
 Compounding concerns about weak physical demand, stocks of copper have been
on a steady ascent since December, rising 125 tonnes to their highest since
July 2010, at 439,850 tonnes.
 Base metals have been knocked this year by turmoil in the Middle East and
North Africa, which has boosted oil prices and stoked inflation concerns, and
by the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in Japan.
 Aluminium firmed $16 to end at $2,645 a tonne. It has been underpinned
by higher energy costs which lifted prices to a 2-1/2-year high of $2,656
earlier this week.
 ""In terms of supply and demand dynamics, Chinese output picked up earlier
this year, as the government-imposed power restrictions were eased once again,""
Credit Suisse said of the metal in a note.
 ""However, supply growth is unlikely to match demand growth in our view. As
a result inventories should fall, providing cyclical support for prices.""
 Zinc rose $24 to $2,362 a tonne.
 Dowa Mining Holdings Co said it plans to resume operations of its 200,000
tonnes-a-year Akita zinc smelter in north-eastern Japan in early April.
 The Akita plant is Japan's biggest zinc smelter, accounting for nearly 30
percent of Japan's total production. Nearly 65 percent of Japan's production
capacity of zinc has been suspended since the March 11 earthquake.

 CHICAGO, March 31 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures surged 4.5
percent and by the daily 30-cent trading limit on Thursday,
while soybeans jumped more than 3 percent after a government
report showed quarterly stocks shrunk more than expected.
 The U.S. Agriculture Department stocks data offset pressure
from a higher-than-expected spring corn acreage outlook. Soy
acres were slightly below expectations, giving additional
support to futures that have risen the past two days.
 Wheat rose 3.5 percent, following soaring corn and soybeans
despite a bearish stocks estimate and a larger-than-expected

 Corn and soybeans were in position to rise for a fourth
consecutive quarter, but wheat was poised for its first
quarterly drop in a year.
 ""The big number was USDA's corn stocks number, which is a

 * Aluminium near highest since Sept 2008
 * Coming up: Chinese PMI data early on Friday
 
 (Releads, adds ring closing prices)
 By Rebekah Curtis
 LONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - Copper rose on Thursday as
dollar weakness attracted non-U.S. buyers after earlier hitting
a two-week low on worries about soft Chinese demand.
 Copper for three-months delivery on the London Metal
Exchange (LME) closed in the rings at $9,430 a tonne versus
Wednesday's close of $9,381. Earlier on Thursday, it touched
$9,332 a tonne, its lowest since March 17.
 The metal used in power and construction is heading for its
first quarterly loss since the second quarter of last year.
 Helping to support base metals, the dollar fell versus a
basket of major currencies. Metals are typically priced in
dollars, and so a dollar decline makes them less expensive in
other currencies.
 Base metals have been knocked this year by turmoil in the
Middle East and North Africa, which has boosted oil prices and
stoked inflation concerns, and by the earthquake, tsunami and
nuclear disaster in Japan.
 Copper was down 8 percent from a record high of $10,190 in
mid-February as high prices have cooled China's buying interest
for the metal used in power.
 ""We're still in a longer-term uptrend for copper,"" Alex
Heath, head of base metals at RBC Capital, said of the market.
 But he added, ""We need to go lower before we can go higher.""
 Analysts remained broadly confident, however, that an
expected deficit in copper this year will support prices.
 ""It's very, very nervy,"" Heath said of the market. ""The
investment community as a whole is probably getting a bit
nervous right now about the lack of momentum.""
 
 PHYSICAL DEMAND
 Compounding concerns about weak physical demand, stocks of
copper in LME warehouses rose again on Wednesday, up 125 tonnes
to total 439,850 tonnes after steadily climbing since December.
Since Japan's earthquake and tsunami, copper has gained some
support from investors shifting their focus to the country's
need to rebuild infrastructure.
 Aluminium ended at $2,645 a tonne in the rings from $2,629.
 ""In terms of supply and demand dynamics, Chinese output
picked up earlier this year, as the government-imposed power
restrictions were eased once again,"" Credit Suisse said of the
metal in a note.
 ""However, supply growth is unlikely to match demand growth
in our view. As a result inventories should fall, providing
cyclical support for prices.""
 The metal used in transport, packaging and construction has
been underpinned by higher energy costs which lifted prices to a
2-1/2-year high of $2,656 earlier this week.
 Zinc ended at $2,362 a tonne from $2,338.
 Dowa Mining Holdings Co said it plans to resume operations
of its 200,000 tonnes-a-year Akita zinc smelter in north-eastern
Japan in early April.
 The Akita plant is Japan's biggest zinc smelter, accounting
for nearly 30 percent of Japan's total production. Nearly 65
percent of Japan's production capacity of zinc has been
suspended since the March 11 earthquake.
 Battery material lead closed at $2,695 a tonne in the rings
from a last bid of $2,655 a tonne, tin at $31,800 a tonne from a
close of $31,250, and nickel at $26,095 a tonne from $26,030 on
Wednesday.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, March 31 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose nearly 1
percent on Thursday, notching a 10th straight quarterly gain,
as the dollar fell and as rallies in oil and grain prices
boosted gold's appeal as a hedge against inflation.
 Ultra-loose monetary policies by central banks, euro zone
debt fears and political unrest across the Middle East have
been major drivers for gold, even as the metal gained only 1
percent, the smallest quarterly rise since 2008, before the
financial crisis took hold.
 ""The second quarter is going to be another positive quarter
for gold. You still have Middle East and the sovereign debt
crisis, which are certainly far from over, and inflation is
becoming an increasingly important factor,"" said Bill O'Neill,
managing partner of commodities firm LOGIC Advisors.
 ""You will see funds continue to be net buyers of gold,
silver and platinum in the second quarter,"" he said.
 Spot gold  rose 0.8 percent to $1,435.10 an ounce by
3:57 p.m. EDT (1957 GMT).
 U.S. gold futures for June delivery  ended up 1.1
percent at $1,439.90, with volume lower than usual as investors
have completed rolling their contracts to June from April on
first-notice day on Thursday.
 Bullion also notched its biggest one-day gain in nearly two
weeks, a day before Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls for March,
considered a key indicator of the health of the U.S. economy.
[ID:nN30121489]
 Investors bought gold to hedge against uncertainty related
to Friday's job report, traders said. Inflation worries also
benefited gold as oil rallied on supply worries from the Middle
East, and as grains surged as strong demand whittled down
stocks. [O/R] [GRA/]
 On charts, the metal is expected to break out of its recent
base and rally toward a record $1,500 an ounce, after it has
built up a large space to consolidate recent gains from the
latter half of 2010. [ID:nN31566525]
 Silver  gained 0.7 percent to $37.71 an ounce. Silver
posted a ninth consecutive quarterly gain, with a 22 percent
increase in the first three months of the year, as investors
bet on further gains in gold and expectations that industrial
demand will improve.
 Earlier in Thursday's session, the gold/silver ratio
dropped below 38, its lowest level since 1983.
 (Graphic: http://link.reuters.com/dyw78r)
 EURO ZONE DEBT JITTERS
 Gold was also supported as the euro outperformed the dollar
on inflation data that firmed expectations the European Central
Bank would raise interest rates, but the unit's strength may
prove temporary, with peripheral debt issues seen persisting in
the second quarter.
 Concerns over euro zone sovereign debt were a major factor
in last year's 30 percent rise in the price of gold.
 On Thursday, rating agency Moody's warned further sovereign
ratings downgrades for euro zone countries could not be ruled
out, which fed ongoing investor concern about the region's
finances. [ID:nLDE72U0JG]
 The prospect of monetary tightening in the United States
and the euro zone has undermined some of the appeal for gold,
which has seen a net outflow of 2.18 million ounces of metal,
or 3.5 percent, from the major exchange-traded funds this
year.
 Signs the U.S. jobs market is recovering could support
calls from some Federal Reserve officials to wind up the
central bank's monetary easing program earlier than expected.
 Platinum  rose less than $1 to $1,766.49 an ounce,

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, March 31 (Reuters) - Gold inched up on Thursday and was on track
for its 10th consecutive quarterly rise since 2008 as an early drop spurred
cautious bargain hunting ahead of U.S. February employment data at the end of
the week.	
 U.S. private employers added more than 200,000 jobs in March, underscoring
expectations that momentum in the labour market will help underpin the economic
recovery. A Reuters poll shows a median forecast for employment, or non-farm
payrolls, is expected to rise by about 190,000 jobs in March, with private
payrolls forecast up by 200,000 when the data is released at 1230 GMT on Friday.
[ID:nN30275708] 
 Spot gold hit an intraday low of $1,420.25 an ounce before rebounding
to $1,426.00 by 0315 GMT, up $2.62 an ounce. Bullion had risen as high as $1,430
on Wednesday as resurgence of risk appetite spurred buying. 
 ""I think sentiment is slightly bullish because there are still many
uncertainties around. Even though the euro zone is expected to increase interest
rates, it will only be a small increase,"" said Ronald Leung, director of Lee
Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong. 
 ""I think we are waiting for tomorrow. Nobody really knows what to do,"" said
Leung, referring to the U.S. job report.	
 Gold rallied to a lifetime high around $1,447 last week because of a falling
dollar, violence in the Middle East and North Africa as well as renewed concerns
about sovereign debt crisis in Europe. 
 A Reuters survey showed on Wednesday that gold's decade-long price rally
which took the metal to record highs last week looks set to plateau in the
second quarter as more downside risks for bullion emerge. [ID:nLDE72T1AT]	
 U.S. gold futures for April dropped $2.4 an ounce to $1,421.4 an
ounce.	
 European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said on
Thursday the central bank's policy is to gradually raise interest rates, while
another board member, Juergen Stark, said rates are exceptionally low, cementing
expectations for an April interest rate hike [ID:nLOOKCBANK]. 
The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.4138 , facing resistance at $1.422 and
$1.4248. BNP Paribas is recommending long euro positions from $1.4120 to target
$1.45 with a stop at $1.402. 
 In the physical market, consumers from Indonesia stayed on the sidelines,
but purchases from Thailand and Indonesia kept premiums for gold bars steady at
90 cents to the spot London price in Singapore. 
 ""I have to say there isn't much transaction on my side. I think people are
just waiting for the data tomorrow because there's no clear direction,"" said a
dealer in Singapore.	
 ""But I heard the demand from China is still good and in fact we are still
getting inquiries from them,"" said the dealer, referring to the world's
second-largest consumer after India. 
 The high-demand wedding season is underway in India, where jewellery is the
most common gift during religious events and weddings. 
 In other markets, Most Asian shares edged up on Thursday, poised to end the
quarter on a positive note after being briefly ravaged earlier in the month by a
sell-off on Japan's disasters and Middle East turmoil, while the yen weakened on
expectations of higher interest rates outside Japan.

 * Arabica coffee futures begin rebound after long slide
(Updates prices, rewrites, adds NEW YORK to dateline, byline)
 By Rene Pastor and Nigel Hunt
 NEW YORK/LONDON, March 30 (Reuters) - U.S. cocoa futures
dropped to a 2-1/2 month low Wednesday as investors eyed
increased prospects for a resolution to the power struggle in
Ivory Coast, which could free up exports from the world's top
cocoa grower.
 Volume in U.S. cocoa futures was double the 30-day norm,
Thomson Reuters preliminary data showed, as investors sold long
positions now that Alassane Ouattara seems to be gaining the
upperhand over incumbent Laurent Gbagbo.
 New York's May cocoa futures slid $70 to close at $2,987
per tonne. In the last two sessions, the contract has lost 8.0
percent in value and settled at its lowest level since Jan. 13.
 The July cocoa contract on London's Liffe market fell 46
pounds or by 2.3 percent to end at 1,948 pounds a tonne.
 Ivorian forces loyal to Ouattara are now in control of the
town of Soubre, the last main town on the road to the cocoa
port of San Pedro, residents said.
 If Ouattara's forces take control of the San Pedro port, it
could allow cocoa to once again flow out of the country after
an export ban stalled supplies.
 ""There's definitely some pricing in of a quicker
resolution. If a quick resolution does occur, these sort of
prices would draw cocoa out (of Ivory Coast) quite quickly,""
Keith Flury, a senior analyst at Rabobank said.
 ""The political situation appears close to reaching a change
in Ivory Coast,"" added Sterling Smith, senior analyst with
brokerage Country Hedging Inc in St. Paul, Minnesota.
 The trade is now mulling whether Ivorian supplies will be
shipped out or whether there will be any further logistical or
quality problems that may crop up, he said.
 Ouattara's export ban, EU sanctions and the collapse of the
local banking system have meant over 450,000 tonnes of stocks
are languishing in storage, and concerns about a deterioration
in quality are growing by the day.
 ""The sell off is speculator based. They were the ones that
ran the prices up,"" Flury said.
 The market's technical outlook had remained shaky after May
fell below the 100-day moving average at $3,150 and the 200-day
MA at $3,042 on Tuesday.
 COFFEE, SUGAR REBOUND
 Arabica coffee futures on ICE were higher with the market
finally beginning to rebound following a prolonged slide driven
mainly by bearish technical indicators.
 Fundamentally, the market is seen as bullish given the
tight supplies of high-quality washed arabica beans.
 ""We have a bullish outlook looking to the next season with
a deficit expected. Prices should stay supported from here on
out,"" Flury said.
 New York's May arabica coffee futures rose 4 cents to
$2.6545 per lb. London's May robusta coffee contract rose $14
to end at $2,524 a tonne.
 Sugar futures were mixed as the market looked toward the
full-bore harvesting of the cane crop in Brazil's premier
center-south region.
 ""With the looming Brazilian crop on the horizon, it seems
safer to sell a rally than buy a dip intraday,"" Sucden
Financial said in a market report on Wednesday.
 The May raw sugar futures rose 0.31 cent to 27.33 cents per
lb. London's May white sugar contract increased $5.30 to finish
at $707.80 per tonne. 
 Smith said that technically, a fall in the May raw sugar
contract below the 200-day MA at 25.90 cents would bring the
area of 24.50 cents into play, the 50 percent retracement of
the move from the May 7, 2010 low of 13 cents to the 36.08
cents top on Feb. 2, 2011.

 By Karl Plume
 CHICAGO, March 30 (Reuters) - U.S. soybean futures rose for a
second straight day on Wednesday and corn eased ahead of a
government report which was expected to show that U.S. farmers
will plant more corn and less soy this year.
 Weak crude oil and a firmer U.S. dollar further weighed on
corn and pressured wheat.
 But trading was choppy and volume was lighter than normal as
investors squared positions before the U.S. Agriculture Department
releases its eagerly awaited prospective plantings and quarterly
grain stocks reports early on Thursday.
 ""People are just evening up their positions and not getting
too ambitious in changing a position this close to the report,""
said Shawn McCambridge, analyst with Prudential Bache
Commodities.
 ""That (weak crude and firm dollar) has some psychological
bearing on the market right now, but it really comes down to the
overall uncertainty with the reports tomorrow,"" he said.
 The USDA report on Thursday will provide a much-anticipated
forecast of which grains U.S. farmers are likely to plant this
spring and is likely to be critical for wheat, corn and soybean
price development.
 Analysts on average expected corn seedings at 91.839 million
acres, slightly below the USDA outlook forum projection of 92
million but well ahead of the 88.192 million acres seeded last
year.
 Soybean acreage was estimated at 76.87 million, below the USDA
outlook's 78 million forecast and less than last year's soy
acreage of 77.404 million.
 USDA's quarterly stocks report was expected to show slight
increases in March 1 U.S. wheat and soybean stocks from a year ago
and a steep decrease in the corn supply.
 Chicago Board of Trade CBOT May corn futures fell 1 cent, or
0.1 percent, to $6.70-3/4 by 10:28 a.m. CDT (1528 GMT), while May
soybeans rose 10 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $13.71-1/2 a bushel.
 ""People are buying soybeans and selling corn, they've been
doing this for the past three days. They think there may be bigger
corn stocks than expected in tomorrow's report and they're looking
for big corn acres and smaller soybean acres,"" said Roy Huckabay,
analyst for The Linn Group.
 CBOT May wheat fell 4-1/2 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $7.32-3/4
a bushel. EU benchmark wheat futures in Paris followed U.S. wheat
down, with the May dropping 1.75 euro or 0.7 percent a tonne to
238.75.

 (Adds quotes, byline, updates prices)
 By Nigel Hunt
 LONDON, March 30 (Reuters) - Cocoa prices stabilised on
Wednesday after sliding around 6 percent during the prior
session as the market eyed prospects for a decisive resolution
to the prolonged conflict in top grower Ivory Coast.
 Coffee prices extended recent losses on selling driven by
technical indicators while raw sugar edged slightly higher.
 Forces loyal to Ivory Coast presidential claimant Alassane
Ouattara advanced on Tuesday to within 200 km (120 miles) of the
two main port cities in an intensifying offensive against
incumbent Laurent Gbagbo.
 If Ouattara's forces take control of the San Pedro port it
could allow cocoa to once again flow out of the country after an
export ban stalled supplies.
""There's definitely some pricing in of a quicker resolution.
If a quick resolution does occur these sort of prices would draw
cocoa out (of Ivory Coast) quite quickly,"" Keith Flury, a senior
analyst at Rabobank said.
 Ouattara's export ban, EU sanctions and the collapse of the
local banking system have meant over 450,000 tonnes of stocks
are languishing in storage, and concerns about a deterioration
in quality are growing by the day.
 ""The sell off is speculator based, they were the ones that
ran the prices up,"" Flury said.
 May cocoa on ICE was up $3 at $3,060 a tonne at 1133 GMT
after earlier hitting $2,993, its lowest level since
mid-January.
 ""Whether there will be a rapid opening of the captured ports
to cocoa exports is still being doubted but it certainly seems
possible,"" one European physical cocoa trader said.
 ""Rapid exports would probably require a scaling-back of EU
sanctions and the EU is not well known for making very quick
decisions on matters like this.""
 July cocoa on Liffe stood 8 pounds higher at 2,002 pounds a
tonne after earlier slipping to 1,968 pounds, also the lowest
level for the contract since mid-January.
 
 COFFEE FALLS
 Arabica coffee futures on ICE eased on technically-driven
sales as the market continued its recent downward slide despite
supportive fundamentals.
 May arabica coffee fell 0.90 cent or 0.3 percent to $2.6055
per lb. The contract has lost about 12 percent of its value
since peaking at $2.9665 on March 9.
 ""When coffee passed $2.65 a lb on the way up it was
speculator driven, roasters were taking a step back,"" Flury of
Rabobank said, adding that once the sell-off occurred across
commodities including coffee after Japan's earthquake, roasters
secured supply before returning to the sidelines.
 Arabica prices remain supported by a shortage of high
quality beans.
 ""We have a bullish outlook looking to the next season with a
deficit expected. Prices should stay supported from here on
out,"" Flury said.
 May robusta coffee on Liffe fell $26 or 1.0 percent to
$2,484 a tonne.
 Raw sugar futures were slightly higher as the market's focus
remained on the harvest outlook for top producer Brazil.
 Rains have hampered early harvesting and Telvent DTN said
there were scattered light showers, locally heavier during the
past 24 hours in Brazil.
 May raw sugar rose 0.4 percent to 27.12 per lb while May
whites in Liffe eased $2.50 to $700.00 per tonne.

 * Copper stocks in China, LME warehouses in the spotlight
 
 (Updates prices)
 By Pratima Desai and Rebekah Curtis
 LONDON, March 30 (Reuters) - Copper fell on Wednesday to its
lowest in nearly two weeks, as investors worried about a lack of
demand from top global metals buyer China.
 Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at
$9,381 a tonne from $9,590 a tonne at Tuesday's close, on track
for a 5-percent fall in March, its first monthly decline since
June 2010.
 It earlier hit its lowest since March 17, at $9,341 a tonne,
some 8 percent below a record high of $10,190 hit on Feb. 15.
 ""All the bets were put on China,"" said Eugen Weinberg, an
analyst at Commerzbank. ""Sentiment in China is not as rosy and
not as upbeat as sentiment in Europe or the U.S.,"" he added.
 China has been absent from the copper market for some months
now, and analysts and traders are beginning to question whether
it will come back before prices fall further. 
 Analysts also pointed to an abundance of copper stocks in
China. ""We are cautious on copper's outlook ... It could be just
be monetary tightening impacting on the copper market,"" said Nic
Brown, an analyst at Natixis. ""It could be a reflection of
copper stockpiles built up in 2009 and now being run down.""
 China's State Reserves Bureau and consumers are expected by
analysts to have built up large stocks of copper in 2009, when
prices ranged between $3,000 and $7,500 a tonne.
 ""The market is nervous, watching and waiting, not sure China
is in the market for copper this year,"" a trader said.
 He added: ""The crisis in Japan and the Middle East is
keeping investors away. They are waiting to see the impact on
growth overall from what's going on in these places.""
 The market pared some losses after data showed U.S. private
employers added 201,000 jobs in March, largely in line with
expectations, which earlier prompted the dollar to trim gains
versus the euro.
 
 TRADITIONALLY STRONG QUARTER
 Traders and analysts are waiting to see what will happen in
the second quarter, traditionally the strongest in terms of
demand, when China normally buys ahead of a pick-up in
construction activity in the third quarter.
""Anecdotally, something in the region of 600,000 tonnes of
refined copper currently (sits) in bonded warehouses in
Shanghai, with perhaps another 100,000 tonnes in the southern
ports,"" Standard Bank said in a note.
 Also in the spotlight are stocks of copper in London Metal
Exchange warehouses, which are near 440,000 tonnes, up more than
25 percent since early December and at their highest since July
last year.
 Zinc closed at $2,338 a tonne from $2,375 and lead, untraded
at the close, was last bid at $2,655 a tonne from $2,685.
 Tin closed at $31,250 a tonne from Tuesday's last bid at
$31,550 and stainless steel ingredient nickel was at $26,030 a
tonne from $26,600.
 Aluminium hit a high of $2,654 a tonne from $2,648 on
Tuesday when it saw $2,656 a tonne, its highest since September
2008. The metal used in transport, packaging and construction
closed at $2,629 a tonne.

 NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - Gold prices turned higher in
choppy trade on Wednesday, snapping a four-session losing
streak, as a broad resurgence of risk appetite prompted buying
of bullion along with other assets ahead of Friday's U.S. jobs
report.
 Gold benefited from a weaker dollar against the euro after
a top European Central Bank official said the ECB's interest
rate hikes will be gradual, and world stocks rose more than 1
percent as strong hiring by U.S. private employers boosted both
U.S. and European markets. [MKTS/GLOB]
 ""It seems that risk is flooding back in. It's finding its
way back into precious metals and the stock markets, and that's
driving the trade higher,"" said Zachary Oxman, managing
director of TrendMax Futures.
 Bullion was also boosted by buying ahead of the start of
April and the second quarter, he said.
 Gold is used as a safe haven in times of economic and
political uncertainties, but its value also rises in prosperity
as the price of bullion has almost sextupled from $250 an ounce
in 2001.
 Spot gold  gained 0.4 percent to $1,422 an ounce by
3:33 p.m. EDT (1933 GMT), having earlier touched a high of
$1,430. U.S. gold futures for April delivery  settled up
$7.60 at $1,423.80.
 Earlier in the session, gold and oil fell sharply in tandem
after data showed swelling crude inventories. However, both
gold and crude futures were sharply off their lows.

 Gold futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange
were again one of the most actively trading commodity markets,
with volume topping 200,000 lots, one of the heaviest trading
days year to date.
 Bullion's failure to capitalize on record highs on recent
strong volume suggested some investors are skeptical about the
metal's investment appeal, analysts said.
 ""It (higher volume) is showing some of the money in gold
has been taken out and moved to other assets,"" Fred
Schoenstein, trader at Heraeus Precious Metals Management said.
""Gold's been a great asset over the last year, but why would
you stay in a trade that has performed so well and so long when
there are other markets where you can make money?""
 A Reuters poll showed that gold's decade-long rally, which
took the metal to record $1,447.40 an ounce last week, looks
set to plateau in the second quarter as more downside risks for
bullion emerge. [ID:nLDE72T1AT]
 (Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/ruq78r)
 On charts, spot gold must close consecutively higher above
its double-top resistance at $1,445 an ounce for a rise toward
record $1,500 level, said Rick Bensginor, chief market analyst
of Dahlman Rose.

 GOLD/SILVER RATIO HITS 28-YEAR LOW
 Silver  climbed 0.7 percent to $37.33 an ounce,
sending the gold/silver ratio to below 38, the lowest level
since 1983.
 (Graphic: http://link.reuters.com/bas78r)
 Daniel Major, an analyst at RBS, said that the price of
silver has been largely driven by technical and momentum
trading rather than the fundamentals.
 Industrial demand for silver is set to rise to 665.9
million ounces by 2015 from $487.4 million ounces last year,
metals consultancy GFMS said in a report prepared in
conjunction with the Silver Institute. [ID:nLDE72T0R6]
 Gold has struggled to eke out fresh gains as financial
markets digest hints from the euro zone and U.S. authorities
they may be set to tighten historically loose monetary policy.
 ""Gold players are anxiously waiting for policy signals from
the U.S. and to see what the ECB (European Central Bank)
actually does next week in its monthly meeting,"" said Credit
Agricole analyst Robin Bhar.
 Investors also await Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report,
which could set the tone for the near-term direction of gold.
 Platinum group metals rebounded after a recent sell-off as
production at Japan's major auto plants are interrupted after
the earthquake, tsunami and the subsequent nuclear crisis that
hit the country nearly three weeks ago.
 PGM sentiment improved after Nissan Motor Co Ltd <7201.T>
said on Wednesday it would resume normal operations at all its

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, March 30 (Reuters) - Gold steadied on Wednesday on firmer
equities and upheaval in Libya, although further gains could be capped by
worries that some central banks will have to soon start tightening monetary
policy, a move that would dent bullion's appeal as a hedge against inflation. 
 In recent days, several top U.S. central bank officials have said further
bond purchases by the Federal Reserve were not needed to support the economy,
while European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet noted his inflation
concerns from rising food and energy prices. [ID:nFLATEE7LX]	
 But an uprising in the Arab world remained a key supporting factor for gold,
as a conference of 40 governments and international bodies agreed to press on
with a NATO-led aerial bombardment of Libyan forces until Muammar Gaddafi
complied with a U.N. resolution to end violence against civilians. 
 Spot gold hardly moved, standing at $1,416.10 an ounce by 0233 GMT
after hitting an intraday high of $1,419.50 -- still well below a lifetime high
around $1,447 struck last week. It had dropped 0.1 percent on Tuesday as the
talk of monetary tightening prompted selling. 
 ""You've got to ask yourself, how bad is inflation? I think, really, you've
got to get the economy moving before anything happens,"" said Jonathan Barratt,
managing director of Commodity Broking Services in Melbourne.	
 ""I think the market itself will probably get a little bit headstrong if, in
fact, we continue to get concerns in the Middle East. I think gold is really
being played out by what's happening in the Middle East and risk aversion
trade."" 
 Muammar Gaddafi's better armed and organised troops reversed the rapid
westward advance of rebels on Tuesday as world powers meeting in London piled
pressure on the Libyan leader to step down. [ID:nLDE72S033]	
 In Syria, President Bashar al-Assad sought to deflect the greatest challenge
to his 11-year rule by mobilising tens of thousands of Syrians in mass rallies
across the country, while in Yemen, protesters demanded an end to President Ali
Abdullah Saleh's rule. [ID:nLDE72S111] [ID:nLDE72S033]	
 U.S. gold futures for April was barely moved at $1,416.0 an ounce.	
 Japan's Nikkei average made modest gains on Wednesday after the dollar rose
against the yen, but remained tethered in a narrow range for a seventh straight
session amid little progress at the crippled nuclear plant. 
 ""There's a bit of physical buying but we've also seen some selling on the
upside. The Middle East is a tense, but people also think interest rates will go
up in the euro zone, which is why the market is capped,"" said a dealer in Hong
Kong.	
 ""It's a mixed market. We may see support at $1,410, while the upside is
capped at $1,420 and $1,422. We may trade within this range for the rest of the
week. Speculators don't seem to know what to do."" 
 Holdings on the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold
Trust , were unchanged at 1,211.836 tonnes. 
In currencies, the yen wallowed at 10-month lows versus the euro and near a
three-week trough on the dollar on Wednesday, having suffered broad losses
after several major chart support levels were breached. 
 Against the dollar, the euro held near $1.4100 , finding the going
tough after a crack at levels above $1.42 last week was met with selling

 Gold demand to make jewellery, dental fillings and in electronics will jump
by more than 5 percent this year, the biggest rise since 2000, metals research

 By Chris Kelly and Silvia Antonioli
 NEW YORK/LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Copper bounced from a one-week low to
end up on Tuesday, as supportive technicals and a rise in equities helped the
red metal snap a three-day losing streak, albeit in ongoing thin trading.
 Aluminium rose to a 2-1/2-year high as further turmoil in the Middle East
fueled expectations of rising costs for the power-intensive metal.
 Despite copper's positive turnaround, the move lacked conviction as seen by
the drop-off in trading volume over the past few weeks -- a development that
should remain in place until the end of the month and quarter, analysts said.
 ""Volume has been trending toward abysmal. I think everyone is in a holding
pattern,"" said Zachary Oxman, managing director with TrendMax Futures in
Encinitas, California.
 ""You're certainly not going to see people adding risk at this point.
There's not going to be a risk-on trade before the end of the month.""
 London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month copper closed up $55 at $9,590 a
tonne, rebounding from a one-week low at $9,429.50.
 COMEX copper failed to sustain its late gains, easing 0.35 cent to settle
at $4.3465 per lb, after running into some technical through its 20-day moving
average at $4.3269.
 Trading volume remained sluggish, with around 31,700 lots traded by 1:40
p.m. EDT (1840 GMT), nearly 40 percent below the 30-day norm, Thomson Reuters
preliminary data showed.
 With little in the way of fresh fundamental news, copper edged higher in
tandem with U.S. equities, analysts said.
 ""The VIX is lower again ... U.S. stocks are up so we are just bouncing back
up again,"" said analyst Andrey Kryuchenkov of VTB Capital, referring to the
Chicago volatility index, a gauge of market uncertainty.
 ""Until I see substantial inventory drawdowns, China coming back, physical
premiums going up, then I think we sustain this range,"" Kryuchenkov added.
 Copper prices are down about 6 percent from their mid-February records at
$10,190 per tonne in London and $4.6575 per lb in New York, as rising LME
warehouse stocks and slack physical demand, especially from China, threw into
question market-wide forecasts for a production deficit in 2011.
 ""The scale of the refined inventory (in China) casts into doubt the size of
the expected refined deficit in the copper market this year and raises the
prospect of a balanced market, or even a small surplus,"" said Standard Bank
bank in a recent note.
 Chile's Collahuasi, the world's No. 3 copper mine, moved closer to ending
its three-month force majeure on concentrate sales as repairs to its port could
be finished by late April, joint owner Anglo American said on Tuesday.
 Latest data showed LME copper stocks fell by 400 tonnes to 439,500 tonnes.
Despite the withdrawal, inventories have risen over 25 percent since
mid-December, and remain at the highest level in eight months.
 As a result of the inventory builds, copper held a $14.50 contango --
discount for cash over three-month material -- compared with $70 backwardation,
or a premium for cash material, in mid-December.
 ENERGY-INTENSIVE ALUMINIUM
 Aluminium pushed up to its highest level since September 2008, underpinned
by brisk demand growth and soaring energy costs.
 ""(Aluminium) is the only metal that is produced in any quantity in the MENA
(Middle East North Africa) region,"" said analyst Stephen Briggs of BNP
Paribas.
 ""Secondly although Japan doesn't mean anything for aluminium production per
say ... the whole nuclear story in Japan points towards rising energy costs
worldwide, and aluminium is most exposed to that of all of the base metals.""
 For aluminium, power accounts for about 35 percent of total cash costs,
said Briggs.
 Aluminium finished at $2,648 per tonne from a last bid on Monday at
$2,615.
 Oil prices turned positive on Tuesday as Libyan lead Muammar Gaddafi's
troops halted a rebel advance, raising doubts among investors over how quickly
the conflict in OPEC member Libya could be resolved.

 (Releads, adds analyst comment, updates prices)
 By Silvia Antonioli and Melanie Burton
 LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Copper recovered losses on
Tuesday from a one-week low, but small gains were capped as
concerns over Italian banks blunted risk appetite, while
aluminium approached new 2-1/2 year highs.
 Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was at
$9,540 a tonne at 1502 GMT from $9,535 at the close on Monday.
 Earlier it touched a weekly low of $9,429.50 per tonne.
Energy intensive aluminium was edging towards highs last seen in
September 2008 around $2,650 a tonne underpinned by unrest
across oil producing nations which has buoyed oil costs.
 A surprise announcement by Italy's UBI Banca's of a 1
billion euro ($1.4 billion) capital hike battered risk appetite,
dragging down European stocks on speculation that other lenders
could be heading down the same road.
 Global macro concerns have resurfaced and along with
expected interest rate rises, are weighing on the industrial
metals complex, said analyst Stephen Briggs of BNP Paribas.
 ""The eurozone problems are rearing their head again. There's
uncertainty and at the same time a sense that interest rates are
on their way up, globally... the end of Q.E. (quantitative
easing) looks like it's on its way, China is tightening up, all
these things are not great for risk appetite,"" he said.
 The European Banking Authority is soon to publish the
definition of core Tier 1 capital to be used in the current
round of bank stress tests as well as the pass mark for the
banks involved, a regulatory source told Reuters. A new
round of bank stress tests in Europe and speculation that
Commerzbank is going to need more capital could hit the euro and
in turn affect metals.
 Economic releases out of the United States pointed to
protracted softness in the U.S. housing market, while consumer
confidence in March fell from three year highs.
 Aluminium was nosing back towards 2-1/2-year highs.
 ""It is the only metal that is produced in any quantity in
the MENA region. Secondly although Japan doesn't mean anything
for ally production per say...the whole nuclear story in Japan
points towards rising energy costs worldwide, and aluminium is
most exposed to that of all of the base metals,"" he said.
 For aluminium, power accounts for about 35 percent of total
cash costs, said Briggs.
 
 CHINA BUYS
 Elsewhere, consensus is building that Chinese copper
consumers may not return to the market until after the second
quarter, given rising stocks and slack demand signals.
 This is easing concerns over tight supply that have boosted
prices this year.
""The scale of the refined inventory (in China) casts into
doubt the size of the expected refined deficit in the copper
market this year and raises the prospect of a balanced market,
or even a small surplus,"" said Standard Bank bank in a recent
note.
 Chinese consumers generally buy more copper in the second
quarter as construction operations intensify during the northern
hemisphere spring and demand for copper rises.
 Also recent macroeconomic events, including political
turmoil in the Middle East could dampen demand for the metal,
Goldman Sachs said.
 ""We continue to believe that strong copper demand growth
will outpace supply growth, generating a cyclically tight copper
market,"" said Goldman Sachs in a note.
 ""Recent events pose downside risks to demand, potentially
deferring our critically low inventory scenario."" 
 Inventories of copper at the London Metal Exchange were down
by 400 tonnes to 439,500 tonnes, the latest data showed, however
inventories have climbed over 25 percent since mid-December.
 Copper was in a $14.50 contango -- discount for cash over
three-month material -- compared with $70 backwardation, or a

 NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - Gold fell for a fourth
consecutive session on Tuesday as signs of central banks'
monetary tightening prompted selling, but the metal was
underpinned by credit downgrades in Portugal and Greece and
disappointing U.S. consumer confidence.
 Bullion's failure to capitalize on new record highs on
recent strong volume suggested some investors are skeptical
when central banks are about to rein in money supply to prevent
inflation.
 ""In the short term, any rhetoric on money tightening could
certainly cause some anxiety, resulting in gold prices
correcting a bit, but I continue to see a significant
underlying bid in gold as dips are being bought in the physical
market,"" said James Dailey, portfolio manager of the TEAM Asset
Strategy Fund. 
 Spot gold  dropped 0.1 percent to $1,417.46 an ounce
by 3:36 p.m. EDT (1936 GMT), having earlier fallen as low as
$1,410.85. U.S. gold futures for April delivery  settled
down 0.3 percent at $1,416.20.
 COMEX gold futures were one of the most actively trading
commodity markets, with volume topped 250,000 lots, one of the
heaviest trading days year to date.
 Dailey said that gold's failure to rise further on strong
volume is indicative of a significant amount of skepticism and
bearishness toward the metal in a healthy bull market.
 Still, growing expectations U.S. and euro zone monetary
policy may tighten are weighing on gold prices, after Western
air strikes on Libya and political unrest across the Middle
East and North Africa pushed gold to a record $1,447.40 an
ounce last week.
 ""I think the market is beginning to believe that there will
be no QE3,"" said Saxo Bank senior manager Ole Hansen. ""We have
geopolitical unrest, rising inflation, weaker dollar and all of
these have failed to make gold fly like last year.""
 St. Louis Federal Reserve chief James Bullard urged the Fed
to begin reversing its campaign of monetary easing, saying it
could trim its $600 billion bond-buying program by $100
billion, while ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet said euro zone's
inflation rate was ""durably"" above the bank's target.
[ID:nLDE72S0RJ]
 Last November, the Fed initiated a $600 billion bond buying
program -- dubbed QE2 because it is the second round of
quantitative easing -- which is scheduled to end in June. Gold
has been a major beneficiary since the Fed has kept short-term
rates near zero since December 2008.
 Also supporting gold was signs of a loss in momentum in the
U.S. economy, with consumer confidence fell in March as
households worried about inflation. In addition, Standard &
Poor's downgraded Greece and Portugal. [ID:nLDE72S209]
[ID:nLDE72S1LY]
 RATE HIKES EYED
 The prospect of tightening monetary policy is casting a
shadow over the gold outlook. Gold tends to benefit from low
real interest rates, as they reduce the opportunity cost of
holding non-interest bearing bullion.
 ""We expect that the strengthening U.S. economy combined
with the end of quantitative easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve
will lead to gradually rising U.S. real interest rates in
2011,"" said Goldman Sachs in a report on Tuesday.
 Gold demand to make jewelry, dental fillings and in
electronics will jump by more than 5 percent this year, the
biggest rise since 2000, metals research and consultant CPM
Group said on Tuesday. [ID:nN29295604]

* China offers promise of guaranteed oil demand
* United States, Saudi both keen to contain Shi'ite unrest
 
By Ulf Laessing and Barbara Lewis
RIYADH/DUBAI, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Violent uprisings across the Middle East and China's rise as the world's fastest growing oil market have shaken an oil-for-security bond between the United States and Saudi Arabia that has lasted for decades.
As western oil consumption stagnates, China is expected to take over the United States' role as the world's biggest oil user.
China is already Saudi Arabia's biggest customer and the kingdom is seen as keen to diversify its political and economic ties.
But while U.S. military might has long offered the capability to protect Saudi Arabia's vast energy resources, links between the leading oil exporter and China are chiefly commercial.
More than ever, as a revolutionary tide has swept away entrenched, autocratic leaders and rocked the oil-producing Middle East to its core, Saudi Arabia could need powerful back-up.
""The Chinese focus on economic interests and want regional stability, but are willing to do very little to ensure it,"" said Barak Barfi, a research fellow, currently based in Bahrain, with the New America Foundation.
""Abandoning the U.S. is not on the cards.""
Others share his view.
""China is behaving as a mercantilist as it always does. China's interest in the Middle East is of a different quality. The issue is China is not seen as intervening in Middle Eastern affairs,"" said John Kuzmik, a partner and China specialist at Baker Botts international law firm.
Talks in the Saudi capital on Tuesday bringing together oil producers and consumers were attended by U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary Daniel Poneman.
China was also represented by senior officials rather than the minister himself and the delegation has so far kept a low profile.
Beyond the conference meeting rooms, however, China's growing business ties are reflected in the number of Chinese restaurants that have sprung up across the Saudi capital.
As the kingdom locks in future oil demand through refinery joint ventures in China, China has secured big contracts in Saudi Arabia. A Chinese firm has built a light rail system to ferry pilgrims from Mecca to holy sites.
 
FRICTION
Amicable, Sino-Saudi business ties contrast with mounting friction between Saudi and the United States.
In an unusual instance of open criticism, Saudi Arabia on Monday expressed regret, according to its official news agency, that the United States has supported Israel by using its veto against a draft U.N. Security Council resolution.
Analysts also say the Saudi perception is the United States abandoned Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who was a crucial Arab ally for both Saudi Arabia and the United States to counter the regional influence of Shi'ite Iran.
""One has to deeply look at Saudi Arabia's systemic role in light of what just happened in Egypt,"" said John Sfakianakis, chief economist at Banque Saudi Fransi in Riyadh.
Even before this year's events, analysts said there were signs that U.S.-Saudi ties were frayed.
Trust was badly shaken by the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, in which 15 of the 19 suicide hijackers were Saudi.
At the same time, the often-stated U.S. desire to reduce its dependency on foreign oil has played badly to Saudi Arabia's domestic audience as the kingdom spends billions on maintaining spare oil capacity that it can add to the oil market to moderate prices for consumers in times of shortage or crisis.
Saudi's roughly 4 million barrels per day (bpd) of spare capacity could easily make up for the lost production of say Libya, whose leader Muammar Gaddafi faces a mounting revolt against his four decades in power.
The much greater fear for oil markets is the revolutionary ferment could spread to Saudi Arabia, where the minority Shi'ite population, based mainly in the oil-producing Eastern Province, has staged a small protest.
The province is near Bahrain, where protestors are trying to topple its Sunni leadership.
For now, Bahrain and its ruling al-Khalifa family is for both Saudi Arabia and the United States -- which bases its Fifth Fleet in Manama -- a remaining bulwark against Shi'ite Iran."

 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Gold eased on Thursday, pulling
back from the previous session's one-week highs, as a series of
successful euro zone bond auctions erased some safe-haven demand
for the metal, although consumer demand remained fairly buoyant.
 Palladium nudged at 10-year highs above $800 an ounce,
having risen by 8 percent so far this week, driven by
expectations of faster global growth, stable investment demand
and optimism stemming from the Detroit auto show.
 Debt sales by some of the euro zone's most economically
fragile members such as Portugal and Spain have met with better
demand from bond investors and tempered some of the concern that
Lisbon and possibly even Madrid may need to tap into an
international rescue fund for cash. [ID:nLDE70C0QB]
 Against this backdrop, spot gold  fell for the first
time following three straight days of gains to $1,379.00 an
ounce, showing a 0.6 percent decline on the day, by 1212 GMT.
 U.S. gold futures for February delivery  were down 0.4
percent at $1,379.60.
 ""Risk aversion is coming down further, so this is leading to
a decline in gold prices, especially because of the need for a
safe haven is not that strong at the moment,"" said Commerzbank
analyst Daniel Briesemann.
 ""But this should be short-lived because in the case of
Portugal for example, it's quite significant refinancing costs
are still of concern,"" he said.
 
 EURO EDGES UP
 The euro hit one-month highs against the Swiss franc
 and edged up against the dollar, lifted by speculation
that measures to control the euro zone debt crisis may be on
their way.
 The single European currency was supported by German Finance
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble who said on Wednesday that euro zone
countries were working on a ""comprehensive package"", which maybe
agreed by February or March, to solve the bloc's debt crisis.
[FRX/]
 Reflecting the retrenchment in investment demand for gold,
holdings of gold in the world's largest gold exchange-traded
fund, the SPDR Gold Trust , were unchanged around their
lowest since June, while ETF Securities' London-listed gold fund
saw redemptions on Wednesday. [GOL/SPDR]
 ""The bounce gold has had in the past few days seems to be
fizzling out as sovereign debt concerns take a back seat. With
so many gold bulls already heavily invested, traders are
beginning to ask where the next wave of buying is going to come
from?"" wrote Manoj Ladwa, a senior trader at ETX Capital.
 In the physical market, dealers noted purchases from main
consumer India as well as China, which could offer support for
cash gold. Premiums for gold bars were at two-year highs in
Singapore and Hong Kong. 
 ""There are talks the Indian government is looking to
increase tax on gold imports, so locals are looking to stock up
beforehand. They are moving into coins and gold bars,"" said a
dealer in Singapore.
 ""Local demand from China is firm before the Lunar New Year
and buying interest from Turkey is also strong.""
 Gold has risen by nearly 1 percent this week, thanks to the
jitters over the euro zone's debt problems, but remains nearly
3.5 percent below the record $1,430.95 struck in December.
 Platinum and palladium have found renewed favour among
investors recently, as holdings of metal in the larger ETFs
remain near record levels, while optimism grows over the outlook
for the auto market this year, a key source of demand for both
metals.
 Palladium is trading around its highest since March 2001,
above $800 an ounce.
 French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen  said on
Thursday it expects markets in China and Latin America to rise
this year after growth outside Europe helped its own 2010
vehicle sales grow 13 percent to a record. [ID:nLDE70C0CQ]
 Palladium, which is consumed primarily by gasoline-powered
vehicles used largely in North America and emerging economies,
virtually doubled in price last year as investors prepared for
car markets in countries like China, Brazil and India to grow.
 The spot price  was last flat at $807.47 an ounce,
having hit a 10-year high of $814.00 overnight.
 Platinum  meanwhile eased 0.4 percent to $1,791.5,
still near its highest since early November.
 Silver  fell 1.2 percent to $29.29 an ounce, echoing
the softness in the gold price, while the gold/silver ratio
ticked up to 47.3 from 46.7 the day before.

 LONDON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Gold eased in Europe on Wednesday
as the dollar rose broadly, with the euro coming under selling
pressure as the ratings agency Moody's put Spain's AA1 rating on
review for a possible downgrade.
 Underlying demand for the metal as a haven from risk was,
however, preventing a larger correction, analysts said.
 Spot gold  was bid at $1,393.05 an ounce at 1258 GMT,
against $1,395.61 late in New York on Tuesday. U.S. gold futures
for February delivery  fell $10.50 an ounce to $1,393.80.
 ""Clearly the downside is well supported by ongoing
uncertainties about debt, with Moody's (reviewing) some European
ratings outlooks, on Spain and Belgium and so on,"" said Credit
Agricole analyst Robin Bhar.
 ""In the short term that will be seen as a negative because
it does harm the euro, but in the long term it has got to be a
supportive factor, particularly if those concerns about fiscal
deficits focus on the United States.""
 Moody's said on Wednesday it had put Spain on review for a
possible downgrade because of its high funding needs and doubts
about its banking sector and regional finances. It cut its
outlook for Belgian debt to negative on Tuesday. [ID:nL3E6NF0D8]
 This pressured the euro down 0.2 percent against the dollar
, 0.1 percent versus the Japanese yen  and to
record lows against the Swiss franc .

zone economies, click on: http://r.reuters.com/get52k

 The Moody's news fuelled concern over the scale of some euro
zone countries' debt, after Greece and Ireland struggled with
their finances earlier this year. This helped drive gold to a
record $1,430.95 an ounce earlier this month.
 
 U.S. DEFICIT EYED
 Some budget experts also fear the United States will face a
Greece-style debt crisis over the coming decade if it does not
bring down budget deficits, which hit 9.9 percent of GDP in
fiscal 2009.
 ""The unease generated by ever-growing budget deficits is
negative for the U.S. dollar and supportive of gold,"" HSBC said
in a note. ""A lack of confidence in the government's willingness
to cut the deficit is an important component in the gold rally.""
 Gold buying in main consumer India slowed on Wednesday as
the weak rupee kept prices of the precious metal relatively high
in local terms. [ID:nSGE6BE049]
 Meanwhile the world's largest gold exchange-traded fund, the
SPDR Gold Trust , said its holdings fell by just over 3
tonnes on Tuesday. [GOL/SPDR]
 However, the iShares Silver Trust , the world's largest
silver-backed ETF, said its holdings hit a record high at
10,964.14 tonnes on Dec. 14. [ID:nL3E6NE20U]
 ""Given our positive outlook for gold we expect silver to
enjoy continued investor demand in 2011,"" UBS said in a note.
""But silver is very volatile, and this will deter some
investors. We see silver averaging $33.00 in 2011.""
 Spot silver  was bid at $29.21 an ounce against
$29.40, platinum  was at $1,696.24 an ounce against
$1,704.24, and palladium  at $745.58 against $757.97.
 The amount of palladium held to back the New York-listed
ETFS Physical Palladium exchange-traded product rose 1.4 percent
to a record high of 1.119 million ounces on Tuesday, according
to the U.S. arm of ETF Securities, which manages the product.
 Holdings of the ETFS Physical Platinum ETP also held at a

 By Chris Kelly and Melanie Burton
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Copper ended down after hitting its
lowest in a week on Tuesday as geopolitical tension added to concerns over
Europe's debt crisis, driving investment money into safer-havens such as gold
and the dollar.
 An artillery exchange in the Korean peninsula exacerbated the risk-aversion
ruling financial markets in recent weeks.
 ""I think the big question on the markets' mind, and why you're seeing such
volatility across the board, is people wondering if this is a one-time incident
or an opening salvo of more to come,"" Zachary Oxman, managing director with
TrendMax Futures in Encinitas, California, said of the Korean incident.
 ""That's why you're seeing gold up a percent and why you're seeing the
dollar spike ... all in addition to the European debt worries already out
there.""
 On the London Metal Exchange (LME), benchmark copper was last bid at
$8,140/$8,145 a tonne against Monday's $8,290.
 Earlier, it fell to $8,050 a tonne, its lowest since Nov. 17, and 10
percent below its record high of $8,966 a tonne hit on Nov. 11.
 COMEX copper for December delivery shed 4.90 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
settle at $3.7025, down over 9 percent from a more than two-year peak at
$4.0835 on Nov. 11.
 ""We could see this short dollar, long commodity trade rotate and start to
see strong dollar, weak commodities, short euro trade starting all over again,""
Oxman said.
 A second straight day of gains in the U.S. dollar continued to knock the
wind out of industrial metals.
 The currency received an extra boost against the euro after German
Chancellor Angela Merkel said Ireland's crisis was different to Greece's, but
just as worrying and the euro was in an ""exceptionally serious"" situation.
 ""It's just a big, cyclical rotation. It's like we have this gigantic set of
dominoes set up, and we're just waiting for one country to push that first
domino over ... it's sitting at a 45 degree angle right now,"" Oxman said.
 Even upbeat growth data in the United States and the 16-country euro zone
failed to shield against the bearish brunt of seller momentum.
 Investors also fretted about the demand outlook in China. The market
expects the world's top consumer of base metals to tighten monetary policy
further, locking up cash.
 Data this week showed copper imports in China fell almost a third in
October, but analysts said the monthly decline was driven by supply rather than
demand.
 Analysts, however, maintained confidence in Chinese demand.
 ""No one in China is worried about rate hikes slowing down demand for
metal,"" Societe Generale analyst David Wilson said.
 ""Speaking to copper producers, they all have full order books. Even the
tier-four cities are on a huge building spree and it's not slowing down.""
 TIGHTENING MARKET
 Signs have emerged of a tightening copper market next month as LME
inventories have dropped steadily since the start of the year, with metal for
delivery on Dec. 15 trading at ""pretty brutal"" premiums over those for one week
later, a trader said.
 Supply has been tightening noticeably with cash copper flipping into a
premium against the benchmark three-month contract some two weeks ago. The
premium has risen above $30.5 a tonne from a $2.5 discount in early November.
 On the supply side, a vast majority of workers at the world's No. 3 copper
mine, Collahuasi, vowed to ignore management's latest wage offer that expires
on Tuesday, and push for the mine to reopen contract talks to end a 19-day-old
strike.
 Across other metals, aluminum closed down $33 at $2,255 a tonne, while
nickel ended unchanged at $21,600 a tonne.
 Zinc shed $53 to close at $2,085 a tonne, and lead fell as low as $2,164,
its lowest in about a week, as funds responded to a worsening chart picture. It
closed down $63.50 at $2,186.50 a tonne.
 Tin approached a two-month low at $23,815 a tonne, before ending down $400
at $23,900.

 By Amanda Cooper and Elizabeth Fullerton
 LONDON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Gold neared two-week highs on
Tuesday as an artillery clash between North and South Korea and
Europe's debt crisis prompted safe haven buying and eroded the
metal's traditional inverse link with the U.S. dollar.
The U.S. currency reaped the benefit from the euro's decline,
rising by over 1 percent against a basket of major currencies
<.DXY>, while gold  rose by as much as 1 percent earlier
in the day to a session high of $1,379.95, before retreating to
show a 0.7 percent gain on the day at $1,375.00.
 U.S. gold futures  rose some 1 percent to $1,372.7.
 Gold's negative correlation to the dollar softened for the
first time since last Thursday, echoing the events of May this
year, when Greece asked for financial aid and bullion's relation
to gold turned strongly positive as investors shed their
holdings of euros.
 Natixis analyst Nic Brown felt that any boost for gold from
events in Korea and even in the European Union were likely to
play second fiddle to bigger picture issues like the dollar and
global measures against inflation.
 ""I'm not sure the gold market is being pushed around by
European credit concerns in the same way that it was earlier in
the year,"" he said.
 ""It feels to me at the minute that it is more about events
in the U.S. - quantitative easing, the strength of the dollar
and also rising inflation in some of the devleoping countries
around the world.""
 Events on the Korean peninsula and Europe triggered a flight
to quality by investors, as reflected by a rise in government
bond prices and a pickup in the Swiss franc -- another perceived
safe-haven asset -- against the euro . 
 
 KOREAS IN FOCUS
 North Korea fired scores of artillery shells at a South
Korean island on Tuesday, killing two soldiers in a sharp
escalation of hostilities between the two nations. [nTOE6AM01Q] 
 In Europe, the euro  came under pressure as fears grew
that Ireland's debt crisis could spread to other weaker members
of the euro zone such as Portugal and Spain and amid signs the
Irish government will have trouble passing a crucial austerity
budget.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday Ireland's
crisis was different to Greece's but just as worrying and the
euro was in an ""exceptionally serious"" situation.
 Gold priced in euros  was at 1,025.89 euros an
ounce, up over 2 percent on the day, having broken through the
1,000-euro mark on Monday for the first time in a week.
 Traders in London also cited strong buying of gold futures
related to the expiry of COMEX December options on Tuesday.
 ""There were some big strikes around $1,370 and that meant
that up until 2.30 p.m. there was plenty of selling in the
market around those levels, so that was putting a bit of a cap
on it,"" one trader at a European bank said.
 ""We've now gone through that option expiry, it looks like
the selling's disappeared and we could have a chance to move
higher this afternoon,"" the trader added.
 Until this week, gold has struggled to overcome the strength
in the U.S. dollar, especially following upbeat manufacturing
and jobless data last week that suggested the economy was
recovering faster than expected.
 Speculators in New York have cut their exposure to gold
futures by 4 million ounces in the last month and holdings of
gold in the world's largest bullion-backed exchange-traded fund,
the SPDR Gold Trust , have fallen by 1.5 percent.

 By Chris Kelly and Rebekah Curtis
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Copper ended lower on Monday after a
slide in Chinese imports reinforced concerns over the country's economy-cooling
efforts while fears of euro zone debt contagion pushed the dollar up on
safe-haven buying.
 The industrial metal emerged as one of the worst performers in the broader
commodities complex, ending near session lows after data showed refined copper
imports by China, the top consumer of the metal, fell nearly a third in
October.
 ""This is all concern about tighter monetary policy in China,"" Bart Melek,
global commodity strategist with BMO Nesbitt Burns in Toronto, said of the red
metal's start to the week.
 ""The concern is, do the Chinese implement some sort of price control plan
to keep these commodity prices from moving any higher,"" he said.
 On the London Metal Exchange (LME), copper for three-months delivery ended
down $114 at $8,290 a tonne, near the bottom of its $8,210 to $8,516.75 range.
 COMEX copper for December delivery sank 8.20 cents, or 2.1 percent, to
settle at $3.7515 per lb, also near its session low at $3.7260.
 COMEX copper volumes remained brisk despite the onset of a
holiday-shortened week. The total stood at 51,396 lots by 1:59 p.m. EST (1859
GMT), nearly 9 percent above the 30-day average near 47,300 lots, Thomson
Reuters preliminary data showed.
 New York commodity markets will be shut on Thursday for the U.S.
Thanksgiving Day holiday. Trading will resume on Friday.
 Copper held firm overnight, tracking upside momentum in the euro, after the
European Union and International Monetary Fund agreed to a three-year bailout
plan for debt-strapped Ireland.
 But as that initial optimism faded, so did the metal's gains, as concerns
about possible contagion to other highly indebted states in the 16-country euro
zone grew and Chinese demand worries persisted.
 ""The Ireland situation is affecting risk appetite but there are other
things impacting copper -- worries about a slowdown in China, with the China
copper imports being relatively low in the most recent data,"" Standard
Chartered analyst Dan Smith said.
 Still, signs of Asian demand were well and strong.
 The world's top copper producer, Chile's Codelco, upped annual physical
copper premiums for Chinese buyers by 35 percent, to $115 a tonne in 2011.
 ETPS PRICED IN
 Signs have emerged that prospective exchange-traded products (ETPs) or
funds (ETFs) for LME metals, like aluminum, are being priced in to metals
markets, even though they have not yet been approved, Standard Bank said.
 ""While some of the tightness may be related to the impact of warehousing
deals, the recent movement suggests that fears over the impact of ETFs on metal
availability may also be manifesting itself in the aluminum spreads,"" Standard
Bank analyst Leon Westgate said in an note.
 The premium on LME aluminum for delivery in 27 months has narrowed against
the benchmark three-months contract to $90 from around $120 last week, LME data
shows.
 Elsewhere, LME warehouse copper stocks kept trending lower, down 825 tonnes
to 359,000 tonnes, the lowest in over a year.
 Concern about supplies in the near term have pushed copper into a $23.5 a
tonne backwardation -- a premium for cash material over the three-month
contract -- compared with a discount of $20 a tonne at the end of October.
 Among other metals, aluminum ended up $24 at $2,288 a tonne, while zinc
shed $22 to close at $2,138 a tonne. Lead ended down $27 at $2,250 a tonne. Tin
slumped $700 to end at $24,300 a tonne and nickel fell $250 to $21,600 a
tonne.

 SINGAPORE, Nov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures rose more
than 2 percent on Monday as bargain hunters stepped into the
market following Friday's slump amid talk that China bought
cargoes of Argentine corn.
 Wheat rose 0.7 percent, with support stemming from Iraq's
purchase of U.S. wheat in a tender, while soybeans were little
changed to trade near two-week lows.
""The rebound is partly due to talk that China is buying corn
and some South American trade going on in that market,"" said
Garry Booth, a traderwith MF Global Australia. ""We also had the
Iraqi wheat tender on Friday where Australia and U.S. secured
more business.""
 Chicago Board of Trade December corn rose 2.1 percent to
$5.45 a bushel by 0442 GMT and December wheat rose quarter of a
cent to $12.69-¼ a bushel.
 Argentina's farm minister said on Friday it was in talks
with China over exporting corn to the Asian country, which does
not buy Argentine corn because of curbs on genetically modified
varieties.
 China is set to expand its reliance on corn imports in the
coming year, a Reuters poll of 10 forecasters showed last
month, although there is little consensus on the overall
balance of supply and demand.
 In the wheat market, which has been buoyed by dry weather
in key U.S. winter crop areas, demand from Iraq provided
support.
 Iraq's state grain board has bought 250,000 tonnes of wheat
from the United States, Australia and Ukraine in its latest
purchase tender, European traders said on Friday. The purchase
involved 100,000 tonnes from the U.S. at $399.80 a tonne c&f,
100,000 tonnes from Australia at $384.60 a tonne c&f and 50,000
tonnes from Ukraine at $370 c&f, traders said.
 Another bullish factor for the wheat market was the weather
in Australia, typically the world's fourth largest exporter.
Australia's 2010/11 wheat harvest is being slowed by continuing
rain across eastern states, raising concerns over crop
quality,
analysts and traders said on Monday.
 Corn and wheat markets steadied as investor demand for
riskier assets made a tentative comeback but did not entirely
banish the fears of a possible move by Beijing to tighten
liquidity that had upset markets last week.
 On Friday, corn and soybeans fell by the daily trading
limits as investors liquidated their positions in markets
ranging from crude oil to gold to sugar on prospects of China,
the world's No. 2 economy, raising interest rates.
 China should move to a more prudent monetary policy and
guard against risks from loose money conditions used to counter
the global financial crisis, a central bank researcher said in
remarks published on Monday.
 Separately, an official newspaper reported on Sunday that
China's four biggest state banks had used up their full-year
credit quotas for property developers and would stop extending
new loans to them for the rest of the year.

 By Amanda Cooper
 LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Gold hit record highs for a fourth
day in a row on Tuesday, as fresh concern over the debt burdens
of several euro zone member countries prompted safe-haven
buying, while palladium rallied for a fifth day.
 Silver  touched $28.90 an ounce, the highest since
March 1980, palladium  saw $732.50 an ounce, its highest
since April 2001. Platinum  hit $1,795.50, its highest
since July 2008. 
 Spot gold  hit $1,422.30 a troy ounce and was bid at
$1,419.50 an ounce at 1540 GMT from $1,409.09 late in New York
on Monday. U.S. gold futures  also hit a record $1,422.10
an ounce.
 ""European investors are worried about the euro, real rates
are very low and set to stay low for a long time, so the
opportunity cost of investing in gold is tiny,"" said Citi
analyst David Thurtell. ""Lots of good reasons to buy it and not
many to sell it,"" he added.
 The premium investors demand to hold Irish and Portuguese
government debt shot to record highs, driven by concern about
funding and potential default, which in turn pushed the euro
down against the yen  and tempered its gains versus the
U.S. dollar. [GVD/EUR] [FRX/]
 ""It just seems that ... with worries about peripheral
European countries like Ireland, there's a little bit of a
safe-haven factor there,"" Thurtell said.

 Gold priced in euros  has rallied by over 7
percent in the last five trading days, rising to its highest
since late June this year.
 
 INFLATION FEARS
 ""We have a combination: inflation fears, currency market
uncertainty, fears about the financial strength of some
countries,"" said Alexander Zumpfe of Heraeus Metals.
 Zumpfe said remarks by World Bank President Robert Zoellick
that leading economies should consider readopting a modified
gold standard, had also helped reignite interest in the precious
metal. [ID:nSGE6A70A7]
 Worries about price pressures were reinforced last week by
the U.S. Federal Reserve, which announced further monetary
policy easing to help boost economic growth in the world's
largest economy, the United States.
 News that the Fed would buy back $600 billion of U.S.
government bonds initially weakened the dollar and propelled
commodity prices higher, particularly gold, which has gained
nearly 30 percent this year so far.
 Investor demand, which had slackened recently, picked up, as
reflected by the first inflow into the SPDR Gold Trust ,
the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, since Oct.
13. [GOL/SPDR]
 Also on the radar is this week's G20 summit. Officials from
Germany, Brazil, China and South Africa are among those
expressing concern that the Fed's policy could weaken the dollar
and drive up commodity prices. [ID:nSGE6A801L]
 If the G20 fails to defuse global tensions, it may heighten
investor concerns that policymakers are drifting further apart,
leaving the world economy vulnerable.
 ""There is a lot of uncertainty ahead of the G20 meeting. If
there are no surprises we may see a correction afterwards,"" said
David Wilson, analyst at Societe Generale.
 ""Gold is using any excuse to go higher.""
 Traders think the target to this rally is $1,475 an ounce.
""Beyond that $1,500 is only a short ride,"" one trader said,
adding high seasonal physical demand was another factor behind
the rise in precious metal prices.
 Palladium rose by almost 3 percent on the day to $726.22 an
ounce, marking its fifth consecutive daily rally and putting it
on track for a ninth weekly increase. 
 Palladium has risen by almost 80 percent so far this year,
fuelled by demand from investors who are keen to tap into the
metal's exposure to China, where it is used in the country's
booming, gasoline-powered auto sector in autocatalysts.
 Spot silver was bid at $28.77 an ounce from $27.69 late in
New York on Monday and palladium was at $725.50 from $705.22.
 Platinum was bid at $1,789.00 an ounce compared with
$1,771.50 late in New York on Monday.

 SINGAPORE, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Chicago soybean futures rose
more than 1 percent on Thursday, while wheat gained 0.7 percent
following a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to inject
liquidity into financial markets by buying bonds.
 The Fed launched a fresh effort to support a struggling
U.S. economy on Wednesday, committing to buy $600 billion in
government bonds despite concerns the programme could do more
harm than good.
 ""We have had a higher start across the commodity complex,
soybean, corn and wheat have all bounced following the Fed QE
announcement which is ultimately seen as bearish for the U.S.
dollar,"" said Luke Mathews, a commodity strategist at
Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
 Chicago Board of Trade soybeans for November delivery added
1.08 percent to $12.40-¾ a bushel by 0711 GMT and December
wheat rose 0.8 percent to $6.95-½ per bushel.
 CBOT December corn was up 0.4 percent to $5.83-½ per
bushel.
 The dollar held near a 10-month low on the euro and a
28-year low on the Australian dollar while edging back towards
a record low on the yen on Thursday after a Federal Reserve
decision to buy more U.S. government debt.
 The attention in Chicago grain markets is turning to a U.S.
Department of Agriculture report on global demand/supply of
agricultural products due to be released on Tuesday.
 ""The grain markets are now going to move on to focus on the
USDA crop report,"" said Mathews.
 ""The outside markets will continue to be important but
there is going to be more and more market talk about potential
supply downgrades in the United States, particularly with
respect to the corn crop.""
 Analysts expect the USDA to further lower its U.S. corn
crop production estimate after cutting its forecast by 4
percent last month after late summer heat reduced yields.
 The USDA's estimate of the U.S. soybeans harvest could also
be cut further after a 2 percent drop in October due to a hot
end to summer.
 Analytical firm Informa Economics projected the 2010 U.S.
corn crop at 12.592 billion bushels, with an average yield of
155.0 bushels per acre. This compares with Informa's previous
forecast of 12.9 billion bushels for corn.
 Informa raised its U.S. 2010 soybean production forecast
slightly to 3.425 billion bushels, reflecting an average yield
of 44.6 bpa.
 Worries about dry weather in the U.S. wheat belt had added
momentum to a grains complex already shaken this year by a
severe drought in Russia that prompted an export embargo there.
But the latest forecasts show rain next week in Kansas, the top
U.S. wheat state.
