On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for delivery in May traded at $103.40 a barrel, down 0.20%, after hitting an overnight session low of $102.05 a barrel and a high of $103.43 a barrel.
Brent crude on ICE Futures Europe added 31 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $107.98 a barrel on Wednesday.
Geopolitical tensions continued to boost oil prices as Ukraine's government stood toe-to-toe with pro-Russian demonstrations in the east of the country.
Russia has warned that use of force against the separatists could drag the country into civil war, and saber-rattling sent oil prices rising on concerns tensions could affect Russian oil shipments.
Russia has downplayed concerns in the Europe and in the U.S. that its troops amassed along the Ukraine border may destabilize the region, while the U.S. insists Russian agents are stirring up trouble in pro-Moscow portions of eastern Ukraine.
Geopolitical concerns offset a bearish U.S. inventory report.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that U.S. crude oil inventories rose by 4.03 million barrels in the week ended April 4, surpassing expectations for a build of 1.3 million barrels.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 384.1 million barrels as of last week.
The EIA said total motor gasoline inventories decreased by 5.18 million barrels, compared to forecasts for a decline of 0.72 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles increased by 0.23 million barrels.
The report came one day after the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. oil inventories rose by 7.1 million barrels last week, well above expectations for an increase of 2.5 million barrels.
Investors were also tracking developments in Libya after government officials and rebels reached an agreement over the weekend to re-open the Zueitina and Hariga ports, which normally export a combined total of 200,000 barrels a day, mostly to Europe."

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for June delivery traded at $1,311.10 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, up 0.15%, up from a session low of $1,301.20 and off a high of $1,315.40.
The June contract settled up 0.83% at $1,309.10 on Friday.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,265.00 a troy ounce, the low from Feb. 10, and resistance at $1,343.00, the high from March 21.
The Federal Reserve Board of Governors unanimously voted to scrap its 6.5% threshold at which interest rates would rise once the unemployment rate hits 6.5%.
In the past, the Fed had indicated rates could rise when the unemployment rate hits or approaches 6.5% provided that figure accompanied a 2.5% inflation rate.
Today, the headline unemployment rate stands at 6.7%, not far from the previous threshold, though inflation remains well below 2.5%, prompting the Federal Reserve to do away with its rate-hike target.
""Participants agreed that the existing forward guidance, with its reference to a 6.5% threshold for the unemployment rate, was becoming outdated as the unemployment rate continued its expected gradual decline,"" the minutes read.
""Most participants felt that the quantitative thresholds had been very useful in communicating policy intentions when employment was far from mandate-consistent levels, but, with the economy having moved appreciably closer to maximum employment, the forward guidance should emphasize that the Committee is focusing more on a broader set of economic indicators.""
Gold prices rose on the news while the dollar softened, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen stating that policy must remain accommodative for some time to come, and the March policy meeting minutes reflected that stance.
Meanwhile, silver for May delivery was down 0.94% at US$19.868 a troy ounce, while copper futures for May delivery were down 0.29% at US$3.042 a pound.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in May traded at $4.585 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, up 1.11%. The commodity hit session high of $4.499 and a low of $4.587.
The May contract settled up 1.30% on Tuesday to end at $4.534 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.22 per million British thermal units, the low from April 2, and resistance at $4.732, the high from March 10.
Forecasts for below-normal temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast over the next six to 10 days sent natural gas prices rising, as the cold snap should hike demand for heating in homes and offices in the area.
Gains were limited, however, as concerns an eventual return of mild temperatures typical of this time of year will curb demand for both heating and air conditioning.
Elsewhere, supply data remained in focus.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration was set to release its storage data for the week ended April 4 on Thursday, with many analysts expecting the report to show the first build in inventories since November.
Severely cold weather over this past winter saw natural gas stockpiles fall to 11-year lows, sparking concerns that producers may not be able to refill inventories before the next heating season.
Producers typically replenish inventories between April and October, when demand is lower.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
Last week’s government supply data showed that natural gas storage in the U.S. fell by 74 billion cubic feet, much more than the five-year average drop of 8 billion cubic feet for this time of year.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 822 billion cubic feet, the lowest for this time of year since 2003.

4,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 09, 2014 12:30PM ET</span>",EU Russian Gas Imports May Plunge 25% By 2020,"By Reuters - Europe is stitching together a patchwork of measures that could reduce its natural gas imports from Russia by over a quarter by the end of the decade as a result of the Ukraine crisis, halting Moscow's tightening grip over the region's energy.
Russia's seizure of Ukraine's Crimea region has chilled political relations between Russia and theEuropean Union, prompting governments across the bloc to look at ways to cut demand, find alternative supplies and switch to other fuel sources such as coal and renewables.
Reuters calculations suggest these steps could slash imports from Russia by around 45 billion cubic meters (bcm) by 2020, worth $18 billion a year, equivalent to a quarter of what Russia currently supplies.
Past hopes of loosening Moscow's grip have been dashed, not helped by Germany's decision to give up on nuclear power, with Russia's share of EU supplies rising 10 percentage points to over a third since 2010, and before the current crisis Russia's gas share in Europe was expected to remain stable at current levels.
The crisis in Ukraine has shaken policymakers awake across Europe's capitals, and several emergency meetings over energy security have been held in the past weeks.
""We are serious about reducing our energy dependency ... We need a new way to do energy business,"" said European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, who represents EU governments in Brussels.
At the forefront of these plans are Germany and Italy, Russia's biggest gas clients in the EU, but also Poland.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in late March that ""energy policy will have to be newly considered"".
Germany is Europe's biggest gas user and Russia's most important customer, using over 80 bcm of gas a year and meeting around a third of its demand through imports from Gazprom, a share that has steadily risen over the past 20 years.

5,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 09, 2014 11:30AM ET</span>","For The Sake Of Oil, China Enters South Sudan Fray","By Jacey Fortin - GAMBELA, Ethiopia -- Rebel fighters in South Sudan have set their sights on a new target: oil. Their tactics are putting the interests of the world's second-largest economy at risk.
All of the crude currently flowing from South Sudan is produced in government-held territory in Upper Nile State, and opposition leader Riek Machar says his fighters are mobilizing to occupy the Paloch oil fields there. A successful offensive would not only curtail revenues for South Sudan's government; it would also threaten China's stake in crude production.
That's why China is pursuing a new strategy in South Sudan's conflict. Beijing is typically known for its non-interventionist policies in Africa, where Chinese companies invest copiously and without much concern for who is in power. But even before the rebels set their sights on Paloch, China had been partnering with Western and African mediators in an attempt to bring peace to the world's youngest country, where the two largest ethnic groups have been pitted against each other in an increasingly bloody showdown.
Machar says that a rebel push towards the Paloch oil fields is long overdue; he objects to President Salva Kiir using those oil revenues to fund government troops. Machar, who served as vice president until his sacking in July, wass accused of plotting a coup against Kiir, late las year. He fled the capital Juba in December, and has since become the nominal leader of the rebellion.
The conflict has deep roots; South Sudan's ruling party, the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, or SPLM, and its army, the SPLA, suffered from internal divisions even before the nation achieved formal independence from Sudan in 2011. The rebels, who call themselves the SPLM/A in Opposition, argue that Kiir's government has squandered oil revenues – which make up about 98 percent of the national budget – and failed to tolerate criticism or reform within the party.

Machar says he doesn't want to shut down oil production in Upper Nile State, suggesting instead that funds from rebel-held oilfields be put into an escrow account that Kiir cannot access. “Meanwhile the oil companies would be paid their dues and Sudan, who owns the pipelines, would be paid their dues, and also the tariffs -- we would also pay them,” he said in an interview at his hideout in remote South Sudan. “An international consortium can be formed to supervise this matter.”
But if the opposition succeeds in taking Paloch, it is unlikely that China would participate in the escrow account Machar proposes, says Luke Patey, and analyst with the Dutch Institute for International Studies and the author of ""The New Kings of Crude: China, India, and the Global Struggle for Oil in Sudan and South Sudan.""
“That would be very much intervening in favor of the opposition side; it would be quite a drastic move, and not a smart one either,” Patey said. “China wants to help the South Sudanese government and the opposition sort out their differences.”

Efforts to do just that began shortly after the conflict erupted in December. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told journalists in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Jan. 6 that a representative of the Chinese government was visiting the region and talking to both sides. “While I'm in Addis, if it's possible and under the auspices of my Ethiopian friends, I'm ready to directly engage the two parties, and that I believe is also my responsibility,"" he added.
Since then, China has been a key player in the ongoing mediation. Its exhortations to both sides to restore peace and stability are hardly controversial, but its presence at the negotiation table signifies an emerging trend – one that China has been hinting at for years. In 2008, for instance, Beijing broke protocol to step up its rhetoric against Sudan regarding the crisis in Darfur, though only after China was criticized for maintaining investments in, and selling weapons to, Sudan. China has also offered to mediate oil-related disputes between Sudan and South Sudan several times since the latter gained independence.
Now, an internal conflict in South Sudan is giving Beijing another theater to try out its new tactic. South Sudan's future will depend on its partnership with China; the China National Petroleum Corporation, or CNPC, is the biggest shareholder in South Sudan's operation companies, and China was importing about 77 percent of South Sudan's crude before the conflict began. Should his opposition forces prevail in South Sudan's civil war, Machar said he has no intention of changing that. “It's an open market,” he said.
Open or not, South Sudan's market hasn't been an attractive one of late -- even for China. South Sudan took 75 percent of Sudan's oilfields when it achieved formal independence in 2011. It now has the third-largest oil reserves in sub-Saharan Africa, but still relies on its northern neighbor for the pipelines to get its crude to market. A row between Juba and Khartoum over pipeline fees and border disputes led to a 14-month shutdown beginning in early 2012. That year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude from South Sudan made up only 1 percent of China's total crude imports. In 2011, South Sudan's crude accounted for 5 percent of Chinese oil imports.
South Sudan's oil is flowing today, but conflict has taken its toll. It has delayed plans to build two major refineries in oil-producing states, and the oil ministry revealed in February that production had fallen to 165,000 barrels per day -- about half the country's total potential output according to government estimations.

That won't have a significant effect on China's oil security; the world's most populous country consumed about 10.7 million barels per day last year, making South Sudan's contribution, or lack thereof, a drop in the bucket. But oil isn't all that's at stake in South Sudan, which is why Beijing has endeavored to turn up the heat in its response to the crisis, even if only from cool to lukewarm.
“It's not just about oil; the Chinese government wants not only to protect its investment, but also wants to protect its global image,” said Patey. “By turning up the volume diplomatically, China is responding to pressure from the South Sudanese government to be more active, pressure from Western governments to be more active, and pressure from domestic constituencies to protect Chinese interests overseas.”
Though China appears steadfast in its determination not to pick sides in the current conflict, its role in mediation could mark a turning point for the world's second-largest economy. CNPC and other Chinese companies involved in high-risk states may prefer to keep investments separate from politics -- but when oil fields become a key target for two sides in a violent conflict, that hands-off approach could become increasingly untenable.

8,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 09, 2014 06:15AM ET</span>",The State Of Ukraine's And Russia's Grain Markets ,"By Connor Adams Sheets - As the crisis between Ukraine and Russia drags on with no resolution in sight, both nations’ grain sectors seem to be weathering the storm without major disruptions.
Corn and wheat prices rose in both countries in the beginning of March as observers around the world predicted that uncertainty in Ukraine would disrupt Black Sea shipping and forecast greatly diminished crops of corn and wheat, of which both Ukraine and Russia are leading producers. These projections contributed to a spike in global grain prices.
But prices of the key commodities have leveled off in recent weeks, a development that reflects waning anxiety over Ukraine and Russia’s 2014 agricultural output, and their ability to deliver wheat and corn to consumers.
“Cash prices of Russian and [Ukrainian] wheat [were] up as much as $10 a ton over the last two weeks of March,” Roy Huckabay, executive vice president at the Chicago-based Linn Group, explained via email. “Over the last week the values set back $3 to $4. Corn never rallied that much -- more like $3 to $5 -- and has set back last week to about where it all started.”
As the world’s fourth-largest corn exporter and sixth-largest wheat exporter as of last year, Ukraine is a major driver of international grain markets, as is Russia, which clocks in as the seventh-largest corn exporter and fifth-largest wheat exporter. Because the two nations play such a vital role in supplying the world with food, news that Russia was dispatching military forces to Crimea in late February and early March initially had market watchers and investors wringing their hands.
“The market really anticipated that we [the U.S.] would have increased export potential when the news first broke. The market anticipated that exports would increase from the U.S. to European countries … as a result of the combination of the unrest and sanctions,” Brian Hoops, president and senior market analyst at the Missouri-based Midwest Market Solutions Inc., explained via phone.  “It wasn’t anything specific that happened; it was more of a perception that those countries would not be able to ship wheat and that the U.S. would get some of that export business.”
But that sense of trepidation has eased recently, a fact that was reflected in the dropoff of wheat prices over the past two weeks and the relative stabilization of the corn market since the initial jump in early March.
The renewed sense of faith in these key agricultural markets is rooted in a widespread sense that since corn and wheat are currently trading at relatively high prices, there is sufficient incentive for close-to-normal yields to be produced this year in Ukraine and Russia.
“The Black Sea shipping has been uninterrupted, so that’s a plus, and that was the first concern. The second one is we can ship it, now can we grow it? I think the feeling for the most part, with the value of grain at the current price -- pretty lofty but down from where it was -- is that it’s still going to get planted,” Don Roose, president of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities Inc., said via phone.
“Most people are going to try to plant for the profitability that’s there despite the uncertainty. I think things have kind of calmed somewhat … so with the tensions easing that has eased some of the concerns of some of the producers.”
Not all observers are as confident in the ability of the ex-Soviet nations’ grain markets to weather the crisis. Art Durnev, a finance professor at the University of Iowa’s Tippie College of Business who grew up in the Soviet Union and Russia and is considered an expert on the region, believes that the situation remains more fluid.
“It’s hard to say. There’s a lot of uncertainty there right now, and if it continues there is a lot of potential impact on the agricultural markets there,” Durnev said via phone. “The prices will continue to increase until there is some stability in that region. … It’s all pretty much a day-by-day situation there right now.”

Still, most experts have tempered the dire predictions for grain markets voiced by some after the Russian seizure of key buildings in the Crimean capital, Simferopol, on Feb. 27 and 28, and the markets have leveled off as farmers get ready to plant for the 2014 growing season.
“There’s still a little bit of concern, but because there hasn’t been any express news in a couple of weeks, it has kind of moved away from being a major pricing influence,” Hoops said, adding that “we want to see if there’s any new political unrest that comes out of these markets.”
In fact, the all-important weather outlook has replaced the political crisis as the dominant concern for Ukraine’s grain markets, according to Roose.
“I think probably knowing what we know about the Ukrainian-Russian turmoil -- and it still is bubbling a bit -- we’ve kind of matured to a level where we’ve kind of calmed,” he said. “But I think what we’re really watching is what the weather is in some of these areas. It’s been dry in Ukraine.”"

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for June delivery was up 0.84% at $1,309.20, off a session high of $1,314.70 and up from a low of $1,296.80
The June contract settled down 0.40% at $1,298.30 on Monday.
Gold futures were likely to find support at $1,295.90 a troy ounce, Monday's low, and resistance at $1,343.00, the high from March 21.
The dollar weakened and gold rose as investors avoided the U.S. currency ahead of Wednesday’s minutes of the Fed’s March meeting, which should provide fresh insight as to the direction of monetary policy.
Last week’s U.S. payrolls report came in slightly below expectations, which spooked investors, as Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said slack labor markets will call for accommodative policies to stay in place for some time, which gave gold a boost as did a rising euro.
Demand for the euro remained firm after European Central Bank officials on Monday stressed that while fresh easing measures may be needed to steer the euro zone away from deflationary pressures, implementation of such tools is not imminent.
Last week the ECB left the door open to further stimulus measures, saying that unconventional monetary policy instruments may be necessary to avert the risk of ongoing low inflation in the euro zone.
A falling dollar and a rising euro often serve as a recipe for firmer gold prices.
Elsewhere, emerging-market currencies rose across the board on sentiments that even though the Federal Reserve will continue to unwind its bond-purchasing program this year, policy will remain loose for some time to come and make higher-yielding currencies more attractive.
Escalating tensions in Ukraine chipped away at the dollar and boosted gold as well.
Gold firmed after pro-Russian activists in Ukraine’s industrial center of Donetsk declared their independence from Kiev, a move Ukrainian leaders described as part of a Russian-orchestrated plan to justify an invasion.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said earlier that Russian agents were encouraging unrest in eastern Ukraine and said Moscow was preparing military action in the region.
Reports that Iraq's central bank is prepared to increase its gold holdings also added to the day's gains.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.222 per million British thermal units, Wednesday's low, and resistance at $4.567, the high from March 28.
A spring storm moving across the U.S. will leave below-normal temperatures in its wake across portions of the central and eastern U.S., which should boost demand for heating.
Forecasts for temperatures dipping into below-normal ranges through April 21 drew applause from investors.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
Elsewhere, investors looked ahead to Thursday's supply report.
Last week’s government supply data showed that natural gas storage in the U.S. fell by 74 billion cubic feet, much more than the five-year average drop of 8 billion cubic feet for this time of year.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 822 billion cubic feet, the lowest for this time of year since 2003.

17,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 08, 2014 10:15AM ET</span>","Why EU, Ukraine Natgas Talks Are At Fever Pitch","By Reuters - BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ukraine's energy minister, EU officials and industry representatives held talks on Tuesday on cutting reliance on Russian gas as tension with Moscow drove home the urgency of finding alternative energy sources and supply routes.
Concerns reached a new pitch after pro-Moscow protesters seized buildings in eastern Ukraine's mainly Russian-speaking industrial heartland, which Kiev said is a replay of events in Crimea, the peninsulaMoscow annexed last month.
At the same time, Kiev missed a midnight deadline to reduce its $2.2 billion debt owed to Russia for natural gas supplies.
That adds to concerns Russia could cut off Ukraine's gas supplies, with possible knock-on effects for the European Union.
The European Commission, the EU executive, said Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger was chairing two meetings in Brussels.
One was of the EU ""gas coordination group"", at which experts debate storage levels, and one brought together industry and Ukraine's energy minister to discuss security of supply.
A copy of an invitation to industry, seen by Reuters, says Oettinger invites ""relevant gas companies for a frank and open discussion"" to contribute to EU energy security for the next winter and over the mid-term.
In particular, it cites the importance of including liquefied natural gas operators. Super-cooled LNG, which can be brought by ship from sources around the world, is one way to cut reliance on pipeline gas from Russia.
Ukraine's Energy Minister Yuri Prodan was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying Russia's decision to nearly double gas prices to Ukraine was unjustified and Kiev could not pay.
""If the situation is not resolved, there will be a threat not only for the supply of gas to Ukraine, but also for the transit of gas to Europe,"" Prodan said.
Following previous crises in 2006 and 2009 over Kiev's unpaid gas bills, which led to the disruption of exports to western Europe, the European Union has already introduced some measures to improve itsenergy security, including increased gas storage and more renewable energy.
Although analysts say nowhere near enough has been done, EU officials say there is renewed determination to act, alongside a recognition that changing Europe's energy system will take time.
Denmark put forward the idea, adopted by an EU summit last month, that the Commission should draw up by June a detailed plan on increasing energy security and says this time around the mood is completely different.
""There is no doubt that this is a game-changer,"" Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told Reuters by telephone late last week, ahead of the Brussels talks. ""The whole Ukraine crisis has definitely changed the atmosphere during our discussions.""
Russia provides Ukraine with around half of its gas and the European Union with roughly one third of its demand, some 40 percent of which currently flows via Ukraine.
Well Stocked
Europe hopes to secure extra imports of LNG and is working on increasing capacity to reverse the flow through some pipelines so that gas, including some imported from Russia, can be sent back eastward to Ukraine from EU countries.
Oettinger has been trying for months to broker a deal with Slovakia to allow Ukraine to receive up to 8 billion cubic metres a year in a reverse flow of gas.
Ukraine, however, says progress on this has not been fast enough while Russia says it would be illegal.
Europe's increased storage levels, currently around half full, mean it can cope with a short-term disruption.
The EU's gas coordination group, with energy experts from all 28 EU member states, was set up in response to the previous pricing rows between Russia and Ukraine.
It last met in March, when officials from some EU countries, such as Poland and Greece, said they feared gas shortages and economic damage if Russia stopped pumping gas to Ukraine.
Moscow also has a great deal at stake. Its gas exports to the European Union provide state-controlled exporter Gazprom with an average of $5 billion per month in revenues."
18,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 08, 2014 09:15AM ET</span>",Iran: We're Not Waiting For US Permission To Boost Oil Exports,"By Meagan Clark - Iran plans to boost its crude production and exports this year despite agreeing to U.S.-led sanctions against the country's energy sector. 
""Iran will use every possibility to increase the amount of oil exports and will not wait for America's permission,"" Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said Monday, according to Iran's oil ministry news service Shana. ""The sanctions do not ban Iran from increasing oil production and we have a big plan for increasing Iran's oil production.""
Iran is also planning to increase its gas production, Zanganeh said. Iran has the second-largest proven gas reserves in the world, and the fourth-largest proven oil reserves, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Iran's oil production has declined in recent years due in part to sanctions, meant to discourage Iran from building up nuclear material that could be used to make weapons. As part of a nuclear agreement with six world powers, Iran agreed in November to export no more than 1 million barrels per day to Turkey, South Korea, China, India, Japan and Taiwan. 
In March, Iran increased its crude exports for the fifth month in a row, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Iran's crude exports averaged 1.4 million barrels per day in February and 1.26 million barrels per day in January, the IEA reported.
Zanganeh attracted billions of dollars in investment to Iran's oil drilling and exporation during his pervious term, from 1997 to 2005. He returned to his title last fall promising to boost crude production capacity. 
""Certainly Iran will increase its oil production capacity in this year and maintain its share in OPEC,"" he said Monday. 

The National Irainian Oil Company annnounced late last week that Iran was currently producing about 2.85 million barrels per day of crude, compared to 3.26 million barrels per day in February and 3.25 million barrels per day in January. Zanganeh hopes to raise production to 4 million barrels per day this year.
""With [removal] of the sanctions, the work will take on a rapid pace, but this doesn't mean that we will wait around until the sanctions are removed. We will pursue our work,"" he said."
19,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 08, 2014 06:30AM ET</span>",How Ukraine May Affect The Flow Of Kazakhstan's Oil,"By Meagan Clark - Kazakhstan is considering new options for its oil exports, including partnering with Iran, as its concerns about Western sanctions against its northern neighbor Russia grow.
Uzaqbai Qarabalin, the minister of oil and gas, told Kazakh lawmakers Monday that Western sanctions against Russia may lead to a decrease in the oil volume transported to foreign markets through Russian pipelines, according to a Radio Free Europe translation of reports from KazTAG, a news agency based in Kazakhstan, and Interfax, a non-governmental news agency based in Moscow. 
The government of the former Soviet republic maintains good relations with the Kremlin and supports Russia’s annexation of Crimea despite Western opposition.
Qarabalin said state-owned KazMunaiGas will have to focus on the Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey route west of the Caspian Sea from Kazakhstan. He also said Iran may be considered as a potential partner.
The Kazakh government is looking to increase its oil exports to neighboring China, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan soon, Qarabalin said. He added that Western sanctions may shift Russian oil exports toward Kazakhstan, affecting the domestic gasoline market and local refinery operations, Radio Free Europe reported.
Kazakhstan has the largest oil reserves and production among the former Soviet republics after Russia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The two largest projects at Tengiz and Karachaganak accounted for 40 percent of the country’s liquid crude production in 2013, according to EIA data. Several American oil and gas companies drill in Kazakhstan. Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) has a 50 percent stake in Tengiz, ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) has a 25 percent stake in Tengiz, and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) has an 8.4 percent stake in Kashagan, a smaller oil field. 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled ever since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, pledged last fall to make Kazakhstan the hub connecting Asia with Europe and driving regional and global prosperity.
Kazakhstan has been ""very wise with building a good relationship with the West,"" said Sergio Millian, president of the American-Russian Chamber of Commerce. ""It's highly doubtful there will be any deterioration of the relationship between the U.S. and Kazakhstan.""
Kazakh support for Russia's takeover of Crimea was probably due to nothing more than ""a friendly request"" from the Kremlin, Millian added. Kazahstan, Belarus and Russia have a trade alliance dating back to 1996 that lets citizens of the three countries cross borders without visas. 

Kazakhstan has grown steadily in the past decade, with 6 percent GDP growth in 2013, and is one of the global oil industry's major growth stories. Production rose from about one million barrels a day in 2002 to 1.7 million barrels a year ago, though a failing $50 billion offshore ice project led by Eni of Italy has slowed production sharply since 2009.
In recent weeks, inflation has burdened Kazakh spending. Prices continued rising in March after the national bank devalued the currency, the tenge, by 16 percent against the dollar in mid-February compared to January, according to Capital Economics.
Looking forward, Kazakhstan’s development objective of joining the rank of the top 30 most developed countries by 2050 will depend on its ability to move away from natural resource dependence toward more balanced growth, according to a World Bank assessment."

28,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 07, 2014 08:30AM ET</span>","Libyan Rebels, Government Agree To Gradually Reopen Occupied Oil Ports","By Reuters - By Ulf Laessing and Ayman al-Warfalli TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya, April 6 (Reuters) - Libyan rebels occupying four eastern oil ports agreed with the government on Sunday to gradually end their eight-month petroleum blockade, which has cost the North African state billions in lost revenues.   Zueitina and Hariga ports, held by federalist rebels demanding more autonomy from Tripoli, will open immediately while the larger ports, Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, will be freed in two to four weeks after more talks, the government said.   Ending the oil port standoff will be a major advance for Libya's fragile government, which has struggled to impose its authority over an unruly nation still in flux nearly three years after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi.
""The ports Zueitina and Hariga will be handed over to the state with the signature of this agreement. The protesters are banned from returning or obstructing work at the ports,"" Justice Minister Salah al-Marghani said, reading out the agreement.   He said the two larger ports will be reopened in no more than four weeks, after more discussions with the rebels.   Top rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran confirmed the blockage of Zueitina and Hariga ports had ended. ""We did this out of goodwill to build trust, have a dialogue and solve all problems between Libyans by peaceful means,"" he said in a short speech broadcast by a rebel television station from Zueitina terminal.
  ""We will undertake more measures to strengthen these intentions provided the government fulfills its part,"" he said, in an apparent reference to the reopening of the remaining ports. ""We serve Libya's interests.""   Neither side commented on what rebel demands still needed to be negotiated with the government, leaving room for possible delays in reopening the larger ports.   Zueitina and Hariga ports account for around 200,000 barrels per day of export capacity, while the larger ports previously shipped around 500,000 bpd of Libya's crude.   Storage tanks are full at the ports, and loading the crude will be straightforward. But getting the tanks resupplied from oilfields will take time.
  The reopening of the eastern oil ports could bump up Libya's output from around 150,000 bpd, but nowhere near the 1.4 million bpd it produced before last summer.   Disputes over Libya's oil resources underscore how weak the government is to confront brigades of former rebels and militias who refused to disarm after Gaddafi's fall and often use their military muscle to strong-arm the state.   With its national armed forces still in training, Tripoli's government often finds itself at the mercy of rival militias who are loosely allied with competing political factions in the country's parliament.  CORRUPTION PROBE
  Rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran, who seized three of the ports with thousands of his troops, is a former anti-Gaddafi fighter, who later become head of a state-run oil facilities guard before he turned against Tripoli.   Hariga port was closed by another group of federalist protesters who sympathized with Jathran's cause.   Jathran's movement set up its own self-declared federal government in the east, where many feel they have long been neglected by Tripoli. They made three key demands on the government, including a system to share oil revenues, a probe of corruption and a committee to oversee oil exports.  

The minister said the agreement calls for all charges to be dropped against Jathran's oil protection force, and for them to receive their oil guard salary payments according to the law.   A committee would be formed to investigate financial and administration corruption since Libya's liberation from Gaddafi, one of the demands made by Jathran's movement.   The body will be made up of Libyans from different regions, a fact which the rebels' self-declared prime minister, Abd-Rabbo al-Barassi, pointed out in a speech. His group had demanded that oil sales be monitored by representatives from all regions.   But the one-page agreement did not mention the rebels' other key demand, a greater share of oil revenue for their eastern region, known as Cyrenaica and one of Libya's three regions before Gaddafi. They also have been campaigning for regional autonomy.   ""We will continue the dialogue and our efforts to completely gain Cyrenaica's remaining rights,"" Barassi told rebel and tribal leaders assembled in Zueitina.   ""We won't give up Cyrenaica's rights whatever happens but when the government started a dialogue we talked and thank God ... we reached an agreement for the good,"" he said.   The shutdown has cost the state more than $7 billion in lost oil revenues and forced the central bank to start burning its reserves to keep the state running. Parliament has failed to approve a budget for 2014, as there is almost no state income at the moment due to a wave of oil protests across the OPEC nation.   Support had been waning for Jathran's protest in the east, where divisions had begun to emerge over whether to continue the blockade.   Talks to end the standoff advanced after the federalist rebels last month managed to load crude onto a tanker at Es Sider and forced it out to sea in an attempt to export the cargo.   U.S. commandos later boarded the formerly North Korean-flagged vessel in international waters and returned it to Libya, in a major blow to the federalists' plan to bypass Tripoli and sell oil independently on the global market.   The oil deal does not necessarily end protests that have shut western oil production facilities such as the 340,000-bpd El Sharara oilfield for weeks. Protesters in the west have few ties with the east and are splintered into small groups lacking a joint leadership, which makes it hard to negotiate with them.

77,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 01, 2014 10:00AM ET</span>",Is Bakken Crude Safe To Transport? ,"By Kathleen Caulderwood - After a series of devastating train derailments that caused extensive damage, evacuations and even death,  the federal Department of Transportation warned the industry that they needed to start testing crude extracted from the Bakken Shale, which is likely more volatile than ordinary oil, and the reason accidents have gotten so dangerous.
The DOT is still waiting. And they’re not impressed.
“The overall and ongoing lack of cooperation is disappointing, slows progress and certainly raises concerns,” the agency told Reuters on Friday. 
“Despite the energy industry making assurances to DOT more than two months ago, we still lack data we requested and that energy stakeholders agreed to produce,” it said.
The worst incident so far happened in Lac Megantic, Quebec when a runaway train caught fire and killed 47 people in July. Similar accidents have happened in Alberta, Alaska and New Brunswick haven’t been as deadly, but have certainly raised concerns.
On Dec. 30 several oil tankers ruptured and caught fire outside Casselton, North Dakota and caused massive evacuations. Three days later the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued an alert that “derailments and resulting fires indicate that the type of crude oil being transported from the Bakken region may be more flammable than traditional heavy crude oil.”
“It is imperative that offerors properly classify and describe hazardous materials being offered for transportation,” the notice reads. 

The Bakken region is one of the top oil-producing regions in North America, and covers a large swath of North Dakota and Montana.
Some of the country’s largest oil companies have high stakes in the region, which is still relatively new to development.
ConocoPhillops, the largest independent exploration and production company in the U.S., saw oil production rise 24 percent last year, as Bakken field production rose 60 percent and hit 30,000 barrels per day, according to a MarketWatch report. 
As Bakken production increases so has business for the crude-by-rail industry. But many of the cars are made according to older safety standards, and have yet to be retrofitted to new specifications.
“One of the biggest problems is that many of the cars used to transport the oil… are not designed to carry flammable Bakken crude oil,” said Jim Fugile, former Democratic party activist and state tourism director, to Minnesota news site MinnPost. 
Fugile has been a vocal opponent of the Bakken boom, arguing that development is moving too fast at the price of safety and economic fairness.
Last week Harold Hamm, the CEO of Continental Resources Inc., one of the major players in North Dakota drilling, assured reporters that the crude doesn’t have any problems.
“Bakken oil is safe,” he said to reporters, according to a Reuters report.
“Anytime you don’t keep trains on the track bad things happen,” he added."

81,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 01, 2014 05:30AM ET</span>",Welcome To The Most Dangerous Coal Mine In The World,"By Jacopo Dettoni - ULAANBATAAR, Mongolia -- Deep inside the earth, the eyes of blackened miners shimmer under spotlights as they hammer endlessly upon rock, tapping the vein of Mongolia's largest illegal coal mine. The Nalaikh mine, 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the capital, Ulaanbaatar, is both a vision from the past and a rogue operation from the present.
Coal dust streaks the miners' cheeks, their hands, their worn clothes. In many cases, whether they know it or not, their lungs are being ruined by coal and nicotine. They risk their lives every time they go into the pits.
Frequently, theirs is a losing bet. The miners here are part of a booming complex of illegal mining in Mongolia, the seamy underside of an expansion of legal mining. Deadly accidents here take place more frequently than in China, as private operators seek to maximize profits by skimping on safety gear.
The miners crawl in the darkness for hundreds of meters through narrow, rambling passages before reaching the working face, where the new coal is cut. Dug with shovels and picks, the tunnels have few timber supports -- a minimum safety standard in any coal mine, and the walls crumble as carts loaded with coal slide up, pulled from the outside by trucks. The air feels chill and still; only a few in Nalaikh can afford ventilators, another minimum safety standard in coal mining.
Every year, about a dozen miners die here. That's the official figure. In reality, nobody knows how many people are buried in the makeshift pits, as Nalaikh largely lies beyond the authorities' control.

Across Mongolia, the national Mine Rescue Service has recorded 422 peak-season accidents since 2000, with collapses and explosions claiming at least 175 victims. With an average annual production of 700,000 tons, that means one fatality for every 56,000 tons of coal mined, making Nalaikh far deadlier than the infamous Chinese coal mines, where one miner dies for every 2.7 million tons of coal mined.
“But this one is safe,” says Ganzorig B., referring to the particular mine shaft he is working with eight fellow miners. Ganrozig, like most Mongolians, omits or abbreviates to the initial his last name. He smiles as he offers his disclaimer, trying to sound reassuring. 

Mongolia has gained a worldwide reputation as the next big thing in mining. Some people call it Minegolia, and companies from all over the globe have rushed in to tap its vast coal, copper and gold deposits. With investments for billions of dollars lining up, the country's economy posted double-digit growth rates in each of the last three years.
Yet it is Nalaikh's “informal” coal that still heats up half of Ulaanbaatar during Mongolia's frigid winter. Though only a handful of the hundreds of mine shafts active in Nalaikh are legally authorized, that has not stopped scores of local miners from coming back, winter after winter. 
“Every autumn we come back and dig new holes, because the old ones are either depleted or collapsed,” Ganzorig said.
Ganzorig's mine shaft lies just down the road from the ruins of the official, vast mining operation that the government used to run here. Opened in 1922, the Nalaikh State Mine was the nation's first industrial mining operation. It provided jobs, and the usual dose of mining tragedies, to generations of local men before going bust in the 1990s, when the collapse of the Soviet-backed state economy dried up its subsidies. A few words can still be read on the façade of the old office building: “Nalaikh Great Mine.”
Perhaps those who looted the building to the last usable brick in the 1990s left the sign as an act of respect, but today, the words embody the irony of Nalaikh's boom and bust curve. Ruins are all over the place: Traces of a railway lead to the skeleton of the old loading station, the office building's façade itself is falling apart, and the Cyrillic letters themselves will be gone soon, under a pile of debris.
Only the coal underground is left, and the hundreds of men who dig it up for a living.
Tent City
“During the peak season, there are more than 200 active mine shafts, and only 26 shafts are authorized,” said Tuyabaatar A., a representative from the office of the  governor of Nalaikh district.
Up to 2,000 ""hand miners"" work at Nalaikh from October to May. They supply around 70 percent of the 1 million tons of coal burned every year in Ulaanbataar's underprivileged ger districts. In winter, the more than 750,000 people living there in gers, the traditional Mongolian nomadic tents, or other semi-permanent structures (about half of the city's total population) feed their stoves with 30 to 50 kilos (up to 110 pounds) of coal per day.
The smoke has turned the city, once known for its blue skies, into one of the world's most polluted, according to a study by the World Health Organization. Famous for its high calorific value, Nalaikh coal is sold at any corner in 15-kilo yellow bags for no more than 2,000 tugriks (US$1.10). It's a huge black market trade that mostly happens in plain view.
“Authorities just cannot control it,” middleman Khashkhuu D. said with a grin on his face. He had just paid the usual 5,000-tugrik bribe to a police patrol that stopped his truck loaded with coal along the highway to Ulaanbataar. Khashkhuu fills up the truck at the mine for some 160,000 tugriks, and resells its load for around 300,000 in the city. The profit is equivalent to roughly $79.

Soon after shutting down the state mine, authorities divided it into small plots and privatized them. But demand from the capital's burgeoning ger districts kept growing, and the government could not, or would not, crack down on the expansion of illegal mining at Nalaikh. Dozens of mine shafts began to actively probe the lode. Today, coal remains a major source of income for the local economy.
“Around 42 percent of the people here live below the poverty line, and the first thing that comes to their mind is mining,"" the Nalaikh government's Tuyabaatar said. ""They pay no taxes whatsoever, make 40,000 tugriks to 50,000 tugriks ($28) per day, and get the cash straight away at the end of the working day.”
With monthly earnings reaching 1.5 million tugriks ($842), Nalaikh's miners make far more money than most Mongolians -- the national average income is 631,000 tugriks -- during the winter months. With no other real alternatives, they care little for the price they might end up paying.
“In the past, the mine's operation would go deeper and be more complex, but we had the names and numbers of those who were down and a rescue team would be sent out for any accident,"" said Janchiv T., who has worked in Nalaikh as a rescuer since the 1970s. ""Whereas today, we don't really know what is happening and how many people get stuck underground when accidents happen.” 
Legal Coal Makes A Comeback?
As the winter season comes to an end and Ulaanbaatar's stoves gradually cool off, Ganzorig and his fellow miners will soon seal off their mine shafts and empty out the site, leaving behind their old picks and mountains of trash. But this year, the mine site will not be utterly abandoned, as engineers from a Mongolian private mining company are expected to camp out here while conducting surveys.
“We are concentrating on how to build one big, reliable project, and local mining firm Tsagaan Shonkhoor will carry out some studies on it this spring,” Nyamsuren S., general director of the Mine Rescue Service, said in an interview in his office. He was toying with a pen branded with the logo of Coal Mongolia 2014, an annual conference that attracts to Ulaanbaatar politicians and coal barons from all over the world.
This year's conference, held in February, gives an idea of how high coal mining ranks on the government's agenda. The speaker list featured Prime Minister Norovyn Altankhuyag alongside three members of the cabinet and three vice-ministers. Coal is the country's biggest export item, accounting for one-fourth of total exports in 2013. Mongolia last year exported 18 million tons, up from just 2.2 million tons in 2005, according to figures from the mining ministry. The government expects to increase exports to 83 million tons by 2028 through the development of large untapped deposits such as lie under the massive Tavan Tolgoi basin, where official estimates put total coal reserves at more than 6 billion tons.
Nalaikh does not feature among Mongolia's most appealing coal reserves, and rarely makes it onto the agenda of Coal Mongolia. Yet there is still plenty of coal left to dig out. Tsagaan Shonkhoor, which legally owns some mining licenses in the western part of the basin, estimates there are coal reserves of about 24 million tons, and authorities are backing a project by the company to restart industrial mining operations at the site.
However, Tsagaan Shonkhoor has met with the fierce opposition from the informal  miners, who are suspicious of its alleged Chinese ownership. Years ago, its employees were attacked by miners armed with spades and crowbars, the local press reported.

A spokesperson from the company confirmed Tsagaan Shonkhoor is still working on the project, but declined to comment further.
“Authorities have to come up with a plan for Nalaikh, but so far there has been a lot of talking and no concrete follow-up,” Janchiv, the mine rescue worker, said.
Down in the darkness of the earth's interior, the miners do not really care. With spring coming up, they are all in a good mood. “Your semester is about to end? Ours too!” Ganzorig said to a local NGO worker who was about to finish university, prompting laughter from his mates. Soon the underground city of illegal coal will fall silent again. Ganzorig will be idle until autumn comes, then he will go off looking for a new mine shaft. And so it will continue, until the government makes good in its talk to turn Nalaikh into a legal project -- or until the coal runs out. "

106,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 29, 2014 10:45AM ET</span>","How Liquid Natural Gas May Revolutionize Shipping, And Make Goods Cheaper ","By Stephen Starr - ISTANBUL -- At a noisy, bustling shipyard 20 miles south of Istanbul, the world’s second-ever tugboat powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG) sits at the end of a pier, awaiting its first water trial.
“Then it’s off to Norway,” said with no little pride Ruchan Civgin, the contracts manager at Sanmar Shipyard, of the 115-foot vessel. “The first boat left in January.”
Further south along the Marmara Sea coast, another shipbuilder is rolling out LNG-powered fish-feed vessels, used to transport feed for fish farms, for international markets.
These ships may be the vanguard of a global boom in LNG-powered shipping, produced by the explosion in U.S. fracking and by new international emissions restrictions. Liquid natural gas may end up turning global shipping on its head, as shipping companies look for an edge in their battle to cut costs and reduce carbon footprints.
The world as we know it today would not exist without the behemoths that traverse the high seas. An astonishing 80 percent of global trade is carried by ship: the Nikes on your feet, the gasoline in your car, the Toyota Prius in your driveway all came on container ships.
In February, San Diego-based TOTE Shipholdings ordered the world's first LNG-powered container ships. It also plans to convert its fleet of four ships to LNG power. “The biggest driver is the environmental benefits of LNG,” said Ben Christian, TOTE project manager.
In January, the Mississippi-based Gulf Coast Shipyard Group launched the first of six LNG dual-fuel offshore supply vessels, the first of their kind in the Gulf of Mexico.
And in Europe, French operator Brittany Ferries recently ordered a massive, 2,500-passenger LNG-powered passenger ferry expected to enter service in 2017. General Electric NYSE:GE and petroleum giant Royal Dutch Shell LON:RDSA are also looking to get in on the act.
Fuel typically amounts to 70 percent of the overall cost of moving a container ship from A to B; most ships today run on cheap, dirty bunker fuel. It's a dense oil residue said to contain 2,700 times more toxic sulfur than vehicular fuels. According to studies cited by the watchdog group Transport & Environment, air pollution from shipping causes 50,000 deaths in Europe alone every year. Regulations to be introduced by the International Maritime Organization next year and in 2020 will make high-sulfur fuels, such as bunker fuel, illegal for use in ships sailing in numerous emission-control zones around the world.
Enter LNG, which, unlike bunker fuel, contains no harmful sulfur dioxide, emits 26 percent less carbon dioxide, and produces almost zero smoke.
And it’s cheaper than bunker fuel too.
According to Tim Delay, vice president of fuels for liquid natural gas distributor Pivotal LNG, a unit of AGL Resources Inc. NYSE:GAS, gas contains more energy than bunker fuel. In the U.S., he said, this works out to around $100 per metric ton cheaper than bunker fuel.
""The relative low price of natural gas and LNG compared to current high residual bunker and distillate fuel prices in the U.S and Europe has added to the attractiveness of LNG,"" wrote Frederick Adamchak, an adviser at New York-based brokerage Poten & Partners, in an industry publication last year.
America is also flush with gas: the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates there’s enough of it underground to last 92 years at expected demand.
And yet, of the 87,000 vessels that make up the global fleet today, LNG ships number just 50. So why isn't everybody converting their ships to a cheaper, abundant, cleaner fuel?

LNG presents challenges: building and converting ship engines takes time and is expensive. That's an important consideration in an industry where profit margins, hit hard by overcapacity after the global financial crisis, have shrunk in recent years.
Hundreds of LNG bunkering and refueling facilities will also have to be built at ports around the world.
“As of today, the infrastructure of LNG supply is limited and installation of LNG engines is an expensive investment. But LNG might be a viable solution for new-built container vessels sometime in the future when the infrastructure is in place,” said Mikkel Elbek Linnet, a spokesman for shipping giant Maersk Line, a unit of Denmark-based AP Moeller Maersk A/S (CPH:MAERSK-A).
Analysts say the number of ships converted to LNG will increase 20-fold by 2020. But in some cases, it's possible to reduce emissions and improve fuel consumption by using recycled engine heat and more efficient engines, rather than invest in an LNG conversion.
Maersk Line is doing just that with the launch last year of the first of a fleet of 20 massive ‘Triple E’ container ships, slow-sailing giants -- the longest ships in the world at 400 meters (1,312 ft) -- that recycle engine heat. Maersk says they will consume approximately 35 percent less fuel per container than some smaller vessels.
However, many major ports have already started the move to gas. The Belgian port of Antwerp, Europe’s second-busiest container port after Rotterdam in the Netherlands, expects to open bunkering facilities for LNG-powered ships at the end of next year. In February, ground was broken on America's first such facility at Port Fourchon, La.
TOTE Shipholdings wouldn’t say how much it expected to save by using LNG on its container carriers working the Jacksonville - Puerto Rico route.
But on a grander scale, vessels running on American LNG operating intercontinental routes could potentially save hundreds of thousands of dollars per journey. With gas prices forecast to remain steady for at least the next five years, cheaper shoes and cars may not be far off for North American consumers."

Supplies fell by 90 billion cubic feet in the same week a year earlier while the five-year average change for the week is a drop of 7 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 896 billion cubic feet, the lowest for this time of year since 2003.

Stocks in the Producing Region were 378 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 754 billion cubic feet after a net withdrawal of 15 billion cubic feet.
The numbers sparked a rally, which may be short-lived, as updated long-term weather-forecasting models called for a return of milder temperatures across most parts of the U.S. once a frigid winter system clears out of the eastern U.S.
Natural gas prices have been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions amid concerns that the arrival of spring will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for heating.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.

119,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 27, 2014 10:15AM ET</span>",U.S. Oil Production Topped 10% Of World's Supply Last Year,"By Meagan Clark - The U.S. produced enough oil in the fourth quarter to account for more than 10 percent of the world’s supply, according to new data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
The production, at 7.84 million barrels of oil per day in the last quarter of 2013, grew 9 percent from the year-earlier period, according to the report released Wednesday. About 41 percent of the total came from tight oil production, which utilizes hydraulic fracturing technology.
Most of the tight oil production came from the Eagle Ford play in South Texas and the Bakken Shale play in North Dakota and Montana. The plays are the poster children of the U.S. oil boom. About one-third of the tight oil production came from Eagle Ford, and 28 percent came from the Bakken. The two together accounted for 27 percent of total U.S. production that quarter.
Though Russia and Canada produce limited amounts of tight oil, the U.S. largely leads. In 2013, Canada extracted about 10 percent of its production from tight oil (0.34 million barrels per day), while Russia extracted only 1 percent of its production from tight oil (0.12 million barrels per day).

But production from tight oil tends to drop off after high initial output, so the U.S. oil industry may have a tougher time maintaining production in the future. Another challenge to the industry is that conventional production is stagnant. To keep up production, oil operators will have to drill new tight oil wells to make up for both declining rates in current shale plays and for the declining conventional production.
Australia and the U.K. may be the next countries to ramp up production from tight oil, according to the EIA, followed by Mexico, Russia, China and Argentina."

123,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 27, 2014 06:30AM ET</span>",Why A Palladium Fund Has Launched In South Africa ,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - South African investors could take interest in a fresh palladium exchange traded fund (ETF) due to launch on Thursday, under African investment bank Absa Capital.  
Palladium is a hybrid industrial and precious metal, used in investment, niche jewelry and automobiles as an element of emissions-control equipment. There are concerns about a steady supply of the metal in the wake of Russia’s military maneuvers in Ukraine, partly as sanctions could hamper Russian palladium exports.
The fund comes almost a year after Absa Capital launched a similar successful fund in South Africa for sister metal platinum. That fund has since grown to be the biggest platinum fund of its kind in the world, amassing almost 950,000 ounces.
“We will be able to provide full liquidity from the first day of listing, which means there is no limitation on trading,” said Vladimir Nedeljkovic, who heads exchange-traded products for Absa Capital, in a statement last week.
Investors will gain easy access to palladium bullion prices in South African Rand terms, in the world’s second-largest producer of palladium and the largest miner of platinum. Platinum and palladium are often viewed as related metals partly because they’re both used in catalytic convertors in cars.
South African institutional investors could derive extra advantages from the fund, said Nedeljkovic in an email to IBTimes. Investments will be treated as domestic assets, so South African institutional investors can avoid burdensome investment rules concerning foreign assets, he said.
There’s significant investor demand for the fund, and there could be a short-term upward impact on prices, New York’s CPM Group wrote in a December 2013 note.
“There could be an interesting trade in selling platinum and buying palladium in advance of the move,” said CPM Group then, noting that institutional investors may switch from Absa’s platinum fund to its new palladium product, to adjust portfolio weightings.
“Platinum prices may be weighed on and palladium prices will be supported, because of that reshuffling in the PGM [platinum group metals] area,” said Carlos Sanchez, CPM Group’s head of commodities, to IBTimes in December.

It may be difficult for foreign investors to participate in the fund, however, said attorney and precious metals specialist Anthony Tu-Sekine to IBTimes.
Local institutional investors could also experience fatigue with precious metals investments, after pent-up demand was absorbed by the platinum fund launch in 2013, Tu-Sekin said. He advised a rival platinum and palladium fund owned by Sprott Asset Management LP on its 2012 launch, though the fund owns far less platinum than its Absa rival platinum fund.
Palladium prices have spiked in recent weeks, hitting their highest since 2011. Palladium traded at $776 per ounce on Wednesday.
“Any restrictions on Russian palladium exports would exacerbate what is already expected to be a large palladium deficit in 2014,” wrote ETF Securities in a research note on Monday. Russian miner Norilsk Nickel (MCX:GMKN) said in late 2013 that there’d likely be structural deficits of the metal in years to come, as mine output fails to match rising demand.
Absa Capital is an African investment bank affiliated with Barclays PLC LON:BARC. Rival Standard Bank launched South Africa’s first palladium ETF on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange this Monday, beating Absa to the punch by less than a week, Reuters reported. "

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, Natural Gas futures for delivery in May traded at $4.419 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, up 0.10%. The commodity hit session high of $4.426 and a low of $4.355.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.258 per million British thermal units, Monday's low, and resistance at $4.428, Tuesday's high.
Natural gas prices rose after powerful winter storm formed over the Atlantic and pummeled the northeastern U.S. this week, bringing heavy snow and frigid temperatures to heavily-populated portions of the country.
By Wednesday, profit taking wiped out most of the commodity's gains, as a return of seasonably milder temperatures in roughly a week should prompt households to throttle back on heating, while higher temperatures that hike demand for air conditioning remain far off on the horizon.
Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to Thursday’s weekly supply data to gauge the strength of demand for the fuel.
Early withdrawal estimates range from a decline of 36 billion cubic feet to 76 billion cubic feet, compared to a drop of 90 billion cubic feet during the same week a year earlier.
The five-year average change for the week is a decline of 7 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 953 billion cubic feet as of last week, the lowest for this time of year since 2003, following a smaller than expected withdrawal of 48 billion cubic feet.
Natural gas prices have been under heavy selling pressure in recent sessions amid concerns that the arrival of spring will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for heating.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.

135,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 26, 2014 10:45AM ET</span>",German Central Bank Discusses Gold Repatriation Progress,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - German gold held by the U.S. Federal Reserve in New York and in Paris is slowly but surely returning home, said a German central bank official in a Tuesday update in New York.
Germany’s gold repatriation program, whereby the nation’s central bank is recalling 674 metric tons from vaults in New York and Paris, is progressing slowly. About 69 tons have returned to Frankfurt so far.
“We have a very great deal of confidence in the security of our gold holdings abroad, so there’s no reason for us to rush through this relocation process,” said Henner Asche, the German Bundesbank’s deputy head of markets, at a New York gathering.
The German central bank is working closely with its French and U.S. counterparts and the Bank of International Settlements to transfer the gold, taking painstaking security and confidentiality measures. Citing security concerns, Asche declined to provide any details on the specifics of the shipments.
Complete relocation of all German gold held abroad isn’t desirable, said Asche, because international finance centers like New York and London provide the best liquidity, in case the Bundesbank decides to exchange gold for cash or other foreign currency.
Frankfurt’s share of Germany’s gold will rise to 50 percent by 2020, as Paris’ share is cut to zero and New York’s share falls to 37 percent. German gold held in London will remain unchanged. Germany held 3,387 tons of gold, or 67 percent of its total reserves, the second highest in the world after the U.S. by tonnage, according to World Gold Council data.
Some gold bars were melted down in Europe to meet the London Good Delivery standard for bars, said Asche.

Though the scheme was first announced in January 2013, that remelting could have contributed to delays before the first shipments started in the fall of 2013, according to George Milling-Stanley, a consultant to central banks on gold buying.
Germany requested a phased delivery over seven years, with each shipment kept small and with no more than one ton in any single delivery, he told IBTimes. “Insurers will cover only deliveries by air, and will not insure shipments of more than one ton at a time,” he said, citing publicly available sources.
A ton of gold is worth $42.2 million at Wednesday’s price of $1312 per ounce. New York’s delivered shipment alone of 37 tons is valued at about 11.9 billion euros ($16.5 billion), on the central bank’s accounting.
India and Sweden are two countries that have pledged gold abroad as collateral for urgent government loans, added Milling-Stanley. He underscored the importance of keeping some gold abroad for liquidity reasons.
About eight standard U.S. 18-wheeler trucks would be required to carry 300 metric tons of gold, the amount of gold Germany is claiming back from the Fed, estimated Anthem Blanchard, CEO of precious metals seller Anthem Vault.
The Bundesbank’s gold management received a favorable audit in 2012 by a German federal court of auditors, added Asche.
The decision to bring Germany’s gold back home wasn’t prompted by political pressure or the court’s audit, but was made independently by the central bank, said Asche.
“In Germany, a lot of emotion is attached to the topic of gold reserves,” said Asche at Bloomberg LP’s headquarters. “The German public in general appreciates the Bundesbank’s gold holdings as national wealth.”"

Front-month April futures contracts for ethanol jumped 13.9 cents per gallon to $2.988 a gallon on Monday. April futures prices for a type of gasoline that contains ethanol and is cheaper than regular gasoline, reformulated regular gasoline blendstock (RBOB), slipped by 1.7 cents per gallon to $2.8909 per gallon the same day.

Ethanol prices last rose higher than gasoline in November 2011. According to Rick Kment, DTN analyst, the premium ethanol prices “could start to move the focus off of overall energy markets” and onto supply issues. “The expectation that overall supplies may continue to remain tight through most of the spring despite warmer weather is creating buyers aggressively outbidding others in order to secure current needs,” Kment wrote Monday.
Prices for ethanol rose the highest on the West Coast, where transportation delays have restricted access to the product.
Ethanol prices ""at the rack,"" the price petroleum marketers purchase the commodity at before it reaches the retail price, rose to $3.447 per gallon, a 10.24-cent-per-gallon increase from Friday’s price.
Plant profitability for ethanol also rose Monday, as the higher prices lifted revenues.

147,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 25, 2014 03:30PM ET</span>",Here's How The Coffee Market Can Determine What Kind You Drink ,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - Wide price spreads for two types of coffee beans traded in New York and London dampen demand for the world’s most popular coffee bean, Latin America’s Arabica, just as demand for Asian Robusta rises.
“If you had a little more spread, then you would be growing that [Arabica] demand much stronger,” said BNP Paribas SA EPA:BNP agricultural strategist Keith Flury at a coffee industry conference on Saturday. “But you’re not: you’re growing the Robusta demand.”

Arabica coffee beans, grown in Brazil, Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America, are the type best known to Western consumers and used exclusively by chains like Starbucks Corporation NASDAQ:SBUX. Robusta beans are largely popular in Asia and in instant coffee. They are produced by Vietnam and the Ivory Coast, among other countries.
Traders watch the Arabica-Robusta spread, or price differential, to monitor variations in demand and price. Robusta futures are traded on London’s LIFFE exchange, while Arabica contracts trade in New York. Many consumers and industry experts view Arabica as superior in quality and flavor.
“The market is encouraging Arabica rationing and production along with Robusta consumption,” reads a presentation given by Flury on emerging market and currency impacts on coffee. The key price spread last peaked in 2011, though current levels compare more closely to ratios from 2012.
Arbitrage between Arabica and Robusta jumped almost 64 percent from January to February, said the International Coffee Organization in its latest monthly report. By the start of March, the differential exceeded $1 per pound, as Robusta stocks fell to their lowest level on record on the London futures market.

Back at the end of 2013, BNP Paribas forecast stronger Arabica consumption in 2014, based on low prices and little difference in Arabica-Robusta prices. Now that Arabica coffee prices have rallied dramatically thanks to drought in Brazil, the world’s largest coffee producer, that view must be revised, according to Flury.   
“The idea that the world is going to consume more Arabica in 2014: we have to review that again,” said Flury during his presentation. “It’s probably not going to happen on the kind of scale we envisioned, especially with the arbitrage as high as it is.”
Coffee demand has grown slowly but steadily over the past decade, driven mostly by emerging markets. Consumers have drunk more Robusta relative to Arabica, as the latter bean has ceded significant share of global demand.
  

“The growth in demand in Robusta far outweighs the growth in demand of Arabica,” said Flury. “If you look at the demand globally of Arabica, it’s actually been relatively flat for a number of years now.”
Coffee is the best performing commodity for the year to date, gaining 58 percent since the start of 2014. That has been one of the steepest and fastest price gains in coffee ever. One recent 20 percent surge came as the steepest weekly rally since 1999, reported Reuters.
High price differentials can even push coffee roasters to tweak the composition of their coffee blends, to take advantage of cheap Robusta prices, according to the ICO.
“If the arbitrage is too high, he might want to use more robusta to reduce the total cost,” said Mauricio Galindo, the organization’s head of operations, in an email to IBTimes.  
Arabica-robusta coffee blends, frowned upon by some market participants, were last seen in 2011, when Arabica coffee touched over $3 per pound. On Tuesday, Arabica coffee traded at $1.74/lb in New York.

148,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 25, 2014 03:27PM ET</span>",Lithuanian Energy Minister Urges US To Export More Natural Gas And Ease Europe's Russian Addiction,"By Meagan Clark - Lithuanian Energy Minister Jaroslav Neverovic implored U.S. Senators Tuesday to help expedite the permitting process for companies to export liquefied natural gas from the U.S. into the global market, saying his and other nations' dependence on Russian energy is crippling.  
Neverovic joined American energy experts to testify before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, chaired for the first time by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. The hearing comes as two other congressional committees and the full Senate debates whether to send more natural gas overseas and as natural gas producers and their supporters insist that exporting the fossil fuel from the U.S. will dampen Russia’s influence and strengthen U.S. allies.

“I am… here to plead with you and your colleagues to do everything within your power to help us achieve that objective [energy independence] by expediting the release of some of your abundant natural gas resources into the world market,” Neverovic said.
The Soviet Union annexed Lithuania and the other Baltic States during World War II, though the U.S. never recognized the annexations as legal. They regained their independence with the Soviet collapse in 1991.
Lithuania is 100 percent dependent on Russia for its natural gas, and Lithuanian families and businesses pay 30 percent more for natural gas than citizens in other European countries, he said. To compare, Ukraine relies on Russia for about 60 percent of its natural gas supply, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Institute for 21st Century Energy.
Currently, U.S. LNG exports to non-Free Trade Agreement countries (most countries that desire the natural gas) must be considered “in the public interest” by the Department of Energy. To expedite the process, President Barack Obama could authorize all pending applications to export LNG to be in the public interest, or Congress could amend the Natural Gas Act that stipulates the current process.
Neverovic said he has recently met with officials from the Obama administration, but when questioned, admitted that they did not promise anything regarding LNG exports.
“They talked nice to you but in fact they failed to give you the assurance that you hoped for that we would actually get the action,” Sen. John Barasso (R-Wy.) said to Neverovic during the hearing. “And I would think that if the administration is not ready to make that commitment today, it is dependent on Congress to act.”
In about 250 days, Lithuania will open its own LNG import terminal, to float in the seaport Klaipeda. The terminal will be the Baltic States’ first large-scale import LNG facility. The European Union countries currently have 22 operating LNG import facilities, but they have been operating at minimal capacities because LNG prices in recent years have been high.
All of the energy advisers testifying agreed that U.S. LNG exports would decrease the global price, which would reduce Russia’s monopoly power.
“Wherever U.S. natural gas exports go, even Asia, they would reduce Russia’s monopoly and benefit Europe,” David Montgomery, senior vice president of NERA Economic Consulting, said.
David Goldwyn, senior fellow at the Energy Security Initiative at the Brookings Institution, said that beyond accelerating LNG export permits, the U.S. should encourage the E.U. to build and connect more pipelines, soften regulations at entry points to pipelines and promote indigenous gas in those countries.
Edward Chow, senior fellow at the Energy and National Security Program at the Center for Strategic International Studies, agreed that there is much Europe can do to help itself.
“They need to look at developing further their own resources beyond renewables,” Chow said. “Why not look at their potential resources in oil and gas and coal rather than importing it from other places?”
The panel of witnesses also agreed that if Congress accelerated the permitting process for LNG exports, the signal sent to the global gas market and Russia in particular would be significant.
Since the majority of contracts for gas in Europe are based on long-term pricing, a signal sent to the market “would strengthen the buyers, knowing there will be more gas on the market, knowing they don’t have to attach themselves to these long-term contracts,” Neverovic said. “This signal would be very important.”
“It would be very important,” Goldwyn agreed. “It would impact the market cap. for Russian companies right now… when we do things in the market today, the impact is now.”
The House Subcommittee on Energy and Power, under the Committee on Energy and Commerce, is holding a similar hearing Tuesday afternoon at 1:30 (EST).

183,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 21, 2014 03:00PM ET</span>","Will The Coffee, Cocoa, Wheat Price Rally Endure?","By Kathleen Caulderwood - Agricultural commodities prices have been on the rise in 2014 thanks to droughts, disease and distress about the conflict in Ukraine.
Brazilian coffee, American wheat and West African cocoa rates have reached strikingly high levels – but economists say the situation isn’t permanent.  



“We think that the sharp rise in agricultural prices since the beginning of the year is likely to be a spike rather the start of an upward trend,” wrote Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a note this morning.
“Past experience suggests that the market tends to factor in worst-case scenarios for bad weather, so there may well be some fall back in prices if the damage isn’t as bad as first feared,” wrote Pugh, citing recent rains in Brazil that could offset damage from January and December floods, which raised concerns about crop yields and sent coffee prices spiking. CE
For instance, the price of Arabica coffee is up more than 70 percent since the end of 2013. Brazil produces 35 percent of the global crop, and has been plagued by bad weather and disease.  
Droughts in December and January have raised fears of low crop yields this year, which has brought up prices. Plus, a type of fungus called coffee rust has damaged more than 20 percent of the global supply, according to the Costa Rican Coffee Institute.
It’s even affecting the country’s economy.
“The drought in Brazil is pushing some food prices up, and some argue that weather effects have been behind the recent increase of 2014 inflation expectations to 6.11 percent from 6.01 previously,” wrote analysts from Merrill Lynch Global Research in a note.
But Brazilian coffee has weathered worse storms before.
However, “these pressures are likely to be much more muted than in 2007/2008 in our view, as slack is building in many economies,” they added.  
In the U.S., a devastating continues to decimate western states, sparking fears of low crop yields.
California is hit the hardest, and will record its third-driest winter on record, and its warmest ever, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture weekly weather and crop bulletin. 
Yesterday, wheat futures jumped to a ten-month high on speculation about continued dry weather. Soybeans and corn prices also jumped.
“Soybeans prices have staged a recovery over the past week on strong demand alongside concerns about tight US supplies,” reads a note from analysts at Deutsche Bank.
However, weather is likely to change soon, which should quell the fears and bring prices towards normal rates.  
“We expect the surge in wheat prices may start to ease in response to favorable weather in the US plains and as fears over a disruption in grain exports from the Ukraine moderate,” the note reads.  
Meanwhile, increased demand for from emerging markets coupled with a drought in West Africa has sent the cocoa price up more than 11 percent since January
“We are looking at a situation where elevated cocoa prices are going to be much more the norm,” said Sterling Smith, a Citigroup futures specialist to the Wall Street Journal. 
“you can’t ramp up cocoa production like you can ramp up corn production,” he added.
West Africa, including Ghana and Ivory Coast accounts for nearly 70 percent of the world’s cocoa-bean production.
However, it’s likely that growing prices will also stem demand, which will mellow out the increase in coming months.

The May contract settled up 0.29% at $99.17 a barrel on Wednesday.
Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $97.00 a barrel, Monday's low, and resistance at $102.89 a barrel, the high from March 7.
The dollar shot up after Yellen suggested at a Wednesday press conference that interest rates could rise six months after the Fed's bond-buying program ends.
The Fed is currently buying $55 billion in Treasury and mortgage debt a month, and expectations for the monetary authority to taper that figure gradually and close the program by fall followed by rate hikes in 2015 strengthened the dollar against most major currencies.
Fed asset purchases aim to stimulate the economy by suppressing interest rates, weakening the dollar as long as they remain in effect, and talk of their dismantling strengthens the greenback.
Elsewhere, data on Thursday showed that fewer individuals sought first-time jobless benefits in U.S. last week than markets were expecting, which added to the dollar's gains.
The Department of Labor reported that the number of people filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending March 15 rose by 5,000 to 320,000 from the previous week’s total of 315,000. Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 10,000 last week.
A separate report showed that manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia-region expanded at a faster rate than expected in March,
In a report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that its manufacturing index improved to a reading of 9.0 this month from February’s -6.3 reading. Analysts had expected the index to rise to 3.8 in March.
On the index, a reading above 0.0 indicates improving conditions, below indicates worsening conditions.
The survey’s broadest indicators for general activity, new orders, and shipments increased and recorded positive readings this month, suggesting a return to growth following weather-related weakness in February.
Company employment levels were near steady, but responses reflected optimism about adding to payrolls over the next six months.
The survey's indicators of future activity reflected optimism about continued growth over the next six months.
Soft housing data failed to seriously dent the greenback's advance, as markets dismissed the disappointing numbers as the product of rough winter weather, which kept oil prices at bay.
The National Association of Realtors reported earlier that existing home sales fell 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted 4.60 million units in February from 4.62 million in January.
February’s pace of sales was the lowest since July 2012.

Bearish supply data pushed prices lower as well.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in April traded at $4.365 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, down 2.67%. The commodity hit session high of $4.474 and a low of $4.350.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.342 per million British thermal units, Friday's low, and resistance at $4.585, Monday's high.
The official arrival of spring sent natural gas prices falling on Thursday.
Updated weather-forecasting models called for cold snap next week though they scaled back the intensity of the cooler weather, while the rest of March and early April should see seasonably mild temperatures.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
A bearish weekly U.S. inventory report dampened prices as well.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended March 14 fell by 48 billion cubic feet, compared to expectations for a decline of 59 billion cubic feet.
Supplies fell by 74 billion cubic feet in the same week a year earlier while the five-year average change for the week is a drop of 30 billion cubic feet.

199,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 20, 2014 06:30AM ET</span>",Guess Which Bugs Are Back?,"By Kathleen Caulderwood - Over a decade ago, a biotechnology company designed corn plants that poison certain pests in an effort to lower use of pesticide sprays. 
It worked for a while, but cost-cutting farmers haven't heeded scientists' warnings about overusing the genetically modified plants. 
Today, the bugs are back. And they're getting tougher. 
“The western corn rootworm has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to adapt to pest management strategies,” reads a March 17 report from a team of scientists led by Aaron Gassmann, an entomologist at Iowa State University. 
The report found a “significant correlation” between the number of years the modified corn was used, and the survival rate of the worms.  
“The evolution of resistance by the western corn rootworm could cut short the benefits of Bt maize,” the report reads.
Last year, revenues from U.S. corn crops topped $60 billion, according to the USDA. But a major chunk of that could be at risk, if this pest gets its way. 

More than 40 million tons of corn never reach market because of these worms, according to Syngenta AG (NYSE: SYT) the biochemical company that created the new strain of bug-resistant corn.  
The adult rootworms lay eggs on the surface of corn plants, which allows larvae to tunnel inside, eating as they go.
“Once corn borers enter the corn stalk to attack the plant from the inside, conventional treatments are not always effective, or even possible,” states a report from Syngenta.  
After that, it’s only a matter of time before the hollow stalk is blown over by a gust of wind or a heavy rainstorm.
The company’s scientists infused ordinary corn plants with a gene called Cry1Ab. It makes the plant produce a protein called Bt through its leaves, stalks and ears, which is deadly for the insects.
The new plant was commercialized in 1996, and worked well for a while.
But the worm would not be easily defeated.    
Scientists have been warning for more than a decade that the modified crops must be used sparingly. It’s important for farmers to keep non-modified sections of their land, to ensure the toxin-exposed bugs breed with the ordinary ones, to stop evolution of resistance.  
Agricultural scientists suggested that farmers keep 50 percent of their crops unmodified. The Environmental Protection Agency has decreed that only 10 to 20 percent of a crop should be non-modified.
But even that hasn’t happened.  
“Sometimes convincing growers to plant non-Bt maize refuges is a challenges because it requires careful planning of where to plant the refuge and could reduce yields,” reads a 2012 report from Nature Education.
Farmers loved the new, modified plants. By 2009, more than 45 percent of American maize crops were Bt corn, and more than 58 million hectares were planted worldwide by 2010.
But in 2011, damaged crops were reported in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota -- all separate cases in which the bugs evolved on their own.
A year later, 22 scientists wrote to the EPA, urging more oversight of Bt maize usage amid more and more reports of “greater than expected damage” to the protected corn. 
“We are concerned that high commodity prices and other factors may have fueled an insurance-based approach to corn rootworm management,” the scientists wrote, adding that this “will only increase insect resistance development in the long term.”  
And today, the problem is only getting worse and farmers may have to use older methods to protect themselves. “These recent cases suggest a need to develop more integrated management solutions for pests targeted by Bt crops,” states Monday’s report.
It’s suggested that farmers sill use older methods such as crop rotation, along with the genetically modified seeds, to stem the pest outbreak.
“Sole reliance on Bt crops for management of agriculture pests will likely hasten the evolution of resistance in some cases, thereby diminishing the benefits that these crops provide,” the writers add."

209,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 19, 2014 12:00PM ET</span>",Meet The Ex-US Marine Who Wants To Reform Colombia's Coffee Trade,"By Patricia Rey Mallén - James Cummiskey knows about change. A former Marine and start-up executive, the Alaska native’s life turned 180 degrees four years ago, when he decided he needed to switch scenery and moved to Colombia on a whim.
A mere look at the country convinced him to stay. With a steady, growing economy and improving governance, Colombia proved to be the perfect post-early-retirement adventure for the 54-year-old Cummiskey.
Q: So how did you end up in Colombia?
That is an interesting story!  A buddy of mine had been insisting for several years that I should move here, he was adamant that I would love it. Initially I just couldn’t do it for personal and family reasons, but then I got divorced, he asked me again and I though, sure why not? So four years ago I took up on his offer, and instantly fell in love.
I had traveled a lot, but somehow Medellín trapped me like no other place had before. It is just really so exotic and cool, and the people are the most amazing people in the world. This is just a dreamland! And there is really so much opportunity down here.
Q: What kind of opportunities?
Colombia is right now one of the best countries on earth to do business.  The economy is growing at an accelerated rate, the homicide rate is the lowest in 20 years, and it is even lower than in major U.S. cities. So, this is an environment with amazing potential, amazing people and I just could not let it pass.
Q: Why did you decide to move to Medellín as opposed to Bogotá?
The weather. What can I say, I am an Alaskan -- and the weather here it is beautiful, it is an eternal spring. Bogotá is much colder. And besides, there is just something about Medellín, its attitude, the people, that bewitches you.
Q: What moved you to try your hand in the coffee industry?
Well, in all honesty, I wasn’t planning to move here for business. My idea was to live my retirement here. But there was the caveat, and it is that to live in Colombia you need a visa. And a way to get a visa is to start a business. And even though my first instinct was to find a different way, as my time in the country progressed I became aware of the reality of the coffee industry. And I almost couldn’t believe it, because the coffee industry is so broken, in almost every level! It is the most inefficient industry I have ever seen.
Q: How so?
There are two main problems that I see in the industry. First, is that 99 percent of coffee is homogenized, which means it is mixed. The equivalent to this would be, let's say, in the wine industry -- which 40 or 50 years ago was what coffee is today. So back then wine was also mixed, but now the industry has reached a point of development [where] we celebrate and cherish individual vineyards, without getting the grapes mixed. That is what is going to happen with coffee. But it won’t until we stop mixing the beans, and all of that uniqueness and hard work gets lost.
And the other, which is the bottom line really for the crisis of the industry, is that the farmer always gets screwed. They get the smallest percentage of profits, around 5 percent, and, on top of that, watch how the tradition of the industry is smashed.
So, four years ago, my partner and I started Cima,  Spanish for “summit,” to try and work it from the inside.

Q: How do you hope to improve the coffee industry?
 Well, for once, we never mix coffee beans. We strive to maintain that pureness, so that the bean identity is preserved and we build that relationship between the consumer and the tradition.
Our second goal [is] we want to eliminate all intermediaries, including ourselves, between the consumer and the producer of the coffee, so more profit goes to the farmers. In every bag of our coffee, there is a code that connects it directly to the farmer, so the consumer knows exactly where it came from. You can even watch videos of the farm in real time online, you can ask them questions through us. It has happened that I am there in the farm with my cell phone and I get a comment from a customer about a particular cup of coffee, and I know exactly who to give it to.
Q: Who are your consumers?
The thing about coffee is that three billion people drink it. After water, is the most widely consumed drink in the world. So there is immense potential for clientele.
We started out selling green beans, which are usually shipped from Colombia, and other countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia to the countries were it is consumed, and the beans are roasted there. So our initial clients were professional roasters.
Now we are looking at diversifying into the other customers, the consumers. We are becoming our own roasters. The thing with coffee is that, unlike wine, it has no scoring system, no way for consumers to trust the quality of the coffee. So we are trying to create one, too.
Q: As a coffee entrepreneur in Colombia, what do you think about Starbucks opening its first store in Bogotá?
That will be really interesting when it happens, certainly. It will not be the first chain in Colombia, that would be Juan Valdez, but it will be a good addition I believe. Starbucks is such a successful model -- it introduced Americans to the good coffee culture, because their product is actually good! What Starbucks has done phenomenally is the creation of the “third space,” as they call their stores, the place to unwind from your home and the offic-, the creation of a particular environment in which to enjoy the coffee. And it will be interesting to see how that plugs in with the Colombian people.  "

(NYSE: BP) is back bidding on drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico not far from the site where its Macondo deepwater well blew out and killed 11 people and created the biggest oilo spill in U.S. history.
The EPA and BP agreed earlier this month to lift a 16-month suspension from federal contracts that had blocked the British energy giant BP from bidding during the previous three auctions in the area.
The company joins 41 other oil and gas companies Wednesday morning in New Orleans to bid in the Department of the Interior’s high-stakes sale of tracts.
 
Eight of BP’s 13 bids are for blocks near the site of Macondo well that exploded in April 2010, which killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the ocean.

During the last central Gulf sale in March 2013, the sale’s highest bid was $81.8 million, offered by Statoil and Samson. High bids totaled $1.2 billion.
Most of the 380 bids filed before the auction are for deep-water territory, according to pre-sale figures released by the Department of Interior. In March 2013, 52 companies filed 407 bids.
The auction was scheduled for 10 am EST but was then delayed about two hours.
Other big oil and gas companies to bid include ExxonMobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (NYSE: RDS.A). "
212,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 19, 2014 11:15AM ET</span>",Why JPMorgan Is Selling Commodities Business,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - Banking powerhouse JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has agreed to sell its commodities business to giant Swiss commodities house Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., reports the Wall Street Journal.
JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, initially valued its commodities unit at $3.3 billion back in October 2013, when it first warmed to a potential sale. Terms of the deal with Mercuria aren’t yet public, though the deal could be done by summer, according to sources cited by the Journal.
Swiss traders and Mercuria executives Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi have rapidly built Mercuria into a closely held commodities empire, which saw over $100 billion in revenue last year, reported Bloomberg earlier. It has come to compete with the biggest independent commodity traders, like Glencore Xstrata PLC (LON:GLEN), as a result.
“This gives them a strong opportunity for growth and puts them close to the top players in the league,” Oliver Wyman partner Roland Rechtsteiner told Bloomberg earlier this month, of the potential acquisition.
JPMorgan’s commodities unit has made $750 million in yearly operating profits before compensation is factored in, according to Bloomberg.

Many Wall Street banks have sold or exited their commodities business as of late. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) sold its oil storage and trading unit to Russia’s Rosneft’ NK OAO (MCX:ROSN) in late 2013. Deutsche Bank AG (FRA:DBK), a major bank player in commodities, announced in December that it’d quit almost all of its commodity businesses. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (LON:RBS) and UBS AG (VTX:UBSN) have all  wound down their commodities work or signaled they plan to.
That trend comes as the Federal Reserve considers tighter regulation on commodities trading at banks.
“Physical commodities activities can pose unique risks to financial holding companies,” said the Fed’s director of banking supervision and regulation Michael Gibson before a U.S. Senate subcommittee in January.
Fed regulation could include caps on assets or revenue related to commodities, higher capital requirements, or simple bans on holdings of certain physical commodities. “Our review of the commodity-related activities of our supervised firms is ongoing,” said Gibson then.
Revenues for the ten largest investment bank commodity businesses fell to $4.5 billion in 2013 from $14 billion in 2008, according to London analytics company Coalition. "

Soybeans last traded at $14.3413 a bushel during U.S. morning hours, up 1.12%, or 15.93 cents. The May soybean contract rallied 1.9%, or 26.4 cents, on Tuesday to settle at $14.1820 a bushel.
The National Oilseed Processors Association said on Monday its U.S. members crushed 141.612 million bushels of soybeans in February, above market expectations for 140.9 million bushels.
Elsewhere on the CBOT, wheat for May delivery hit a daily high of $6.9538 a bushel, before turning lower to last trade at $6.8950 a bushel, down 0.39%, or 2.7 cents.
The May wheat contract jumped 2.67%, or 18 cents, on Tuesday to settle at $6.9240 a bushel as mounting concerns over the health of the U.S. winter-wheat crop provided support.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that that approximately 34% of the Kansas wheat crop was rated in good to excellent condition, down from 37% a week earlier, as dry and cold temperatures damaged crops. Kansas is the largest wheat producing state in the U.S.
During the past two weeks, wheat futures have risen nearly 14%, their biggest two-week rally since July 2012.

219,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 19, 2014 07:15AM ET</span>",This Is China’s White Gold Rush,"By Moran Zhang - The “white gold rush” is on. China’s growing appetite for dairy products is expected to benefit Chinese dairy producers as well as exporting countries like New Zealand.
The dairy industry in China has experienced rapid growth in recent years. The market was worth $40.6 billion last year, compared with only $20.7 billion in 2008.
According to HSBC, liquid milk is the China dairy market’s core product, representing more than 80 percent of total consumption. But low liquid milk penetration rate in China means there is substantial growth potential over the next decade.
While per capita liquid milk consumption has multiplied from 1.0 kilogram (2.2 pounds) in 2000 to 9.4 kilograms in 2011, it still remains low compared with other developed and emerging markets.
The milk-drinking levels in South Africa, Japan and Korea are 3.4 times to 3.6 times China's, and those in Australia and U.K. are as high as 12 times greater.

The liquid milk sector in the world’s second-largest economy is fairly concentrated, following consolidation among producers in the past few years.
Two of the largest national players, China Mengniu Dairy Company Ltd. and Yili Group, have expanded their combined share from 35 percent in 2007 to 41 percent in 2012.
“We expect the consolidation trend will continue for another decade, with national and regional players expanding further into the rural market,” HSBC analyst Christopher Leung said in a note.

China is the world's top dairy importer. Imports of milk powder (including infant formula) represented 33 percent of the global market in 2012, rising to 38 percent in 2013, according to HSBC.
A series of milk contamination scandals since 2008, in which Chinese-made formula tainted with the industrial chemical melamine killed six infants and sickened 300,000, has shaken consumer confidence in domestic dairy products.
“Demand for imported infant formula has been exceptionally strong in the past few years as consumers have increasingly traded up to higher-end infant formula products,” Leung said.
The easing of the one-child policy will also boost the growth of the infant formula milk powder market, and HSBC expects this to raise consumption of infant formula products by 4 percent to 8 percent yearly.

Rising demand from China helped New Zealand record its first trade surplus in January since March 2012, and its highest surplus ever for the first month of the year.
Of 4.1 billion New Zealand dollars ($3.4 billion US) in total exports, 1.2 billion went to China -- a leap of 92 percent from a year earlier. Milk powder, butter and cheese made up just over 40 percent of exports, and nearly half went to China.
In February, French food giant Danone SA (EPA:BN) paid $663 million to more than double its stake in China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited (HKG:2319) as the nation’s demand for dairy products rises.
On the same day, RRJ Capital, a private equity firm run by former Goldman Sachs partner Richard Ong, announced it plans to invest 1.5 billion yuan ($248 million) in a unit of Bright Dairy & Food Co. Ltd. (SHA:600597), China’s third-largest milk producer.
At the same time, tighter regulations have led to consolidation among domestic dairy farms and milk collection centers, with the larger and better-run enterprises surviving.
The Chinese government said last year it wanted to cut the number of domestic milk powder manufacturers to 50 from 127, and to see 10 large dairy entities with an annual income of more than 2 billion yuan take over 70 percent of the market in five years, a Fitch report said.
In addition, the rapid increase in prices in the past few years has provided farmers with greater incentive to focus on the safety and quality of their raw milk."

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.342 per million British thermal units, Friday's low, and resistance at $4.585, Monday's high.
Gas prices shot up on Monday as a winter storm trekked across the heavily populated central and northeastern portions of the country, a system that investors bet would hike demand for heating.
By Tuesday, profit takers sent the commodity into negative territory.
Updated weather-forecasting models called seasonably mild temperatures across the Midwest and Southeast through the rest of the week, though a possible return of cooler mercury readings gave natural gas some support.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.001 trillion cubic feet, the lowest for this time of year since 2003.
Prices slumped to a seven-week low of $4.341 per million British thermal units on Friday, amid concerns that the arrival of spring will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for heating.

Non-OPEC supplies grew by 1.3 million barrels a day in 2013 and are expected to increase even more this year, by another 1.7 million barrels a day, led by the United States and Canada. That would be the highest rate of growth since at least the early nineties. Russia, China and Brazil will contribute to the rise as well.

February was the first time in five months that OPEC crude supplies passed 30 million barrels a day. Iraq led the rise, with output flowing to 35-year highs.
OPEC supply rose by 500,000 barrels a day to 30.49 million barrels a day.
IEA forecasts global oil demand growth of 1.4 million barrels a day in 2014, to 92.7 million barrels a day. Emerging markets will lead the growth, with non-OPEC Asia expected to produce half the gain. 
Global crude refineries are expected to grow by 1 million barrels a day this quarter, to 76.6 million barrels a day.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that it will sell 5 million barrels of crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to test reserve system infrastructure. Deliveries are expected in April.

The cap is required by a deal over its nuclear program with six global powers (U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Russia and China).

Iran’s crude exports averaged 1.16 million barrels a day in January, according to the IEA, and based on preliminary estimates, remained as high in February. Crude exports from the country averaged 1 million barrels a day in 2013.
The European Union bans oil imports from Iran, but Asian buyers are increasingly comfortable with Iranian oil because political risks are declining. India’s oil imports from Iran increased by 175,000 barrels a day in January to 415,000 barrels a day. Imports to Japan and China dropped by about 45,000 and 40,000 barrels a day.
In February, imports of Iranian oil grew by 155,000 barrels a day in Japan and 145,000 barrels a day in South Korea, making up for lower sales to China and India. The U.S. reportedly asked Indian officials to cut back on the country's Iranian oil imports to fulfill the nuclear deal.

264,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 14, 2014 06:00AM ET</span>",What Indonesia's Fuel Subsidy Is Costing,"By Sophie Song - Indonesia’s fuel subsidy is now reaching critical condition, exceeding the combined expenditures on health, education, defense and social protection, despite last year’s reform, and will likely get worse in the coming year.
Since 1967, Indonesia has been heavily subsidizing the retail prices of diesel, gasoline and kerosene fuel to protect the purchasing power of the poor. But the outdated subsidy has become astronomically expensive, now the third-highest fuel subsidy in the world, according to a study carried out by the Energy Institute at Haas.

In 2012, the subsidy cost the Indonesian government around $18 billion, or 2.2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), much higher than the budgeted $13.7 billion. In 2013, while oil prices stayed put, the rupiah depreciated significantly, and as a result, the subsidy is likely to have cost the government $25 billion, more than 25 percent above the budgeted $19.3 billion, a research note from Societe Generale on Thursday said.
What’s more, Indonesia has been a net oil importer since 2004, and is expected to import a record high of $63.5 billion in 2018, compared to $40.4 billion at present, which means it is still becoming costlier for the government to maintain the policy. The subsidy has already reached 20.9 percent of central government expenditure, from just 14.5 percent in 2006.
The Indonesian government hiked fuel prices last year, after overshooting the legal budget deficit of 3 percent, but the results were limited as with previous attempts.
“The reforms in 2005, 2008 and 2013 were more successful,” Societe Generale analysts wrote. “But insufficient to offset higher global oil prices and currency depreciation, and hence was not sufficient enough in taming demand.”
While analysts are generally upbeat about the wider economic conditions of the country for 2014, wider and more systematic reforms to the subsidy program to “contain its burgeoning oil subsidy burden,” Societe Generale added, with a focus on increasing investment in energy production to boost both oil exploration as well as refining capacities, creating a more sustainable energy consumption mix and most importantly, continuing to hike oil prices.
“Political compulsions have ensured that Indonesian policymakers have so far taken the easy way out by keeping fuel prices highly subsidized and only opting to raise prices when ballooning subsidies threaten to assume serious proportions,” Societe Generale analysts wrote. “We believe Indonesia may do well to replicate India’s policy of regular (monthly) and moderate hikes (less than a percent in prices of subsidized fuel to ensure a less painful process of adjustment.”

266,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 14, 2014 03:30AM ET</span>","Russia Gold Sales Flagged As Outside Risk, If Sanctions Come ","By Nat Rudarakanchana - If Russia’s central bank sold gold to raise cash ahead of Western sanctions, that could send shivers throughout the gold market.
Societe Generale SA (EPA:GLE) analyst Michael Haigh flagged the potential risk in a research note earlier this week, but told IBTimes it was unlikely that Russia’s central bank would sell gold to recover from sanctions, to make up for lost oil revenue.
To be clear, all indications are that Russia has mostly held onto its gold reserves, which are typically used to diversify central bank holdings. Russia sold a small amount of central bank gold in September, surprising some gold investors.
Swiss investors quizzed Haigh recently about the Russian government’s options in the face of U.S. or EU sanctions, he explained. It’s not unheard of for central banks to sell gold to raise funds, he added, citing Cyprus’ ultimately failed talk of a 400 million ($554.7 million) euro gold sale in April 2013 amid economic uncertainty.
“We don’t expect that they’re going to do it, or that they’d need to do it,” Haigh told IBTimes, referring to Russia’s options. “We were echoing what our clients were worrying about.”
But: “Could they sell gold to support their needs? Yes, of course they could. That, like the Cyprus effect, would send shivers through the gold market,” he added.
According to World Gold Council data from Thursday, Russia remained the eighth highest holder of gold in the world, holding 1034 metric tons or 8.3 percent of reserves. It bought about 77 tons net in 2013.
Russian reserves slid by 0.5 tons from February to March 2014. One ton of gold is worth about $43.9 million, at current spot prices of $1367 per troy ounce. A sale of a ton or less is considered tiny by many gold investors.
“It would probably hurt sentiment a little bit, but I don’t think it would have a significant physical impact, unless they [Russia] sold an enormous quantity,” said George Milling-Stanley, who advises several central banks on gold buying, to IBTimes.
Russia is one of about 20 countries which have bought gold significantly in the past several years, including the Ukraine itself, said Milling-Stanley. Russia has bought gold for over 20 years, since the end of the Soviet Union.
“I find it very difficult to believe that even sanctions, however serious they might be, would actually prompt them to sell gold,” said Milling-Stanley, who holds that gold is a harder and more reliable asset than the U.S. dollar or the euro. “I think they might want to get rid of some of their dollars.”
Russia could even request gold in payment for their oil and gas exports, noted precious metals seller GoldCore, though that’s an outside possibility.

271,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 13, 2014 11:52AM ET</span>","Crude gains on U.S. data, Chinese indicators weigh","Investing.com - Crude prices rose on Thursday after better-than-expected U.S. retail sales data sparked demand for the growth-sensitive commodity, though soft Chinese production figures capped gains.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in April traded at $98.35 a barrel during U.S. trading, up 0.37%. New York-traded oil futures hit a session low of $97.68 a barrel and a high of $98.60 a barrel.
The April contract settled down 2.04% at $97.99 a barrel on Wednesday.
Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $97.57 a barrel, Wednesday's low, and resistance at $102.89 a barrel, Friday's high.
Oil prices found reason to rise on better-than-expected retail sales and jobless claims data.
The Commerce Department reported that U.S. retail sales rose 0.3% in February, ending two months of declines and better than market expectations for a 0.2% increase.
Core retail sales, which exclude automobile sales, also rose 0.3% last month, ahead of expectations for a 0.2% rise.
Separately, the Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing initial jobless claims in the U.S. fell by 9,000 to a three-month low of 315,000 last week.
Analysts had expected initial jobless claims to rise by 6,000 last week.
The numbers painted a picture of a U.S. economy that is on the mend, poised to demand more fuel and energy going forward.
Soft production figures out of China offset U.S. data.
Chinese industrial production rose 8.6% in the first two months of 2014, according to data released on Thursday, missing market expectations for a 9.5% increase, while Chinese retail sales rose by 11.8%, beneath market forecasts for a 13.5% gain.
The Asian nation is the world's second largest oil consumer after the U.S. and has been the engine of strengthening demand.
Investors also remained wary as tensions between Russia and the West remained high ahead of Sunday's referendum in Ukraine’s Crimea region, now controlled by pro-Russian forces, on whether citizens want to join Russia.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil futures for May delivery were down 0.15% and trading at US$107.19 a barrel, while the spread between the Brent and U.S. crude contracts stood at US$9.27 a barrel.

272,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 13, 2014 11:45AM ET</span>",Here's How Silver May Fare Under China's War On Pollution,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - Silver may not fare as well as some investors hope, even if the Chinese government’s so-called “war on pollution” tweaks the energy mix in the world’s largest producer of solar panels and phases out coal-powered plants.
Silver is a key ingredient in solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, with silver paste used in crystalline silicon PV cells, according to industry association the Silver Institute. China, too, is the largest producer and exporter of solar panels in the world. The European Union and the U.S. have even complained that China floods their markets with artificially cheap solar panels and kill domestic producers.  

The case for higher silver prices is simple: if China’s leaders crack down on pollution, as avowed last week, China’s energy production could shift from coal-fired electricity plants towards alternative energy, like solar panels. That’s the case made by ETF Securities in a note earlier this week.
Solar panel uses takes up about 5 percent of annual silver supply, estimated ETF Securities research director Mike McGlone. Last year the Chinese government also mandated an increase in domestic solar capacity to 25 gigawatts by 2015, a further drive to demand, he added.
Chinese demand for silver in solar panels could double in a few years, if that mandate goes through, said McGlone. “It’s certainly increasing rapidly,” he said, of such demand.
“Who’s the largest PV producer in the world?” he added. “Their biggest source of pollution is coal-fired electricity plants. If we can replace some of that electricity production with renewable solar panels, that’s perfect. It makes sense.”
About 100 million ounces of silver are projected for use for solar energy in 2015, about double today’s levels, on Silver Institute estimates.
But that view doesn’t chime with other industry data.
Global silver demand for solar panels could actually decrease 1.5 percent in 2014, to just 52.4 million ounces, metals consultancy Thomson Reuters GFMS estimates. China’s solar panel industry used up over 35 million ounces in 2013, but that could decline slightly in 2014, as producers become thriftier, to a potential low of 30 million ounces.
That decline also comes amid China’s first ever corporate bond default, which shook solar panel maker Shanghai Chaori Solar. Solar panel prices have also fallen sharply in recent years, leading to consolidation and cuts within the sector, reported the Wall Street Journal.
Chinese net silver imports are projected to continue falling in 2014 thanks to a cut in unnecessary and “uneconomic” solar panel production capacity, noted Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) Government subsidies will be cut substantially, Citigroup analysts said, removing a spur to growth.
China also exports many of its solar panels, complicating the picture. China made almost two thirds of solar panels worldwide in 2012. Still, they installed 12 gigawatts of solar panels within China in 2013, or a third of global installations.  
The long term case is clear, even if the timeline for boosts to silver prices is fuzzy, argued McGlone.
In 2005, China used less than a million silver ounces in producing solar panels, relative to the 38 million ounces absorbed in 2012, according to Reuters GFMS data.
Even as silver powder and paste makers reduce silver content in solar cells, to stay competitive and help struggling customers reduce input costs, Chinese solar panel installations are nonetheless forecast to grow.
“China expects to increase installations to 14 GW in 2014 and is increasingly focusing on pushing domestic demand as it loses business with the U.S., due to the trade war,” said GFMS.
China’s global market share in solar panel production likely grew in 2012.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in April fell to a session low of $4.382 per million British thermal units, the weakest since January 21.
Natural gas last traded at $4.401 per million British thermal units during U.S. morning hours, down 2%, or 8.9 cents. Futures traded at $4.411 prior to the release of the supply data.
The April contract lost 2.5%, or 11.5 cents, on Wednesday to settle at $4.490 per million British thermal units amid concerns that the arrival of spring will bring warmer temperatures throughout the U.S. and cut into demand for heating.
Futures were likely to find support at $4.290 per million British thermal units, the low from January 21 and resistance at $4.631, the high from March 12.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended March 7 fell by 195 billion cubic feet, compared to expectations for a decline of 196 billion cubic feet.
Supplies fell by 145 billion cubic feet in the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average is a decline of 95 billion.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.001 trillion cubic feet, the lowest for this time of year since 2004.
Stocks were 958 billion cubic feet less than last year at this time and 858 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 1.859 trillion cubic feet for this time of year.
The report showed that in the East Region, stocks were 395 billion cubic feet below the five-year average, following net withdrawals of 95 billion cubic feet.
Stocks in the Producing Region were 335 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 737 billion cubic feet after a net withdrawal of 79 billion cubic feet.
Market analysts have warned that prices remain vulnerable to even further losses in the near-term as the coldest part of the winter has effectively passed and below-normal temperatures in March mean less than they do in January and February.
Updated weather-forecasting models called for above-normal temperatures across many densely populated areas in the U.S. in the next three to five days.
Spring and fall see the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
Natural gas rallied to a more than five-year high of $6.493 per million British thermal units on February 20 as frigid winter temperatures in the U.S. led households to burn a higher than normal amount of the fuel in furnaces to heat their homes.
Elsewhere on the Nymex, light sweet crude oil futures for delivery in April inched up 0.04%, or $0.04 cents, to trade at $98.03 a barrel, while heating oil for April delivery slumped 0.3% to trade at $2.917 per gallon."

275,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 13, 2014 09:30AM ET</span>",Shell Trying To Tighten Grip On Its American Oil,"By Meagan Clark - Royal Dutch Shell’s (NYSE: RDS.B) CEO Ben van Beurden said Thursday that a tighter grip on its Upstreams Americas business will be integral to its plan to grow cash flow and improve returns.
Losses in resource plays such as shales have impacted Upstreams Americas' profitability, Shell said in a statement on its 2014 Management Day in London. Shell is cutting spending in 2014 by 20 percent compared to 2013 and redirecting onshore investment in Upstream Americas to the lowest cost gas acreage with the best integration potential and to exploration in liquids-rich shales. Shell expects profitable growth to continue in deep-water and heavy oil.
“Shell has a strong asset base and industry leadership in many of its growth themes,” van Beurden said. “While this position of strength gives confidence for the future, it is also clear that we need to get a tighter grip on performance management in Shell. I am determined that, by focusing sharply on our three key priorities – better financial performance, in particular in our Upstream Americas and Downstream businesses, enhanced capital efficiency, and continuing strong project delivery, we will continue to grow our cash flow and improve our returns.”
He also said Shell is determined to deliver a better performance of its asset portfolio this year.
""With sharper accountability in the company, this approach will target growth investment more effectively, focus on areas of the business where performance improvement is most required, and drive asset sales from non-strategic positions,” van Beurden said.
Shell plans to improve growth in upstream businesses that are delivering high returns and strong cash flow. About $35 billion in investments are planned for 2014.

In the short-term, Shell expects cash flow from deep-water projects. In the long-term, Shell plans to identify and mature opportunities in Iraq, Kazakhstan and Nigeria, the latter where thieves have been siphoning off $3 to $8 billion in oil a year and damaging pipelines, according to a report by the Chatham House.
""We are taking stock of our investment opportunities and operating positions,” van Beurden said. “Are our assets attractive economically, and are they resilient to industry cycles? Are our plans credible, are they competitive and are they affordable? This approach is driving hard choices on today's asset base, new opportunities, and disposals plans, where we have recently announced exits from Australia and Italy downstream, Wheatstone LNG in Australia, and US gas-to-liquids.""
So far this year, Shell has sold $4.5 billion in assets as part of its 2014-2015 $15 billion asset-shedding program. "

304,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 11, 2014 10:45AM ET</span>",China Shadow Banking's Use Of Copper Collateral Threatens Red Metal ,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - A Chinese economic slowdown isn’t the only worry on the horizon for copper, as the industrial red metal sees fallout from its use as a financing tool in China, the world’s largest copper consumer.
Copper is used as collateral by companies and investors in China, in an effort to work around strict lending standards enforced by Beijing. Companies obtain a letter of credit, use it to import copper, sell the copper or deploy it as collateral, and often invest in higher yield assets, before paying back the loan, reports the Wall Street Journal.
China is the world’s largest consumer of copper and represents 40 percent of global copper demand. Copper is used in construction, power lines and refrigerators, among other things, so it is often taken as a gauge of industrial and business activity.
But Credit Suisse Group AG (VTX:CSGN) analysts estimate that a third of China’s imported copper is used in financing, while others believe that half of the copper in China’s warehouses is tied up in such financing deals.
The worry is then that a recent drop in copper prices could have a worsening effect on this financing system. Falling copper prices could force borrowers to post more collateral or sell more copper, and a sell-off could drop prices further. Banks may also be less willing to accept a cheaper metal as reliable collateral.

Last Friday, copper fell by its most in one day within about two years, after a Chinese solar technology company defaulted on its corporate bonds. Weak Chinese manufacturing data recently has exacerbated worries about copper.
Expect copper prices to become even more volatile in the near future, wrote Societe Generale commodity analysts in a note on Monday, as China slows and mine supply expands.
As the Chinese government further tightens regulation over so-called “shadow banking”, or unofficial banking and lending in China, there could be a “rapid unwinding” of copper collateral positions, the analysts said.
That could in turn flood the physical market with unwanted copper, plunging prices and resulting in “dramatically higher volatility.”
Copper contracts on New York’s COMEX for March delivery opened at $3.122 a pound on Tuesday. That’s down significantly from a recent high of $4.6 per pound in February 2011, but better than a recent low of $1.275 per pound, reached during the depths of the financial crisis.  "

317,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 10, 2014 12:00PM ET</span>","Natural Gas Exports Still Face Obstacles, Despite Ukraine Promises ","By Nat Rudarakanchana - Exporting natural gas and other forms of energy from the U.S. to foreign markets, a tantalizing long-term scenario bolstered by a U.S. shale oil and gas boom, won’t be easy.
The U.S. must still improve transportation and logistics infrastructure, which can move natural gas from productive inner regions of the country, like North Dakota, to coasts in preparation for exports. The earliest production for a U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal is late 2015, while exports could begin at the second Freeport LNG Development terminal in 2018.
That infrastructure gap means talk by Western officials about exporting natural gas to Ukraine to lessen its dependence on Russia remains a far-fetched scenario for now. Other options vetted by U.S. and EU governments include lessening Europe’s dependence on Russian oil and gas as a whole.
“Everybody is talking about this fracking technology and the North American energy revolution. Well, what does the North American energy revolution mean?” said S&P vice president for commodities indices Jodie Gunzberg to IBTimes in a February interview.
“It depends on the transportation and logistics infrastructure in place, and the deals that can make U.S. natural gas into a global commodity, deals which haven’t happened yet,” she said.
Gunzberg pointed out that natural gas is the only commodity in the benchmark GSCI commodity index based on North American markets only, rather than global production and price data.
That contrasts with international heavyweights like Brent crude oil, an easily transportable resource which determines prices for two thirds of the world’s crude oil trade. Originally traded in London, it has since become a product on the IntercontinentalExchange.
It could be the end of this decade before liquefied natural gas exports ramp up significantly in other countries, like major energy producer Canada, Barclays PLC noted in a December report. The U.S. already exports some natural gas via pipelines to Canada and Mexico, though it has been a net importer of gas for years.
The U.S. has grown natural gas production from about 1.75 trillion cubic feet in 2010 to a forecast 2 trillion cubic feet for 2014, government data show. That boom has been helped by technologies like hydraulic fracturing, or ‘fracking’, which have unlocked huge amounts of shale gas despite criticism from environmental activists.

Political opposition to fracking techniques may hinder U.S. natural gas exports more than underdeveloped infrastructure, according to University of Houston petroleum engineering professor John Lee.
There are few government approvals for exports so far, with few applications and actual permits. There have been six liquefied natural gas export terminals approved so far.
“Not many licenses, not nearly enough have been approved,” he told IBTimes. “Until the permits are obtained, the amount of gas is going to be limited.”
“The U.S. has much of the infrastructure that would be required to export natural gas,” he continued. Unmerited political opposition may be the real threat, according to Lee.
“I don’t think there are any significant risks related to hydraulic fracturing,” he added. “There hasn’t been a single case documented that hydraulic fracturing has harmed any water source, and several top government officials know this.”

321,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 10, 2014 10:00AM ET</span>",Asian Dairy Demand Lifts U.S. Milk Prices ,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - Demand for milk within Asian countries, particularly China, has led to spikes in milk prices in the relatively small $1.8 billion milk futures market, reports the Wall Street Journal.
That has translated into higher prices for global buyers of milk contracts, like big dairy processors and companies, but has also led to slightly higher U.S. retail prices for milk. Government data show retail milk prices rose 1.5 percent in January from a year ago, with forecasts for price hikes of 3.5 percent this year.  
Traditionally the U.S. has competed with milk exporter New Zealand as a major player in the global milk trade. But drought in New Zealand has curbed that budding market this year, so U.S. milk expots to Asian countries have risen.
“What we’ve seen in futures over the last two months in the sharpest upward move I’ve ever seen,” said analyst Eric Meyer of brokerage High Ground Trading, to the Journal. He has followed milk futures since 2001.

U.S. dairy exports grew 19 percent in volume in January from a year ago, according to the U.S. Dairy Export Council. January exports alone were worth $584 million, after a record 2013 for exports.
U.S. market share among global exporters also grew in 2013, inching up 3 percent. U.S exports have expanded annually and consistently over the past decade, and now the United States ships 16 percent of its milk production overseas, up from 6 percent a decade ago.
China has been a key buyer of milk powder supplies, even after a 2008 milk powder scandal that sickened 300,000 people.
Dairy farmers in the U.S. have benefited from the boom. They received 24.7 cents per pound on average for milk in February, up 27 percent from a year ago, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data show.
“Every drop of milk we can squeeze out right now is profitable,” New York state farmer Skip Hardie told the Journal.
New Zealand remains the world’s biggest milk exporter. Earlier this year, U.S. regulatory body the Commodity Futures Trading Commission allowed U.S. investors to buy New Zealand milk products on the NZX Dairy Futures Exchange, amid heightened interest in the country's dairy trade. "
322,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 10, 2014 09:00AM ET</span>",Investor Jim Rogers Talks Commodities (Q&A),"By Nat Rudarakanchana - Maverick investor Jim Rogers founded the Quantum Fund hedge fund in 1973 along with George Soros. Rogers made his fortune early and retired at 37. He later traveled on a motorbike around the world in 1990, and then visited six continents over three years in 2003, chronicling his adventures in books.
Around 2005 he relocated with his family to Singapore, partly so his daughters could learn Mandarin Chinese during childhood. In talks, Rogers emphasized China’s rise to economic dominance in the early 2000s and penned ""Hot Commodities"" (2004), which painted China as a massive consumer of natural resources in coming years.
In ""Hot Commodities,"" Rogers argued that commodities, which include oil, metals, agricultural goods and other natural resources, would boom for at least a decade. He started his own commodities index fund in 1998, known as the Rogers International Commodity Index.

Now 71, Rogers is a well-known investment pundit still sought after by media and investors for his views on markets and the global economy. He spoke with IBTimes by phone from Singapore about commodities, the global economy and where he sees investment opportunities.
Q: You’ve argued that commodities are always driven fundamentally by supply and demand. But have commodity prices been swayed lately by apparently external factors, like U.S. monetary policy or bond tapering?
A: Ultimately everything is supply and demand. If tapering occurs, that certainly influences demand, if nothing else. So ultimately it’s all supply and demand. Different things affect supply and demand. War affects demand, for instance. It also affects supply. Money printing affects demand certainly, though it doesn’t affect supply so much.
In the end, whatever happens, most things affect and influence supply and demand, including tapering.  
Q: Strong Chinese physical demand for gold didn’t stop gold’s fall in 2013. Why did gold fall so hard in 2013?
A: One, we had an anomaly in the gold market. Gold went up 12 years in a row, which is very strange and unusual for any market. When the correction came, it too was an anomaly. At the same time, the Indians – who were the largest buyers of gold in the world – Indian politicians started blaming their problems on gold. So they took many measures to cut back their demand for gold, successfully.
Gold is still going down. India was a much bigger buyer than anyone else – so obviously when you take out demand from the largest buyer of anything, it causes a correction. That’s what been happening. Nothing unusual about it.
At the same time, many speculators and investors were cutting back after the 12-year bull market. That plus the Indians overwhelmed Chinese demand.
I still am not buying gold in any big way yet, because there are still too many mystics, too many people who think that gold is holy. I don’t see how the markets can make a bottom until a lot of those mystics get shaken out of the market. Once they throw in the towel, then gold will make a significant bottom, and I hope I’ll be buying a lot more at that time.  
Q: What are your thoughts on developments in recent years that have unlocked shale oil and gas? Some have said the U.S. energy boom is the most important development in political economy in decades.
A: I would urge people to go out and see what’s happening in the field. Yes, it was all very exciting in the beginning. But now we’re finding out that those wells are very short-life wells. Production dropped by 40 to 60 percent in the first year, and the demand for rigs to drill in the shale fields is down 75 percent in the last couple of years. The demand for pumps is down 50 percent.
So it’s not as much fun as we’d hope it would be. In some countries such as Poland, people have given up their shale leases, because they’ve realized it’s just not so simple. I read all the hype, but again I’d urge people to go into the fields and see what’s actually happened, rather than reading what journalists hype.
Natural-gas prices have quadrupled since the bottom. They’re not quadrupling because this is the most important thing in several decades.
Q: But if the U.S. can become self-sufficient in an energy or a net exporter, as some foresee, won’t that be very significant?
A: Well, if cows can fly, that’s very significant too. But present indications are that’s not going to happen. But if that happens, sure. That would change things dramatically. Like if Germany became a net exporter of energy, my God! That’d be one of the most significant things of the century, not of the decade.
But the fundamentals indicate it’s not going to happen, despite the current hype. Demand for drilling rigs is down 75 percent. Why do you think the rigs are down? If it was so wonderful, everybody would be drilling like crazy. Gas prices have quadrupled. People would be out there drilling like crazy people, when prices have quadrupled. The facts on the ground are: these [developments] are not as exciting as we thought at first.
Now, hopefully, mankind will figure out a way to overcome the technological problems. Mankind always has. But so far we have not been able to figure that out.
The same applies to shale oil. Shale oil production drops even faster than shale gas. This doesn’t even get into the whole environmental question of water, etcetera. [e.g. concerns over environmental damage caused by fracking].I have no idea whether the environmentalists are right or not.  
Q: Have commodities fallen away from that multi-year bull market you predicted back in 2004? Or are recent slumps merely temporary corrections in a longer upward trend?
A: It’s a normal temporary correction, which happens in all markets. The bull market in stocks between 1982 and 2000 had many significant corrections. In 1987, stocks went down 40 to 80 percent. 1989, 1990, 1994, 1997, 1998 – these were several very significant corrections in the price of stocks.
Back then many people said: Aha! Now the bull market is over. Well, they were wrong. In my view, this is what’s happening in commodities.
I do not see enough significant permanent new supply in almost anything, which can cause the end of the bull market [in commodities]. Rio Tinto PLC (NYSE:RIO) and BHP Billiton and others have cut back substantially on their capital spending programs because they think they should not be bringing a lot of new [mining] supply on stream yet. So until we have significant permanent new supply, I don’t see the bull market coming to an end.
The bull market will end, I assure you, it will end someday. But not yet.
Q: What about demand for natural resources? The talk of a Chinese economic slowdown, could that alone derail commodities?
A: Well, if you take out a big buyer of anything, of course it has an effect. You cut demand anywhere, and it hurts. But remember, the Chinese economy is one tenth the size of Japan’s, Europe and America [combined]. The Chinese have done a brilliant job. But America, Europe and Japan are ten times bigger than the Chinese economy.
The Japanese, the Americans and the Europeans are moving heaven and earth to increase demand in those countries. Those countries as a group are more significant than China.
China is trying to cool off, and it should. My gosh, it should – I hope they do cool down. But that’s not the end. That’s not the whole demand story in anything, and certainly not in commodities.
Q: You’re an investor admired by a lot of investors, professional and otherwise. Which investors in 2014 do you admire or follow?
A: I’m afraid I don’t pay much attention to other people. I’m pretty much a loner. I have found in my career that when I listen to other people I usually make mistakes and lose money. So I try not to pay much attention to other people. There are plenty of smart investors in the world, but I just don’t move in those circles.
Q: What are some stock markets you’re interested in?
A: First, the plenary session in Beijing in November – the Chinese say it’s one of the three most important things in the past 35 years of Chinese history. So I’m doing what they’re doing. I’m started to look for investments in the area where they’re going to put money. If the Chinese government is going to put a lot of money into something, I should too. They have a lot more money than I do. They’re smarter than I am.
I started buying Russia in recent months. Yesterday [March 5] and the day before, I bought more. I haven’t bought too much, but have been looking for things to buy in Russia. I bought shares in the Moscow Stock Exchange, I bought Aeroflot. I own airlines around the world. And I’m looking to buy more in Japan, if given the chance.
I like to buy things that are depressed. Agriculture is very depressed. The American stock market is hitting all-time highs. I don’t find that particularly attractive.
Q: Why Japan?
A: First of all, the market is down 70 percent or so from its all-time high. But Mr. Abe has said he’s going to print unlimited amounts of money. Those were his words. So he’s going to ruin Japan. Twenty years from now, we’re going to look back and say: that was the death knell for Japan.
But in the meantime, if you print unlimited amounts of money it’s got to go somewhere. The market is down dramatically in 24 years. And Abe also passed a law giving tax incentives for ordinary Japanese to invest in the stock market. I’ve seen that happen many times in history, and it always gets people to invest.
For those reasons, I’m investing in japan. I repeat: this is all going to be a disaster in the end. Printing unlimited amounts of money is terrible. Running up staggering debt is terrible. But that’s what Mr. Abe is doing. He’s going to ruin Japan. But he might make the stock market go higher.
Q: On a personal note, what are you up to nowadays on a daily basis?
A: I make a lot of speeches around the world, which I love doing. For some reason, people keep inviting me. But more importantly than that, I have two little girls that I spend as much time with as I can. I came to parenthood late in life, so I spend as much time with my kids as I can. Not making speeches, or investing, or whatever.
Q: Any last thoughts?
A: Agriculture is very exciting for many reasons. We’re running out of farmers worldwide. More people in America study public relations, not agriculture. The average age of farmers in America is 58. In Japan, it’s 66. So if you want to get rich, become a farmer, not a stock broker.
Stock brokers will be driving taxis in the next few years. The farmers are going to be driving Lamborghinis. Sugar prices, for example, are down 75 percent from all-time highs. Learn about agriculture, don’t learn about finance.

The Bethesda, Maryland-based company has 505 employees and will not be able to repay debts due by October 2014. Since 2007, USEC stock has lost 99 percent of its value.

Uranium prices have fallen more than 30 percent since the March 2011 nuclear disaster at Fukushima, and many nuclear facilities in Japan, Germany and the U.S. have shutdown. Demand for nuclear fuel has also been low, causing fuel prices to drop.
Tokyo Electric, the operator of the Fukushima facility, was one of USEC’s biggest customers before 2011.
USEC halted uranium-enrichment operations at the Kentucky-based Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, a project leased by the Department of Energy, and planned to shift production to the American Centrifuge Project in Piketon, Ohio, but didn’t secure the necessary funding.
The company has spent more than $2.5 billion developing the American Centrifuge Project, according to the bankruptcy filing, but more than $4 billion is required to complete it. USEC sought a $2 billion loan guarantee from the Department of Energy, but the department prohibited the loan and said the plant was not ready for commercial production.
As of Dec. 31, USEC reported $70 million in assets and $1.07 billion in liabilities. If the company’s reorganization plan receives court approval, USEC plans to emerge from bankruptcy in 90 to 120 days.

Meanwhile, wheat for May delivery hit a daily peak of $6.6300 a bushel on Friday, the most since December 4, before settling up 1.13% to close the week at $6.5400 a bushel.
The May wheat contract ended the week with a gain of 7.92%, as worries over political instability and violence in Ukraine fuelled concerns over a disruption to supplies from one of the world's largest wheat exporters.
Ukraine is forecast to export 10 million tonnes of wheat in the current marketing season, according to the USDA.
Concerns that freezing temperatures in key wheat-growing states in the U.S. will curb output and damage the quality of the harvest also provided support.
Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for May delivery rose to a session high of $5.0240 a bushel on Friday, the most since August 27, before turning 0.41% lower to close the week at $4.8900 a bushel.
On the week, the May corn contract picked up 5.23%, the seventh consecutive weekly gain.
Ukraine is forecast to export 18.5 million tonnes of corn in the current marketing season, representing 16% of global trade, according to the USDA. A disruption to supplies from Ukraine could mean increased demand for U.S. corn.
The USDA reported old-crop corn export sales of more than 1.5 million tonnes in the latest week, well above a range of trade estimates.
In the week ahead, market players will focus on the release of key USDA data, including the monthly supply and demand report due on Monday as well as weekly export sales figures on Thursday.
Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay."

336,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 08, 2014 01:05PM ET</span>",Obama Energy Policy: Still 'All Of The Above'?,"By Meagan Clark - President Obama’s proposed 2015 fiscal budget released this week would repeal over $4 billion a year in tax subsidies to the oil and gas industry and give more to renewable energy, “clean coal” and natural gas.
Congress will likely enact little of Obama’s budget into law, but the requests reveal the president’s policy priorities, a sort of White House wish list that may influence congressional Democrats and those campaigning ahead of midterm elections.

Obama requested $27.9 billion to fund the Department of Energy, a 2.6 percent increase from the enacted 2014 budget. He requested $28.4 billion for the department in 2014. More than a third would go to energy and science initiatives, including a climate action plan Obama announced last summer to reduce carbon emissions.
The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy would receive $2.3 billion under the budget, a 20 percent increase from 2014, with funds to renewable energy increasing 16 percent.
Funding for the Fossil Fuel program would decrease from last year’s levels.
“As the nation continues to pursue clean energy technologies that will support future economic growth, it should not devote scarce resources to subsidizing the use of fossil fuels produced by some of the largest, most profitable companies in the world,” the budget states.
Fossil fuel-supporters say subsidies to renewable energy producers like wind and solar are wasteful, and Obama’s “all-of-the-above” energy policy doesn’t pan out in his budget because they say support for oil, gas and coal is lacking.
Thomas Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, said Obama’s budget would hamper affordable and reliable energy sources and prop up expensive and unreliable ones. The institute calls Obama’s 2015 budget “a masterpiece of energy wastefulness.”  
“In his budget, the President once again calls for the expansion and permanent extension of giveaways for the wind and solar industries,” Pyle said in a statement. “These centuries-old technologies should be able to stand on their own without lavish taxpayer support.”
Jack Gerard, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, said Obama’s budget adds to a deficit of new ideas in the oil and gas sector, instead recycling earlier calls for tax hikes that would hurt government revenue, domestic energy production and job creation.
""The average oil and natural gas job pays about seven times the federal minimum wage, and the natural gas renaissance has led to lower CO2 levels,"" Gerard said in a statement. ""Higher energy taxes would set back the president's own goal of addressing income inequality and undermine his ability to achieve his climate goals.""
The oil and gas industry currently pays the highest effective tax rate, 44 percent, compared to the 30.2 percent of other corporations. Obama’s budget would increase taxes on the oil and gas industry and coal industry that would add up to $48.8 billion over a decade.
Obama is also calling for an expansion of production tax credits to renewable energy producers like solar and wind and wants to make these tax credits permanent.
Rob Gramlich, senior vice president of public policy at the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), welcomes the proposal. In 2012, AWEA sent a letter to congressional leaders accepting a six-year phase-down of a production tax credit that will give wind producers 90 percent of the credits in 2014.
""Policy stability is critical to promoting domestic manufacturing which keeps people employed and brings down our costs,” Gramlich said Friday. “We are pleased the president has proposed providing stability for the PTC in this budget.""

337,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 07, 2014 03:05PM ET</span>","Genetically Modified Food Is Safe, China's Agriculture Minister Says","By Sophie Song - Genetically modified (GM) food is safe to eat, says China’s agriculture minister, Han Changfu, in the most public statement by a senior Chinese official to promote acceptance of GM food, which could help Beijing feed its citizens.  
""I eat food processed from GM crops, soya bean oil to be specific,"" Han said at a press conference Thursday in Beijing, where the National People's Congress is meeting this week, the South China Morning Post reported.

Han added that most soya bean oil products sold in China are made from imported GM soya beans, and explained that the safety assessment and supervision network for GM food is rigorous. There are already 17 GM products from five different plant species – soya beans, corn, oilseed rape, cotton and tomatoes – in the domestic market, and regulations require these products to acknowledge their GM origins on the packaging. GM cotton and papaya are the only crops approved for commercial planting in mainland China.
The minister also assured the public of the safety of chicken, despite numerous cases of bird flu outbreaks in China in the past year.
""As agriculture minister, I promise you eating chicken is safe,"" Han said, adding that poultry farms had not been infected with the H7N9 virus. Mainland health authorities have reported more than 120 human cases this year, according to the South China Morning Post.
GM food could solve one of Beijing’s biggest problems. As the nation underwent rapid industrialization and urbanization in recent years, pollution has rendered 3.33 million hectares of farmland unproductive, which, coupled with demand from rising income, has caused China to rely on importing an unprecedented amount of food to feed its 1.35 billion people. In 2012, China imported 2.6 million tons of rice, and the heightened demand has sent global rice prices to an all-time high.

Concerns that the coldest part of winter has passed, while warmer spring temperatures lie just around the corner also fueled the selloff.
Spring and fall see the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.

The data sent the dollar gaining, as the Federal Reserve has said it will pay close attention to data when deciding on how quickly it will dismantle its monthly bond-buying program.

341,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 07, 2014 11:25AM ET</span>",Another First For China,"By Sophie Song - State-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), China’s largest offshore oil and gas developer, has been licensed to explore for oil resources in the Arctic, the first Chinese firm to be granted such approval.
Orkustofnun, Iceland’s national energy authority, granted the new offshore license to CNOOC as an operator with a 60 percent share, while Icelandic partners Eykon Energy and Petoro Iceland AS hold 15 and 25 percent respectively, the China Daily reported on Thursday.
CNOOC applied for the license to explore oil and gas resources in Arctic waters in June, and was granted operating rights on Jan. 22. The Chinese company has been accelerating its steps in foreign offshore oil and gas businesses, and last year purchased the Canadian oil and gas company Nexen Inc. (TSE:NXY) for $15.1 billion.

""The permission that CNOOC got from the Iceland government proves the Chinese energy companies' upstream exploration competence,"" said Guo Haitao, Associate Dean of the School of Business Administration with the China University of Petroleum, according to the China Daily.
The project is still in the beginning stages and does not have the capacity to add to China’s oil and gas supply in the short term, Guo added. In the long term, however, the project will raise the level of China’s energy exploration technology as well as ensure supply through diversified resources.
CNOOC already boasts of considerable experience in deep water exploration. In 2013, it produced 412 million barrels of oil, of which 69 came from Nexen Inc. The Chinese firm aims to produce 422 to 435 million barrels, which would be between 2.43 and 5.58 percent of year-on-year increase. But as the first Chinese company to explore in the Arctic, CNOOC has much to learn.
""CNOOC will be the major operator of the project, and risks are high,"" said Guo.
The Arctic region has rich oil and gas resources with a proven reserve the equivalent of 400 billion barrels of oil, according to the China Daily. Exploring in the Arctic has high operation costs, long payback periods, and requires different extraction equipment than ones used in deep water, as the area has extremely low temperatures and Arctic ice.

Schild also said people concerned about climate change should support the pipeline.
“When you think about where [oil production and transport] will be managed better, when you think about some of the Asian countries ... by all measures, you’re certainly looking at a project that passes the administration’s own climate test,” she asserted.

Gold and the dollar tend to trade inversely with one another.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery traded at $1,349.70 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, up 0.70%, up from a session low of $1,331.40 and off a high of $1,352.40.
The April contract settled up 0.18% at $1,340.30 on Wednesday.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,320.10 a troy ounce, the low from Feb. 28, and resistance at $1,355.00, Monday's high.
The ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5%, as recent data pointed to a moderate recovery in the euro zone.
ECB President Mario Draghi said he was encouraged by Wednesday data revealing that business activity in the euro zone rose to a 32-month high in February and praised improvements in the services sector, which accounts for the majority of job growth.
Draghi reiterated the ECB’s forward guidance on rates, stressing that interest rates will remain at their present levels or lower for an extended period. The ECB remains determined to maintain the high degree of accommodative monetary policy for as long as needed, and will take further actions as it sees fit, he added.
Still, the decision to leave policy unchanged bolstered the single currency on Thursday against the dollar, often a recipe for rising gold prices due to the yellow metal's tendency to move inversely from the U.S. currency.
The central bank revised its forecast for economic growth in 2014 to 1.2% from 1.1% in December.
However, the bank revised down its inflation forecast for this year to 1.0% from 1.1% in December. The bank expects inflation to pick up to 1.3% in 2015 and 1.5% in 2016, remaining below the bank’s target of just under 2%.
Meanwhile in the U.S., the Department of Labor reported earlier that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits last week fell by 26,000 to 323,000 from the previous week’s revised total of 349,000.
Analysts were expecting jobless claims to fall by 11,000 to 338,000 last week.

Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $99.41 a barrel, the low from Feb. 13, and resistance at $105.22 a barrel, Monday's high.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that U.S. crude oil inventories rose by 1.4 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 28, surpassing expectations for an increase of 1.3 million barrels, which sent prices falling on concerns the country is awash in crude.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 363.8 million barrels as of last week.
The report also showed that total motor gasoline inventories decreased by 1.6 million barrels, compared to forecasts for a drop of 1.2 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles increased by 1.4 million barrels, confounding expectations for a withdrawal of 1.2 million barrels.
Meanwhile in Ukraine, fears of a Russian-led military conflict continued to abate.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week that there was ""no need yet"" for Russia to exercise its authority, reiterating that any force used would be a last resort.
Russia is the world's second-largest crude oil exporter, and sanctions slapped on the country from the West over Ukraine could have disrupted supply.
Elsewhere, solid U.S. jobless claims data failed to give oil much support, as soft factory data dampened spirits.
The Department of Labor reported earlier that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits last week fell by 26,000 to 323,000 from the previous week’s revised total of 349,000.

Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.1968 trillion cubic feet, the lowest for this time of year since 2004.
Stocks were 908 billion cubic feet less than last year at this time and 758 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 1.954 trillion cubic feet for this time of year.
The report showed that in the East Region, stocks were 370 billion cubic feet below the five-year average, following net withdrawals of 82 billion cubic feet.
Stocks in the Producing Region were 273 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 754 billion cubic feet after a net withdrawal of 43 billion cubic feet.
Gains were somewhat limited due to concerns that the coldest part of winter has passed, while warmer spring temperatures lie just around the corner.
Spring and fall see the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.

350,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 06, 2014 11:25AM ET</span>",What You Need To Know About The Geopolitical Role Of Natural Gas,"By Meagan Clark - With the ongoing crisis in Crimea, many are asking whether or not the U.S. should export natural gas to Europe and how soon that could happen. IBTimes asked Andrew Weissman, senior energy advisor at Haynes and Boone LLP, to weigh in on the debate on Wednesday.
What restrictions on U.S. exports of crude currently exist? What restrictions on LNG exist?
They’re different programs, but the restriction on crude exports has existed for quite some time. It’s really only recently that there’s been any effort at all to get approval for any exports and that’s been largely just to Canada. Politically at least prior to the crisis in Ukraine, it’s been generally thought that it would be very difficult for the Obama administration to act. One of the factors involved is the U.S. has been struggling with energy independence for so very long, that even though the conditions are now very different… there have been many members of Congress who have difficulty switching gears.

With natural gas exports there’s a specific section of the Natural Gas Act that prohibits exports without the approval of the Department of Energy. Over the last two to three years, there have been a very large number of applications filed with the Department of Energy for approval of natural gas exports… it covers at this point more than 30 bcf [billion cubic feet] per day of natural gas exports, and that would increase U.S. demand for natural gas by almost 50 percent, so there’s a huge number of implications.
There have been two constraints. The Department of Energy has been proceeding very slowly with the applications. Of the approvals they’ve granted only one is completely final. The others are preliminary, because in addition to the Department of Energy authorization to export the gas, to build an export terminal you need to build a liquefaction plant which is essentially the world’s largest freezer. And that requires approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the federal regulatory commission is more backlogged than the Department of Energy.
It’s taking so long because there’s been some significant acquisition, from a few specific industrial energy users [like Dow Chemical] who would rather that the U.S. restrict pretty severely the amount of natural gas that it exports, and there’s also been opposition from Sierra and some other environmental groups who are concerned about increased natural gas production.
Some of the concerns opposing groups have raised is that allowing exports would raise gas prices at home.
That’s the concern they’ve raised. Personally, I feel there’s very little basis for that. Pretty clearly we have gas supplies from shale that we can develop. The supplies are probably several times larger than the government estimates. The government estimates tend to be based on data that’s a few years old, and there have been such dramatic improvements in the past few years [in drilling]. The techniques for developing shale are getting radically better every year, so the costs are getting lower and lower, and there too the government is using data that doesn’t reflect the efficiencies that have been achieved in the last 12 months.
How has the crisis with Ukraine and Russia changed incentives for the U.S. regarding LNG exports? 
I hope that as the dust settles that the whole perception both in the country and within the Obama administration of regulating LNG exports will more or less completely change, and the reason I say that is I think we’re seeing very dramatically and in very concrete terms that adequacy of natural gas supply to Ukraine in part but to Europe generally is an absolutely critical issue. Right now both Europe and Ukraine remain very heavily dependent on Russia for gas. And what you see when you turn on the TV or read the newspapers every day is that the biggest leverage Russia has, when the U.S. is not exporting LNG and the applications are moving along very slowly, it gives Russia leverage that’s very powerful. It probably gives them leverage that’s as powerful as sending troops into the Crimea.
There’s been very little recognition up until now why it’s so critical for the U.S. to export natural gas.
How soon could the U.S. begin exporting LNG to Europe, assuming all the relevant agencies came on board with it?
What’s really required is for the administration to look really long and hard at how we can really move this process along quickly. So far there’s been no sense of urgency. If there were a sense of urgency, the Department of Energy could issue additional authorizations certainly within a period of 90 days.
If the president and Congress gave FERC [the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] the staffing and funding it needs to move the applications along more quickly, we could get a lot more approvals in the next six months and then projects could start coming on in three to four years.
In thinking about that, it might seem, well that’s a fairly long time, so would that really make a difference now? The answer is it would make a big difference right away. Literally, if the president were to make an announcement that this was what he was going to do tomorrow, it would make a bid difference.
Right now, if you’re a European country, it’s very uncertain whether you’re going to be able to get gas supplies from the U.S. By contrast, if the president said tomorrow, we’re going to move this forward really aggressively, then these countries, like Germany, could with absolute certainly say to Russia, look I have a supply option. I still want to do business with you, but I have another option, and if you want to continue to do business with me, you have to be fair with me and demonstrate you’re going to be a supplier long term. Literally overnight our European allies would have a great deal of bargaining power to get better prices near term.  
Should the U.S. want to cripple the Russian economy?
No, I wouldn’t say that. Putin has done some very aggressive things, and we need to make clear that we have some very powerful leverage of our own. We could in fact supply so much gas to Europe that it would really hurt Russia tremendously. And it’s potentially more powerful than any near-term economic sanctions.
What measure has Europe taken in the last decade or so to reduce dependence on Russian energy?
They are importing more gas from other sources from Central Asia, Norway, north Africa, and using pipelines that don’t go through Ukraine. Europe, including Ukraine, has found other sources of supplies and built a number of new pipelines but the problem is you have to have energy, so it’s better to be 30 percent dependent than 70 percent, but when you still dep on Russia for 30 percent, that’s still powerful leverage.
Can Norway and Algeria fill in European demand? Can anyone else? What will happen if the U.S. doesn’t increase gas exports to Europe?
I think there is some potential to bring in potentially more gas from Algeria, but of course that has its own risks with it. There have been terroristic attacks against some of the current LNG facilities in north Africa. In the past, there have been a lot of focus on central Asia potentially being a major source of supply but I think the question at this point is going to become, ‘Are those supplies adequately secure?’  I think something really, really major has happened. I’m not a foreign policy expert, but I think Ukraine is different than Georgia. Ukraine is a large country, which is really right between Russia and the rest of Europe, and Kiev and the other areas around it where most of the population is are very Europe-oriented, and armed conflict there is like armed conflict in the rest of Europe.
Some people say we haven’t had a crisis like this with Russia for 40 years… I think this fundamentally unsettles the balance of power, and it changes the game completely. As we recognize that I think we’ll become more aware that what we do with energy is maybe the single most important piece of the process of diplomacy.
Did anything in Tuesday’s energy security report surprise you? Stand out to you?
Even though it was just issued and it was well done, we’re moving into a whole new era. I don’t think anyone anticipated this change that’s dramatic and maybe semi-permanent.
Even if Russia doesn’t invade Ukraine, I think there’s a pretty significant risk it’s going to maintain control over Ukraine maybe for a long time. From an energy security standpoint, that creates a whole new uncertainty.
It’s almost like going back to square one, it’s such a basic change in the picture, I think it forces us to look at the energy supply fix completely different.
Who else could Russia or Gazprom turn to if it loses business from Ukraine and the rest of Europe?
For oil, it does sell into the global market, but Europe is its major customer. For gas, it’s been talking to China and South Korea, potentially it could sell more to Japan… but there are lots of obstacles. I’m not sure Japan or South Korea would buy from Russia if there’s a further escalation in tensions.
If the U.S. imposes economic sanctions on Russia, how would that affect the gas trade, especially American companies? The big fear is that Russia would retaliate by cutting off energy supplies. Essentially, both sides have some really major points of leverage. And both sides have some reasons not to want to promote the other. But given what’s happened, one would think unless Putin backs off there are going to be some pretty serious sanctions. Russia’s main source of income is selling energy, particularly selling to Europe. In terms of what happens near term, both sides have some significant leverage.
If we decide to ship LNG exports to Europe, that would have a major impact.

351,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 06, 2014 11:20AM ET</span>","Should The US Export Natural Gas To Ukraine, Europe?","By Meagan Clark - The Ukrainian crisis is fueling the argument for U.S. natural gas exports, as a ready supply of gas to Europe from the U.S. would diminish Russia President Vladimir Putin's hold over the region.
The Obama Administration has approached natural gas exports cautiously, as some Democrats, environmentalists and American manufacturing companies worry natural gas exports would raise the price of gas domestically and that the process used to extract it, hydraulic fracturing, may contaminate water sources. Republicans and major oil and gas producers are urging the president to speed up gas exports.

Dozens of companies have begun the approval process to export natural gas, but the Energy Department has been slow to grant authorizations, and the earliest any company will export LNG is late 2015.
So what does that process look like?
The Natural Gas Act of 1938, as amended, requires anyone who wants to import or export natural gas from or to another country to obtain authorization from the Department of Energy (specifically the Office of Oil and Gas Global Security and Supply, Division of Natural Gas Regulatory Activities).
There are two types of authorizations: blanket and long-term. The blanket authorization allows a company to import or export on a short-term basis, for two years maximum, and the long-term authorization can be given to a company that has signed an agreement resulting in the imports or exports of natural gas for a period of time longer than two years.
Generally, federal law requires the Energy Department to approve natural gas exports to the 20 countries that have Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the U.S, and for countries that do not have FTAs with the U.S, the Natural Gas Act directs the Energy Department to approve exports unless the Department believes the exports “will not be consistent with the public interest.”
As of Feb. 11, the Energy Department has approved 32 applications for exporting LNG to countries with FTAs with the U.S, and of those, six applications for exporting LNG to countries without FTAs with the U.S.
But of those six applications, only one has full, final approval as of Feb. 21 from the federal government because for a company to export LNG, it also needs to build what’s called a liquefaction plant, a giant freezer. That requires approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). FERC has so far approved only one application, for Sabine Pass Liquefaction, LLC in Sabine Pass, Louisiana across the river from Port Arthur, Texas.
The Sabine facility is under construction and is scheduled to begin exporting LNG in late 2015. Sabine Pass Liquefaction was founded in 2010, is based in Houston and is a subsidiary of Cheniere Energy Investments, LLC. Sabine Pass Liquefaction plans to construct six trains to treat, liquefy, store and export natural gas.
The other five applications, if approved soon, would not export LNG until 2017.  They include:
Freeport LNG Expansion, LP and FLNG Liquefaction LLC in Freeport, Texas
Houston-based Freeport LNG Expansion and its liquefaction unit have two Energy Department-approved applications because a second application was required to request to export an additional 1.4 bcf of LNG from new trains. The company signed an agreement in February 2013 with the U.K.-based BP PLC to export 4.4 million metric tons a year of LNG from its Freeport, Texas terminal. In the 20-year agreement, BP would retain an exclusive right to process natural gas at one of Freeport’s three planned liquefaction plants. Freeport still needs approval from FERC.
Lake Charles Exports LLC in Lake Charles, La.
Lake Charles Exports is a venture between the U.K.-based BG Group PLC and the Texas-based Energy Transfer Equity LP. It plans to ship up to 2 billion cubic feet a day from Lake Charles.
Dominion Cove Point LNG, LP near Lusby, Md.
Dominion Cove Point, operated by Dominion Resources Inc., has an offshore LNG shipping terminal, where it has been receiving and storing LNG imports. Dominion Resources plans to spend up to $3.8 billion to modify the terminal and export LNG off the shores of Chesapeake Bay.
Cameron LNG, LLC in Cameron, La.
Cameron LNG is owned by Sempra Energy and won Energy Department approval just last month. Cameron plans to export up to 1.7 billion cubic feet per day for up to 20 years once its terminals are constructed and working at full capacity.

But Ukrainian grain exports could still be a problem – especially for the world’s largest wheat importer.  
 “Whilst we do not expect significant disruption to the supply of any commodities, there is much greater potential for exports of grain from the Ukraine to be interrupted than energy supplies from Russia,” read a report from Tom Pugh, commodities economist at Capital Economics.
 “While the risks to energy prices may be relatively small, Ukraine is one of the largest producers of grain in Europe, so crop prices could be more vulnerable,” he wrote.
Ukraine is the fifth-largest grain exporter worldwide, accounting for roughly 16 percent of global corn exports and 6.3 percent of wheat, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.  
Egypt imports more wheat than any other country in the world. Though the conflict between Russia and Ukraine hasn’t caused any problems yet, future price fluctuations could create further tension for an already tense market.
The benchmark Paris milling wheat for May was up 0.9 percent to hit a three-month high on Wednesday, according to Reuters.
Though economists don’t expect a supply shock any time soon, potential problems at Ukrainian ports or a delay in the spring planting season could cause trouble down the line.
Ukraine sends six hundred metric tons through its ports every week, so even one or two disruptions could have wide implications. Two major ports are Sevastopol, in the Crimea, and Odessa, where pro-Russian rallies have occurred.

Meanwhile, the country’s army reserves would include most men under 40 years old. If they were called into service, it could seriously disrupt the spring planting season. Again, this is only a possibility.
 “For now we think that disruption to grain supplies is unlikely,” he wrote, adding that the price of wheat should fall to $500 per bushel by the end of the year.
Though Egypt imports about ten million metric tons of wheat every year, officials have stated there is no need to worry. But experts are keeping a close eye on the situation.
“They’re a huge importer of wheat and that’s what I’m worried about,” said Matthew Spivack, practice leader for Middle East and North Africa at Frontier Strategy Group, an advisory form for multinationals that operate in emerging markets.
“It’s just something else that adds to volatility.”
But Egyptian officials have emphasized that the country is prepared.  
“Egypt’s imports of wheat will not be affected by political events that Ukraine is witnessing,” said Mamdouh Abdel Fattah, vice chairman of the main government wheat buying agency GASC on Saturday, according to Reuters. 
On Monday, the Egyptian supplies minister said the country had enough stocks to last until June.
Like other countries in the region, many Egyptian food products are highly subsidized. Citizens purchase loaves of bread for about $0.01 each – a program that costs the government about $3 billion annually. "

The U.S. Department of Agriculture expects Ukraine to be the fifth-biggest wheat exporter and the third-largest shipper of corn in the current marketing year. A disruption to supplies from Ukraine could mean increased demand for U.S. grains.
Market players looked ahead to the USDA’s weekly export report later in the session to gauge the strength of global demand for U.S. supplies.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, corn futures for May held in a range between $4.7863 a bushel and $4.8188 a bushel. Corn prices last traded at $4.7988 a bushel during U.S. morning hours, down 0.3%.

The May wheat contract dipped 0.16% on Wednesday to settle at $6.4240 a bushel. Prices hit $6.4560 a bushel on Tuesday, the highest since December 10.
The USDA projected that Russia and Ukraine will produce a combined 74 million tonnes of wheat in the 2013-14 marketing season and export a total of 26.5 million tonnes of the grain, representing 17% of world trade.
According to the USDA, Ukraine is forecast to export 10 million tonnes of wheat in the current season, while Russian wheat shipments are expected to total 16.5 million tonnes.
Elsewhere on the CBOT, soybeans futures for May delivery inched up 0.55% to trade at $14.2850 a bushel. Prices of the oilseed declined 0.18% on Wednesday to settle at $14.2040 a bushel.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in April traded at $4.547 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, down 2.57%. The commodity hit session high of $4.721 and a low of $4.533.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.463 per million British thermal units, Monday's low, and resistance at $4.736, Monday's high.
Profit taking sent natural gas prices falling on market perceptions that the coldest part of winter has passed, while warmer spring temperatures lie just around the corner.
Spring and fall see the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
Forecasts for mild weather in the coming two weeks sent prices falling as well, though pockets of below-normal temperatures in parts of the northern reaches of the country cushioned losses somewhat.
In its 8-14 day outlook, Natgasweather.com called for a cold blast for the northern U.S. with reinforcing cold blasts to follow.
The southern U.S. will see moderate and slightly above-normal temperatures though cold snaps will appear as well.
The western U.S. will see warmer-than-normal conditions.
Meanwhile, traders looked ahead to Thursday’s supply report, amid expectations for a larger-than-average drop in U.S. natural gas inventories.
Early withdrawal estimates range from 140 billion cubic feet to 174 billion cubic feet, which is mostly above the year-ago draw of 149 billion cubic feet and well above the five-year average draw of 105 billion.

378,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 04, 2014 03:30PM ET</span>",Here's How High Ukraine's Energy Risk Is,"By Meagan Clark - Ukraine faces the highest energy security risk in the world, but expanded U.S. production of natural gas is lowering global energy risk, according to the 2013 International Index of Energy Security Risk released Tuesday by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
The index calculates the energy risk of the 25 largest energy users and scores them based on their energy efficiency and security of energy sources.

Norway tops the list with the most energy security. The U.S. ranked sixth, climbing one place since 2012 and three places since 2005. Mexico, New Zealand and the U.K. ranked second, third and fourth, respectively. Ukraine hasn’t budged from the bottom since the breakup of the Soviet Union in the early nineties.
“Ukraine is suffering from dramatic exposure risk,” Karen Harbert, president and CEO of the Institute for 21st Century Energy, told reporters on a conference call.
Ukraine’s risk stems from its very inefficient use of energy and almost complete dependence on Russia for energy imports, Steve Eule, vice president of the institute, said.
But Ukraine is also one of the few countries that has reduced its energy security score in the past two decades. The country has discovered shale resources, is exploring LNG projects near the Black Sea and is privatizing its coal industry—all efforts that, if continued, will pay off in the long term, Eule said.
Russia ranked 14th. Though the country has vast resources, it uses energy very inefficiently. And since Russia is “a tremendous energy power,” it’s “not afraid of using its energy power for geopolitical ends,” Eule said.
“And that argues for greater U.S. imports to Europe,” Eule said.
The European Union has seen energy prices, especially for electricity, climb in recent years.
“It’s about the U.S. being able to supply more of the world’s natural gas, in an affordable manner… and not use it as a political tool,” Harbert added.
Eule and Harbert agree that North America and particularly the U.S. led a global reduction in energy risk and prices in 2013, despite a significant amount of oil taken off the market from Iran.
“Combined with growing energy production from Canada and a reformed hydrocarbon sector in Mexico, it’s possible we’ll soon see the world’s energy center of gravity shifting away from the Middle East and towards North America, bringing with it even greater economic and geopolitical advantages,” Harbert said.
With the boom in unconventional oil and gas production, North America led “the most dramatic fall in energy prices since the beginning of our tracking” in 1980, Harbert said.
“This is the perfect example of how improving energy security in North America has improved energy security in the world,” she said.
Japan could also benefit from U.S. natural gas imports. The country ranked 18th on the 2013 index, four places below its 2011 ranking. Since the Fukushima disaster, Japan has decided to reduce its reliance on nuclear power and instead rely on imports, increasing its energy risk.
It’s going to take some time to build the infrastructure, but “the prospect of supply, of democratic molecules [natural gas] coming in from the West, will have a calming effect on the markets” and reduce price volatility, Harbert said.

385,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 04, 2014 07:45AM ET</span>",Oil Industry Leaders Object To EPA's Newest Fuel Standard,"By Meagan Clark - Oil refiners must begin removing more sulfur, which creates smog linked to respiratory disease, from American gasoline blends, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced Monday. But oil industry leaders and some Republicans have taken issue with the EPA’s study used to make the regulation.
Public health and environmental activists have long-awaited the final rule, as they have lobbied the EPA to complete the regulation since President Obama first asked the EPA to create it in 2010. The rule is a third phase that will cut sulfur content in gasoline from 30 parts per million to 10 parts per million beginning in 2017.
Sulfur burned in gasoline interferes with pollution-control mechanisms in engines and increases emissions linked to a range of respiratory diseases like lung disease and asthma, as well as heart disease and premature births and deaths.
Proponents of the rule say it is an important step to reducing air pollution and Obama’s most significant public health achievement this term. Opponents say the rule is too costly and air quality is improving without the rule.
“Without any doubt, this is the most significant move to protect public health that the EPA will make this year,” Frank O’Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch, said in a statement Monday. “There is literally no more effective tool to fight smog.”

According to the EPA, the new regulation will raise the cost of gasoline by about two-thirds of one cent per gallon and add about $75 to the price of cars. But oil industry officials say the rule will cost their industry $10 billion and increase gasoline costs by up to nine cents per gallon.
“This rule’s biggest impact is to increase the cost of delivering energy to Americans, making it a threat to consumers, jobs, and the economy,” Bob Greco, a downstream director for the American Petroleum Institute (API) said Monday. “But it will provide negligible, if any, environmental benefits. In fact, air quality would continue to improve with the existing standard and without additional costs.”
API commissioned a study by Baker & O’Brien, released in June 2013, which found the annual compliance cost for oil refineries will be $2.4 billion, increasing the cost of gasoline by six to nine cents per gallon.
When asked about the EPA’s own estimate for the price increase in gasoline, API spokesman Carlton Carroll said the EPA “is using false assumptions to come up with its cost figure.”
The EPA addresses API’s study in its final ruling report released Monday, arguing that API exaggerated the costs to refineries in various ways. For example, EPA argues API based capital costs on the costs associated with the second phase of regulations, which requires refineries to strip out more sulfur than the third phase will. Oil industry officials say taking out the final bits of sulfur is more difficult and costly than taking out initial amounts.
Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the Science, Space and Technology Committee, said the EPA is basing the fuel standards on “secret science.”
“A majority of the agency’s claimed benefits for these standards are derived from taxpayer-funded studies that are hidden from the public and cannot be validated by independent scientists,” Smith said in a statement Monday. “Americans impacted by these costly regulations have a right to see the data and determine for themselves if the agency’s actions are based on sound science or a partisan agenda.”
Smith has been pressuring the EPA for years to increase its transparency and has cosponsored a bill that would prohibit the EPA from proposing regulations based on scientific information that’s not publically available. Next week, the EPA’s head of air and radiation will testify before the Science Committee about the agency’s regulatory actions.
“This regulatory action was supported by influential scientific information,” the EPA’s report states."

Portions of the western half of the country could see above-normal temperatures in the first half of March, which also softened prices.
Weekly supply data due remained in focus as well.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.348 trillion cubic feet as of last week, the lowest for this time of year since 2004, following a withdrawal of 95 billion cubic feet.
Early withdrawal estimates for this week's storage data ranged from 140 billion cubic feet to 174 billion cubic feet, which is mostly above the year-ago draw of 149 billion cubic feet and well above the five-year average draw of 105 billion.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
Elsewhere on the NYMEX, light sweet crude oil futures for delivery in April were up 1.74% and trading at $104.37 a barrel, while heating oil for April delivery were up 1.79% and trading at $3.0703 per gallon.

397,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 03, 2014 10:45AM ET</span>",Will Iraq Become The World's Largest Oil Exporter?,"By David Kashi - Iraq’s oil exports hit a 25-year high in February, according to a high-ranking Iraqi official. The news comes as experts say the embattled country has the potential to become the fastest growing crude oil exporter in the world.
""Production in February was 3.5 million barrels per day, and we exported 2.8 million barrels per day,"" the deputy prime minister for energy affairs, Hussein al-Shahristani, told reporters on Saturday in the southern port city of Basra, according to Global Energy World.

Iraq is not only poised to ramp up its production faster than any other nation, it has the potential to become the world's largest crude exporter, according to a recent report by U.K.-based bank Standard Chartered PLC (LON:STAN). Between now and 2035, Iraq could potentially generate approximately $5 trillion in oil revenue, or about 40 times the country’s 2010 GDP, according to International Energy Agency estimates from October 2012.
“Not only does Iraq have massive oil reserves, extremely favorable geology makes its crude oil among the cheapest in the world to exploit,” the report said. The IEA estimates that the investment required for a new energy supply infrastructure will total more than $530 billion.

But if Iraq wants to become an oil-production leader, it will have to overcome political instability, and it must first of all stop attacks on its oil infrastructure. Already the latest projections put Iraq’s crude output at 6.08 million barrels per day (mmbd) by 2017, about half of the 12 million barrels a day that were previously forecast.
While Iraq faces challenges and setbacks, the report points to new fields coming online that will help increase production, offsetting the recent shortfall.

""One advantage Iraq’s oil fields have over the rest of the world is its geology, which makes drilling less complicated and expensive than in countries like the U.S., Canada and Brazil,"" the report said. ""Furthermore, Iraq’s crude requires less-intensive refining than competitors. Estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show the sharp difference in average exploitation costs between Iraq (less than $5 per barrel of oil) and anywhere in the world, including the rest of the Middle East.”

Agricultural commodities received a boost from a slumping U.S. dollar, as dollar-priced commodities become cheaper to investors holding other currencies when the greenback weakens.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, fell 0.6% on Friday to close the week at 79.81, the lowest level since December 18.
Meanwhile, market players continued to monitor rising tensions in Ukraine, one of the world's largest corn and wheat exporters, following reports that armed men had occupied airports in the pro-Russia Crimea region.
A disruption to supplies in Ukraine could mean increased demand for U.S. supplies.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, corn futures for May delivery rose to a session high of $4.6500 a bushel on Friday, the most since September 17. Corn prices eventually settled 1.98% higher to end the week at $4.6340 a bushel.
On the week, the May corn contract picked up 2.24%, the sixth consecutive weekly gain.
For the month, corn prices jumped 6.29%, amid ongoing indications of robust export demand for U.S. supplies.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported sales of 101,600 tonnes of the grain to unknown destinations for shipment during the 2013-14 marketing year on Friday.
Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat for May delivery rallied 2.21% on Friday to settle the week at $6.0220 a bushel.
The May wheat contract ended the week with a loss of 1.21%, the first weekly decline in four weeks.
Despite the weekly drop, wheat prices still ended February with an increase of 7.83%, amid concern freezing temperatures in key wheat-growing states in the U.S. will curb output and damage the quality of the harvest.
Meanwhile, soybeans for May delivery advanced 1.72% on Friday to end the week at $14.1400 a bushel.
The May contract surged to $14.4540 a bushel on Thursday, the most since July 23, before erasing gains to settle at $13.9000 a bushel, down 0.5%.
The March soybean contract added 3.06% on the week. For the month, prices of the oilseed rallied 9.2% as hot and dry conditions in key soy-growing regions in Brazil and Argentina fuelled concerns over crop prospects.
In the week ahead, market players will focus on the release of key weekly USDA data, including export sales figures on Thursday.
Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay."

On the week, U.S. crude futures, also known as West Texas Intermediate or WTI, climbed 0.38%, the seventh consecutive weekly gain.
Nymex oil prices ended February with an increase of 4.62%, the biggest monthly rise since August.
Oil’s gains came as the U.S. dollar fell to a three-month low against the euro on Friday after data showed that the annual rate of consumer inflation in the euro zone rose by a more-than-expected 0.8% in February, dampening speculation the European Central Bank will add to stimulus at its upcoming policy meeting.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, fell 0.6% on Friday to close the week at 79.81, the lowest level since December 18.
Dollar-denominated oil futures contracts tend to rise when the dollar falls, as this makes oil cheaper for buyers in other currencies.
Meanwhile, forecasts for freezing temperatures across most parts of the central and northeast U.S. over the next couple of weeks boosted prices as well.
Gains were limited after the Commerce Department reported Friday that U.S. fourth quarter gross domestic product was revised down to an annual rate of 2.4%, from a preliminary estimate of 3.2%. Analysts had expected a downward revision to 2.5%.
The disappointing data added to concerns that the economic recovery has lost momentum since the end of last year.
Earlier in the week, Fed Chair Janet Yellen acknowledged recent weakness in U.S. data, saying it indicates softness in the economy.
In testimony to the Senate banking committee in Washington, Ms. Yellen said it was hard to say how much the recent soft data was due to weather and added that the bank would be attentive to signals on whether the recovery is progressing in line with expectations.

413,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 01, 2014 12:00AM ET</span>",Is China Trying To Control The World's Grain Supply?,"By Sophie Song - Chinese state-owned food giant COFCO Corp. is buying a 51 percent stake in Nidera NV, a major grains trader, possibly for better access to major grain-growing regions, as Beijing tries to feed its increasingly wealthy citizens.
The majority stake in Nidera would give COFCO greater control over pricing and better access to Latin America and Russia, important grain-growing regions, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. The announcement did not include financial details of the deal, but Nidera’s total enterprise value is estimated to be around $4 billion, with $1.2 billion in equity value of the stake, people familiar with the matter said.

Demand for food in China is increasing at an unprecedented rate, as the Chinese become wealthier. In 2011 China became a net importer of rice, and imports of soybeans overtook domestic production in 2004. To cope with the heightened demand, Beijing has in recent years been investing in food assets overseas and buying farms in agricultural regions like Latin America.
COFCO is China’s largest state-owned grain trader, and the government’s go-to company when importing U.S. corn or Australian wheat. Nidera, on the other hand, has been looking for a strong partner in China and the rest of Asia to help it expand, said Ton van der Laan, the company's CEO.
""It makes perfect sense that [COFCO] seized the opportunity on this deal,"" said Ding Pin, agriculture analyst at China Haitong Securities, according to the Wall Street Journal, and added that China’s demand for grains will continue to be huge as its population grows wealthier and requires better quality food.
This is the latest of a series of consolidations in the grain trading industry. In 2012, Glencore International bought Viterra (TSE:VT) for 6.1 billion Canadian dollars ($5.48 billion), while Japanese trading house Marubeni (TYO:8002) bought the Gavilon Group in 2013.

414,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 28, 2014 10:05AM ET</span>","How Aluminum Grabbed A Chunk Of Steel's Auto, Airplane Market","By Meagan Clark - Aluminum manufacturing is expanding globally as auto and aerospace makers ""lightweight"" their fleets for fuel efficiency. But how did aluminum become a buzzword in these industries? And where is aluminum going next?
To answer these questions, IBTimes talked to Steve Demetriou, CEO of Cleveland-based Aleris Corporation, an aluminum manufacturer, recycler and specification alloy producer. Aleris operates 40 production facilities around the world with 7,000 employees, and brought in $4.4 billion in revenue in 2012.

Why is aluminum winning over steel and other materials? Is there more to this than automakers “lightweighting” to meet fuel efficiency standards?
Aluminum has been growing and penetrating various markets for years. Probably the most significant event was the shift from steel to aluminum cans in the 1970s. Most recently when we talk about automotive, clearly the most significant shift is from performance and cost sustainability. Aluminum is fairly priced when it comes to auto performance, and that’s why it’s winning.
But another big differentiator is sustainability. Aluminum is infinitely recyclable, so environmental performance is superior. A lot of the raw material used in these applications is scrap aluminum. Recycled scrap aluminum uses 95 percent less energy than the process for using aluminum on purpose. When you look at performance, aluminum is 20 percent lighter than steel, yet has the same strength.
Who are aluminum’s biggest buyers?
Aluminum’s biggest segment is transportation, aerospace, automotive, the rail industry, truck trailers and, on defense side, armored vehicles and other large vehicles.
Another big market is the building and construction segment, specifically the housing applications.
To what degree are non-metallic materials like carbon fiber and other materials competing with aluminum?
Like any industry, there will be competition from other materials. There has been some limited success from new materials like carbon fiber and high-strength steel , but the majority of winds are coming from aluminum because of that cost-performance combination.
In aerospace there’s been some success in the carbon materials industry to make planes lighter, but it’s been limited to wide-body planes. [The reason manufacturers can justify the cost of the material is that these larger aircraft are typically used for long-haul flights, so fuel efficiency and the savings they gain outweigh the total added cost of using carbon fiber or composites, a spokeswoman for Aleris, Shannon Bennett, clarified.]  There’s an eight-10 year backlog of planes to be built for the major players in the industry like Boeing, and the majority continue to be aluminum.
You have about 7,000 employees globally. How many are in the U.S?
About half of our employees are in the U.S., with the other half in Europe and China.
Is there enough aluminum to keep up with demand in the short term? Novelis’s Tom Boney said Ford’s use of aluminum is forcing auto manufacturers to reconsider plans in the short term. 
When you look at the most recent projections in the [aluminum] industry for the lightweight industry, it clearly shows the [aluminum] industry will need more capacity globally. In Europe, we’ve invested a significant amount of capital to increase our capability.
Why in Europe?
We’re one of the largest players in Europe. That’s a foothold we have. With Europe leading the way, they started lightweighting 10 years ago, we supply to most of the premium carmakers in Europe. Pretty much any premium car maker you think of there, we’re supplying to.
How have you seen the industry change in Aleris’s lifetime?
In 2004 when Aleris was formed by the merger of several companies, the focus for aluminum was much more cost focused for cost optimization and geographically trying to expand. There’s been an exciting innovation shift to new alloys, new process technology and research and development.
We’ve recently completed our Duffel [Belgium] facility—providing innovation technology for our customers. We also have facilities in Aachen, Germany and an aerospace center in Koblenz, Germany. We’re looking to expand those innovation centers, and also to expand [research and development as well as manufacturing] in the U.S. and China.

419,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 27, 2014 03:25PM ET</span>","Will It Soon Be 'Drill, Baby, Drill' In The Atlantic?","By Meagan Clark - The Obama administration released its long-anticipated study Thursday on the environmental impact of allowing oil and gas exploration off the East coast through seismic surveys, unveiling a new framework for oil and gas research and potentially allowing drilling in the region in 10 years.
Researchers from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) began the study, which will inform decision makers on whether to allow offshore drilling and what regulations to impose, five years ago. The analysis examines the potential harm seismic surveys and the loud air gun blasts they require may have on whales, dolphins and other marine life, but does not explicitly deny or approve particular seismic studies in the designated ocean region, from mid-Florida to Delaware.

The study recommends three basic rules the government should impose on the research firms that want to use seismic waves to search for oil and gas deposits: prohibit the surveys on the migratory routes of the endangered North Atlantic right whale, prohibit multiple seismic surveys from being conducted simultaneously, and use passive acoustic monitoring systems to identify marine mammals in the area where the surveys will be conducted.
“We’re really going to require and demand a high level of environmental performance from any operator seeking to conduct surveys in these areas,” BOEM director Tommy Beaudreau told reporters Thursday. “They’re really going to have to up their game and use these technologies to avoid potential conflict and environmental impact.”
Oil and gas industry members say these rules could be costly, as shutting down operations or repositioning when dolphins or whales are nearby can take hours, and passive acoustic monitoring can give false readings.  
“Our primary concern is that the government is using the best available science to make these determinations,” Erik Milito, director of upstream and downstream operations for the American Petroleum Institute, told reporters Thursday morning before the study was released. “Some of our concerns are how they’re developing these mitigation measures… these measures should be the same for seismic vessels as any other vessels.”
Seismic surveys have been conducted safely for decades in the Gulf of Mexico, other areas in the U.S., and around the world, API argues. The last surveys of the Atlantic Ocean took place about 30 years ago, and technology has since improved.
The public will have until April 7 to comment on the study. Then the BOEM will make a final decision.
So far, at least nine firms have pending applications to conduct seismic studies in the mid- and south-Atlantic coastal region. The government could sell drilling rights as soon as 2017.

Stocks in the Producing Region were 251 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 775 billion cubic feet after a net withdrawal of 5 billion cubic feet.

424,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 27, 2014 10:05AM ET</span>",Is The China-Myanmar Oil Pipeline In Trouble?,"By Sophie Song - A multi-billion dollar China-invested oil terminal and pipeline in Myanmar may not be built, after a major processing refinery project in China was shelved as part of a wider cutback in energy development.
A Chinese refinery in the province of Yunnan was suspended following street protests last year over pollution worries, the Irrawaddy reported on Thursday. Due to the delays, the refinery will not be built before 2016, if at all. Previously, the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC)-developed refinery, which would have been able to process 200,000 barrels of oil per day, was expected to begin operations this year.

“The shelving of the large refinery in Kunming is now part of a wide-ranging cutback in energy developments in China,” Collin Reynolds, an independent energy industries consultant and analyst, told the Irrawaddy. “It is one of a number of major refineries and petrochemical projects being delayed or canceled.”
CNPC’s 900-kilometer (559.23 mile) oil pipeline that runs through Myanmar, with a transmission capacity of 440,000 barrels per day, is still under construction and may now be delayed as a result of the Yunnan refinery woes. The company originally planned to transmit nearly half of the 22 million tonnes (24.25 million tons) of crude oil it imports from the Middle East and Africa through the Burmese pipeline to Yunnan.
“Of course, China is still a huge consumer of oil and gas and that isn’t going to change overnight,” Reynolds said. “All the same the slowdown means that the multi-billion dollar pipeline and port developments in Burma are certainly not so important now.”
China’s economy has been slowing down for the past two years, and in 2013, Chinese consumption of gasoline and diesel grew at its slowest pace for 20 years. Nonetheless, refinery construction is just now waking up to the slowdown, resulting in some overcapacity that ended up hurting margins.
The oil pipeline in Myanmar has been mired in its own controversies involving human rights and land grabs, the Irrawaddy reported. Much like its sister Shwe natural gas pipeline, which also runs to Yunnan province, the oil pipeline has allegedly displaced local Burmese without due compensation.
Shwe pipeline has only been in operation for a few months, but already there were allegations that the pipeline is unsafe, and possibly has cracks.

""We closed the Nembe Creek Trunkline on Sunday for the removal of crude theft points,” a spokesman of Shell Petroleum Development Co. of Nigeria, Precious Okolobo, told Dow Jones Newswires. “We plan to complete the exercise and reopen the line as soon as possible.”
The amount of crude lost is unknown.

The pipeline transports 150,000 barrels of oil a day and has been closed many times due to theft since Shell replaced it in December 2010 for $1.1 billion.
Last year, Mutiu Sunmonu, head of Shell's Nigerian unit, said the attacks on the Nembe Creek pipeline have been “unprecedented… more than 60,000 barrels of oil are being stolen a day, resulting in frequent production shutdowns and massive oil spills blighting the ecosystem.""
Shell announced intentions to sell the 97-kilometer pipeline in late 2013, due to persistent losses from theft and destruction."

Sergio Millian, president of the chamber, is flying to Moscow early to prepare, stopping in Kiev, Ukraine, along the way. He talked to the IBTimes Wednesday about the upcoming forum and why the Russian Oil Ministry wants U.S. technology to extract oil and gas in previously unreachable areas.
What’s on the agenda for the oil and gas forum?
It’s a three day conference on Russian energy strategy and energy efficiency. Several weeks ago, we met with several top officials from the U.S. Department of Energy about the conference, and we have received some other relevant information about the successful cooperation.
We hope that trade will increase between Russia and the U.S. We’re hoping to attract investment of about half a billion into Russian exploration and investment into American refineries.
Who’s going to be at the forum?
Several companies. Chevron confirmed, Exxon Mobil confirmed participation in the forum. We’re talking to about 10 more companies. I’m flying this weekend to Moscow and will continue talking to them.
Exxon Mobil has a contract already and is an example of successful cooperation with Russia. Rosneft is working with Exxon. They signed an official agreement two years ago for several billion dollars. They’re the most successful recent example, and really the only example, of Russian-American cooperation in oil.
Is the Russian government looking to U.S. companies to invest in oil exploration in Russia? 
Yes, basically the Russian government for the second time … is hosting the oil and gas forum, which means that since it’s conducted by the [Russian] Minister of Energy, the idea is make sure they [U.S. companies] understand the guidelines after the year 2013. Some projects will be discussed with substantial investments. American companies can benefit greatly.
Why does Russia’s energy ministry want help from American companies?
They would like to partner with the American companies because technologies from the shale revolution have been developed here, and most of the European countries don’t have this technology yet. They want to explore the Arctic Sea and Eastern Siberia.
American companies may not enter into any significant deals. They have to get an okay from the Russian government. This forum represents the platform where business execs and Russian officials can reach agreements.
What concerns would U.S. companies have about working with Russia?
Most of the time concerns voiced from American companies are about energy security and not understanding Russian tax law and fiscal policy. Many companies have voiced concerns about terrorism, Chechnyan terrorists. It hasn’t happened yet, but they are still concerned it might.
Some of the world’s largest oil companies like Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS.A) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) have signed agreements or nearly signed agreements for oil exploration in Ukraine and the Black Sea. With the Ukrainian crisis, what do you think will happen with oil companies’ operations in Ukraine?
I met with the people in charge of the operations. Right now I think they will make a short pause to see what will be the next move in the country. Business is usually quiet in these turmoil times. Once things are more stable, I’m sure they will continue working there.

440,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 26, 2014 11:05AM ET</span>","Even Amid Consumers' Profit-Taking, Turkish Gold Demand Remains Robust ","By Nat Rudarakanchana - Turkish consumers are taking advantage of gold’s recent rally to sell off the precious metal, even as trade statistics show a remarkable year for Turkish gold demand in 2013.
“A lot of people are selling back the gold they purchased last year, having made quite a reasonable return on it,” said Andrew Leyland, manager of precious metals demand at the Thomson Reuters GFMS metals consultancy, to IBTimes.
Turkish consumers flocked to buy gold at bargain prices in 2013, after a steep price plunge in April made the culturally important metal more affordable. That mirrored bargain buying in China.
Local gold, which often sells at a premium to benchmark London prices, have traded slightly lower in recent days, at a discount of $2 per ounce, according to Leyland, who visited Turkey last week. That points to the volume of investors booking profits from gold’s rally in early 2014, as it moved from $1205 per ounce on Jan. 1 to $1331 on Wednesday, up 11.5 percent.
Turkish demand for gold remained robust in 2013. The country mints the most gold coins in the world by a stretch and has been dubbed the world’s largest gold coin market by industry body the World Gold Council. Consumer demand for the metal rose 60 percent in 2013, the third fastest in the world after China and Thailand.
Demand for bars and coins doubled, though the country still consumes small amounts of gold relative to China, India and the U.S., the three top consumer markets for the metal.


On the strength of bar and coin demand, Turkey is the only market which didn’t see its consumer gold market contract in value in the last quarter of 2013, compared to the year before, World Gold Council data show. 
“Turkish people choose gold as an inflation hedge, and they also invest in gold,” said Gokhan Sen, a vice president for research at Turkish investment brokerage and researcher Ak Yatirim.
“Ordinary citizens invest in gold because financial markets here are weak,” he said. “People just don’t invest in stocks or bonds,” he added, citing local preferences for real estate, gold, and foreign exchange markets.
Gold has also become a particularly sensitive topic for Turkey’s state-owned Halkbank, which has been accused of trading gold in exchange for Iranian oil and gas, circumventing U.S. sanctions on Iran. Gold has become a medium of exchange in that trade, noted Sen.
“Gold was being sent to Iran for trade,” he continued. “It wasn’t a normal exchange.”
Turkey’s gold imports hit a record 300 tonnes in 2013, GFMS data show. Imports could increase if sanctions on Iran are eased in exchange for nuclear concessions, a point under negotiation in ongoing talks.
After Turkey’s hyperinflation and financial collapse in 1990s, normal Turkish citizens came to trust gold, dollars and euros, as a store of value, Turkish resident and investment expert Enis Taner of Risk Reversal told IBTimes.
“Gold has always been a favorite investment vehicle for the Turkish population because the lira has always been quite weak,” said Taner.
But gold’s rise from around $280 per ounce in January 2000 to $1200 by January 2014 left many Turkish consumers, who often buy small gold products as gifts, feeling pinched.
“In 2013, gold went down quite a bit in dollar terms. So that actually for Turkish consumers was viewed somewhat positively,"" said Taner. ""All of a sudden wedding gifts became a little cheaper.” 
Stringent regulations for pooling assets mean that Turkish institutional investors and money managers don’t maintain large gold holdings, however, said Taner.
But Turkey’s demand for gold may not reflect wider regional trends. New Middle East gold demand has slumped since 2005, falling from almost 400 tonnes annually to about 150 tonnes in 2013, as gold became more expensive.

“Turkish people don’t necessarily hoard the gold all the time. They’ll quite often sell it back to the market,” said GFMS’ Leyland. “At the grand bazaar in Istanbul, you’ll see a lot of little gold exchange shops. It’s almost like a bureau de change. People will treat gold like another currency.”
Turks may be selling gold to buy dollars or euro, in turn to protect against further weakness in the Turkish lira, said Leyland. The lira has fallen 5 percent this year, hitting a record low on Jan. 27.

445,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 26, 2014 06:25AM ET</span>",Oil Companies Seek Ways To Reduce Gas Flaring And Pollution,"By Meagan Clark - The oil pumped out of the Bakken Shale fields in North Dakota brings natural gas above ground too, but the state doesn’t have the infrastructure yet to store or move the gas to processors. So about 30 percent of the natural gas rising to the North Dakota prairies is burned, emitting carbon and losing the value the methane could have had if processed into ethane, butane and other liquids.
Right now, about 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas in the state is burned into the air, Gov. Jack Dalrymple said Monday at the Bloomberg Energy 2020 conference in Washington.
“Everybody feels it’s a huge waste, to say nothing of the environmental impact,” he said. “And the companies are scrambling as fast as they can to gather up this gas and hook up the pipelines they need to move it to processing plants.”
General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), Statoil (NYSE:STO) and Ferus Natural Gas Fuels say they have an answer: their “Last Mile Fueling System.” The trio is capturing the natural gas escaping Statoil’s Bakken oil wells and stripping out propane and butane from the liquids to transport it to processors. The rest of the gas is compressed on-site in GE’s “CNG in a box” system, an 8-by-20-foot fueling station, to be used for trucks and other equipment. So far, Statoil has converted 10 rigs to run on half diesel and half natural gas. The CNG system will help power those rigs.
“Eventually, most of the flaring will be gone,” said Lance Langford, vice president of Statoil’s North American Production and Development segment. “I think it’s a win-win for everyone.”

The natural gas replacing some of the diesel is less expensive, and the gas burns cleaner, reducing carbon pollution. “We want to replace diesel as much as possible,” Langford said. “We know we’re going to reduce emissions at the rig, but we don’t know exactly how much yet.”
It just makes good economic sense, agrees John Westerheide, general manager of unconventional resources at GE Oil & Gas.
The primary problem for the industry is that the sheer number of wells is outrunning the infrastructure needed to transport gas, but the Last Mile project could overcome this hurdle, Stewart Wilson, vice president of commercial development, said. “We’ve just got to build out the capacity,” he said.
The companies tested the CNG system on Monday to power hydraulic fracturing equipment. In a separate collaboration, GE and Statoil are in the “early stages” of researching how to use carbon dioxide instead of water to hydraulically fracture shale rock and retrieve crude, Westerheide said. "

454,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 25, 2014 02:45PM ET</span>",Tomorrow’s Wheat Today: Here’s What Bayer Is Up To ,"By Kathleen Caulderwood - Last week, Bayer CropScience Ltd. (BAYE:NS) opened a multimillion dollar wheat breeding center near Victoria, Australia. A team of 20 people will evaluate about 4000 types of wheat seeds. It's part of the company's focus on wheat as other producers concentrate on other crops. 
“There has been an underinvestment in wheat for a long time now in comparison to other crops such as corn and soybeans,” said Rick Turner, Bayer’s global head of wheat and oilseeds, to The North Queensland Register. “We feel we can make similar genetic gains in wheat as we have seen in these other crops,” he added.
Most are optimistic about corn and soy, but experts disagree about the global future of wheat. 
Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast wheat production to decline and food use to grow, preventing an increase in global ending stocks for the next year. But on Tuesday the Dutch Rabobank slashed its forecasts for wheat prices and the World Bank also forecasts an increase in wheat production this year. 
The daily wheat price has fallen to $275 per metric ton from a high of $361 in November 2012.    Global wheat production increased to 714.2 million metric tons in February, up from 653.8 million in 2011, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.    Climate change is a big concern for wheat producers, since severe weather in unlikely areas can be especially damaging for the ""cool weather"" crop. Consequently, Bayer scientists are working to make strains that are resistant to droughts and floods.  
“We are facing the twin challenges of how to increase intrinsic yield and adapt currency wheat varieties to cope with these environmental challenges,” said Steve Patterson, Bayer CropScience’s global crop manager cereals, in a statement. 
The process will take some time and requires a great deal of patience, but Bayer CropScience is eager to make the investment, which should help them capitalize on growing markets such as Asia.
“It certainly is a complex crop to work with, but we see it as such an important crop worldwide,” said Bayer CropScience Australia general manager Jacqueline Applegate to Theland.com.
In January, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) announced that it would receive approximately $1.37 million from Bayer CropScience, in an effort to help the consortium’s effort to sequence the wheat genome. “The DNA sequence of the wheat genome will provide and essential tool for identifying and studying the function of wheat genes and support efficient breeding of new varieties,” a press release reads.

The company’s Meadowbank Gold mine, in Canada’s northernmost Nunavut region, enjoys low-cash production costs, which fell to $637 per ounce in its latest quarter. That’s well below the spot price of gold, which sold for $1,320 per ounce on Monday, and below average industry production costs.
But the mine has seen setbacks in the remote region, thanks to a lack of nearby transport and logistics infrastructure. Agnico was forced to build a $50 million highway to ferry in food and other supplies for its 550 workers, and one 2011 fire cost the company $18 million.
The company has recently seen $269 million in impairment charges related to the Meadowbank mine, part of wider write-downs costing $1.2 billion. Agnico lost $436 million in impairments from its mines, partly due to weak gold prices in 2013. 
Still, the challenging Arctic geography promises material mineral riches. In 2011, the Meadowbank mine produced 270,800 ounces of gold, then worth $420 in market value, according to the Nunavut government’s website. Companies spent $300 million in 2011 exploring for gold, diamond and industrial metal deposits in Nunavut alone.
The Arctic also has abundant oil and natural gas reserves, alongside more than $1.5 trillion worth of minerals, estimates the U.S. Geochemical Society. Major Russian miner Norilsk Nickel (MCX:GMKN) has been active in the Arctic for years.
More than 200 mines have been abandoned or are still in early planning stages, according to the Raw Materials Group. Only six mines are now operating in the North American part of the Arctic.

Once users enter their zip code on the new website -- Fuelcaster.com -- the system tells them whether to buy gas in that area now or wait until the next day for a cheaper price. According to the site, it can predict if the gas price will rise or fall within the next 24 hours with almost 90 percent accuracy.

“What you’ll find is a ton of apps — both free and paid — that show gas prices, but none that focus on retail with the granularity that Fuelcaster does,” Esurance told BuzzFeed in an e-mail. “The bulk of the data comes from GasBuddy.com, which is all user generated content. (Other) prediction sites are more focused on wholesale gas prices, versus local retail, which is what GasBuddy does.”
According to Esurance, the service has been tested with thousands of scenarios in zip codes across the U.S. In addition to predicting the price of gas, the website locates 10 gas stations in the area with the cheapest prices, and displays how much a gallon currently costs. It also help users navigate to the gas station of their choice.

“If you see ‘buy,’ gas prices are expected to rise. If you see ‘wait,’ prices are forecasted to fall. It's a simple way to save. Though we're confident in our predictions and prices, they're not guaranteed. Gas prices are influenced by many factors and savings will vary,” Esurance said in its website.
Fuelcaster has been optimized for mobile devices, and is scheduled to be launched on Monday.

According to reports, the U.S. Coast Guard said that the barge and the towboat collided between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. The collision happened on Saturday afternoon near Vacherie, La., 47 miles west of New Orleans.
Coast Guard Petty Officer Bill Colclough reportedly said that there was no news on how much oil had spilled into the river. He added that no one was injured and all barges were secured, and that the cause behind the collision was being investigated.

Colclough reportedly said that the barge, one of two loaded with light crude, being pushed by the Hannah C. Settoon, hit the Lindsay Ann Erickson, which was pushing a grain barge. He added that he was unaware if the Lindsay Ann Erickson was damaged.
By late Sunday afternoon, around 16 vessels had been waiting to go downriver and 10 vessels were waiting in an upriver queue. New Orleans city officials shut down the public water-intake valves, which are located on the river, as a safety precaution.
""The water supply in St. Charles Parish remains safe,"" parish officials reportedly said, in a news release Sunday afternoon.
The Mississippi River and the nearby area are no strangers to boat collisions and oil spills.
According to the Guardian Liberty Voice, last month, a barge carrying 600,000 gallons of crude oil crashed at “one of the two most difficult turns in the Mississippi River.” The barge spilled more than 10,000 gallons of oil affecting the nearby riverbed, leaving a “long-term impact” in the sediment.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in March traded at $6.094 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, up 0.49%. The commodity hit session high of $6.303 and a low of $5.885.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $5.372 per million British thermal units, Monday's low, and resistance at $6.378, Thursday's high.
A powerful blast of cold air is expected to shoot across the northern U.S. states on Tuesday through Thursday, Natgasweather.com reported, which will increase demand for natural gas as businesses and homes crank up the heat.  
Still, uncertainty as to how long the system may stick around as well as how far south it dips capped the commodity's gains, even sending it into negative territory at times.
A lackluster weekly inventory report released Thursday capped gains as well.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended February 14 fell by 250 billion cubic feet, compared to expectations for a decline of 251 billion cubic feet.
The number sparked profit taking, especially among investors speculating for a more bullish stockpile report.

Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.443 trillion cubic feet. Stocks were 975 billion cubic feet less than last year at this time and 741 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 2.184 trillion cubic feet for this time of year.
The report showed that in the East Region, stocks were 364 billion cubic feet below the five-year average, following net withdrawals of 129 billion cubic feet.
Stocks in the Producing Region were 277 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 806 billion cubic feet after a net withdrawal of 91 billion cubic feet.
Stockpiles of the fuel are likely to finish below 1 trillion cubic feet by the last week of March, the formal end of the winter heating season, for the first time since 2003.

490,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 21, 2014 11:45AM ET</span>","Say 'Aloha,' For A Glimpse Of The Postmodern Energy System","By Meagan Clark - Hawaiians pay three times the national average to power their homes, as their island chain imports nearly all of its energy and relies on oil to generate electricity much more than the rest of the U.S. That’s why the state launched an aggressive plan in 2008 to produce 70 percent of its electricity from clean sources by 2030, and power grid operators are encouraging efficiency programs to lower demand.
So how are those efforts coming along? The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported Friday that Hawaii has so far replaced about 8 percent of its reliance on oil with renewable sources.

In 2008, coal and oil accounted for more than 90 percent of Hawaii’s annual electricity generation, according to the EIA. Generation from coal, which comes from one facility on Oahu, has remained at 13 to 15 percent each year in the past decade, while generation from petroleum has declined. Petroleum accounted for 81 percent of electricity generation in 2002 and declined to 72 percent last year. Comparatively, the U.S. overall uses oil to power less than 1 percent of its electricity.
At the same time, Hawaii has increased its generation from renewable energy sources from 4 percent of overall electricity generation in 2002 to more than 12 percent in 2013, the EIA said. And utility-scale electric generation has declined six years in a row from 2007 to 2012, mainly from policies that have increased efficiency and encouraged homes and businesses to generate electricity on-site by solar and other means like biomass, geothermal and hydroelectric.
The largest increases in renewable energy have come from solar and wind electricity production. EIA data shows wind accounted for 36 percent of utility-scale renewable generation in 2012, and rose to 42 percent in 2013 through November. Utility-scale solar generation increased more than fivefold from 2012 to 2013 but remains only 2 percent of utility-scale renewable generation. Small-scale solar power installations on homes and businesses have also grown as power grid operators seek partnerships to minimize consumption. For example, on Thursday, the state announced a $100 million outdoor site for companies to test pre-commercial solar, ocean and algae biofuels energy technologies.

528,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 18, 2014 04:05AM ET</span>","China Consumed, Mined & Imported The Most Gold Ever In 2013","By Nat Rudarakanchana - China has been officially crowned the world’s largest gold market for the first time, according to fresh industry figures from Tuesday.  
The country overtook India as the world’s largest consumer of gold in 2013, with consumer demand soaring 32 percent to 1,066 tonnes for 2013. That’s the most gold ever demanded annually by one country’s consumers in bars, coins and jewelry, topping India’s previous 2010 record of 1,007 tonnes.  

China is already the world’s top producer of gold, mining 437 tonnes in 2013 on industry estimates, with the largest annual increase globally for 2013. It displaced South Africa as the world’s largest gold producer in 2007. The country also imported a record 1,108 metric tons in 2013, up 33 percent from a year ago, via Hong Kong. That’s more gold imports than any other country.
“The impact on the Chinese gold industry of the extraordinary growth in 2013 demand has been marked, with significant growth in both manufacturing and retail network capacity,” reads the World Gold Council’s latest quarterly demand report.
“The gold market has really taken off in China over the last five years, to being quite small to now being the largest in the world,” council managing director Marcus Grubb told IBTimes in a phone interview.
“You’ve seen an expansion in the number of businesses selling gold, both at an investment and jewelry level,” continued Grubb. “Wholesalers and fabricators in Shenzen and in manufacturing zones are particularly interesting.”
“There may be up to 300 tonnes now sitting in that inventory and stocking chain in the Chinese system, with banks, fabricators, jewelers, wholesalers and dealers,” he said. “Those businesses were not stocking for fun.”
Much of the demand surge has stemmed from weak gold prices, which plunged abruptly to lows in April and June 2013. The precious metal fell 28 percent in price in 2013, in its worst showing since 1981.
That meant Chinese consumers snapped up physical gold at bargain prices, though Chinese buying in the second half of 2013 slowed significantly.
Although Wall Street analysts have said Chinese physical demand may be gold’s strongest single support, record consumer buying has done little to lift prices. Western investors sold off over 880 tonnes, or 28 million ounces, from gold exchange-traded funds in 2013, with high-profile hedge funds liquidating the metal from portfolios.
That led to much negative market sentiment in 2013, despite China’s extraordinary $49 billion consumer market. Investment demand, which drives prices via influential futures markets, fell 50 percent in 2013, in its worst year on record. That meant global gold demand shrank 15 percent in value in 2013 to $170 billion.
Global consumer demand rebounded to its best since the start of the financial crisis in 2008, according to World Gold Council data.


It’s unclear if gold flows from the West to East in 2013, which saw bullion refiners profit, could easily reverse. Chinese consumers often hoard gold and may be unwilling to relinquish it, even if prices fluctuate, according to Ed Moy, chief strategist for precious metals seller Morgan Gold.
“The Western focus is a lot more now on electronic derivatives and paper gold. The East is focused a lot on physical gold itself,” said Moy in an interview. “Individuals don’t have the capacity to necessarily buy a 400 ounce bar of gold – that’d be about half a million bucks – but they’re the ones driving demand for individual bullion coins.”
Grubb estimated that China’s gold consumer market may have circulated close to 1,400 tonnes of gold, far exceeding official estimates of 1,066 tonnes, if over-the-counter flows are included.  
Gold opened at $1,318 per ounce on Monday on New York’s COMEX exchange, at its highest since November.

532,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 17, 2014 01:35PM ET</span>",Gold Wins Strongest Returns In 2014 So Far: Goldman Sachs ,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - After a dismal 2013, gold has actually offered the best returns for the year to date among all asset classes in 2014, according to a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) chart from Monday.

That comes on the heels of a 28 percent decline in gold prices in 2013, its worst year since 1981. Stock markets have been sluggish in early 2014, however, pulling out the brakes after a bullish 2013 gave rise to talk of potential market corrections in 2014.
Still, like many Wall Street analysts, the New York-based investment bank’s metals analysts maintain a dim view of gold prices for the upcoming year. Goldman Sachs’ Jeffrey Currie sees gold averaging $1050 over 2014, down significantly from its current $1318 per ounce.
In the research note sent out Sunday, Goldman Sachs also discussed global equities. It held global macroeconomic conferences in Tokyo and Hong Kong last week, and said the majority of the 2000 attendees were most bullish on equities, relative to other assets, and specifically European equities.
In contrast with Asian investors and portfolio managers, Goldman Sachs predicts that the Japanese stock market will post the strongest returns in 2014.
“It became apparent that Europe is viewed as the ‘default option of choice.’ Past experience has led us to expect a bias in favor of local [Asian] equity markets, but the pattern did not occur this year,” wrote the Goldman Sachs analysts.
There is much apprehension over a Chinese economic slowdown and Japan’s “third arrow” of Abenomics reforms, which has dampened local sentiment, said the analysts.
“Most clients subscribed to our view that the current high valuation of the S&P 500 will result in only modest returns for the index in 2014. By process of elimination, clients believe European equities have the best near-term return possibilities.”
Asia-based equity investors also have a dimmer view of potential gains in the S&P 500 for 2014, relative to their American counterparts, according to the note.
“American home-bias exists. Many US-based investors with whom we have met recently expect the S&P 500 will climb to 2000 - 2200 by the end of this year (+10% to +20%). No investor we met at the macro conference expressed such a positive view of the US stock market,” read the note.
Goldman Sachs forecasted that Japan would post the best total return in 2014, at 23 percent, followed by Asian markets excluding Japan (16 percent), and Europe (12 percent), with U.S. equities in last place at a projected 6 percent return.

533,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 17, 2014 01:25PM ET</span>",The Factors Behind Kuwait's Oil Refinery Power Problem ,"By Meagan Clark - Inadequate power supply in Kuwait is continuing to hinder the country’s oil production as underinvestment collides with growing demand.
A power failure late last month shut down all three of Kuwait’s oil refineries with a total capacity of 930,000 barrels per day. The reason remains unclear as officials have not discussed the matter publicly.
The power shut off for the three refineries (the Mina Ahmadi, Mina Abdullah and Shuaiba refineries) at the same time, suggesting the state electricity supplier and not onsite technical problems are to blame.
“Power was cut from the source,” a spokesman for Kuwait National Petroleum Co. told Reuters.

The closures halted Kuwait’s fuel production for one week. The country is one of the world’s largest crude oil producers and refines about a third of its three million barrels per day crude production. About 660,000 barrels per day of petroleum products are exported, according to OPEC.
Kuwait’s power supplier, the Ministry of Electricity and Water, offers low prices. The low cost to air condition a home coupled with one of the world’s hottest climates has helped the country rank as the fourth biggest per capita energy consumer in the world, according to the World Bank.
But Kuwait has not expanded its infrastructure or attracted foreign investors to do it, and a shortage of natural gas is also straining the power supply. In the summer when demand for power is highest, Kuwait imports liquefied natural gas.
""Kuwait is perpetually in a state of electricity supply shortage and experiences frequent blackouts and brownouts each summer,"" the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in an analysis. ""In the past decade, the development of Kuwait's electricity sector has stalled because of political factors and lack of investment, despite average annual demand growth of 6 percent.""
Many refineries in other countries have their own generators to at least keep power going to control systems when supplies fail from outside. In Kuwait, the refineries depend completely on the national power grid. They have no internal power generation.
The last major power outage in Kuwait happened one year ago, and before that, three years ago. The outage last month was the most severe. Industry analysts say the recent blackout may have stemmed from a mistake in power flow management or the country’s ageing power equipment.
On Feb. 10, the Kuwait government approved $12 billion in bids from foreign companies to upgrade the Mina Ahmadi and Mina Abdullah refineries. Japan’s JGC Corp. won a $4.82 billion deal for the Mina Ahmadi refinery, and the U.K.’s Petrofac and the American Fluor Corp. paid Kuwait to work on Mina Abdullah. Contracts are expected to be signed in April, with work beginning soon after.
It is not yet clear whether the country’s $12 billion “Clean Fuels Project” will include power generators for back-up or even whether it will go on as scheduled. The plan is part of Kuwait’s economic development plan, which has been stalled due to political instability. Also part of the clean fuels plan is a project in planning since 2008 called Al-Zour. The Al-Zour refinery is supposed to replace the Shuaiba site, but it has been delayed to at least 2018.

536,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 17, 2014 09:25AM ET</span>",U.S. Gold Sentiment Shifts Slowly,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - U.S. investors have finally started to warm to gold, citing an array of bullish factors as the precious metal broke past a key $1300 per ounce threshold on Friday.
“Compared to the bearish sentiment that prevailed at the start of this year, US clients are warming to gold,” wrote UBS AG (VTX:UBSN) analysts in a note on Monday.
“That's not to say they're outright bullish - they're not, but the sentiment barometer (1-10 range) has moved from an icy 1 or 2 in January to a relatively warmer 5 or sometimes 6,” they added.
“Looking forward gold should be on the receiving end of more long interest than it has seen for some time, although this will drag considerably behind the norms of previous years.”
That’s not to say that gold prices will soar skywards. The precious metal has traded within narrow bands of about $50 to 100 over the past several months, from lows of $1180 per ounce to recent highs of $1300 or so.
The analysts merely expect the establishment of a slightly higher trading range in coming weeks. They don’t expect a return to the days of gold at over $1900, in all-time highs reached in September 2011.   
Better sentiment, after several weeks with analysts underlining weak or negative gold sentiment, stems from several factors.
Those include: “no expectations for a more aggressive Fed policy; potential for the removal of the 80/20 rule in India; light investor positioning; EM [emerging market] risks; gold's diversification with equities; persistent Chinese demand; constrained mine supply going forward; the need for tail risk hedging; and inflation or deflation risks.”

Nonetheless, investors are hesitant, since they can’t easily forget gold’s painful 2013, where it lost the most in value since 1981.
“It’s all rather tactical, rather than strategic,” UBS’ precious metals analysts Joni Teves and Edel Tully wrote. “Investors aren’t yet prepared to be in gold for the long or even medium haul just yet.”
“But now that US players are putting gold on their radar again, gold has an opportunity to climb, an opportunity that was severely lacking just a few weeks ago,” they concluded."

That’s relative to fixed income, currencies, emerging market equities and global equity indices. Gold has done especially well in the past several, rising to highs of $1,300 per ounce not seen since November 2013, after a year which saw severe slumps in price and investor sentiment.
That doesn’t mean returns will last. The analysts are bearish on most commodity sectors, including energy, precious metals and agricultural products.
Nonetheless, it’s a little more heartening than commodities markets from 2013. By the end of 2013, commodities earned a reputation as the worst performing assets in terms of returns, as the benchmark Dow Jones UBS commodities index fell 9.6 percent over 2013.
“The first six weeks of 2014 have been relatively kind to commodities compared to the losses suffered on benchmark equity and EM indices,” wrote the Deutsche Bank analysts.

552,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 14, 2014 10:05AM ET</span>","Wind Farms, Solar Panels And Killer Smog: Coal Still Reigns In China's Schizophrenic Energy Revolution","By Jacopo Dettoni - JIUQUAN, China – By almost any measure, China’s Hexi Corridor seems an unlikely place to show off the country’s environmentally friendly, renewable energy.
A narrow, windy, 600-mile-long passage running along the southern border of the Gobi Desert in China's northwestern Gansu province, the corridor is rife with heavy industry and coal-fired power plants that rise like monoliths from the arid, dusty steppe. Howling winds from the desert carry heavy loads of smog from smokestacks that blur the edges of distant mountains and shroud the skies over urban areas.
Of all the cities of Jiuquan prefecture, Yumen is near the epicentre of this grim industrial landscape. Once a booming oil town, with some 20,000 people, the city's fortunes have declined as the oil has been depleted; thousands of people have moved on, and parts of the city now resemble a ghost town interspersed with a few petroleum refineries and coal-fired power plants that spew a toxic mix of emissions.

Yet it is here that China has chosen to make its greatest investment in renewable energy, for better or worse.
Solar panels glitter on the rooftops of buildings surrounding coal-fired power plants while hundreds of wind turbines spin in the strong, frigid winter winds blowing from the desert. An enormous 20-gigawatt (GW) wind power development is under construction that will be among the world's largest and – theoretically – will be part of China’s program to replace toxic coal-fired plants with environmentally friendly, sustainable power sources.
   A wind farm in the Hexi Corridor  Jacopo Dettoni 
There is just one problem: The Hexi Corridor’s boom in solar and wind power is more conspicuous than effective. The odd juxtaposition of state-of-the-art renewable energy developments next to coal-fired dinosaurs is evidence of China’s schizophrenic energy policy, which emphasizes renewable energy even as it remains the world's biggest emitter of CO2 -- the primary culprit among greenhouse gases -- and to export its smog into neighboring countries and far over the Pacific Ocean.
“Where one coal power plant stops, another begins,” as James West, senior producer at climate change content platform Climate Desk, puts it.
If not for the scale of environmental damage that continues to be caused by the corridor’s heavy industry and coal-fired plants, the breadth of China’s commitment to renewable energy sources would, in fact, make the region a global model. In Jiuquan prefecture alone, primarily state-owned companies have developed wind and solar farms totaling 6GW and 1GW of installed capacity, respectively, during the past 10 years. And the dozens of wind-turbine blades piled up behind the gates of Jiuquan's new renewable-energy industrial park suggests that the local wind-power boom is far from over.
“Our goal is to reach 15GW of installed wind-power capacity in 2015 and add another 25GW by 2025, so that total capacity is going to reach 40GW,” Wu Xuesheng, head of the energy bureau of the Jiuquan Municipal Development and Reform Committee, said. That's enough power to run all of New York City, or to replace 10 coal-fired power plants and perhaps claim a spot in the world's top three wind-power energy producers. And Jiuquan is only the most obvious example of China’s renewable energy investment; similar developments are under construction all over the country. 
Facing worsening levels of environmental contamination, Chinese authorities have pursued on an unprecedented scale the development of power generation from sources other than fossil fuels, including wind, solar, hydropower and, to a lesser extent, nuclear power, for two reasons: Those sources are more sustainable, and toxic pollution from coal plants has reached levels that even the aggressively pro-development government recognizes as dangerous. Smog has gotten so bad across China that pilots sometimes have difficulty landing planes because of limited visibility, and pollution masks have become one of the best-selling items in Chinese markets.
Already, China has installed enough wind turbines to power an entire nation the size of Mexico. No other country can compare in terms of investment.
Back in 2005, when a national legal framework for renewable energy developments was passed, China's share of global installed wind-power capacity was a meager 2.1 percent. Seven years later, in 2012, the country accounted for 27 percent of the world's wind power base with more than 75GW of installed capacity, followed by the U.S. (21 percent) and Germany (11 percent), according to figures from the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC). Chinese manufacturers have taken over the wind-power industry worldwide, with four Chinese wind-turbine producers in the top 10 by market share. Guodian Corporation has overtaken Spain's Iberdrola SA (MCE:IBE) to become the world's largest owner of wind assets, according to figures from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
An additional 70GW of new wind power is expected to come on-grid by 2015, alongside 120GW of large-scale hydropower and 5GW of solar power, according to the strategic goals included in the country's 12th Five-Year Plan, which covers the period from 2011 to 2015. Chinese authorities want non-fossil fuel generation to meet 11.4 percent of primary energy consumption by 2015, compared with 9.8 percent, according to figures from the National Energy Administration (NEA).
Such ambitions are already a matter of national pride, exemplified by huge propaganda efforts and photos of wind farms in Beijing's national history museum.
All Powered Up And Nowhere To Go
For now, though, it appears unlikely that China will be able to significantly reduce pollution by using renewable sources, for a variety of reasons, and so the passing of the daylight hours in cities such as Jiuquan’s provincial capital, Lanzhou, are marked by the changing hues of purple and brown smog. The primary reason the new energy sources are having limited impact is that the power grid necessary to distribute all the new, green power has not kept pace with the development of renewable energy sources.
“We built too many wind and solar farms over the last few years and, today, the transmission lines are full,” Li Shimin, deputy managing director of Lanzhou's UNIDO International Solar Energy Center for Technology Promotion and Transfer (ISEC), told IBTimes.
   Power lines march across the steppe in the Hexi Corridor  Jacopo Dettoni 
Lured by generous feed-in tariff schemes devised to make investment attractive, renewable energy developers rushed to install new wind turbines and solar panels – so much so that the national power distributor, State Grid, has been unable to keep up. Many of the newer developments still await an adequate grid connection. As a result, green power struggles to come online, and meanwhile, coal-fired plants continue to foul the air. According to the project manager of a brand-new 100 megawatt solar facility a few miles from downtown Jiuquan, solar farms are running at only 40 percent capacity because the grid can handle no more.
In typical Chinese fashion, authorities have pledged to close the gap as quickly as possible, and in fact, huge transmission projects are being designed. “We built a second 750 kilovolt (kv) transmission line in 2013 and another 800kv line is slated to be up and running by 2015,” Wu noted. “At that point, the grid will be able to match the whole renewable energy capacity in the area.”
Nationwide, State Grid is investing 2.55 trillion yuan ($420 billion USD) between 2011 and 2015 to absorb the new power capacity that is slated to come online during that period. That equals a yearly investment rate of around one percent of the nation's entire economy, the second largest in the world. Some 500 billion yuan is going toward high-voltage transmission lines to better connect power-generating provinces in the northwest, including Gansu, with big consumption centers in the east, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
Yet even when high-voltage transmission lines are in place, renewable energy generation will not likely supplant fossil fuel power plants given China's growing energy needs.
“Wind and solar power cannot be continuously supplied, and that creates problems,” ISEC's Li said.
Wind farms in Gansu logged around 1,880 effective hours in 2013, Jiuquan's Wu said. That equals a 21 percent capacity factor. Only one-fifth of Jiuquan's wind peak capacity turns into electricity, below the 25 percent to 30 percent average range for wind farms across the globe. The problem is the intermittent nature of the region’s winds; solar farms, likewise, are inconsistent producers, with an average capacity factor of around 25 percent, owing to fluctuating weather conditions and the day-night light cycle. Without a smart grid capable of minimizing losses and storing renewable energy to meet peak demand, burning fossil fuels remains the only way to continuously meet China's growing energy needs. No wonder, then, that coal is still king, in Gansu as elsewhere in the country.
Other fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas are largely imported, yet coal abounds in China and has naturally emerged as the source of choice to power the Chinese economic miracle. The government's recent push for a greener energy mix may be reducing coal's share of total energy production, but it will not reverse the country's dependence on cheap coal any time soon.
No Peak for Coal in Sight
Coal consumption is projected to peak in 2035, when China will account for 57 percent of the world's total consumption, and more than the rest of the world combined, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates in its International Energy Outlook 2013. As the economy keeps growing and electricity demand follows suit, “coal-fired power capacity expands by almost 530 gigawatts from 2010 to 2040, with net capacity additions averaging nearly 18 gigawatts per year, as compared with 59 gigawatts per year from 2005 to 2010,” the report notes. That equals with an average of 18 new mid-sized power plants coming online every year during the next three decades – not much of an achievement for a country supposedly on a quest to reduce environmental contamination and improve air quality.
   Smog dims the day in Lanzhou, China  Jacopo Dettoni 
A number of coal conversion projects meant to produce liquid fuels and synthetic natural gas, and reduce the country's dependence on oil and natural gas imports, are expected to further boost coal mining and consumption across the country.
“The potential scale of projects in China involving coal to produce synthetic natural gas and synthetic liquids is enormous,” wrote IEA's director of energy markets and security, Keisuke Sadamori, in an industry report in December 2013.
As a result, despite massive investment in alternative energy sources and related products and construction, no one has more reason to be optimistic than China’s coal barons. Total coal consumption is expected to hit 4.8bn metric tons by 2020, up from 3.52bn in 2012, according to the China National Coal Association’s forecast.
Few people expect a significant change in course any time soon, despite the ongoing, massive investment in alternative energy. Instead, Chinese humor has darkened alongside the atmosphere, with even the state-controlled English-language newspaper, China Daily, having published a popular joke about the country’s infamous air pollution.
As the joke goes, someone in Beijing comments that the smog is so dense that he cannot see the giant Chairman Mao portrait in Tiananmen Square. Another person replies, ""You call that dense? I cannot see the Chairman Mao portrait on my banknotes.""
The subtext of the joke is evident in the punch line: The bank notes are, literally and figuratively, the bottom line.

Total OECD industry stocks fell by 56.8 million barrels a day in December, diminishing OECD stock for the final quarter to 1.5 million barrels a day. Total OECD oil stocks were below their five-year average at the end of December.

Global, non-OPEC oil supplies fell by 290,000 barrels a day in January compared to December, to 92.1 million barrels a day, IEA said. But year over year, supplies increased by 1.5 million barrels a day. Non-OPEC output in January 2014 grew by 1.9 million barrels a day from January 2013, and OPEC natural gas liquids from January 2013 exceeded a decrease in OPEC crude production of 390,000 barrels a day. IEA forecasts non-OPEC supply growth for 2014 at 1.7 million barrels a day.
Crude oil supply rose modestly in January by 85,000 barrels a day to about 30 million barrels a day. A partial recovery of Libyan output helped offset a fall in Iraqi production. IEA did not change the “call on OPEC crude and stock change” for the current quarter, leaving the forecast at 29 million barrels a day. But the agency raised its forecast for the year by 0.2 million barrels based on expected higher demand.
OECD oil demand growth rebounded in last year’s second half, but non-OECD countries still accounted for more than 90 percent of the global growth in oil demand last year. IEA expects demand growth to accelerate this year with the global economy.

(NYSE:GS) research.
Gold, platinum, copper, iron and soybean markets could all be rattled by unease within “vulnerable” countries, which the investment bank defined as those with problems managing trade deficits.  
From this lens, vulnerable nations include Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey, and South Africa, Goldman Sachs commodities analysts said in a note from Wednesday.

“Commodities most exposed…include gold on the demand side, and copper, iron ore, soybeans and platinum on the supply side,” they wrote. “This reinforces our existing bearish forecasts on these markets.""
The note reinforces the globalized nature of natural resource prices and trading. India is a key source of gold demand and imports heavily. South Africa produces most of the world’s platinum and hosts a community of investors keenly interested in the metal. Brazil is close to overtaking the U.S. as the world’s top soybean producer.
Weaker currencies and slower growth in these countries, among other vulnerable groups, could hurt demand and impact supplies. Those five disparate commodities were the most highly levered to vulnerable emerging markets, on a quantitative Goldman analysis.
   Commodities Exposure Among Emerging Markets In Early 2014, Goldman Sachs Research Note Feb 12 2014  Goldman Sachs Research 
Oil is expected to remain insulated from emerging market turmoil for the time being, though. 
“We find that the oil market has only a small leverage to this “vulnerable” EM [emerging markets] group given its very low price elasticity. This, along with record low seasonal crude inventories at the end of 2013, is likely a key reason why oil has been so unresponsive to the recent EM turmoil,” wrote the analysts.
Luckily, many “resilient” emerging markets consume commodities in good measure, which could help rebalance global oversupplies.
Investors worldwide have been spooked lately by political and economic moves in Argentina and Turkey, as global equity markets faltered weeks after coming off an encouraging 2013.

559,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 13, 2014 03:05PM ET</span>",Is China's Grain Independence Over?,"By Sophie Song - Chinese leaders are worried the world’s second-largest economy will come to depend on imports for corn, just as it does for soybeans.
“We cannot have a situation like it was with soybeans, where we now heavily rely on imports,” Huang Dafang, the director of the Biotechnology Research Institute of Beijing’s influential Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, told reporters on Thursday, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Beijing’s goal has long been to have enough domestically grown grain to feed at least 95 percent of its population’s consumption, and soybeans were an important part of that self-sufficiency target, since China’s soybeans had been supplied by domestic producers until the beginning of this century.

But following its admission to the World Trade Organization, Beijing opened its gates to importing soybeans, which quickly overtook domestic output. China has since become the world’s top soybean importer, with 63.4 million tonnes (69.9 million tons) in 2013. By contrast, it only produced 13 million tonnes within its borders.
Corn is showing signs of following that same path, which has China, worried for its independence in grains, especially after the nation turned into a net importer for corn in 2010. The U.S. accounts for more than 90 percent of the Chinese import, which has shown explosive growth in recent years.
In December, China rejected 545,000 tonnes of corn from the U.S., because the shipment contained a genetically modified strain, which the Chinese have always been wary of. The rejection contributed to an overall 37 percent fall in the country’s corn import for the year of 2013, according to the Wall Street Journal.
But the massive rejection highlights China’s enormous appetite for the grain to feed its population of 1.3 billion. The government has thus far declined to allow domestic genetically modified corn to be commercially grown and distributed for human consumption, but if that trend continues, China will have no choice but to rely more heavily on imports.

The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending February 8 rose by 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 339,000 from the previous week’s total of 331,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to fall by 1,000 to 330,000 last week.

574,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 12, 2014 05:05PM ET</span>",Gold Dealers May Avoid Bitcoin On Regulatory Fears,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - Precious metals dealers may avoid accepting bitcoin in payment for gold, thanks to regulatory uncertainty, according to industry insiders.
That’s despite a warm welcome from some gold retailers who will happily trade one of the world’s oldest and most recognizable currencies for a volatile upstart on the global financial stage.
Gold retailer Morgan Gold told IBTimes in an interview that questions over anti-money laundering rules have stopped them from accepting bitcoins as payment.
“My concern with bitcoin and the gold business would be the reporting laws that exist for the current gold industry,” said Morgan Gold CEO David Cloyed to IBTimes. “There’s a lot of questions that haven’t been answered about bitcoin and what it represents in terms of currency transactions as they relate to gold.”

Bitcoin’s anonymous nature and association with illegal drugs marketplace Silk Road make it vulnerable to money launderers, who hide the origins of cash to mask ill-gotten gains.
In an effort to root out money laundering, the Internal Revenue Service requires cash payments of more than $10,000 to be reported by businesses, regardless of what they sell.
Because regulatory stakes are high, gold companies must be cautious about how they deal with bitcoin, said Morgan Gold’s chief strategist, Edmund Moy.
As it turns out, regulators told IBTimes they don’t consider bitcoin payments akin to cash payments.
The relevant Form 8300 is “specific about what is included as “cash,” and those definitions do not include bitcoin,” wrote the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) spokesman Stephen Hudak to IBTimes.   
FinCEN, which combats money laundering for the Treasury, contrasted virtual currencies and actual currencies back in March 2013. But a recent high-profile bitcoin bust has refocused regulatory attention on bitcoin, amid complaints from the broader finance sector about the regulatory questions bitcoin raises. FinCEN has sent out letters warning unregistered bitcoin businesses about compliance, Reuters reported recently.
Startup online gold retailer CBMint plans to accept bitcoin shortly. But its chief financial officer, Chris Martinez, told IBTimes that he’d likely submit the relevant Form 8300 for gold bitcoin purchases over $10,000, which regulators say isn’t necessary.
That underscores some of the confusion in the industry.
Martinez also pointed out that accepting bitcoin automatically makes a business a money service business under the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. That has led to trouble with CBMint’s current bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (NYSE:JPM) popular Chase arm, which told Martinez it won’t do business with CBMint if the gold seller accepts bitcoin.
“If we decide to accept bitcoin in the future, we will likely have to look elsewhere” for a bank, Martinez said to IBTimes. JPMorgan is not alone in hesitating to provide services to bitcoin businesses, according to MarketWatch.
The bitcoin gold trade may all be moot, in any case.
One prominent national gold dealer who accepts bitcoin told IBTimes: “We have received several inquiries about bitcoin but are yet to have any individuals that actually purchased gold with bitcoin.” The company declined to speak on the record about bitcoin-gold regulations.
On Wednesday, one troy ounce of gold in New York cost up to $1,292, or just less than two bitcoins.
Gold dealers typically accept cash, checks and wire transfers. Some fear fraudulent credit card payments, but bitcoin could help reduce those concerns, according to Moy.
Bullion dealers have other reporting requirements specific to the industry, though these are complex and technical. Multiple forms could potentially be required by government regulators, said Cloyed.
The National Taxpayer Advocate, an internal watchdog for the IRS, said in a January report that the IRS hasn’t yet clarified bitcoin-related rules.
“The lack of clear answers to basic questions such as when and how taxpayers should report gains and losses on digital currency transactions probably encourages tax avoidance,” concluded the report."

Sales by the U.S. Mint to gold dealers fell to 133,000 from 222,500 ounces a year ago. That’s still a strong monthly showing, but also falls below January 2012’s sales of 140,500 ounces.

January is typically a bountiful month for gold dealers, as consumers stock up on new coin designs and gifts for later in the year. Investors have predicted strong gold coin sales this year, highlighting that retail market as a strength in an otherwise gloomy gold environment.
   Monthly U.S. Mint Gold Coin Sales, 2012-2014, CPM Group Research Report Feb 6 2014  CPM Group Research Report Feb 6 2014   Lesser sales suggest that gold dealers now hold ample stocks, wrote New York’s CPM Group in a Feb. 6 precious metals report. They may offload that inventory onto consumers in coming months - that is, if consumers are buying.
Some gold dealers saw softer sales in January, although gold coin sales are still soaring by historical standards.
“When gold goes down and drops, there’s lots of sellers, but when it starts to stabilize and go back up, there are less buyers,” said Morgan Gold CEO David Cloyed to IBTimes.
Sales of coins minted before 1933, a leading indicator for broader coin sales, have slowed significantly since November and have stayed muted, according to Cloyed. That specialist market only accounts for a small percentage of the gold coin trade.
“What the U.S. Mint produces is additional supply to the existing market. The existing market has gotten 1 million to 1.4 million ounces of new gold from the Mint over the past four years,” explained Morgan Gold strategist and former U.S. Mint director Edmund Moy to IBTimes.
In years where market risk is low, the Mint sells 200,000 to 300,000 ounces of gold per year to dealers. Even with lower gold demand recently, amounts annually distributed to dealers still far outweigh figures from off-risk years, said Moy.
“Mint figures tend to be volatile at a time when the Mint changes over from 2013 to 2014,” wrote Alan Mandel, a precious metals analyst for gold retailer HTDT Gold, to IBTimes. “I suspect February bullion coin sales generally will be higher.”
“No one has returned to sell their gold coins back to us” over the past year, continued Mandel. “I suspect this is the same all over. Sales may slow but the coins are hoarded.”
Gold edged higher early in 2014, nearing a key $1300 per ounce mark on Wednesday’s trading. The metal hasn’t traded above $1300 per ounce since November 2013.
Many Wall Street analysts remain bearish on gold’s prospects for 2014 and beyond. Some analysts see the metal trading at less than $1000 per ounce in coming months.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in March traded at USD4.932 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, up 2.23%. The commodity hit session high of USD5.027 and a low of USD4.781.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at USD4.564 per million British thermal units, Monday's low, and resistance at USD5.734, the high from Feb. 5.
Investors were betting that a powerful winter storm dumping snow and ice across the southeastern U.S. will prompt thermal power plants to burn more natural gas to meet demand, which should take its toll on the country's inventories.
The U.S. National Weather Service said that the southern part of the U.S. may get 1 to 3 inches (2.5-7.5 centimeters) of snow and sleet over the next three days, while the northeastern U.S. could see wintery weather as the system tracks towards the Atlantic.
Bullish speculators are betting that the winter storm will increase demand for the heating fuel.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
Prices saw support amid speculation weekly supply data due on Thursday will show a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. natural gas inventories due to cold weather.
Early withdrawal estimates for this week’s storage data range from 225 billion cubic feet to 240 billion cubic feet. The five-year average change for the week is a decline of 162 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage fell by 262 billion cubic feet last week to 1.923 trillion cubic feet, approximately 22% below the five-year average for this time of year and nearly 29% below last year’s unusually high level.
Natural-gas inventories have fallen sharply since November as frigid winter temperatures in the U.S. led households to burn a higher than normal amount of the fuel in furnaces to heat their homes.
Elsewhere on the NYMEX, light sweet crude oil futures for delivery in March were up 0.58% and trading at USD100.52 a barrel, while heating oil for March delivery were down 0.36% and trading at USD3.0172 per gallon.

579,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 12, 2014 12:25PM ET</span>",Why Drug Cartels Are Seen Profiting From Mexican Oil Reform,"By Meagan Clark - Mexico’s recent oil reform will open up the energy industry from a 75-year-old state monopoly to a stream of private companies, and with them, organized crime.
Mexico’s vast shale-based reserves are one of the world’s largest, according to a recent assessment by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But the shale is also located in precisely the northeastern regions heavy influenced by the Zetas organized crime group. The Zetas and rivals like the Gulf Cartel have profited from reselling stolen oil and illegal mining operations for years, pocketing about $1.13 billion from the trade in 2012 and the first nine months of 2013, according to a November report by Pemex director Emilio Lozoya. And more than half of the money came in during the last nine months, indicating gangs’ oil profits are rising.
Pemex was established as Mexico's state oil company in 1938. Reuters
“Most of the public attention on the oil reform has focused on the political consequences, but the sudden entry of a raft of new firms unfamiliar with Mexico could present a juicy new target and a revenue boon for organized crime,” Patrick Corcoran wrote Tuesday for InSightCrime, a website dedicated to tracking organized crime in the Americas.
In December, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto signed a reform into law that will end the monopoly of the state oil company Pemex and allow private companies to drill for oil and gas. Then in January, Nieto announced a partnership between Pemex and Russian firm Lukoil. U.S. companies too, especially those with operations in Texas, are expected to stretch their operations across the border into Mexico’s shale basins.
The Mexican congress must still draft legislation before March ends that will specify details like how the government will award contracts. In his speech before signing the reform, Nieto promised his citizens the act would bring more jobs and cheaper electric bills.
Opponents say the reform betrays Mexico’s oil sovereignty and will not help ordinary Mexicans but only fatten the billfolds of the already-rich oil businessmen.  Left-wing parties are promising to organize the country’s first referendum in 2015 to undo the law, though reversing the law would still need approval from the Supreme Court.
Supporters say the reform will boost Mexico’s ailing oil output and slowly growing economy by attracting billions in investment from private oil firms and helping manufacturers better compete globally with cheaper and more plentiful energy.  
Regardless, Mexican gangs have plenty of practice siphoning oil from Pemex pipelines. Pemex and Mexican authorities have traced the most illegal taps to the Sinaloa Cartel of the state Sinaloa and the Zetas.
Pemex discovered more than 2,600 illegal siphons on its pipelines stealing gasoline, diesel, crude oil, natural gas and petrochemicals in 2013, compared to only 155 in 2000, Mexican newspaper El Universal reported last week after filing a freedom of information request in Mexico. That’s a 1,548 percent rise in 13 years. Siphons appear more in states with higher drug cartel activity.
After obtaining the crude, the gangs’ profit depends on how many outside companies and gas stations will pay for it, knowingly or unknowingly purchasing stolen goods. The crude is usually transported across the border with false documents and priced below market so companies buying can increase their profit margins. Pemex has sued gobs of U.S. companies and individuals for participating in fuel trafficking, including Big Star Gathering Ltd., F&M Transportation Inc., Western Refining Co., Joplin Energy and others.
As one integrated company, Pemex has successfully tracked down a portion of lost supplies and closely watched employees suspected of criminal activity. But as the oil industry diversifies, criminal groups will have an array of targets and partners to choose from. When one company tightens security, a gang will be able to simply find another, and perhaps more vulnerable, company.

581,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 12, 2014 10:05AM ET</span>",Copper Beats Gold As An Inflation Hedge: S&P,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - Copper may be better suited for protecting investors against inflation than gold, according to a surprising analysis pioneered by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC.
Investors have typically viewed gold as an inflation hedge, since it is touted as a safe haven in times of geopolitical and monetary turmoil. Gold also moves inversely to the U.S. dollar, so a weaker currency often translates into higher gold prices.
But that received wisdom of gold’s power as an inflation hedge may not square with the facts, S&P’s vice president of commodity indices Jodie Gunzberg said Tuesday to IBTimes in an interview.

“Inflation [hedging] with gold is not as powerful as inflation [hedging] with copper, which is a true industrial metal and moves much more with economic growth,” she told IBTimes on Tuesday. “Copper, because it’s the material used in buildings, has historically been more sensitive to inflation and a better inflation hedge than gold.”
As the global economy improves, and inflation rises as products become more expensive, copper prices may also rise. Although Federal Reserve tapering and interest rate hikes have preoccupied markets most in recent weeks, others have warned that inflation may rear its head towards the end of the year and into 2015.
Academic studies have delivered mixed conclusions on gold’s properties as an investment hedge. In the 1980s and 1990s, gold failed as a shield against inflation, an international study found in September 2013.
In contrast, copper has been historically consistent in its relationship to inflation, according to Gunsberg.
“Both expected and unexpected inflation are positively correlated to copper returns, though the correlation to unexpected inflation is more significant,” noted earlier S&P research, which analyzed decades of data. 
“A similar analysis was also conducted on gold and neither expected nor unexpected inflation was found to be statistically significant in explaining gold returns…Investors purchasing gold in the early 1980s would have experienced losses relative to inflation,” read the paper.
“Overall, copper returns appear to perform better in inflationary periods than those of gold...This is significant, especially given that copper makes up a very small portion of the CPI.”
Consumer prices rose 1.5 percent over the past year, up slightly from past monthly readings, according to the latest U.S. consumer price index.
Many investors lost faith in gold in 2013, as prices saw their worst decline since 1981. Depictions of gold as a stable safe haven may now be permanently tarnished, though others still defend gold as diversifying portfolios.

590,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 11, 2014 07:45PM ET</span>","Brazil Agriculture Booms, Even As Grain Prices Wobble","By Nat Rudarakanchana - Brazil is bullish on its agriculture.
That’s the message on Tuesday from Brazil’s Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply, marking the start of the 2013-2014 harvest season. The ministry anticipates a record year for Brazilian agriculture and the agribusiness sector.
The ministry forecasts a record harvest of 90 million tons of soybeans, which could help it overtake the U.S. as the world’s top soybean producer. The 193 million tons of projected harvested grain also moves Brazil closer to the ranks of the world’s top food producers, a circle dominated by the U.S., China and India, among others.
For Brazil’s massive agribusiness industry, gross domestic product could grow 4 percent in 2014 to about 1 trillion Brazilian reais ($416 billion). If that projection is met, the sector’s GDP will have grown 34 percent in 10 years, according to the Brazilian government. That business accounts for 23 percent of the country’s economy now.
The sector exported goods (including meat, soybean and maize) worth $99 billion last year, or more than 40 percent of all Brazilian products sold to other countries. 
But bumper Brazilian harvests could flood global markets and dampen global commodity prices, even as Brazilian exporters see better sales. Large grain harvests in South America and the U.S. should pressure prices by the second half of 2014, London’s Capital Economics wrote in a note on Tuesday.    
“We are not anticipating that prices will plummet again, as they did over the last year,” wrote Tom Pugh, their commodities economist. “But we do continue to expect ample supply to pull prices down gradually.”
The drag on prices comes despite strong rising demand for grain. Global oversupply of agricultural commodities has been a key theme for investors and analysts early this year, though uncertain weather in Brazil has boosted commodities like coffee.
“We’ve seen the big influence of weather in the cattle markets, dairy markets and grain markets recently,” Brazil’s Scot Consultoria analyst Rafael Ribeiro told IBTimes. “Hot temperatures and lack of rainfall are important factors for soybean and corn.”
Brazil has seen the hottest January on record in some of its most productive regions, with scarce rain. That has sparked abrupt price swings for some grains and led to revised production forecasts.
Initial estimates for soybean production have been revised anywhere from 10 to 15 percent downwards, to 40 to 50 percent less, depending on the region, according to Ribeiro. That highlights the uncertainty traders face when forecasting grain prices, which depend heavily on fickle weather patterns.
Brazil’s official Conab agency cut its grain harvest projections in a report on Tuesday, and its March report may show further downward revisions, said Ribeiro.
Meanwhile, influential investors like Dennis Gartman have said they are bearish on Brazilian soybeans.
“There’s going to be a huge increase in the amount of acreage planted in soybeans.

On Tuesday the New York-traded oil futures hit a session low of USD99.92 a barrel, a high of USD100.57 a barrel and finally closing at USD99.93 a barrel.
Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at USD99.11 a barrel, Monday's low, and resistance at USD100.53 a barrel, Monday's high.
In prepared remarks to the House Financial Services Committee, Fed Chair Yellen suggested that the central bank will continue tapering the pace of its asset purchases at future meetings if the economy continued to improve as expected.
“Let me emphasize that I expect a great deal of continuity in the Federal Open Market Committee’s approach to monetary policy,” she said.
Yellen added that the pace of the central bank’s bond purchases are not on a “preset course” and reiterated that the Fed plans to hold interest rates near zero “well past” the time the jobless rate falls below 6.5%.
The Fed is currently purchasing USD65 billion in Treasury holdings and mortgage debt a month to suppress interest rates to spur recovery, which weakens the dollar as a side effect, though talk of less Fed intervention has the opposite effect on the U.S. currency.
A stronger greenback tends to make oil a less attractive commodity on dollar-denominated exchanges.
Cushioning losses were Yellen's concerns that the unemployment rate remains high, leaving markets to conclude the Fed will taper oil-supporting stimulus measures gradually.
Also keeping the commodity range bound were perceptions that a decision to further taper monetary stimulus programs signals a more robust economy, one that will demand more fuel and energy going forward.

611,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 10, 2014 10:27AM ET</span>",How Much Gold Did Chinese Grannies Buy In 2013?,"By Sophie Song - China’s demand for gold exceeded 1,000 tonnes (1,102 tons) for the first time in 2013, a 41 percent leap from 2012, says the China Gold Association.
The surge in consumption, fueled by a 28 percent slide in gold prices in early 2013, makes China the biggest gold consumer in the world. By contract, demand dropped in India, the other major gold consumer.
According to statistics on the China Gold Association website, China consumed 1,176.40 tonnes of gold last year, with jewelry demand climbing 43 percent to 716.50 tonnes, and bullion demand leaping 57 percent to 375.73 tonnes.

""The sharply lower prices attracted a lot of Chinese consumers looking for bargains,"" said Chen Min, an analyst at Jinrui Futures in Shenzhen, according to the Economic Times. ""Gold will continue to be an attractive investment in China in the near term as prices look steady near $1,200 an ounce.”
The demand surge was affectionately dubbed the ""Granny Effect"" in China, as middle-aged and elderly Chinese women, attracted by low prices, lined up outside gold shops both in mainland China and in Hong Kong to buy every piece of gold jewelry and bullion they could lay their hands on. 
Correspondingly, China’s production of gold rose as well, to 428.16 tons, a jump of 6.2 percent dwarfed by the country’s surge in demand. Even so, China remains the world’s biggest producer of gold for the seventh year running.
The figures from the China Gold Association do not take into account demand from the Chinese central bank, whose reserves stand at 1,054 tonnes, according to the latest number on the central bank’s website, which was announced in April 2009. Market speculation suggests that the bank may have been accumulating reserves and would soon announce a new figure, the Economic Times reported.

Temperatures are expected to warm following the arctic chill that settled through most of the nation during January.
MDA Weather Services said it expects a ""more aggressive warm up"" in the Midwest by late next week, while a ""more substantial warmth"" will build over the central U.S. in its 11- to 15-day forecast.

The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said Thursday that natural gas supplies dropped by 262 billion cubic feet in the week ended January 31, compared to expectations for a decline of 270 billion cubic feet.

Natural-gas inventories have fallen sharply since November as frigid winter temperatures in the U.S. led households to burn a higher than normal amount of the fuel in furnaces to heat their homes.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in March traded at USD5.173 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, down 3.76%. The commodity hit session high of USD5.735 and a low of USD5.154.
The March contract settled up 9.58% on Tuesday to end at USD5.375 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at USD4.769 per million British thermal units, Monday's low, and resistance at USD5.735, the earlier high.
Updated weather forecasting models called for bitter cold weather across the U.S. during the next three-to-five days.
Colder temperatures hike demand for natural gas at the country's thermal power plants as businesses and homes crank up their heating.
Still, longer-range forecast models called for a return of seasonably mild temperatures to settle in across much of the country from Feb. 15 to Feb. 19, with some pockets of the country seeing above normal temperatures, which sparked a round of profit taking.
Traders kept an eye out to Thursday's U.S. supply report as well.
Early withdrawal estimates range from 250 billion cubic feet to 281 billion cubic feet, compared to a drop of 129 billion cubic feet during the same week a year earlier.
Total U.S. natural gas storage fell by 230 billion cubic feet last week to 2.193 trillion cubic feet, approximately 17% below the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural-gas inventories have fallen by nearly 40% since November as frigid winter temperatures in the U.S. led households to burn a higher than normal amount of the fuel in furnaces to heat their homes.
Some market analysts expect supplies at the end of the winter heating season in March to be at their lowest in six years.
Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs lowered its forecast for inventory levels at the end of March to 1.39 trillion cubic feet, driven by the recent “polar vortex.” Goldman had previously estimated U.S. gas inventories at 1.61 trillion by the end of March.

651,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 05, 2014 01:30PM ET</span>","Iron Ore, Coal Prices Slump","By Sneha Shankar - The price of iron ore has fallen 8.4 percent, according to data from Platts. Thermal coal prices fell 8.4 percent in January, and  premium hard-rocking coal prices declined 5 percent, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. China's imports from Australia, its biggest trading partner, will be announced in an upcoming Australian trade report, which industry watchers await eagerly.
According to Reuters, iron ore exports to China from Australia's Port Hedland, which ships about a fifth of the global market for the steel-making raw material, fell 3.5 percent in January from December.
 
The drop was largely due to weaker demand from Chinese steel mills and the aftermath of a late December cyclone that closed the port's anchorage for nearly three days.
Shipments to China dropped to 23.31 million tonnes in January versus 24.16 million tonnes in December, data from the Port Hedland Port Authority showed on Tuesday.
Analysts have warned China's appetite for imported ore would wane in the months ahead as industrial growth cools and demand for steel weakens.
The volume of imported iron ore stacked in China's major ports has swelled to almost 93 million tonnes , the highest since November 2012.
February could also prove to be a lighter month for exports, given the heavy rains in the Pilbara iron belt, from where the port's top two users, BHP Billiton and Fortescue MetalsGroup, ship around 80 million tonnes per quarter.
Fortescue, the world's fourth-biggest producer, last week revised fiscal 2014 shipments ending June 30 to the lower end of guidance at 127 million tonnes, citing interruptions caused by the cyclone and heavy rains at its mines since then.
The company's main Cloudbreak mine was saturated with 500 millimetres of rain over a single week.
Iron ore shipments to Japan fell to 1.43 million tonnes in January from 2.07 million in December. Shipments to South Korea climbed to 2.74 million tonnes from 2.02 million tonnes over the period, Port Hedland data showed.
Overall, Port Hedland iron ore exports totalled 28.23 million tonnes in January versus 29.46 million in December, according to the port authority.

That’s the change from December 2012 to December 2013 in China’s wheat imports, measured in kilo tonnes, according to a recent Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) note.
In real terms, the change is also staggering.
“That 5319% YoY increase was not a typo,” wrote Citigroup China commodities analyst Shawn Shen in an email to IBTimes. “Chinese wheat imports were 395.22 kt in Dec 2013 and 7.29 kt in Dec 2012.”
From seven kilo tonnes to almost 400 kilo tonnes, the startling one-off statistic illustrates China’s reliance on wheat imports in 2013.
The country is already the world’s biggest wheat consumer, but suffered from a smaller harvest in 2013, reported Bloomberg. Bad weather spoiling domestic harvests in 2013 meant China could stand to beat out Egypt as the world’s top wheat importer.
On an annual basis, China’s wheat imports rose from under 1 million tonnes in 2009 to 5.5 million tonnes in 2013, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. China’s imports of barley, corn, and rice couldn’t keep up.
   China Top 5 Grain Imports 2013, Thomson Reuters Data  Thomson Reuters      China Top 5 Grain Imports 2006-2013, Thomson Reuters Data  Thomson Reuters 
In 2013, China imported by far the most wheat from the United States, relative to any other country it imported from. It bought 3.8 million tonnes of U.S. wheat, relative to the second top partner Canada, who sold China 866,000 tonnes.
December 2013, too, pales with October 2013. In the latter month alone China imported 1.3 million tonnes of wheat, according to the Citi note.
Thankfully, world wheat production for the 2013-2014 season is projected to hit a new record, according to the USDA’s latest wheat outlook. China led that increase in January 2014, up 1 million tonnes to 122 million. China’s Henan province is its biggest growing region.
For the year overall, China increased wheat imports by 50 percent thanks to the record U.S. harvest, in its second largest yearly import boost by commodity, said Citi. China consumed 122.5 million tonnes of wheat in 2011, on USDA estimates. China domestically produces the vast majority of its wheat consumption.  
Russia, China, India, the European Union, and the U.S. are among the world’s top wheat producers.
The U.S. winter wheat crop has suffered from bitter temperatures, as their “snow cover” evaporated, reported the USDA on Monday. Wheat is used in flour, noodles, and livestock feed, among other uses.
   Citigroup China 2013 Imports Recap, Jan 2014 Citigroup Note  Citigroup Research

668,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 04, 2014 09:30AM ET</span>",Coffee Sees Jump On Brazil’s Lack Of Rainfall,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - Arabica coffee beans staged their largest one-day percentage jump in eight years on Monday, driven by unexpectedly dry weather in Brazil, reports the Wall Street Journal.
Coffee prices in the $7 billion futures market rose 8.6 percent on Monday and hit $1.3595 per pound on the ICE futures U.S. exchange. That’s the largest one day percentage gain since September 2005 for that futures contract.
Reports of consistently dry weather in Brazil’s Minas Gerais, a key coffee-rich region of Brazil, wrongfooted analysts, who’d expected a bumper harvest this year in line with the past two years. Estimates from commodities analysts ranged as high as 60 million bags of coffee for this year’s harvest, though Brail’s government crop unit Conab forecasted a crop of 46.5 to 50.2 million bags.

Brazil is the world’s largest producer of Arabica coffee beans, accounting for about a third of global coffee production, the USDA estimates. Coffee’s other variety of bean, the Robusta, is produced heavily in Vietnam.
“There are really two things that move coffee – a drought and a freeze,” president of the commodities brokerage Infinity Trading Corp. Fain Shaffer told the Journal. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see some really wild swings.”
It was the hottest January on record for parts of southern and southeastern Brazil, according to Somar Meterologia. Rain may not fall in Minas Gerais until mid-February, after rainfall in January was 60 percent below usual levels in January.
It’s unclear how long a rally will last, however. 2014’s harvest is an ‘on-year’ for coffee harvests, which alternate between more productive and less productive ‘off years’. Even in off years, Brazil’s coffee harvest has recently hit records, thanks to dry and frosty weather in Minas Gerais.
   USDA Brazilian Coffee Crops 2007-2014, USDA Dec 2014 Coffee report  US Department of Agriculture 
There’s also an ongoing global surplus of coffee, which fueled a 23 percent drop in coffee prices in 2013. Colombia, another key coffee producer, also saw a strong start to its 2013 to 2014 harvest, according to a Societe Generale note from November.
“We maintain that [coffee supply] tightening will not be seen until at least the 2015/2016 marketing year, barring any significant drop in Central American coffee production due to leaf rust disease,” Societe Generale said in that earlier note.
Analysts have watched Brazil’s weather closely, eyeing forecasts for a hint on harvests, despite significant weather uncertainty recently. Societe Generale forecasts an average coffee price of $1.08 cents per pound in 2014, just below an average cost of production of $1.20 per pound. Stockpiles are estimated to end the harvest season at 16.3 million bags.
Production of Brazilian naturals, a form of Arabica bean, rose 19.3 percent in exporting countries from 2011 to 2012, according to the International Coffee Organization’s latest market report. Global coffee exports were worth $15.4 billion in 2010, according to the group.  
Robusta coffee traded in London also fared better, trading up to $1896 per metric ton, according to Agrimoney. Coffee has jumped 24 percent since the start of 2014, heading towards the best start of a year since 1997, reported Bloomberg.

669,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 04, 2014 09:30AM ET</span>",Limited US Oil Exports To Europe Approved ,"By Meagan Clark - The U.S. government has approved at least four licenses to export crude oil to Europe, for the first time in years, showing how companies are breaking through the limits of the export ban established in the seventies, Reuters learned from a Freedom of Information Act request.
The Department of Commerce authorized two licenses to export U.S. crude to the U.K. since last year, totaling $1.8 billion, and two more to Italy, totaling $3.12 billion, Reuters said Tuesday. One license to export to Germany, totaling $2.6 billion, was filed in January and is awaiting a decision by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), the government agency that reviews requests to export crude under the 1975 ban that prohibits most crude shipments except to Canada and re-exporting foreign oil, along with a few other exceptions.

These are the first licenses to allow crude exporting to the U.K. since at least 2000 and the first to any European country since 2008, according to the BIS, which has approved 120 licenses since January of last year. Ninety percent of those requests were sales to Canada.
The permits will likely add to a debate in Washington over whether or not to lift the ban as the rise in shale oil production inches closer to saturating domestic refineries. Allowing companies to export within the current law may set back a firm decision from the Obama administration on whether to annul the ban.
U.S. oil production has climbed to its highest in 25 years. Many oil producers have lobbied for an end to the export ban, which would open up new markets for them. U.S. refiners have opposed lifting or easing the ban, as they benefit from cheaper domestic crude. Foreign refiners may benefit from U.S. exports to Europe, since access to cheap, high-quality U.S. shale oil would improve their margins.
Licenses for exports to central America and Asia have regularly been approved over the past decade, for exports of heavy Californian crude or re-exports of foreign-produced oil. But companies have rarely applied to export to European countries or been approved. Two licenses filed in 2011 for exports to Switzerland and one for exports to the Netherlands were denied.
Applicants for export licenses must demonstrate that the trade is in the national interest, that they cannot sell the oil in the U.S. for a reasonable price and that the exports will end if U.S. supplies are in danger of drying up."

The U.S. Northeast and Midwest are key gas-consuming regions. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, U.S. supply levels also remained in focus. Total U.S. natural gas storage fell by 230 billion cubic feet last week to 2.193 trillion cubic feet, approximately 17% below the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural-gas inventories have fallen by nearly 40% since November as frigid winter temperatures in the U.S. led households to burn a higher than normal amount of the fuel in furnaces to heat their homes.
Some market analysts expect supplies at the end of the winter heating season in March to be at their lowest in six years.
Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs lowered its forecast for inventory levels at the end of March to 1.39 trillion cubic feet, driven by the recent “polar vortex.” Goldman had previously estimated U.S. gas inventories at 1.61 trillion by the end of March.
According to the bank, natural gas prices will average USD4.50 per million British thermal units, up from a previous estimate of USD4.25.

672,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 04, 2014 07:30AM ET</span>","Gold Prices Below $1,200 Could Mean Production Cutbacks","By Nat Rudarakanchana -
If gold dips below $1,200 per ounce for a “sustained” period, serious production cutbacks are likely, World Gold Council representatives warned Monday.
The average industry cost of production is $1,200 per ounce, according to the council, which cited recent Thomson Reuters data. About 30 percent of the gold mining industry becomes unprofitable if prices fall below that threshold, the council estimates.
Massive capital writedowns from 2013, from the world’s largest gold miner Barrick Gold Corp. (TSE:ABX) among others, could also “impair future production for some miners,” said the council’s 2014 outlook.
The council declined to specify exactly how long prices could stay below $1,200 per ounce before significant production cutbacks appeared. But more modest production from gold miners amid heavy expenses is not a new trend, noted council managing director William Rhind.
“This is already happening. This is not something that we’re anticipating,” he told reporters in New York on Monday. “The mining industry, as of last year, is already selling assets and writing down capital.”
The council’s remarks add to existing research highlighting $1,200 per ounce as a key price threshold. Barclays PLC (LON:BARC) said earlier that gold at that price could prompt miners to hedge on gold, locking in current prices to safeguard against future declines.

Mining capital and operating budgets soared in the past decade as gold prices sailed to a peak of $1,920 per ounce in September 2011. Since then, prices have fallen and shareholders have pushed for widely welcomed cost-cutting.
Declining scrap or recycled gold supply, which fell to a five-year low in 2013, exacerbates a tight supply picture, said council investment research director Juan Carlos Artigas. Still, there’s an underlying market surplus of the metal, according to Thomson Reuters’ GFMS. That contrasts with sustained deficits for other precious metals like platinum and palladium.
Miners unwound hedging activity in 2013, or “de-hedged,” to the tune of 49 metric tons, according to GFMS. Still, there has been fresh hedging activity worth 11 tons, an activity which recalls strategies not seen widely for years.
“To date, fresh hedging in this lower price environment has remained comparatively modest,” said the precious metals consultancy GFMS in a January 2014 report. Their data is considered an industry benchmark.
Others say apparent optimism among miners may not run too deep.
“We maintain the view that net activity is likely to return to hedging this year with $1200/oz remaining a sensitive price point,” wrote Barclays PLC analysts on Monday. Official data on hedging is maintained in a global hedge book.  
Industry giant Barrick reports full-year earnings on Feb. 14 and is likely to post a profit of $2.5 billion, though that's significantly down from its past three years, according to analysts polled by Reuters. Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM) and AngloGold Ashanti (JSE:ANG), two other top miners, will report on Feb. 20 and Feb. 19, though both lost more than $1 billion in the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2013. Global mine production is likely to hit 2,980 tons in 2013, up 4 percent from the year before.
Gold mines can take years to come online, up 20 years after deposits are first discovered, so the industry may take a long-term view on prices. The industry is also reportedly beset by a shortage of qualified mining engineers. The World Gold Council is an industry trade lobby whose members include major gold miners.
Although bullish bets on gold have risen recently, many Wall Street analysts remain downcast on the metal’s prospects in 2014. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) sees gold falling to $1,050 per ounce within the next 12 months.
Gold opened at $1,242 per ounce in New York on Monday.
“There’s a real cost of getting it out of the ground. And that cost has to be accounted for. That’s not to say that prices can’t fall below the marginal cost of production. … It’s just to say there’s a sensitivity there,” said Rhind on Monday. “You’ve got a significant sensitivity there to the price.” "

681,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 03, 2014 01:00PM ET</span>",Mexican Pension Funds Show Interest In Gold,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - Mexico’s pension funds have showed fresh interest in gold, after the lifting of years of strict investment regulations, according to the World Gold Council.
The council has talked to about half of the country’s twenty or so influential pension fund managers, who together manage $160 billion in assets, said council investment research director Juan Carlos Artigas on Monday.
Legislation from 2012 allowed Mexican pension funds to invest in gold and commodities in 2013, and invest more freely in foreign assets. Japan’s pension funds, who together hold the world’s second largest pool of retirement assets, have also gravitated towards gold.
“I spoke to many of the pension funds in Mexico last year,” Artigas told reporters in New York on Monday. “Many of them are interested…They need to get a certification for investing in commodities. But once they do, it’ll be likely that they’ll start investing.”
“Compared to the pension fund space in the U.S., it’s probably small, but it’s still $160 billion or so in assets. So it’s still substantial,” he continued. Mexican pension funds account for 22 percent of Mexican savings, ad could double in assets by 2018, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Mexico’s pension funds still face caps on how much they can invest in commodities and foreign assets, as a slice of their assets. They won’t be able to invest more than 10 percent of their assets in commodities, depending on the fund’s structure.
The world’s largest gold-backed fund, SPRD’s GLD, is cross-listed for trade in Mexico, so investments in the fund won’t count toward a foreign investment cap, said Artigas.
Pension fund interest in gold rarely impacts the yellow metal’s price, since it plays a relatively small role in a $236 billion global market. Bloomberg estimated in 2012 that only $9 billion in Mexican pension assets will be eligible for commodities investment overall. At the same time, influential U.S. hedge funds sold gold heavily in 2013, contributing to bearish sentiment.
Mexican pension fund purchases of gold may amount to dozens of metric tons at most, in a market which demands over 4000 tons annually. But there are already fifteen Japanese pension funds buying gold through exchange-traded funds, who may make a larger impact, according to William Rhind, who handles institutional investors for the council.
Gold performed better than most Mexican assets from 2003 to 2013, but underperformed Mexican equities, earlier World Gold Council research showed. Gold prices fell 28 percent in 2013, in their worst year since 1981.

Repeated blasts of arctic air that shot across the U.S. in January will give way to milder temperatures during the first two weeks of February, according to updated forecasting models.
Milder wintertime temperatures in the U.S. often prompt homes to scale back on their heating, which lowers demand for natural gas in the country's thermal power plants.
The second half of February should see a return of below-normal temperatures across parts of the eastern U.S., which cubed the commodity's losses, though cold snaps won't be as severe as those in January.

The March contract tumbled 1.36% on Friday to settle at USD4.943 per million British thermal units.

Bearish speculators are betting that the milder weather will decrease demand for the heating fuel.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
Meanwhile, U.S. supply levels also remained in focus. Total U.S. natural gas storage fell by 230 billion cubic feet last week to 2.193 trillion cubic feet, approximately 17% below the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural-gas inventories have fallen by nearly 40% since November as frigid winter temperatures in the U.S. led households to burn a higher than normal amount of the fuel in furnaces to heat their homes.
Data from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission released Friday showed that hedge funds and money managers increased their bullish bets in natural gas futures in the week ending January 28.

686,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 03, 2014 09:00AM ET</span>",Obama Won't Be Rushed Into Keystone Pipeline Decision,"By Meagan Clark - President Barack Obama will wait at least 90 days to decide whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, a Wall Street analyst says, after the State Department released a report Friday that concludes the oil transport project wouldn't significantly increase carbon pollution, one of Obama's main concerns.
Obama said last summer he would not approve the 1,700-mile pipeline if it would “significantly exacerbate” the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change.
The White House said Sunday the delay will allow the president to receive vital input from other government departments and agencies.
Some industry analysts believe the president will avoid making a decision until after the U.S. mid-term elections in November in order to avoid alienating Democratic voters.
“A final decision isn’t expected until this summer and could well occur after November’s congressional election,” Kevin Hebner of JP Morgan Chase Bank in New York said Sunday in a research note.
The TransCanada Corp. pipeline would transport 830,000 barrels a day of asphalt from Canada’s oil sands and of light oil from North Dakota to refineries near Houston on the Gulf Coast. Environmentalists have protested the project, but Western oil producers want the pipeline built so they can access new markets. The State Department’s report also suggests if the pipeline is not built, oil would continue to be extracted at the same rate from Alberta and transported to the Gulf Coast by rail instead.

Obama’s top adviser and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough said the president won’t be rushed into a decision.
“The Friday report is an important input into the process. We’ll hear from other cabinet secretaries,” McDonough told NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday.
“We have one department with a study. Now we other expert agencies,” he said. “The president wants to make his decision based on the most sound science.”
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has no deadline to make a recommendation to the president on whether or not the pipeline is in the American national interest.
Billionaire Democratic Party donor and pipeline opponent Tom Steyer wrote a letter to Kerry urging him to launch an independent investigation of the environmental impact of the pipeline. Steyer called the State Department’s report “defective” because the U.S. hired a TransCanada contractor, Environmental Resources Management, to write the report."

703,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 31, 2014 12:00PM ET</span>",Italy's Used Gold Brokerage Business - The Second-Largest In The World - Is Going Bust,"By Domenico Conti - ROME -- The placards are still there, punctuating suburban thoroughfares, proclaiming in bold black text against a bright yellow background: “We Buy Gold.” 
But the signs, like the gold they advertise to buy, are increasingly relics themselves, because the shops where Italians once traded the precious metal for cash are largely empty, and many have closed.   Heavy losses caused by a proliferation of gold brokers, continuous gold depreciation and a sharp decline in the number of Italians willing to sell off their jewels has sent almost four in 10 gold-buying firms into bankruptcy, collapsing a business that once comprised 38,000 retailers and made Italy the second-largest supplier of scrap gold in the world, after the United States. 
Surviving businesses, such as the one owned by a 23-year-old Chinese man named Zhu, who asked that his full name not be published, face a life-or-death struggle whose outcome will be dictated by the direction of gold futures.    And for every “compro oro” (literally: “buy gold”) retail brokerage that’s still in business, almost as many have gone bankrupt in the past few months. In one southern Roman suburb alone, Ostiense, two gold traders recently closed.    Zhu, who works as a salesperson in a shop he set up with his cousin in the suburb of Laurentino, started out as a brave entrepreneur who entered the market during a downturn. But now, his effort looks increasingly like an ill-advised folly. With help from his cousin and other family members, Zhu opened for business in May 2013, when gold futures were in sharp decline following an all-time high valuation of more than $1,900 (in USD) posted in September 2011. The fall continued to less than $1,200 a few weeks after Zhu finished refurbishing his bare, 40-square-meter store, with its fake marble floor and cashier’s booth behind bulletproof glass, which previously served as a real estate office.   “Today not a single client entered the shop. We bought nothing,” Zhu says in the loud voice necessitated by the thick glass sheltering his small space from customers who are allowed inside only after pressing a buzzer. His shop, with large pictures of gold bullion and gold dust in the windows, hasn't bought any scrap since last week, when Zhu purchased a nine-gram brooch valued at around 170 euros, or $230 USD.    “We made the investment because we expect the market to improve,"" Zhu says in fluent Italian. Behind him sits a desktop computer and to one side a vault, a scale and an acid-test kit. A slot in the bulletproof window enables money and jewels to pass through, and, with a little squeezing, a handshake.    The initial investment to set up such a business can be as cheap as 10,000 euros ($13,600). The shops are very small, many don't showcase any items for sale and most are located in suburban areas where the rent is cheaper.    David Campomaggiore, 31, is another Rome-based gold entrepreneur who vows to ride out the long downturn. A former employee of Alitalia who enjoyed a comfortable position with the state-backed (if ailing) airline, he left his job in 2010 after catching Italian gold fever from a friend. He says he made up his mind after spending one year studying gold brokerage, and unlike Zhu's, his timing ""was excellent,"" Campomaggiore says.    Starting with a sizable investment of 40,000 euros, Campomaggiore opened his first gold scrap shop, which he named Golden Island, in Centocelle, a popular, low-income suburb in eastern Rome. Things went so well that within a couple of years he was able to open three more outlets under the same name elsewhere on the outskirts of Rome.    At the peak of the euro zone crisis, debt-laden Italy became the epicenter of turmoil in global markets in 2011. Its government securities' yields skyrocketed to more than 7 percent as the country entered its worst-ever postwar recession. With unemployment mounting, wages cut by austerity moves and a credit crunch raging, gloom seized the minds of many Italians. While it was carnage for small and midsize firms, used gold brokers flourished.    Many people rushed to sell gold bracelets they had been given during Catholic sacraments known as eucharist or confirmation, as well as old engagement rings, little-worn necklaces or watches, even dental fillings, out of necessity. Others, less needy, saw a rewarding opportunity in getting rid of jewels they didn’t care for anyway. Gold, historically considered a safe-haven asset, was about to reach its all-time record-high valuation, a product of widespread uncertainty, fears of inflation, and the unprecedented liquidity being pumped into the markets by the Federal Reserve and central banks in Europe and Japan.    Saverio, an Italian man in his early 60s who, like Zhu, didn't want to reveal his surname, said he made 1,800 euros on golden tie clips, cuff links and other old, unused items that he sold to a Roman scrap buyer back in 2012. ""I found it useful. It was some old stuff covered with dust I could have thrown away.""   It was a blessing for those in the business. There were few scrap gold shops in Italy in the 1990s, with the exception of a few jewellers and traditional pawn shops. But when the government liberalized retail gold trading in 2000, many sniffed out the bargain that was about to present itself. Italy's tax police estimate the number of shops buying gold for cash rose fivefold in the two years following the liberalization. At the peak early last year, the number of retailers had gone from 20,000 in 2011 to 38,000, including numerous jewelers who, after opposing the newcomers, embraced the new business opportunity after being hit hard by the crisis of their core activity, jewelry sales.    The gold fever was a bonanza for many. Margins for brokers, who act as intermediaries for gold scrap between people and foundries, went above four euros per gram of gold, on a retail price that reached 44 euros per gram of pure gold early last year. Today ""many are millionaries,"" says Nunzio Ragno, an accountant who chairs Antico, Italy's scrap buyers’ lobby. Yearly turnover for a typical firm could reach as much as 400,000 to 500,000 euros in the boom years. Overall turnover peaked at an estimated 10 billion to 12 billion euros early last year.    ""Sometimes deals could reach even 60 kilograms of gold per month,"" Ragno says. On a good business day, some people would bring jewels worth as much as several thousand euros to a compro oro. The books of firms well established in the business boast single transactions worth 6,000, and 2,500-euro sales were normal on a daily basis until early 2013. Campomaggiore recalls an elderly woman entering his shop with so much wealth that he, eager to close the deal and keep the customer loyal, rushed to borrow money from relatives and friends just to buy. Many older people sold family jewels to avoid inheritance disputes among their heirs. Others, wary of burglars, wanted to empty their vaults before going on vacation.   After years of hearing that the safest investment was in gold, many entrepreneurs saw the recession as an opportunity to try their luck in an industry that seemed to know no decline. Crisis-bitten butchers and cobblers turned their stores into gold scrap shops. Laid-off employees invested their severance pay to open similar concerns. Criminal enterprises also entered the market; according to the scrap business lobby, illicit business accounted for 15 percent of the firms. Legal loopholes helped. In Italy, starting a gold scrap business requires only a police license and keeping a register of all deals, with a generic description of the items bought and the obligation to keep them in the store for at least 10 days to prevent the receipt of stolen goods. No value-added tax is charged, because Italian law considers scrap discarded waste material suitable for reprocessing. Issuing a receipt for each transaction is discretionary.    In hindsight, it couldn’t last. Hubris, excitement, greed and the crisis that pummeled traditional segments of the Italian economy quickly lead to a disorderly proliferation in this scarcely regulated market. Many would overleverage their investment, borrowing money at expensive rates to set up a business that was expected to deliver huge profits. The industry experienced such a boom that it soon became overcrowded. Competition became fierce, eating into margins. Many newcomers, lured by the prospect of easy money, rushed in with no experience of the gold business and scant understanding of market behavior. Some dealers were so inexperienced they did not regularly check gold futures and update their prices accordingly. Coupled with the outlook for the global financial markets at the time, it was the perfect recipe for trouble.   After the 2011 record high, a downward trend crept into the gold market, and by the end of last year, when the Federal Reserve signaled plans to slow bond purchases, the price fell by as much as 36 percent. Prices in the Italian retail market fell 34 percent to 29 euros per gram of pure gold, or 18 euros per gram for 18-carat metal, a blend that contains three-quarters pure gold and is the most common in Italy.    The sharp correction in gold prices in the second half of last year caught many by surprise, coming when the Italian brokerage business was still running full-steam, which resulted in steep, overnight losses. People like Campomaggiore retain a frightful memory of April 2013, when the spot price of gold plunged almost 15 percent in two days. Futures dropped by 11 percent over the mid-month weekend, posting the worst plunge since 1980. Gold brokers weren't able to resell to foundries quickly enough to avoid further losses. Some firms lost as much as 60,000 euro between the Friday closing in the New York Stock Exchange and the opening in Tokyo the following Monday.    As Zhu, relatively new to the gold business, learned at his own expense, low prices meant people's appetite for selling their jewels dried up. The market changed. In fact, recycling of gold peaked in 2010 when sales reached 1,719 tons, according to Barclays, and once the numbers are in, the expectation is that gold supply from scrap materials dropped by 25 percent last year. According to a report from the World Gold Council, a producer-funded group, gold recycling shrank on a year-to-year basis for the sixth consecutive quarter in the third quarter last year, with the contribution from industrialized markets falling almost 13 percent. ""Supplies of old gold became increasingly scarce, and lower average prices failed to attract sellers,"" the organization says.   Until 2012, when the boom began moving toward a bust, relatively wealthy Italians accounted for a large percentage of the transactions in terms of volume. Today, prices are a deterrent to selling even jewelry that one isn’t fond of. As a result, most of today's customers are people in urgent need of cash. According to Eurispes, an Italian think tank, nearly one in three Italians are unable to make ends meet and stretch their salary until the end of the month.   Single transactions are often worth as little as a few dozen euros, with some peole entering the shop with only a small pendant to sell. ""Some need money to help pay the house rent or the mortgage,"" Ragno says. But, he adds, others have more futile motives: ""It is common to see youngsters who need cash to repay the loan they got to buy an iPhone, or ladies who want a trendy, designer purse."" Even more extreme are those who need to finance compulsive gambling on poker machines.   Turnover for a typical firm has been cut in half, Ragno says. Italy's overall gold brokerage business is now worth 7 to 8 billion euros -- a third less than a year ago. Margins retained by the typical gold scrap firm have been cut fourfold to one euro per gram of gold, which has put many out of business. With a monthly fixed expenditure of no less than 3,500 euros to cover shop rental and personnel, a small firm needs to sell at least 3.5 kilograms per month to break even -- a target many can't reach.   Of the gold buyers who remain in business, many are looking for new ways of gaining market share. One option is merging with one of the chain stores now operating throughout Europe. Orocash, Italy's biggest buyer of used gold jewelry, has more than 400 shops in Italy alone, plus about 200 more in Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Austria. Some scrap buyers pitch other forms of financial intermediation, such as offering to release collateral people pawned at banks as a guarantee for loans, brokering the pawn valuation and becoming de facto creditors.    Marketing is also becoming more aggressive. The streets in Rome's periphery are still swarming with scrap buyers' flashy ads. Zhu added a large blue flag outside his shop that screams ""We pay cash."" Others are getting more sophisticated. Campomaggiore's promos display fashion jewelry and watches offered for sale at a 50 percent discount, trying to harness people's appetite for cheap, second-hand jewels. He promotes his businesses on the Internet, and offered hot-air balloon trips to lure customers and gain visibility. His Golden Island small chain store also throws in a free lottery ticket for every 20  grams of gold sold.     ""Nobody is selling us gold -- it's survival of the fittest,"" Campomaggiore says. He's confident the market will recover, although with lower margins and in a more challenging environment. ""People still possess gold; they aren't selling just now because the price dropped. You need to be good at the business,"" he says. After all, gold demand is expected to increase as the world's two most populous nations, China and India, get wealthier. Albert Cheng, Far East managing director at the World Gold Council, says demand for gold in China may rise by at least the pace of economic growth. Still, many people are bearish. BNP Paribas lowered its 2014 average gold-price forecast to $1,095 an ounce, a further reduction from its June estimate.   While Campomaggiore says the good old times gave him a better lifestyle, he reinvested part of his profits in two other industries: a tire shop and an automated sex shop where people can buy items in total discretion. ""I needed to diversify, and the sex shop looked like a good bet,"" he says.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at USD4.652 per million British thermal units, Monday's low, and resistance at USD5.198, Monday's high.
Recent blasts of cold air sweeping across the U.S. have prompted businesses and homes to crank up their heating to the point that the country's thermal power plants have burned more natural gas to meet the demand, Thursday's supply data should reveal.
Early withdrawal estimates for Thursday’s storage data range from 170 billion cubic feet to 239 billion cubic feet, compared to a drop of 191 billion cubic feet during the same week a year earlier.The five-year average change for the week is a decline of 162 billion cubic feet.Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.423 trillion cubic feet as of last week, approximately 13% below the five-year average for this time of year.Natural-gas inventories have fallen by 1.411 trillion cubic feet since November 8 as frigid winter temperatures in the U.S. led households to burn a higher than normal amount of the fuel in furnaces to heat their homes.Some expect supplies at the end of the winter heating season in March to be at their lowest in six years.
Meanwhile, chilly forecasts pressured prices up as well.
Below-normal temperatures should hover over much of the country through early February.

723,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 29, 2014 01:00PM ET</span>",Commodity Sector Outlook Got You Down? Consider This Metal,"By Mike Obel - Commodities have started to seriously bore Wall Street. That's because commodity prices are expected to hold steady -- at best -- this year and many are expected to fall. Production is generally seen as keeping pace with or exceeding demand and inventories of a number of commodities are not low enough to bolster prices.
Barclays PLC put it succinctly recently in noting that commodity returns will remain “sluggish for some time to come.”   Consider oil, the most heavily traded commodity. The U.S. shale revolution is pushing the nation closer and closer to being able to export rather than import crude oil. Tensions between Iran and the West appear to be easing, and there are tentative signs of improving crude oil production from western Libya, particularly its massive El Sharara field, which has a production capacity of some 350,000 barrels per day. Oil prices are widely believed to have nowhere to go but down.   Even the risk of supply disruptions from South Sudan or continued output problems in eastern Libya are not expected to boost global oil prices, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Jeffrey Currie, writing in a note that “oil price risks are substantially skewed to the downside in 2014.”   Other commodity prices appear headed south. Ethanol prices are already trending lower in response to the U.S. government’s decision to not increase the amount of the commodity that gasoline refiners must blend. And since fuel production monopolizes as much as 40 percent of the U.S. corn crop, that is weighing on the corn prices.   Capital Economics commodities economist Tom Pugh wrote recently that he forecasts corn to fall to $3.50 per bushel this year from $4.20 per bushel in December.   “We expect demand for grains, especially corn, to be subdued over the next year,” he wrote in a note.   Strong supply will weigh on other commodity prices. This season’s wheat harvest is projected to climb to a record, according to the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization. Barley prices are expected to be capped by high stockpiles and competition with other grains and oilseeds. International soy bean prices have fallen from the peaks of the drought-reduced output in the 2011-12 season, IGC said. The global cotton market, meanwhile, is bracing for a massive influx of supply from China’s huge stockpile, which it now no longer wants to maintain. The upshot of all these forecasts is a broad-based pessimism among Wall Street investors about what comes out of the ground.   But amid all this gloom, one commodity could begin to sparkle: copper. Over the last 12 months the price of the red metal has fallen more than 12 percent, from $3.72 per pound to $3.26 per pound.     Copper prices during 2013  Thomson Reuters Eikon, COMEX copper futures     But there are fundamental changes afoot that should raise it out of its doldrums. In fact those changes have already begun emerging: from Dec. 11, 2013, to Jan. 8, 2014, copper’s price edged up 1.7 percent.    It's hard to overstate the importance of copper prices, both to numerous industries as well as the global economy. In the U.S., demand for products made of copper, 60 percent of which is used to make wire, comes primarily from four sectors. One is construction. That includes home builders like Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (NYSE:HOVU), D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) and Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN), which buy wiring, plumbing and appliances that contain the metal. The construction sector also includes industrial builders like closely-held Bechtel Group, Inc., KBR, Inc. (NYSE:KBR) and Fluor Corporation (NYSE:FLR) that assemble power plants, drilling platforms and factories. A second source of copper demand comes from utilities and companies that own and operate the vast transcontinental high-power lines that crisscross the nation and constitute the bulk power grid. Both builders and utilities buy their products from companies like Germany's ThyssenKrupp AG, which turns copper into wire, tubes, sheaths, plates and coils. A third source of copper demand is manufacturers of electronic products like smart phones such as Apple Inc. (Nasdaq:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. A fourth industry that buys large amounts of copper products is the car and truck industry. The average automobile, for example, contains nearly one mile of copper wiring, while the total weight of copper in cars ranges from 50 pounds for compacts to as much as 100 pounds for luxury and hybrid cars.   There are three reasons that copper prices may rise this year.  Chinese demand   The State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), which provides power to 80 percent of the world’s second-largest economy aims to boost by 13 percent its annual investment to more than $60 billion, according to research by Barclays PLC.   Given that Chinese utilities account for more than 40 percent of Chinese copper demand, that sort of big jump in capital investment should firm up prices.   “We had forecasted a gradual normalization of spending throughout 2013, as the year started with investment up 44 percent, year-over-year,” Barclays analyst Sijin Cheng wrote in a note. “Grid investment growth softened as expected (last year). However, the new (SGCC) target exceeds our expectations and suggests that copper demand from the power sector could stay as strong, if not stronger, in 2014.”   Prospects of significantly stronger Chinese copper demand this year contributed to Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) raising its stance on the mining sector, including copper mining, to Bullish from Neutral. “While we remain concerned about the potential long-term structural demand story for commodities in China, and we are cognizant of a potential seasonal slowdown in the first quarter of this year, our move to bullish reflects better bottom-up fundamentals, particularly from the major miners. We would rather be too early than too late in making this call.”   China is not the only source of expected rising copper demand.   In its “Global Outlook,” Barclays said worldwide demand for the red metal rose throughout 2013. By yearend the investment bank said its estimate of “2013 global copper demand is almost 50 percent higher than the low point for our forecasts reached in Q2 and is almost three times the average growth rate of the 2000s.   “For 2014 we forecast demand growth to be a little slower, but if our forecast of around 800,000 tons is achieved, then demand growth in 2013-14 will be the third strongest two-year demand growth expansion in the copper market for more than 20 years.”   If European economic growth continues advancing this year, the continent will also account for increased copper demand.  Supply growth   Strikes, storms and scheduled maintenance of major copper processing facilities are flattening the growth in copper production. Barclays said in a Jan. 13 note that the rate at which global copper supplies are growing will peak this year and then begin to slow next year.   Chile -- Output at Codelco’s 300,000 ton per year Chuquicamata smelter was halted for most of December due to a strike.   Philippines -- Glencore’s Pasar smelter in the Philippines remains closed since Typhoon Haiyan slammed into the country on Nov. 7, 2013.   Australia -- BHP Billiton plans a maintenance outage at its Olympic Dam smelter in March.   Indonesia -- Freeport-McMoRan has suspended copper concentrate exports from its huge Grasberg mine in Papua as it fights a sudden 25 percent export duty that will grow to 60 percent by 2016 on copper concentrate exports. That led Deutsche Bank to cut its 2014 copper sales estimates by 120 million pounds, assuming a full first-quarter of export disruptions.   China -- Barclays said Jan. 24 that its final estimate of the nation’s refined copper production of 6.5 million tons was lower than the reported total of 6.9 million tons.  Global inventory   In addition to higher demand and production constraints, the global stocks of already-mined copper are tightening. A year ago, according to Barclays, copper stocks were about 1.46 million tons. That rose to 1.81 million tons in April of last year and has been falling ever since. On Dec. 13 global copper stocks had declined to an estimated 1.27 million tons. Further, the metal’s on-warrant inventory has shrunk to its lowest level since 2008.     Global copper inventories are only slightly in surplus.  Barclays Research, ICSG, Wood Mackenzie     UBS AG raised its near-term copper price forecast on China’s “robust commodity trade and due to Brazil’s weak supply growth.” Specifically, UBS increased by 6 percent an earlier 2014 copper price forecast of $2.95 per pound, although the investment bank still sees copper prices this year lower than last year. UBS also raised its copper price forecasts for 2015 slightly to $2.90 from $2.85.        "

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery traded at USD1,262.60 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, up 0.97%, up from a session low of USD1,248.90 and off a high of 1,268.90.
The April contract settled down 1.03% at USD1,250.50 on Tuesday.
Futures were likely to find support at USD1,231.30 a troy ounce, the low from Jan. 23, and resistance at USD1,279.20, the high from Jan. 26.
Turkey and South Africa hiked interest rates earlier to support their currencies, which rekindled fears that an end to ultra-loose monetary policies in the U.S. and elsewhere will makes assets in emerging markets less attractive, which sent stocks falling.
Gold often serves as a hedge amid global stock-market selloffs.
Gains were somewhat muted on U.S. monetary policy uncertainty.
The Federal Reserve will release its statement on monetary policy and interest rates later, and markets were betting that months of broad improvements to U.S. economic indicators will prompt monetary authorities to trim USD10 billion from its USD75 billion bond-buying program.
The program, launched in September of 2012, originally started out at USD85 billion in monthly purchases of Treasury holdings and mortgage debt a month.
Fed asset purchases seek to spur recovery by holding down long-term interest rates, which weakens the dollar as a side effect and makes gold an attractive hedge, though talk of their dismantling can have the opposite effect.

727,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 29, 2014 10:30AM ET</span>","Natural Gas Prices In January Are Remarkable, Notes S&P","By Nat Rudarakanchana - U.S. natural gas prices have posted their biggest monthly gain since September 2009 thanks to the frigid weather in January, according to Standard & Poor’s.
January 2014 has been a remarkable month for commodities overall and for natural gas specifically, as record cold temperatures disrupted the movement of goods and drove up home heating demand.
S&P’s GCSI natural gas index had gained 19.3 percent earlier this week, since its sluggish start in the new year. That’s the largest monthly gain since September 2009, wrote S&P commodities vice president Jodie Gunzberg in a blog post.

“Only 17 months of the 240 in the history of the index have seen bigger gains than 19.3%,” wrote Gunzberg. The index has existed in this form since January 1994. 
U.S. natural gas prices have been driven up by a tight supply and demand balance in recent weeks,  Citigroup analysts said in a recent note. Rising U.S. production amid a broad North American energy boom may not meet demand in the short-term. Natural gas prices rose 32 percent in 2013.  
Now the question is whether natural gas will end January and earn the month a “bull market” title, defined as a rise of 20 percent or more in value. There hasn’t been a bull market month for natural gas since 2009, on the index model.
On Wednesday, the index gained 17.9 percent for the month of January, falling shy of the 20 percent threshold. The benchmark spiked up 9.2 percent on Jan. 24, and on Monday was up 44 percent relative to its recent low on Nov. 4, 2013.

“For the first time in a long time, natural gas is in backwardation, which is relatively rare. We almost never see backwardation, which means there’s a shortage in natural gas,” Gunzberg told IBTimes in a phone interview. Natural gas has only been in backwardation about 7.6 percent of the time in the history of the index.
“Any traders in the front month have a chance to profit,” she added. “It’s difficult to replenish commodities, and this [trend] has been pretty persistent,” for January, though the fundamentals were in place at the end of December, she said.
Natural gas on New York’s mercantile exchange (NYMEX) for February delivery rose above $5 per million British thermal units in Wednesday’s trading, beating a key price threshold. Citi called that $5 threshold “unthinkable”.
About half of U.S. households use natural gas to heat their homes. U.S. natural gas demand hit its second highest on record on Tuesday, at 133 billion cubic feet per day, according to the Wall Street Journal. "

A recent blast of cold air that gripped the eastern U.S. will see reinforcements through the end of January, though normal to above-normal temperatures could reach the heavily populated eastern U.S. in the first half of February, which sparked a round of profit taking.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.423 trillion cubic feet as of last week, approximately 13% below the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural-gas inventories have fallen by 1.411 trillion cubic feet since Nov. 8 as frigid winter temperatures in the U.S. led households to burn more fuel in furnaces to heat their homes.
Some expect supplies at the end of the winter heating season in March to be at their lowest in six years.
Early withdrawal estimates for this week’s storage data range from 170 billion cubic feet to 239 billion cubic feet, compared to a drop of 191 billion cubic feet during the same week a year earlier.
The five-year average change for the week is a decline of 162 billion cubic feet.

753,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 27, 2014 09:30AM ET</span>","US Steel Imports Surge, Driven By Price Differentials","By Nat Rudarakanchana - Cheap foreign steel, especially from China, has pushed U.S. steel imports up for a recent brief surge and dented confidence among domestic steel producers, reports the Wall Street Journal.
Steel imports are expected to hit 3.2 million tons in January, up 23 percent from a year ago, as price differences between U.S. and Chinese steel rose to $159 per ton. At this time last year, U.S. steel cost $19 less than Chinese steel, according to market analysis firm CRU Group.
“It’s the largest first-quarter import order I’ve seen in the last five years,” one unnamed steel trader told the Wall Street Journal. That trader brokers steel purchases between U.S. buyers and foreign sellers.
The surge in imports could impact confidence in major U.S. steel producers like United States Steel Corp. (NYSE:X), AK Steel Holding Corp. (NYSE:AKS) and ArcelorMittal USA Inc., which all report earnings within the next two weeks.

Price-wise, the average U.S. price for a benchmark hot-rolled coil is $676, up 10 percent from a year ago. That compares with the Chinese benchmark price of $540 a ton. Even with shipping costs factored in, foreign steel can end up being 10 percent cheaper, according to Midland Steel Warehouse Corp.’s Howard Allen.
Steel producer CEOs have long complained that foreign countries dump steel at artificially low prices into U.S. markets. They have requested trade tariffs. South Korea, China and Japan are major exporters of steel to the U.S.
U.S. steel shipments have dipped slightly from 2012 levels, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. U.S. steel imports, for all steel products, were worth $26.6 billion from January 2013 to November 2013, according to U.S. Census Bureau statistics.
China has a healthy steel surplus, which it ships off to countries including South Korea and Southeast Asian countries, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Chinese steel exports rose to 54.9 million tons from January to November 2013, up from 48.7 million tons a year before. In contrast, the U.S. has a steel trade deficit of about 1.5 million metric tons, meaning it imports more than it exports.

   Chinese Steel Exports, Jan - Nov 2013, US Commerce Dept Report  US Commerce Dept  
Steel is used in cars, industrial machinery, the energy sector, and construction, among other applications. China has steadily imported more iron ore, steel’s key raw material input, and has exported more steel, in the past three years.

Many analysts expect global and U.S. steel prices to fall this year, driven by global oversupply. Overall U.S. imports for January to November 2013, the latest covered by official data, fell 4.4 percent from 2012, and averaged 2.4 million tons per month in 2013. "

The trip is part of the latest edition of the decade-long International Ocean Discovery Program that will run from 2013 to 2023. The IODP was launched by the U.S. in the 1960s and its latest effort will include 31 scientists from 10 countries drilling at three different sites for two months.
""Oil and gas fields lie close to the coast, but the key is to open the treasure box buried beneath the basin,"" Wang Pinxian, a marine geologist and member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told the Post Monday.

The IODP invited proposals from 26 member nations and, while a proposal to drill in the controversial South China Sea -- first proposed by China in 2008 -- was not the most popular one, it was reportedly mainly chosen because the Chinese government agreed to pick up 70 percent, or $6 million, of the mission’s tab. The NSF, which used to contribute 70 per cent of the Joides Resolution's expenses, cut its annual ocean drilling budget to $50 million last year, David Divins, director of the IODP’s ocean drilling program.
The expedition will sail aboard the American scientific drill ship, Joides Resolution, operated by the National Science Foundation, or NSF, the Post reported, adding that the voyage will take the team to waters claimed variously by China, the Philippines and Vietnam.
So far, the ship has received permission from the Philippines and Beijing but is waiting for a response from the Vietnamese government to drill at a site in the southwest part of the South China Sea, the Post reported, citing Divins, adding that the expedition may have to opt for an alternative site.
Tensions stemming from China's energy interests are a constant undercurrent to the region's geopolitics. For instance, in May 2012, China began drilling to new depths in the South China Sea, 200 miles southeast of Hong Kong, with the launch of its first deep-water oil drilling rig, triggering tensions between Manila and Beijing. In December 2012, China had asked Vietnam to stop exploring for oil in disputed areas of the South China Sea and demanded that the latter not harass Chinese fishing boats.
However, findings of the IODP expedition, which includes 13 scientists from mainland China, nine from the U.S. and one from Taiwan, will reportedly be shared around the world, including with countries that are not part of the program.

772,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 23, 2014 08:00PM ET</span>","Precious Metals Q&A: Central Banks, Interest Rates And The US Economy","By Nat Rudarakanchana - Chris Gaffney, a senior market strategist for Florida’s EverBank Financial Corp. (NYSE:EVER), discussed precious metals with IBTimes in a phone interview on Thursday. EverBank holds $17 billion in assets and $13 billion in deposits. Here are edited excerpts.
Q: U.S. economic data has arguably been the strongest driver of global gold prices in the past year. What’s your take on this relationship? 
A: It has been dependent on U.S. economic data, but mainly because the ETF [exchange-traded] fund paper market has really dominated gold in price movements. Investors were moving into gold as that safe haven trade -- so as we saw more indications that the U.S. economy and the global economy in general was improving, we saw investors abandoning those safe haven trades, especially by selling the ETFs. They [ETFs] are obviously the easiest way for individual investors and funds to participate in the precious metals market.
Q: U.S. economic, housing and jobless claims data came out Thursday morning. How is gold likely to react to that data? 
Today, I think prices are less dependent on the data. Jobless [unemployment benefit] claims came in just as expected. What I thought was interesting: The continued claims number stayed above 3 million. That’s in spite of the fact that a large number of people were taken off jobless claims at the end of the year, when the claims expired [due to Congressional failure to extend emergency unemployment benefits]. That is a worrying number for the labor market – that the continuing claims number is so high. That has maybe contributed to some of the price appreciation we’ve seen in gold this morning.    
Q: Platinum miners in South Africa started strikes on Thursday. Gold miners could hold smaller strikes in early February. How will labor unrest impact markets? 
A: The key there is violence. If you see any type of violence in these strikes then you see a much more dramatic surge in prices…The strikes do impact the supply side of the equation, but they’ve had intermittent strikes before and the companies have known that these were coming. It isn’t a surprise to the companies. So there probably was an opportunity to stockpile some supply leading up to the strikes.
Length is ultimately the important factor…Otherwise, we’ve only seen a little blip up here on prices. A month of strikes is not going to have a dramatic impact. If it drags on for perhaps three months, then you start seeing it really impact the supply…You could see a shortage develop on the platinum side.
As for gold, Russia’s recent statement that they’d lower gold production will have more impact on gold prices than these small South African strikes. We’re seeing miners start reducing production because of the low prices we’re seeing – Russia now is stating that they will reduce production. Obviously Russia is one of the larger producers.
Q: What are central banks likely to do with gold? 
All of the quantitative easing we’ve seen, by the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee, as well as the cost of bailing out the peripheral European countries -- that’s created some demands on these central banks. One thing they can do to meet some obligations is to sell some of their assets, like gold, and central banks could move to sell even more assets as they try to deal with the debt they racked up during quantitative easing.
China is an exception to that. China is certainly adding to their gold holdings, and we’ll probably get that number sometime soon. It’s not very much of a secret that they could jump to the third largest gold holdings behind Germany and the U.S. eventually.
(Note: Central banks have been net buyers of gold for the past few years, though many European banks haven’t bought or sold sizeable amounts of gold.)
Most central banks bought their holdings at much cheaper levels than we are right now. So even with [steeply lower] gold prices, I don’t think there’s a bunch of worry about all the losses that these banks will sustain if they go and sell their holdings. (Switzerland’s central bank recently lost $16.5 billion in gold write-downs thanks to 2013’s price plunge.)
Q: How has gold been trading in relation to platinum and silver? Do you see platinum and palladium decoupling from gold, breaking free from its influence, as other analysts have predicted? 
We own silver and platinum in our managed accounts through our wealth management arm. So we’ve put our money where our mouth is. We feel that those two are going to have a better appreciation in the coming year.
They are decoupling from gold. It goes back to the physical demand for platinum manufacturing and the automobile industry in particular…Silver also has more industrial uses than gold. Selling from ETFs has been dominated by gold, so I do think you’re going to see continued decoupling from gold.
Q: One influential forecaster has said gold could fall to $800 per ounce if bond yields rise to 4 percent, up from 2.8 percent now. What’s your take on bond yields and gold?   
A: I really respect Erb [the forecaster]. However, I think his gold interest rate model is too myopic…Inflation will have a bigger influence on the future movement of gold’s price than interest rates…While the model did an excellent job of predicting the price of gold last year, if you take the same model over 2004 to 2007, I believe you will see the results are not as encouraging.
   Gold vs 10-yr Treasury Yields 2004-2007, Bloomberg data. Yields are in gold color and measured by left axis. Gold prices are in white on right axis.  Bloomberg, via Chris Gaffney at EverBank 
Yields on the 10 year Treasury bond marched steadily higher during this time and the price of gold also moved higher. This is in direct contradiction to Erb’s model.
I still believe gold will face too many headwinds in order to see any large price appreciation in 2014 – so I wouldn’t classify myself as a current gold bull.  
(Note: Others have questioned the strength of the correlation between U.S. interest rates and gold prices. But it’s still common industry wisdom that interest rates are one of the strongest factors correlating with gold prices, if not the strongest, based on ample historical data.) 
Q; Any last thoughts? 
I think gold prices are going have a tough time seeing any kind of real rally in 2014.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in March traded at USD97.34 a barrel during Asian trading, down 0.05%. 
On Thursday, New York-traded oil futures hit a session low of USD97.30 a barrel and a high of USD97.43 a barrel. The March contract settled at USD97.38 a barrel.
Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at USD93.66 a barrel, Monday's low, and resistance at USD98.96 a barrel, the high from Jan. 2.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that U.S. crude oil inventories rose by 990,000 barrels in the week ended Jan. 17, outpacing expectations for an increase of 588,000 barrels. 
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 351.2 million barrels as of last week.
The report also showed that total motor gasoline inventories increased by 2.1 million barrels, broadly in line with market expectations.
Meanwhile inventories of distillates, which include diesel fuel and heating oil, fell by 3.2 million barrels compared to market calls for a loss of 851,000, which supported crude prices.

In the U.S. earlier, the Labor Department reported that weekly initial jobless claims rose in line with expectations last week, but the number of continuing jobless claims remained above the 3 million mark for a second successive week.
The number of individuals filing for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week rose to 326,000, up from the previous week’s revised total of 325,000 and in line with analysts' forecasts.
The number of people filing continuing unemployment claims rose to 3.056 million up from 3.022 million in the week to Jan. 11.
Analysts had expected continuing claims to fall to 2.930 million, and the numbers reminded investors that the Federal Reserve will take its time dismantling its USD75 billion bond-buying program and keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels even as the unemployment rate falls.
Fed bond purchases tend to soften the dollar as long as they remain in effect by suppressing long-term interest rates to spur recovery, sending investors to asset classes like stocks and gold in the process.
Elsewhere, U.K.-based Markit Economics reported that U.S. factory output fell to a three-month low in January, mainly due to the impacts that wintry weather had on commerce.

780,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 23, 2014 10:30AM ET</span>",Rail Companies Could Use Cheap Natural Gas To Power Trains,"By David Kashi - Rail companies are hoping to cash in on the U.S. natural gas boom by replacing diesel-burning locomotives with natural gas-burning ones, which could cut fuel costs by 50 percent while reducing pollution.
“[Natural gas] may revolutionize the industry much like the transition from steam to diesel,"" Jessica Taylor, a spokeswoman for General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) told the Associated Press Thursday.
General Electric and Caterpillar Inc.(NYSE:CAT), two major locomotive manufactures, have developed a prototype engine that could burn both diesel and liquefied natural gas. The redesigned engine will be tested by Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX), Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (NYSE:BNI) and Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) beginning this year.

Thanks to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and the ability to drill horizontally, U.S natural gas production has rocketed. Fracking is a drilling technique that blasts millions of gallons of water and chemicals to fracture rock formations deep beneath the surface and release petroleum.
The abundance of natural gas on the market has caused prices to drop making the energy resource a cheaper and cleaner alternative to diesel-burning trains.
One downside to using natural gas-powered locomotives is that prices could surge if gas exports increase and if industries switch to natural gas, Logan Purk, an Edward Jones analyst told AP.
Rail companies have not set a price to retrofit kits, but experts expect the price to be less than purchasing a new locomotive that costs approximately $2 million.
""It's so early in this that we're still working to understand the potential savings,"" Louis Renjel, vice president of strategic infrastructure at CSX railroad, said.

783,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 23, 2014 09:30AM ET</span>",Platinum Strikes: Price And Production Impacts Worsened By Uncertainty ,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - South African platinum miners for the world’s top three platinum producers started an indefinite strike on Thursday, threatening production at companies that mine half of the world’s platinum. 
South African mining companies Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) (SJ:AMS), Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (Implats) (SJ:IMP) and Lonmin PLC (LON:LMI) face a strike by the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU), who are demanding an entry-level monthly wage of 12,500 rand ($1,140).
The AMCU represents about 70 percent of the workforce at these three companies, having displaced the formerly dominant union the National Union of Mineworkers. The companies have said they cannot afford the AMCU’s wage demands.
Here are key points to remember as the strike proceeds.

Price Impact May Be Minimal 
A strike, which represents a disruption to supply, typically boosts prices for the metal, if demand stays similar.
But this time, much of the danger surrounding strikes may already be priced-in by markets, according to a Wednesday note from UBS AG (VTX:UBSN) analyst Joni Teves.
The metal has already gained $100 per ounce from a recent low in December, incorporating the potential for strikes, and is the top precious metals performer for the year to date, gaining 5 percent.
“Any further upside from here will depend on whether or not production disruptions due to the strikes are protracted. This is currently not our base case,” she wrote on Wednesday. “We think that much of the SA risks appear priced-in by now.”
The platinum sector may already hold enough existing inventory to satisfy global demand for about six weeks, more than the typical four weeks inventory, according to Teves.
“Operations would likely need to be offline for several weeks before deliveries start to get affected and the impact is felt on the global supply/demand balance,” she said.
Gold, which influences platinum prices, fell in trading earlier this week and dragged platinum prices lower, too, wrote HSBC Holdings pc (LON:HSBA) analyst James Steel.
“Muted reaction more recently to the announcement for a possible strike may be due to investor awareness of producer stockpiling,” wrote Steel in a Tuesday note.
Robust continued demand for platinum globally is also reflected in Chinese imports of the metal, which hit a near four year high in December 2013. Stronger automobile sales have also boosted platinum, which is used in catalytic converters.
Production Impact May Be Modest 
Immediate impacts to global platinum supply may be modest, to judge by historical examples.
An 11-day strike at Amplats in the fall of 2013 cost them 44,000 ounces in platinum output, relative to the company’s 2012 production of 2.2 million ounces. That’s also relative to a global platinum supply of 5.64 million ounces, according to industry tracker Johnson Matthey (LON:JMAT).
Implats, the world’s second largest platinum producer, told IBTimes that it lost 120,000 ounces in a bloody 2012 strike, and a further 30,000 ounces as it restarted operations post-strike.  
How long the strike and wage negotiations stretch for will be the key point to watch. AMCU treasurer Jimmy Gama told IBTimes it’s unclear how long the strikes will last for.
“It will depend on how quick the negotiations on the wage process take place,” Gama said. “If agreement is reached very late, it might be much longer.”
Both platinum and its sister metal palladium are likely to see supply deficits this year, however, so any cutbacks in production could exacerbate that. Still, industry analysts have known about these supply deficits for a while.
Not The First Labor Unrest, Not The Last: Little May Change 
Mining strikes are nothing new for South African industry executives, especially in the gold and platinum sectors. Aside from the Amplats’ strike in September 2013, widely followed strikes in the summer of 2012 were prompted by lethal shootings at Lonmin’s Marikana platinum mine. Labor unrest over six weeks left 45 people dead in that episode.
This strike is unlikely to be the last in either the gold or platinum sectors in South Africa, which has also witnessed a rivalry between the formerly dominant NUM and the more active and reportedly militant AMCU. Separate planned strikes by the AMCU gold miners, who are only 19 percent of unionized gold miners, could start by early February, according to Bloomberg.
At stake is a struggle for better wages, which mining companies bat back by citing depressed platinum prices and soaring production costs. Mining companies have offered 7.5 to 8.5 percent annual wage increases over the next two to three years, along with better benefits, and say that compares favorably to both other industries and South Africa’s current inflation of 5.3 percent.
Implats told IBTimes that their current wage bill is “in the region” of 7 billion rand for the year. They added that basic wages are 4937 rand ($449) for surface workers and 5500 rand ($500) for underground workers, though many employees receive perks like housing allowances.  
Implats made profits of 5 billion rand in 2013, according to its latest annual report, on revenues of 30 billion rand. It employed 57,000 people in 2013.   
“Demand for our metals has declined in recent years on the back of depressed global markets and declining vehicle demand,” Implats spokeswoman Alice Lourens told IBTimes in an email. “Consequently prices have declined and together with escalating costs have put pressure on the profitability of the platinum industry.”
Costs at Implats per tonne milled have almost doubled from 2009 to 2013, according to company data. Like gold producers, platinum companies have faced profit margin pressure as platinum prices fell 19 percent over the past three years, though production expenses have escalated.  
Nonetheless, many analysts have been bullish on platinum and palladium for 2014 and beyond, expecting them to fare better than gold. That’s because stronger automobile markets in China and the U.S., alongside a recovering market in Europe, lift demand, just as supply remains in a deficit.
“The strikes are going well. The strikes are peaceful, with no incidents of intimidation, and nothing violent is taking place,” Gama told IBTimes on Thursday. Analysts and mining companies were wary of violence from tensions between the AMCU and NUM beforehand, and called for a peaceful strike.

811,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 21, 2014 11:00AM ET</span>","Amid US Oil Production Boom, Group Wants Public Policy Change","By Meagan Clark - U.S. demand for crude oil grew faster than China’s last year for the first time since 1999, but surging American oil production could slow if the U.S. doesn’t lift its ban on crude oil exports, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
A boom in shale oil production pumped up U.S. oil demand to 390,000 barrels a day in 2013, a 2 percent growth rate and three-year high, reversing years of steady decreases. Production rose 15 percent, the fastest absolute annual growth in any country for 20 years.
In contrast, China’s demand grew by 295,000 barrels a day last year, the weakest growth in at least six years.
Oil demand can reflect a country’s economic growth, since use of fuels indicates the strength of industrial and consumer activity. China’s economy has strengthened over the past decade as its oil demand grew, while U.S. consumption has been dropping steadily since 2005.

Now U.S. consumption of oil fuels is rising again as new drilling techniques are opening up new opportunities for American shale oil and gas reserves. But the U.S. limits the market for its oil supply with heavy regulations on exports.
“The growing volumes of light tight oil that cannot leave North America are increasingly posing a challenge to industry, putting the spotlight on the U.S. crude oil export ban,” the IEA said in its monthly oil market report.
Exports to Canada have increased to 155,000 barrels a day, and refinery, pipeline and crude rail capacity in the U.S. has expanded to carry the growing supply, according to IEA. Production is expected to grow by 780,000 barrels a day this year.
""Although there appears to be room in the market to accommodate further supply expansion in 2014 without any immediate change in export regulations, how long this can continue is open to debate,"" the IEA said in its report.
The laws restricting oil exports date back to the 1973 oil embargo, when world oil prices spiked and Congress wanted to limit U.S. reliance on oil imports. The 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act banned crude oil exports (not oil that has been refined into gasoline or diesel fuel) except in select circumstances. Among the exceptions granted by the Commerce Department have been oil that’s shipped to Canada, oil that goes through the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline, heavy oil from certain fields in California and certain types of oil exported with a license given by the Commerce Department.
European oil demand is also growing for the first time since the financial crisis, and the IEA expects oil demand to rise this year in developed economies overall for the first time since 2010. "

823,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 20, 2014 11:00AM ET</span>",Gold Sentiment Sees Modest Positive Signals,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - Sentiment towards gold has picked up modestly in January, as the precious yellow metal closed just above $1,250 per ounce on Friday, a psychologically key threshold, amid other encouraging signals.
“A modest build in speculative positioning, an increase in ETP holdings, and a strong start to coin sales implies investor appetite may be less of a drag on prices and in turn is a key area to watch,” wrote Barclays PLC (LON:BARC) analysts in a note on Monday.
Most notably:
- Those betting on gold on New York’s Comex exchange rose to their highest since early November, as net longs rose for the fourth straight week, on the latest data running to Jan. 14. “This was the largest weekly build in fresh longs since mid-October, supported by the weaker-than-expected non-farm payrolls data,” wrote Barclays analysts. That’s as measured by U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
- In the first half of January, gold coin sales reached 11 percent of all coins sold in 2013, at 123 kilo ounces. “In absolute terms, if sales remain at this pace, January 2014 will prove to be the strongest January since 1999,” according to Barclays. Coin sales in the new year have remained robust, especially in Australia and Canada.
January is traditionally a strong month for coin sales, however, as collectors hoard new coin designs.
- Gold exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw their first net inflows in almost a month, and the largest daily intake since Jan. 31, 2013. These investment products allow investors easy exposure to gold prices without the need to buy physical bullion. Gold tonnage pouring into these stock-like products is often a proxy for investor sentiment.
In 2013, such outflows were the worst on record for about a decade, led by outflows from the world’s largest gold ETF, SPDR GLD. Collectively such funds lost over 870 metric tons of gold in 2013, an overwhelming amount relative to Friday’s intake of 7.4 tons.
“However, flows for the month to date are still negative at 16 tonnes (metric tons), but signs of stabilization will be key in allowing gold prices to find better support,” said Barclays.  
Modest positive signals for gold in early 2014 could also be driven by index rebalancing and hedge fund buying. Many investors and analysts still believe that gold won’t do well in 2014, as a U.S. economic recovery appears on steady legs and as Indian import rules depress global demand. That follows gold’s steep price decline in 2013, its worst percentage fall since 1981.
Gold could also have risen much higher on seriously weak U.S. jobs data from Jan. 10, wrote UBS AG (VTX:UBSN) analysts on Friday.
“With just a $12 range in gold for the week, many participants will leave their desks today wholly disillusioned with gold’s price path. It shrugged off the olive branch received from last Friday’s NFP [non-farm payrolls data], and also ruled out any price flutter above $1250 that initially looked like a possibility,” they wrote on Jan. 17.
“The gold market is lacking enthusiasm and interest…Collective sentiment is firmly back in the bearish camp.” Even Barclays analysts are skeptical, too, of steeply higher gold prices. They forecast that gold will average $1205 per ounce over 2014.

Bearish speculators are betting that the mild weather will decrease demand for the heating fuel. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.U.S. supply levels also remained in focus. Nymex gas prices rallied last week after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that natural gas supplies dropped by a record-high 287 billion cubic feet. The previous record drop was a decrease of 285 billion cubic feet in the seven days ended December 13, Energy Information Administration data show.Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.530 trillion cubic feet as of last week, approximately 15% below the five-year average for this time of year.Natural gas inventories have fallen by 1.3 trillion cubic feet, or 34%, since November 8 as frigid winter temperatures in the U.S. led households to burn a higher than normal amount of the fuel in furnaces to heat their homes.Some market analysts expect supplies at the end of the winter heating season in March to be at their lowest in six years.Data from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission released Friday showed that hedge funds and money managers reduced their bearish bets in natural gas futures in the week ending January 14.Gross long natural gas positions increased by 6,476 contracts to 152,876, while gross short positions rose by 2,114 contracts to 238,929.

830,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 20, 2014 02:30AM ET</span>",The Top 5 Nations With Cheapest Gas Prices,"By Charles Poladian - Gas prices fluctuate and, depending on where you are in the world, can be quite the bargain. The Washington Post has broken down gas prices from countries around the world and it’s not surprising that some of the cheapest places to get gas are those with massive oil reserves.
The Washington Post reports Venezuela pays just $0.05 per gallon. The reason for the cheap gas there is state-run gas stations being supported by the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., PDVSA, whose assets include Citgo and petroleum stakes in Sweden and Germany. The $0.05 rate reflects the Central Bank of Venezuela’s exchange rate whereas the tourism exchange rate sets the price at $0.10.

The cheapest gas prices in the world can be found in countries that are members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC: the aforementioned Venezuela as well as Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. Iran’s average price per gallon of gas is $0.47, Saudi Arabia's is $0.78 per gallon, Kuwait's is $0.88 and Qatar's is $0.93. No other country breaks the sub-$1.00 per gallon mark, but the Washington Post reports that Egypt and Oman are tied for sixth with an average of $1.50 per gallon of gas. However, based on GlobalPetrolPrices.com, the sixth-cheapest country for gas, with an average price of about $1.07 per gallon, is the tiny island country of Bahrain.
While the price of gas in the United States is nowhere near as low as they are in those countries, the U.S.'s average price of gas, currently at $3.31, does fall well below the global average. Subsequently, the U.S. is the 15th cheapest nation for gas, according to the Washington Post’s map. The global average is $5.52 per gallon of gas. Norway is the distant outlier for countries with the most expensive price per gallon of gas: $10.76 per gallon, $1.60 more than the next-most-expensive country, the Netherlands, where gas is $9.16 per gallon.

840,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 17, 2014 10:00AM ET</span>",China Central Bank Still Likes Gold,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - China’s secretive central bank may have stocked up heavily on gold in the past few years, and could own about 2710 tons as of the end of 2013, according to an industry expert.
Precious metals expert and gold bug Jeff Nichols, a managing director of the American  Precious Metals Advisors, wrote on Thursday that much of this reported increase in holdings came from domestic Chinese mine production and secondary supply, which involves scrap or recycling gold.
According to Nichols’ sources, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) bought 654 metric tons of gold in 2009 to 2011, 388 tons in 2012, and over 622 tons in 2013. There is no recent official data about Chinese central bank gold holdings, as the institution last announced its gold holdings in April 2009, at 1054 tons.
The PBOC doesn’t regularly report on its gold buying, as many other central banks do, and it hasn’t said when it might update the gold market on its purchases. Estimating how much the Chinese central bank has bought in recent years is something of a parlor game for Wall Street analysts and gold investors, though official announcements could have real price impacts.
Nichols declined to specify his sources to IBTimes. He had no details on the potential timing of an official central bank announcement.
“The important thing isn’t the specific numbers themselves,” Nichols told IBTimes. “There’s growing appreciation of indications that the [Chinese] central bank has been accumulating gold in recent years, probably in significant quantities.”
If Nichols is right, China would jump to the fourth largest gold holder in the world, beating out Italy and France, with the extra 1664 tons since 2009. That more than doubles China’s reported holdings as of 2009.
Bloomberg Industries metals and mining analyst gave similar figures last week, citing conversations with officials in China and Mongolia.
“There is no official data at all on Chinese official sector demand,” HSBC Holdings Plc gold analyst James Steel told IBTimes in late 2013, stressing the difficulty of devising accurate estimates here. “It is one of the opaque elements of the market.”
China may be buying gold to diversify its foreign reserve holdings away from its heavy exposure to the U.S. dollar, which account for the vast majority of its foreign reserves. China holds U.S. treasury bonds worth $1.3 trillion, reported Bloomberg earlier this week, in a new record.
Gold and the euro were the main diversification options for China's central bank managers before the continent’s euro zone crisis, according to experts.
“China were diversifying their holdings away from dollars towards euro,” said ETF Securities investment analyst Nick Brooks to IBTimes in late November. “And then of the course the euro crisis broke out. And there were questions about the structural stability or viability of the euro.”
China’s gold holdings on a percentage basis were also already low compared to major developed economies, added Brooks, providing another incentive to beef up gold reserves. They were 1 percent of holdings in 2009, according to industry data.
Central banks in developing nations have added to their gold reserves in recent years, though the pace slowed in 2013. Russia has been a prominent player in that trend. Gold bugs tend to cite massive central bank buying by China as bullish for prices, though it’s unclear if that unknown factor has a significant price impact compared to, say, U.S. monetary policy.  
Central banks globally held 31,900 tons of gold, according to latest World Gold Council data. Yemen and Albania held the least, with 1.6 tons of gold each.
Even with the supposed additions, China’s gold reserves as a percent of its total holdings, including gold and foreign exchange reserves, only comes to 2.5 percent, on Nichol’s analysis. That compares to 70 percent in gold holdings for the U.S and 69 percent for Germany.
Switzerland’s central bank recently lost $16.5 billion in gold write-downs thanks to the metal’s steep price declines in 2013.  Gold saw its worst year of price declines since 1981 in 2013, as the U.S. Federal Reserve threatened to taper back bond purchases, and skittish gold investors turned to booming equity markets instead. "

876,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 14, 2014 10:30AM ET</span>",Gold Stages Modest Comeback – Will It Last?,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - The world’s most watched precious metal has made a modest comeback in early 2014, weeks after it suffered its worst price decline in 32 years last year.
Major hedge funds including the $3 billion Passport Capital and the $1 billion Vermillion Asset Management LLC, owned by the Carlyle Group LP (NASDAQ:CG), plan to bet on gold in coming weeks, reported the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday.
Gold rebounded to $1252 per ounce on Tuesday’s open on the New York COMEX exchange, following weeks where it hovered near the $1200 mark, or precariously close to $1180 per ounce, 2013’s yearly trading low.  
That’s a rebound of 4 percent so far this year, relative to lacklustre stock market gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen by 1.92 percent so far, while the NASDAQ index and the S&P500 are down by about 1.5 percent each, after an exceptionally strong year for equity markets in 2013. Gold investors view a shift of about $50 per ounce, up or down, as a significant price shift.
Major gold producer Goldcorp Inc. (TSE:G), among the world’s top ten gold producers by tonnage, also plans a $2.4 billion bid for smaller Canadian rival Osisko Mining Corp. (TSE:OSK), in a sign that gold miners may be taking advantage of depressed enthusiasm for gold and gold mining shares, to secure cheaper deals. Similar moves have been made in the silver sector, with attractive low valuations for deals, a silver mining executive told IBTimes last year.
Much gold buying in the new year could be due to investors re-balancing their exposure to two major commodity indices, however. The Dow Jones UBS Commodity Index and the S&P GSCI both require specific gold allocations, so the metal’s gold’s price plunge means investors must buy more gold to shore up percentage totals for portfolios.
In a Dec. 4 report, CPM Group actually highlighted gold mining stocks as a potential comeback story for late 2014, in an unorthodox investment pitch. Gold mining stocks have fared badly in 2013, as gold miners suspended projects amid lower gold prices and high production costs.
Gold mining stocks are at their lowest prices since the worst of the last gold bear market, from 1997 to 2002, wrote CPM Group analysts. Sharply falling production costs in mid-to-late 2013, spurred by investor disenchantment and gold’s own price decline, have tightened up finances at these lumbering giants, long known for letting costs spiral out of control.
“There is some rejuvenation of interest in mining equities beginning to emerge. CPM Group…expects equity investors to return to the mining share market slowly but steadily. Such a revival may be anemic for a few more quarters, but by the final quarter of 2014 it may be more clearly in place,” read the precious metals report.
“Gold equities would be expected to turn higher before the price of gold,” said the report.
Not all analysts are bullish, though, and much skepticism persists about gold’s prospects throughout 2014. Gold is often viewed as a bet against the economy and on higher inflation, so a bright economic future for the U.S., as depicted in much recent economic data, augurs badly for gold. Investors and money managers, too, pulled back $38.8 billion from gold funds in 2013, the most since 2000, reported Bloomberg.
“We see more significant downside building throughout the year in gold,” due to rising interest rates, wrote Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) analysts in a Jan. 12 commodities note. They foresee gold prices ending 2014 at $1050 per ounce, below 2013 lows.
Disappointing jobs numbers from last Friday, where employers added far fewer jobs than anticipated, could spur gold up to $1300 per ounce. But gold isn’t likely to stay there long, as investors could use a rally to sell the metal for a quick profit. Many analysts see sustained levels far above $1300 per ounce as unlikely in the short term.
“Gold’s response highlights a market that has been burned, quite badly; and investors are operating with the mindset of once bitten, twice shy,” wrote UBS AG (VTX:UBSN) analysts in a note on Monday. “Gold bulls are in a lonely place – after a disastrous 2013, few investors are willing to trust gold at this stage.”

902,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 12, 2014 08:29AM ET</span>",Grain futures - weekly outlook: January 13 - 17,"Investing.com - U.S. grain futures ended Friday’s session mixed, with corn prices rallying sharply to hit a two-week high after the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicted a smaller harvest than analysts had expected.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, corn futures for March delivery surged 5.04% on Friday to settle the week at USD4.3260 a bushel, the highest since December 26.
Earlier in the day, corn prices fell to a session low of USD4.0638 a bushel, the weakest level since August 2010. The March contract settled down 1.2% on Thursday to end at USD4.1200 a bushel. On the week, the March corn contract advanced 2.12%.
The USDA said the U.S. corn crop that was harvested last fall totaled 13.925 billion bushels, 0.5% lower than its December estimate of 13.989 billion and confounding expectations for a harvest of 14.053 billion bushels.
Corn yields averaged 158.8 bushels an acre, down from an estimate of 160.4 bushels in December. Analysts had been looking for an increase to 161.2 bushels.
The USDA also unexpectedly cut its outlook for corn stockpiles at the end of the 2013-14 season in August by 9% to 1.631 billion bushels. Analysts had forecast the inventories estimate would rise to 1.844 billion bushels.
Elsewhere on the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for March delivery inched up 0.37% on Friday to settle the week at USD12.7840 a bushel by close of trade. Prices of the oilseed rallied to a session high of USD12.9700 a bushel earlier in the day, the strongest level since December 31.
The March soybean contract added 0.34% on the week amid ongoing indications of robust export demand for U.S. supplies.
The USDA said U.S. soybean production reached 3.289 billion bushels last fall, 1% higher than a previous estimate and slightly more than analysts had forecast. Soybean yields averaged 43.3 bushels an acre, up from an estimate of 43.0 bushels in December.
Global soybean production will reach a record 284.94 million tons, compared with 283.54 million forecast last month and up from 268.02 million a year earlier, due to increased production in Brazil and Argentina.
Meanwhile, wheat for March delivery tumbled 2.61% on Friday to settle the week at USD5.6900 a bushel. Earlier in the day, wheat prices fell to a session low of USD5.6040 a bushel, the weakest level since July 12, 2010.
CBOT March wheat prices fell 0.76% on Thursday to settle at USD5.8420 a bushel. The March wheat contract ended the week with a loss of 6.41%.
The USDA said that U.S. wheat stockpiles in the season ending May 31 will total 608 million bushels, up from 575 million projected last month. The agency also forecast global supplies of the grain at 185.4 million tonnes, up 1.4% from a December estimate of 182.8 million tonnes.
In the week ahead, market players will focus on the release of key weekly USDA data, including crop progress numbers on Monday and export sales figures on Thursday.
Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, government figures show. Wheat was fourth, behind hay.

903,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 12, 2014 07:48AM ET</span>",Crude oil futures - weekly outlook: January 13 - 17,"Investing.com - New York-traded crude oil futures moved off the previous session’s eight-month low to end up more than 1% on Friday, after weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data fanned speculation that the Federal Reserve will scale down its bond-buying program at a slower pace than previously anticipated.
The Fed’s stimulus program is viewed by many investors as a key driver in boosting the price of commodities as it tends to depress the value of the dollar.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude futures for delivery in February rose 1.16% on Friday to settle the week at USD92.72 a barrel by close of trade.
The February contract fell to USD91.24 a barrel on Thursday, the lowest since May 2, before trimming losses to end at USD91.66 a barrel, down 0.73%. Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at USD91.24 a barrel, the low from January 9 and resistance at USD94.18 a barrel, the high from January 8. On the week, U.S. crude futures, also known as West Texas Intermediate or WTI, lost 1.55%, the second consecutive weekly decline.
The U.S. economy added 74,000 jobs in December, the Labor Department said, the smallest increase since January 2011 and well below expectations for 196,000 new jobs.
The unemployment rate fell to a five-year low of 6.7% from 7% in November, but this was due in part to people dropping out of the labor force. The labor participation rate fell to an almost 35-year low of 62.8%.
The disappointing data tempered expectations that the Fed would cut its stimulus program again this month. The central bank cited a stronger labor market in its decision to taper its asset purchase program by USD10 billion in December to USD75 billion-a-month.
Minutes of the Fed’s December meeting released earlier in the week showed that officials were keen to stress that further reductions in stimulus were not on a “preset course” and would be undertaken in “measured” steps. The central bank is scheduled to meet January 28-29 to review the economy and assess policy.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, declined 0.41% on Friday to end at 80.74, the lowest since January 2.
Dollar-denominated oil futures contracts tend to rise when the dollar falls, as this makes oil cheaper for buyers in other currencies.
The CFTC Commitments of Traders report for the week ending January 7 showed that speculators sharply increased their net-short exposure to NYMEX crude futures. Money managers boosted their net short oil positions by 18,115 contracts to 52,674, while reducing net long positions by 3,576 contracts to 293,342.
In the week ahead, investors will be closely watching U.S. data on retail sales, inflation and consumer sentiment, as well as speeches by two Federal Reserve officials on Tuesday.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil futures for February delivery advanced 0.81% on Friday to settle the week at USD107.25 a barrel. Earlier in the session, London-traded Brent prices fell to USD106.03 a barrel, the lowest since November 13.
The February Brent contract inched up 0.22% on the week. Meanwhile, the spread between the Brent and the crude contracts stood at USD14.53 a barrel by close of trade on Friday."
904,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 12, 2014 06:46AM ET</span>",Gold / Silver / Copper futures - weekly outlook: January 13 - 17,"Investing.com - Gold futures rallied sharply to end at a four-week high on Friday, after disappointing U.S. nonfarm payrolls data reduced concerns over a further reduction in U.S. monetary stimulus.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for February delivery jumped 1.42% on Friday to settle the week at USD1,246.90 a troy ounce. Gold prices hit a session high of USD1,248.50 a troy ounce earlier in the day, the strongest level since December 16.
Comex gold prices advanced 0.32% on Thursday to settle at USD1,229.40 a troy ounce. Futures were likely to find support at USD1,223.10 a troy ounce, the low from January 9 and resistance at USD1,251.40, the high from December 16. On the week, the February Comex gold contract added 0.79%, the third consecutive weekly gain.
Meanwhile, silver for March delivery ended Friday’s session up 2.74% to close the week at USD20.22 a troy ounce. Comex silver prices rose 0.74% on Thursday to settle at USD19.68 a troy ounce. On the week, the March silver futures inched up 0.44%.

The central bank is scheduled to meet January 28-29 to review the economy and assess policy. Expectations of monetary stimulus tend to benefit gold, as the precious metal is seen as a safe store of value and inflation hedge.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, declined 0.41% on Friday to end at 80.74, the lowest since January 2.
Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
The CFTC Commitments of Traders report for the week ending January 7 showed that speculators boosted their net long gold positions by 2,062 contracts to 139,244, while reducing net short positions by 4,602 contracts to 100,357.

909,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 10, 2014 07:00AM ET</span>",Silver Mining CEO Talks Markets And Outlook,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - Top U.S. silver mining company Coeur Mining Inc (NYSE:CDE) spoke with International Business Times about its business, the silver market and industry, and the corporate culture within mining companies.  The $1.1 billion company, which calls itself the largest U.S.-based primary silver producer, lost about $69 million over the past three quarters, in a difficult commodities market. It notched annual losses from 2008 to 2011, but recovered in 2011 and 2012.  Edited excerpts from a phone conversation with Coeur CEO Mitchell Krebs follow. How has the silver price decline in 2013 affected your business? (Silver fell 36 percent in 2013, the second-worst performer among commodities after corn, and worse still than gold’s much publicized 28 percent swoon.)  “It’s the first time in a long time that the industry had to deal with significant and sustained price declines,” said Krebs. Before 2013 price declines, Coeur tried to maximize cash flow by reducing operating costs and freeing up working capital.  “In this kind of cyclical commodities business, no matter where prices are, we always need to focus on reducing costs. It’s the one thing we have a little bit of control over,” he said.  Although cost restructuring was already underway by early 2013, when April and May arrived, with precious metal price freefalls, Coeur stepped up focus. “There’s nothing like a good price decline to instill some urgency in people,”  Krebs said. They cut back capital expenditure budgets for 2014, and ended up spending $100 million in capex in 2013, down from an initially projected $125 million. Exploration expenses were also slimmed down. “You’ve got to find ways to grow the business that can provide an adequate rate of return even at lower prices,” continued Krebs. “That really shortens the list in terms of opportunities out there in a lower price environment,” he said, referring to new mine projects or acquisitions.What’s your outlook for silver in 2014?  “I think we’re going to see continued choppiness and a fairly sideways silver price,” said Krebs. “Silver is a very volatile metal and will probably see a range of $18 up to $23 per ounce, throughout the year … Investors are trying to get a sense of global economy, whether there is or isn’t any hint of inflation, or the X-factor of some crisis, a political crisis or otherwise.”Silver prices are forecast by London’s Capital Economics to hit $21.5 per ounce by the end of 2014, a small gain from the present $19.7/oz. Silver typically trades in tandem with gold, as the more influential yellow metal attracts heavier investment and can drag down silver in its wake. How much does it cost you to produce silver?  Starting with Coeur’s next quarterly results, the company will release so-called ‘all-in sustaining cost’ metrics, which refer to the total costs required to mine a silver ounce from the ground. Previously, the silver and gold mining industry cited cash costs, which were expenses excluding big capital expenditures, exploration expenses, administrative and corporate overhead, and the like.  Critics who charged that Coeur’s production costs are higher than silver's price tag use “backward-looking” projections, according to Krebs.  “Our all-in sustaining costs is around that $20 an ounce mark,” he said, “and hopefully declining as we keep our focus on those [efficiency] areas,” he said. “Our costs continue to decline.”Silver miners don’t have a much higher profit margin over gold miners, said Krebs, contrary to some perceptions. Gold miners have suffered this year as production costs per ounce of gold approach the selling price of gold, squeezing company margins. Your net metal sales and raw earnings fell in 2012 from 2011. Have those picked up for 2013?  Net Metal Sales and EBITDA For Coeur Mining, Coeur Presentation at JPMorgan Conference Dec. 11 2013 Coeur Company Presentation. “We haven’t disclosed publicly what our 2013 full year numbers are,” Krebs said. The company is due to report its 2013 full year results later in February 2014, and will release mining production figures before that, in coming weeks.    Krebs defended losses by arguing that operating cash flows figures were more relevant in the capital-intensive mining industry, since these metrics strip out non-cash charges and derivative accounting.  “As we look to 2014, on current prices -- about $1250/oz. on gold and $20/oz. on silver -- we are about net cash flow break even for the year,” he said. A substantial cash flow surplus will meet deductions from capital expenditures and royalty payments, he said. Gold mining stocks fared badly in 2013. Have silver mining stocks done better?  Silver mining companies have suffered from a “lost decade of shareholder value,"" Krebs said. That’s parallel to problems at gold miners, from mammoth Barrick Gold Corp. (TSE:ABX) to smaller rivals, who faced flack for poor corporate governance and spending without returning cash to shareholders.  “Our whole reason for being here as a company is to recognize the failings of the past, and to change the way we do thing going forward,” he said, citing recent corporate restructurings at Coeur.  Shareholders need to be coaxed off the sidelines and back into precious metal mining equities, he said. The formation of Coeur Capital, a subsidiary dedicated to silver streaming, royalties and acquisitions, is Coeur’s attempt to do that. “Coeur Capital has much higher margins, is a higher return business, and is a less risky business. Those are all things concerning traditional mining companies that have really scared investors away,” he said. Coeur’s stock as traded in New York has fallen 51 percent in the past year. Its Canadian stock in Toronto has fared almost as badly. Other silver companies, like Silver Wheaton Corp. (TSE:SLW), have said that recent low valuations have helped smart companies with cheap acquisitions.“The risk profile of this industry, or at least the perception of it, has really become a major reason why investors are shunning equities in the precious metals sector,” he said. “We just need to be culturally very focused on the return side of the equation. … We [the industry] need to create that value proposition for investors that I think is really lacking right now.” Last thoughts on Coeur Mining?  “Five years from now, I’d like to see from us … a much more diversified set of revenue streams, from more metals aside from just silver and gold,” Krebs said. The new mining investments, which could include lead, zinc and copper, must balance well with revenues from existing gold and silver properties. “A portfolio of assets with poly-metallic types can get you much higher margins and give you more of a cushion against lower prices,” he said. Thanks to the appearance of popular precious metals exchange traded-funds in 2004, investment in precious metals has changed entirely, according to Krebs. Those funds allowed investors easy exposure to metal prices, without the burden of buying physical metals.  “It used to be, you’d attract a premium valuation for being a pure play company, whether a silver company or otherwise. That was sort of the game,” he said. But ETFs now mean mining companies must compete like other companies, on their execution and returns to shareholders. “We can’t just try to be a leveraged liquid play on a single metal,” he said. “That’s just not a sustainable business model.” Industrial demand for silver should see “a little bit of an uptick”, thanks to a slowly improving global economy, said precious metals retailer Anthem Blanchard to IBTimes. But demand for silver among investors will likely depend on less predictable U.S. interest rates and monetary policy, he added.  Silver miners are expected to produce 800 million silver ounces in 2013, with about 75 percent stemming from silver as a mining by-product, according to November 2013 Thomson Reuters GFMS data. Silver is often produced as a byproduct in gold mines. Rising mine production in 2013 and a lingering silver surplus from 2012 could prove negative for prices in 2014, according to the GFMS report. Global demand for silver in 2012 stood at about 1 billion ounces, or about 31,000 metric tons, according to the Silver Institute. The silver investment market was worth more than $7 billion globally in 2013.  Barclays PLC (LON:BARC) forecast on Thursday that silver prices could slump to as low as $15/oz in 2014, though it’ll likely average $19/oz. “Underlying silver market fundamentals are set to remain unaccommodating in 2014 given a projected bloated surplus,” Barclays analysts wrote. Ironically, investors may not realize that at least 5 kilo tonnes of holdings in specialist silver funds are now loss-making, they said. Silver ETPs saw net inflows in 2013, contrasting with steep outflows from gold products.    Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Coeur to report a loss of $16.3 million in its upcoming quarter, down from $36 million in profits a year before. The company recently acquired Vancouver-based Global Royalty Corp. for $23.8 million, in a bid to earn royalties from Global Royalty’s interests in Mexican and Ecuadorian mines, and diversify the business away from pure mining.  Some analysts are modestly upbeat about Coeur’s prospects. Coeur is close to a meaningful turnaround, and could gain the confidence of investors, but its Nevadan Rochester mine must meet Wall Street expectations, wrote Chris Thompson, an analyst with Raymond James, in recent reports. The company’s production expenses are also high, at about $20/oz., and keeps it highly exposed to silver price fluctuations, he said.  “We believe that CDE [Coeur] is on the cusp of turning the corner in achieving operational consistency, and with that, market confidence … ” he wrote in a September 23 report. “We look for quarter-on-quarter operational improvements to justify our thesis.” "

1655,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 17, 2013 09:33PM ET</span>",Oil trades slightly higher as traders fret about U.S. data,"Investing.com - Oil futures traded slightly higher during Friday’s Asian, although traders appeared pensive that the recent U.S. government shutdown will weigh on oil demand and prices in the near-term. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for November delivery rose 0.11% to USD100.78 per barrel in Asian trading Friday. The November contract settled lower by 1.58% at USD100.67 per barrel Thursday. Oil was pressure Thursday due to some mixed U.S. economic data points. In U.S. economic news out Thursday, the Labor Department said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits last week declined by 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 358,000 from a downwardly revised 373,000 in the preceding week.Analysts had expected U.S. jobless claims to decline to 335,000 last week. A separate report showed that the Philly Fed manufacturing index ticked down to 19.8 from 22.3 in September, but came in above expectations for a reading of 15.0. Traders appear to be betting that because the U.S. government was closed for more than two weeks, fourth-quarter economic output will be hampered with no means for the world’s largest economy to recapture that lost growth. The Fed has previously pledged to keep its easing program in place until the U.S. economy shows sufficient strength. The central has also said its time line for tapering is not tied to a calendar, but rather economic data. Elsewhere, OPEC member Angola, Africa's second-biggest oil producer after Nigeria, raised taxes on oil producers there in a bid to boost government revenue. Meanwhile, Brent futures for November delivery rose 0.24% to USD109.25 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."

1678,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 15, 2013 09:22PM ET</span>",Oil trades slightly higher despite U.S. default fears,"Investing.com - Oil futures traded modestly higher during Wednesday’s Asian despite heightened fears the U.S., the world’s largest oil consumer, is inching closer to its first ever sovereign debt default. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for November delivery rose 0.06% to USD101.27 per barrel in Asian trading Wednesday. The November contract settled lower by 1.17% at USD101.21 per barrel on Tuesday. Oil futures were likely to find support at USD101.08 a barrel, Monday's low, and resistance at USD102.58 a barrel, Monday's high.Hopes continued to build on Tuesday that U.S. lawmakers and the White House are closer to agreeing on a spending packaged needed to reopen the government and avoid a default. However, some of that optimism was drained on news that talks between U.S policymakers to reopen the government mired in its first shutdown in 17 years, had stalled. Fitch Ratings, the only of one of the three major credit ratings agencies that still has an AAA rating on the U.S., put U.S. Treasury bonds on Rating Watch Negative. That could be viewed as a sign Fitch is preparing to pare its rating on U.S. sovereign debt. ""The prolonged negotiations over raising the debt ceiling ... risks undermining confidence in the role of the U.S. dollar as the preeminent global reserve currency, by casting doubt over the full faith and credit of the U.S. This `faith' is a key reason why the U.S. 'AAA' rating can tolerate a substantially higher level of public debt than other AAA"" bonds,"" said Fitch in a statement. Elsewhere, PIRA Energy Group said of U.S. oil output the ""growth rate is greater than the sum of the growth of the next nine fastest growing countries combined and has covered most of the world's net demand growth over the past two years."" Meanwhile, Brent crude futures for November delivery rose 0.19% to USD109.38 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."
