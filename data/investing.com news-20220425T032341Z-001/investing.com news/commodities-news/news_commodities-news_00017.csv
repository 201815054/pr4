Bottom fishing brought the commodity in and out of positive territory at times.
In the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for delivery in December traded down 0.27% at $81.84 a barrel during U.S. trading. New York-traded oil futures hit a session low of $80.81 a barrel and a high of $82.73 a barrel.

Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $79.10 a barrel, Thursday's low, and resistance at $84.08 a barrel, Thursday's high.
Oil prices fell due to ongoing concerns that global supply far outstrips demand, with OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran recently hinting at the need to get used to current prices and leave output quotas on unchanged.
The oil cartel will hold its next biannual meeting in Vienna on Nov. 27.
Elsewhere, Germany’s Bundesbank reported that the country’s economy barely grew in the third quarter, as industrial output slowed and business sentiment deteriorated, which pressured prices lower on concerns a more sluggish European economy will consume less fuel and energy going forward.
In its monthly report the German central bank said that while the euro zone’s largest economy was unlikely to enter a recession the economic outlook for the fourth quarter was cautious.

The Asian nation will release data on third quarter gross domestic product, as well as reports on industrial production, retail sales and fixed-asset investment for September.
Market analysts expect China's economy to grow 7.2% in the three months ending September 30, down from growth of 7.5% in the preceding quarter.
Recent economic data from the Asian nation has indicated that the recovery remains fragile and may require further monetary stimulus.

Futures were likely to find support at $3.659 per million British thermal units, the low from November 21, and resistance at $3.817, the high from October 17.
Updated weather-forecasting models showed that cold temperatures along the U.S. East Coast will give way to more seasonal readings from October 27 through October 31.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Meanwhile, investors continued to digest Thursday's weekly inventory data, which showed that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by a more than expected 94 billion cubic feet last week.
Inventories rose by 79 billion cubic feet in the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average change is a build of 78 billion cubic feet.
Injections of gas into storage have surpassed the five-year average for 26 consecutive weeks, alleviating concerns over tightening supplies.

14,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2014 05:50PM ET</span>",Ukraine says it agrees on interim gas price with Russia,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's and Russia's leaders have reached a preliminary agreement on a price for gas supplies this winter but Kiev may need international help to pay, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said on Saturday.
Poroshenko met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Milan on Friday to discuss the conflict in Ukraine's eastern regions, where pro-Russian separatists are fighting Kiev government forces.
Russia cut off gas supply to Ukraine in mid-June following more than two years of dispute on the price. Russia said Ukraine had to pay off large debts for previously-supplied gas before it would resume supply.
""(We) reached an agreement,"" Poroshenko said in an interview with Ukrainian TV channels. ""Until March 31 we will fix the price at $385.""
An agreement signed in 2009 by former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko called on Ukraine to pay $485 per 1,000 cubic meters for Russian gas. Kiev is contesting the contract in a Stockholm arbitration court.
Poroshenko said that state-run energy company Naftogaz was short of funds to pay for Russian gas partly because of debts created by consumers in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, controlled by pro-Russian separatists.
""We must solve the question of how we cover the deficit of funds for Naftogaz for gas purchases,"" Poroshenko said.
""We have several different options (including) the International Monetary Fund.""

He said a mission of the IMF is due to arrive in Kiev in mid-November to discuss amendments to the current loan program for Ukraine. Poroshenko said the next round of gas talks was likely to take place on Oct. 21 in Brussels.

The Intercontinental Exchange Brent December contract gained 57 cents, or 0.7 percent, to close at $86.10 per barrel Friday. The benchmark price lost 4.9 percent for the week as a whole.
The ICE WTI November contract edged higher to close at $82.85 per barrel Friday. However, the light, sweet crude lost 3.6 percent for the week.

Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC -- the group of 12 mostly Middle Eastern producers that pump about one-third of the world’s oil -- are scheduled to meet in November in Vienna, and traders will track their decisions on production targets.
Producers such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates plan to oppose any cut in the OPEC oil-production ceiling at the meeting, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) said in a note to clients that crude oil’s selloff has been fueled by investor positioning based on expectations rather than a real-world disparity between supply and demand, and that if prices dropped low enough, they could trigger renewed demand and consumption, Bloomberg News reported. The investment bank said “prices have likely overshot to the downside.”
Oil prices dropped by more than $1 per barrel Thursday, when Brent crude hit a fresh four-year low at less than $83, amid growing concerns over the health of the global economy.
The International Energy Agency, or IEA, this week cut its oil demand growth forecast for 2015 as global economies remain weak, prompting predictions that OPEC members might prefer selling at lower prices over losing their markets."

""However, the rest of the U.S. will be relatively comfortable as high pressure expands to cover many northern U.S. regions by late in the week, providing several days where only light national heating or cooling demand will be needed.""
Thursday's supply report pressured prices lower as well.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for December delivery traded at $1,239.80 a troy ounce, down 0.11%, up from a session low of $1,232.20 and off a high of $1,242.10.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment index rose to a seven-year high 86.4 for October from 84.6 in September. Analysts had expected the index to slip to 84.1 in October, and the surprise firmed the dollar and sent gold prices falling amid sentiments that the Federal Reserve will likely close its bond-buying program this month and hike interest rates in 2015.
Elsewhere, the Census Bureau reported earlier that U.S. building permits rose 1.5% to 1.018 million in September, disappointing expectations for an increase of 2.8% to 1.0.29 million units, after a 5.1% drop to 1.003 million units in August.
The report also showed that U.S. housing starts rose 6.3% in September to 1.017 million units, beating expectations for a 4.8% gain. Housing starts for August were revised to a 12.8% fall from a previously estimated 14.4% decline.

Official data released on Wednesday showed that Chinese inflation for September slowed to 1.6% on-year from 2.0% in August, below expectations for a reading of 1.7%.
The weaker-than-expected data underlined concerns about China's economy and sparked speculation policymakers in Beijing will have to introduce fresh stimulus to meet the government's 7.5% growth target.
In Europe this week, revised data showed that bloc's consumer price index rose by 0.3% in September, in line with expectations though soft nonetheless.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for December delivery traded at 1,233.60 a troy ounce, up 0.29%, up from a session low of $1,231.30 and off a high of $1,238.50.
The December contract settled up 0.68% at $1,230.00 on Monday.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,217.60 a troy ounce, last Friday's low, and resistance at $1,243.20, the high from Sept. 16.
Soft European data gave the dollar a boost on Tuesday, though gold stayed in positive territory on demand from investors seeking safe-haven to digest turbulence in equities markets.
The ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported earlier that its German economic sentiment index fell to -3.6 this month from September’s 6.9 reading. Analysts had expected the index to come in at 1.0 in October.
The index of euro zone economic sentiment plunged to 4.1 in September from 14.2 in August, well below expectations for a decline to 7.1.
A separate report showed that eurozone industrial production contracted 1.8% in August from July, outpacing expectations for a 1.6% decline. July's figure was revised to a 0.9% rise from a previously estimated 1.0% increase.
Year-on-year, industrial production fell 1.9% in August, surpassing expectations for a 0.9% decline and after rising at a rate of 1.6% the previous month.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has said monetary authorities will do what it takes to steer the continent away from deflationary declines, and Tuesday's data sparked expectations that further stimulus measures may be needed to kick-start the economy.
Elsewhere, U.S. stocks rebounded on Tuesday after heavy losses in recent sessions, though many investors remained gold, a refuge in times of volatility, until more markets cease to roil as much as they have been.
Meanwhile, silver for December delivery was up 0.31% at $17.398 a troy ounce, while copper futures for December delivery were up 1.47% at $3.085 a pound.

OPEC oil ministers are scheduled to meet in Vienna on November 27 to consider whether to adjust their production target of 30 million barrels per day for early 2015.
A report last week showed OPEC oil output hit a two-year high of 31 million barrels per day in September, led by higher output from Iraq and Libya.
Despite calls for a cut in output, Kuwait's oil minister Ali al-Omair said Monday that the cartel is unlikely to lower production to support prices.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has privately told oil market participants that it is ready to accept oil prices below $90 per barrel, and perhaps down to $80, for an extended period in an effort to slow the expansion of rival producers and retain its market share across Asia and Europe.
Saudi Arabia is the largest exporter among OPEC members and produces approximately 10 million barrels of oil a day.

42,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2014 10:10AM ET</span>","Facing new oil glut, Saudis avoid past mistakes to halt price slide","By Rania El Gamal 
DUBAI (Reuters) - Still haunted by its failed attempt to prevent a steep drop in oil prices by slashing production by almost three quarters in the 1980s, the world's top oil exporter Saudi Arabia is determined not to make the same mistake again. 
The oil glut of the 1980s, the early days of the modern crude market and a distant memory for most traders, has resurfaced recently in conversations with Saudi officials and veteran analysts who see it as the defining moment behind the kingdom's new strategy to protect medium-term market share. 
While the latest 25-percent slide in oil prices to below $90 a barrel is so far modest compared with the 1980s slump that took crude from $35 to below $10, many observers see similarities in a global market that is on the brink of a pivotal turn from an era of scarcity to one of abundance. 
Three decades ago, the spike in prices caused by the 1973 Arab oil embargo and Iran's 1979 revolution sapped global oil demand, while the discovery of oil in the North Sea spurred a new influx of non-OPEC crude. 
With world markets awash in oil, Saudi Arabia embarked on a strategy of defending prices, which at the time were largely set by exporters rather than the nascent futures market. The kingdom slashed its own output from more than 10 million barrels per day in 1980 to less than 2.5 million bpd in 1985. 
Other producers failed to follow suit, however, both within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and among new petroleum powers such as Britain and Norway. Prices fell into a years-long slump, leading to 16 years of Saudi budget deficits that left the country deeply in debt. 
Finally, in late 1985, Riyadh shifted gears, revving up output and cutting prices in a move that triggered a final slump in markets but ultimately paved the way for a gradual recovery. 
""The big mistake was that they continued to cut production to try to prop the prices and the price fell anyway,"" said analyst Yasser Elguindi of Medley Global Advisors. 
Instead they should have fought for market share, allowing ""higher cost producers to shut in as the price fell - which is what they are doing now."" 
Last week, Saudi officials briefed oil market participants in New York on the kingdom's shift in policy, making clear for the first time that Saudi is prepared to tolerate a period of lower prices - perhaps as low as $80 a barrel - in order to retain market share, Reuters reported on Monday. 
Saudi Arabia is not trying to push oil prices down, an oil source said, but is prepared to let the market find its floor and tolerate lower prices until others in OPEC commit to action. It has already cut selling prices to retain Asian customers. 
Saudi Arabia ""may be saying 'Don't expect us to somehow shoulder the responsibility for managing the whole oil market',"" said Sadad al-Husseini, a former top executive at state-run Saudi Aramco. 
Brent crude oil  traded below $88 a barrel on Tuesday, its lowest in almost four years, as traders realize that Saudi Arabia is in no hurry to curb the emerging oil glut. [O/R] 
1980s GHOSTS 
The grim circumstances of the 1980s dominated the formative years of King Abdullah's rule, when as de facto regent during the long illness of his predecessor King Fahd, he embarked on painful economic reforms that paved the way for years of growth. 
Then in the late 1990s, as prices weakened during the Asian debt crisis, the Saudis declined to cut production. 
""Instead, when Venezuela suggested it might produce at a maximum rate, the Kingdom indicated it would do the same,"" said Philip K. Verleger, president of consultancy PKVerleger LLC and a former adviser to U.S. President Jimmy Carter. 
The result was prices fell back to 1986 levels and only recovered after the Saudis changed tack and along with other OPEC and non-OPEC members cut output. 
Fast forward to 2014, Riyadh now wants to preempt a price collapse without sacrificing production levels or market share. 
In the 1980s, it was a drop in U.S. and European consumption coupled with the rise of the North Sea; now it is fears of easing demand from Asia and the unexpected growth of U.S. shale oil. 
The net effect is the same: An oil market potentially facing years worth of oversupply, a scenario the Saudis and OPEC have not been forced to grapple with since the early 2000s, before the rise of China triggered a decade-long price boom. 
Fellow Gulf Arab ally and OPEC exporter Kuwait has already said that OPEC is unlikely to cut oil production in an effort to prop up prices because such a move would not necessarily be effective. Venezuela became the first member to call for an emergency meeting to defend $100 oil. 
OPEC DISUNITY 
Another similarity: OPEC disunity. 
During the 1980s, Riyadh learned the hard way that it could not count on fellow OPEC producers, many of whom continued to pump at higher rates than their agreed-upon quotas, leaving Saudi Arabia to bear the brunt of output cuts. 
Much of the disharmony was on public display. Iran and Iraq were engaged in an eight-year all-out war. Accusations by Iraq that Kuwait had been pumping above its OPEC quota led ultimately to the first Gulf War in the early 1990s. 
It was not until late 1985 that the issue came to a head. The kingdom and OPEC finally agreed to reclaim market share, driving prices down to $10 a barrel but reestablishing themselves in the market. It took 16 years for prices to fully recover. 
""They decided they had enough – they were the swing producer and they increased production and drove prices down dramatically,"" said Dr. Gary Ross, chief executive of PIRA Energy Group, who has followed oil markets since the 1970s. 
This time around, Riyadh appears to be taking that stance from the start, with a focus on preserving the medium-term revenue of its 266 billion barrels of crude oil reserves rather than chase falling prices and sacrifice their market. 

""From an economics point of view, it's much better to let prices go way down,"" says Verleger. The emerging price war is ""a war of necessity.""

Also on the Comex, silver for December delivery tacked on 6.3 cents, or 0.36%, to trade at $17.40 a troy ounce.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones were on track to snap their worst three-day loss since November 2011 on Tuesday, as investors shifted their focus away from global growth concerns and toward corporate earnings.
Gold prices have been well-supported in recent sessions as ongoing concerns over the global economic outlook and losses in equity markets supported demand for safe haven assets.
Meanwhile, gold traders continued to speculate over the timing of a rate hike in the U.S. after the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s September meeting released last week showed that some officials were concerned over the impact of the stronger dollar on global growth and the outlook for U.S. inflation.
The minutes prompted investors to trim back expectations for an earlier-than-expected hike in U.S. interest rates.
Lower interest rates can give gold a lift, as it decreases the relative cost of holding on to the metal, which doesn't offer investors any similar guaranteed payout.

LONDON (Reuters) - Demand for oil in 2015 will grow far slower than previously forecast as global economies remain weak, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday, and prices may extend their sharp fall so long as OPEC shows no sign of countering a supply surge. 
The IEA said it cut its 2015 estimate for oil demand growth by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from its previous forecast and now expects demand growth of 1.1 million bpd to 93.5 million. It cut its 2014 estimate by 200,000 bpd to 0.7 million bpd. 
It said demand would be supported by prices near four year lows - oil  is around $88 a barrel from above $115 in June, a 25 percent drop resulting from a boom in U.S. shale oil production, slow global growth and a strong dollar. 
But it added that those low prices would remain under pressure because of supply levels: Global oil supply rose by almost 910,000 bpd in September to 93.8 million bpd, almost 2.8 million bpd higher than the previous year. 
In a rare IEA comment on OPEC's strategy, its chief analyst Antoine Halff said the producer group may no longer be willing or able to adjust production as the market has been transformed by the U.S. shale oil revolution. 
Some OPEC members whose budgets depend on oil might prefer to keep selling at lower prices than lose their part of the market. 
""We should not expect OPEC to necessarily play its traditional role of swing producer,"" Halff told Reuters on Tuesday, adding that other players with higher production costs might cut instead, such as those extracting from deepwater or oil sands. 
PRICE SLIDE 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Nov. 27 to discuss output policies and whether to act to stem the price slide. 
Given that oil is currently in what analysts including JBC Energy call the biggest bear market since 2009, it's likely to be the most interesting meeting in a while - particularly if, as several OPEC watchers suggest, its biggest exporter Saudi Arabia is less willing to cut production than in the past. 
The IEA said oil prices might not yet have dropped enough to force OPEC cuts because an ""analysis of light, tight oil supply suggests that most of it remains profitable at $80 a barrel Brent."" 
""Recent price drops appear both supply and demand driven,"" the West's energy watchdog said in its monthly report. ""Further oil price drops would likely be needed for supply to take a hit – or for demand growth to get a lift."" 
STRONG SUPPLY, WEAK DEMAND 
The IEA said that because of weaker global demand outlook it had also cut its estimate for demand for OPEC crude by 200,000 bpd for 2015 to 29.3 million bpd - more than 1 million bpd below current production levels. 
OPEC crude oil output surged to a 13-month high in September, led by recovery in Libya and higher Iraqi flows. Production rose 415,000 bpd from August to 30.66 million bpd. 
Crude supplies from top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia edged up by 50,000 bpd in September to 9.73 million bpd. The IEA said flows might ease in October due to slower seasonal demand for domestic crude burn. 
It also said that it expected non-OPEC supply growth to average an impressive 1.3 million bpd in 2015. 

""Total U.S. liquids production continues to exceed Russian and Saudi Arabian oil supplies. We estimate that total U.S. total liquids output will be above 12.0 million bpd next month and will remain above that threshold through December 2015,"" it said.

47,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2014 06:13AM ET</span>","Labor strife, safety concerns push South Africa platinum mechanization","By Ed Stoddard
RUSTENBURG South Africa (Reuters) - For decades, production in South Africa's platinum mines has rested on the muscular shoulders of men risking life and limb to drill into the rock face with jackhammers.
Three years of labor upheaval and a political push to make the shafts safer and transform the low-wage workforce have set in motion a drive to replace such rock drillers with machines.
""Labor militancy is dictating our push to mechanization and boardrooms will rubber stamp this stuff,"" said Peter Major, a fund manager at Cadiz Corporate Solutions.
The costly change is happening despite the obstacles thrown by geology, low platinum prices and capital constraints.
At Anglo American Platinum's Bathopele mine near Rustenburg west of Johannesburg, technology has already made rock drillers obsolete and hydraulic machines do the job, blazing an automated trail others are keen to follow.
Elsewhere in the platinum shafts, plans are afoot to roll out mechanization, including at Amplats' rival Impala Platinum, which recently sent a team to Bathopele to observe the lay-out - an unprecedented example of cooperation in an industry that has long been fiercely competitive and secretive.
Implats, Amplats and Lonmin, the world's top three producers, are also partnering at Bathopele with mining products company Joy Global to develop rock-cutting technology, which would remove the need for blasting and rock drilling.
Joy Global's chief executive Ted Doheny told Reuters in a phone interview from the company's Wisconsin headquarters that implementation would take another five to ten years.
CAPITAL UNITES
The big three platinum producers are united as never before, having collectively faced a five-month wage strike by the hardline Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) this year which pushed them to the brink and dealt a crushing blow to investor perceptions of South Africa's mines.
The automation drive is underway: Amplats wants to sell off its conventional mines to focus on mechanization while Implats' chief executive has said ""we will mechanize where we can.""
The industry says the pivot to mechanization was in the works even before AMCU's emergence on the platinum belt, where it has poached tens of thousands of members from the rival National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) in a turf war that has killed dozens and unleashed the recent waves of labor unrest.
Also underpinning the drive has been calls from the government and ruling ANC for the industry to move away from the labor-intensive, low-wage model rooted in the apartheid era.
A government safety drive with the goal of ""zero harm"" has also triggered a scramble to find less lethal mining methods.
Scores still die each year in South Africa's deep and dangerous mines though much progress has been made since the 1980s when hundreds of black miners perished annually, with much of the toll inflicted on rock drill operators.
""The shafts we are designing today will be in operation for 50 years and one has to take a view on whether rock drillers will be available, and whether using people in that way will still be acceptable,"" said Implats spokesman Johan Theron.
Safety aside, the triumph of technology over geology in the platinum shafts will have other consequences and hit AMCU hard, as its members are mostly semi-skilled, at the bottom of the wage scale, and perform tasks mechanized equipment will replace.
Rock drillers also comprise the union's hardline core and so the reduction in their numbers could blunt AMCU's militancy.
""AMCU understands that mechanization can undermine its collective power,"" said Crispen Chinguno, a researcher at the sociology department of Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand and an expert on the union.
At Bathopele, higher-paid employees including AMCU members broke union ranks during the big strike this year and it started limited production before the wider industry stoppage ended.
Officials from AMCU declined comment on the issue of mechanization. Rival unions have concerns about jobs but welcome the mechanized trend if the aim is better pay and safety.
""We have a problem with the introduction of mechanization if its sole purpose is to replace labor. But if it's about safety and workers getting more pay, then we don't have such a problem,"" Frans Baleni, NUM's General Secretary, told Reuters.
MAN AND MACHINE
Geology has confounded industry attempts to mechanize in the past because the platinum reef is generally too narrow, or at too steep a gradient, for machines to easily access. The gold reef also presents challenges on this front.
This is changing as firms like Atlas Copco and rival Sandvik develop machines that can work in ever tighter spaces and steeper conditions.
These include ""drill rigs"" and ""roof bolters"" that will replace the human rock drillers, whose jackhammers grind into the earth to insert explosives for blasting or safety bolts for underground roof support.
There are also mechanical sweepers with rotating steel brushes to move debris - a job still done in many South African mines by men with shovels.
In a shallow crevice at Bathopele, a hydraulic roof bolter designed by Atlas Copco drilled into the rock above, where the safety bolts will be inserted. Metres away crouched a man remotely controlling it.
With a vertical hydraulic drill protruding in front, it resembles a flattened bulldozer that can squeeze into tight spaces: in this case around 1.2 meters (four feet).
""We can do this far more productively and we remove the people from the hazard zones,"" said Judd Barlow, head of production at Bathopele's central shaft.
CAPITAL CONSTRAINTS
On the platinum belt, Bathopele is a proto-type and the swing to mechanization will not come overnight.
For older mines, ""the capital expenditure will make no sense because of their life span,"" said Jim Porter of the University of the Witwatersrand's Centre for Mechanised Mining Systems.
This is the challenge faced by Implats, which does not have a vast pool of capital at the moment, given the depressed price for the precious metal used for emissions-capping catalytic converters in automobiles. Platinum is near 5-year lows.
Implats, which had net cash at the end of its financial year in June of 4.3 billion rand ($389 million), is also burning up money on its post-strike ramp up.
Gerhard Potgieter, head of growth projects at Implats, says the company's first-generation shafts around Rustenburg, known as ""the Old Men,"" will not be mechanized given their age.
The best potential for mechanization can be found on its ""Big 5"" shafts, large second and third-generation operations. All of Implats' tunneling operations are also being converted.
Back at Bathopele, the surface presents as sharp a contrast with conventional mines as its underground operations.
Unlike most of the mines in the area, where workers are bused in or trudge on foot from grim shantytowns, Bathopele's skilled and higher-paid employees drive themselves and its parking lot is full of gleaming new cars and pick-up trucks.

""We actually have a parking problem here, we are running out of space,"" said one employee.

OPEC oil ministers are scheduled to meet in Vienna on November 27 to consider whether to adjust their production target of 30 million barrels per day for early 2015.
A report last week showed OPEC oil output hit a two-year high of 31 million barrels per day in September, led by higher output from Iraq and Libya.
Despite calls for a cut in output, Kuwait's oil minister Ali al-Omair said Monday that the cartel is unlikely to lower production to support prices.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has privately told oil market participants that it is ready to accept oil prices below $90 per barrel, and perhaps down to $80, for an extended period in an effort to slow the expansion of rival producers and retain its market share across Asia and Europe.
Saudi Arabia is the largest exporter among OPEC members and produces approximately 10 million barrels of oil a day.

53,By International Business Times,"<span>Oct 13, 2014 05:15PM ET</span>","Brazil Drought Takes Toll On Coffee, Sugar","By Brianna Lee -

A deepening drought crisis across Brazil is hitting two of the country’s largest exports as coffee prices surged to their highest level in two years and sugar production is headed for a steep decline. The drought affecting Brazil this year is the worst the country has faced in decades, triggering alarm for cities like Sao Paulo, which has instituted emergency measures to cope with a water supply crisis.
The price of Arabica coffee, of which Brazil is the world’s top supplier, soared to a two-year high last week as meteorologists predicted low prospects for rainfall in Brazil’s coffee-producing regions for the rest of October and November.
Brazil joins other Central American countries dealing with coffee crop woes as El Salvador, Honduras, Panama and Guatemala have all dealt not only with drought but also coffee rust, a fungus that hit crops and resulted in the loss of more than $1 billion since 2011. Meanwhile, however, Colombian coffee seems to be taking advantage of the situation. Colombia's coffee output looks set to reach a 20-year high this year. 
Sugar industry experts say the toll on Brazilian sugar could lead to the first global sugar production deficit in years. Jonathan Drake, chief operating officer of RCMA Group Pte., a Singapore trading company, told Bloomberg Brazil’s sugar cane harvest could fall by around 10 percent in the year beginning April 1. Brazilian cane sugar industry group Unica also reported production fell by 29 percent in the second half of September in Brazil’s Center-South region, which produces about 90 percent of the country’s output. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's bureau in Brasilia also predicted Brazil would export 24 million tons of sugar from May 2014 to April 2015, a six-year low. 
The drop in supply might provide some eventual relief for global producers, who have faced depressed prices from years of oversupply of sugar. But in the meantime, Brazil’s sugar industry is still facing a host of problems. Sugar mills, facing both inflation and low prices, have been saddled with debt as they’ve sold sugar below production costs, and dozens of mills have shut down in the past year. Ethanol mills have been facing the same slump. A recent report by research firm Ricardo Pinto Associados said 30 sugar and ethanol production plants are on the verge of bankruptcy. "

57,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2014 10:48AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Privately, Saudis tell oil market- get used to lower prices","By Ron Bousso and Joshua Schneyer 
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is quietly telling the oil market it would be comfortable with much lower oil prices for an extended period, a sharp shift in policy that may be aimed at slowing the expansion of rival producers including those in the U.S. shale patch. 
Some OPEC members including Venezuela are clamoring for production cuts to push oil prices back up above $100 a barrel. 
But Saudi officials have given a different message in meetings with investors and analysts: the kingdom, OPEC's largest producer, will accept oil prices below $90 per barrel, and perhaps down to $80, for as long as a year or two, according to people who have been briefed on the recent conversations. 
The discussions, some in New York over the past week, offer the clearest sign yet that the kingdom is setting aside its longstanding de facto aim of holding prices at around $100 a barrel for Brent crude  in favor of retaining market share in years to come. 
The Saudis appear to be betting lower prices – which could strain the finances of some members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – will be necessary to pave the way for higher revenue in the medium term, by curbing new investment and further increases in supply from places like the U.S. shale patch or ultra-deepwater, according to the sources, who declined to be identified due to the private nature of the discussions. 
The conversations with Saudi officials did not offer any specific guidance on whether - or by how much - the kingdom might agree to cut output, a move many analysts are expecting in order to shore up a global market that is producing substantially more crude than it can consume. Saudi Arabia pumps around a third of OPEC's oil, or about 9.7 million barrels a day. 
Asked about coming Saudi output curbs, one Saudi official responded ""What cuts?"", according to one of the sources. 
Also uncertain is whether the Saudi briefings to oil market observers represent a new tack it is committed to, or a talking point meant to cajole other OPEC members to join Riyadh in eventually tightening the taps on supply. 
One source not directly involved in the discussions said the kingdom does not necessarily want prices to slide further, but is unwilling to shoulder production cuts unilaterally and is prepared to tolerate lower prices until others in OPEC commit to action. 
OPEC ANGST 
With most other members of the cartel unable or unwilling to reduce their own output, the group's next meeting on Nov. 27 is set to be its most difficult in years. OPEC has agreed to cut production only a handful of times in the past decade, most recently in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. 
On Friday, Venezuela - one of the cartel's most price-sensitive members - became the first to call openly for emergency action even earlier. Foreign Minister Rafael Ramirez said ""it doesn't suit anyone to have a price war, for the price to fall below $100 a barrel"". 
On Sunday, Ali al-Omair, oil minister of Saudi Arabia's core Gulf ally Kuwait, appeared to be the first to articulate the emerging view of OPEC's most influential member, saying output cuts would do little to prop up prices in the face of rising production from Russia and the United States. 
""I don't think today there is a chance that (OPEC) countries would reduce their production,"" state news agency KUNA quoted him as saying. 
Omair said that prices should stop falling at around $76 to $77 a barrel, citing production costs in places such as the United States, where a shale oil boom has unexpectedly reversed dwindling output and pushed production to its highest level since the 1980s. 
Saudi oil officials have made no public comments on the deepening swoon in markets. Senior officials did not reply to questions from Reuters about recent briefings. 
DON'T BE SURPRISED BELOW $90 
Global benchmark Brent  crude oil futures have fallen steadily for almost four months, dropping 23 percent from a June high of over $115 a barrel as fears of a Mideast supply disruption ebbed, U.S. shale production boomed and demand from Europe and China showed signs of flagging. [O/R] 
Brent fell below $88 a barrel on Monday, hitting its lowest in almost four years, after news of the Saudi and Kuwaiti statements. 
""In light of these comments, one should not expect any OPEC output cuts before the Nov. 27 meeting,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB in Oslo. 
An OPEC delegate from outside the core Gulf Arab group said he did not think OPEC would cut output at the November meeting but added he believed the Saudis should cut output unilaterally: 
""The question should be posed to Saudi Arabia"". 
The growing difference in opinions means OPEC is heading for its most tense meeting since mid-2011 when it failed to agree on an increase in output despite a loss of Libyan production. 
Until recently, Gulf OPEC members have been saying that the price dip was a temporary phenomenon, betting on seasonal demand in winter to prop up prices. But a growing number of oil analysts now see the latest slide as something more than a seasonal downswing; some say it is the start of a pivotal shift to a prolonged period of relative abundance. 
Rather than fight the decline in prices and cede market share in the face of growing competition, Saudi Arabia appears to be preparing traders for a sea change in prices. 
The Saudis want the world to know that ""nobody should be surprised"" with oil under $90 a barrel, according to one of the people. Another source suggested that $80 a barrel may now be an acceptable floor for the kingdom, although several other analysts said that figure seemed too low. Brent has averaged around $103 since 2010, trading mostly between $100 and $120. 
While the latest discussions are the bluntest efforts yet to signal the shift in Saudi strategy, early signs had already begun sending shivers through the oil market. In early October the kingdom cut its official selling prices more sharply than expected in a bid to maintain customers in Asia, widely seen as the opening shots in a price war for Asian customers. 
""Riyadh's political floor on oil prices is weakening,"" Robert McNally, a White House adviser to former President George W. Bush and president of the Rapidan Group energy consultancy, wrote in a note to clients following a trip to Saudi last month. 
McNally said he is not aware of any specific Saudi price or timing strategy, but told Reuters that Saudi Arabia ""will accept a price decline necessary to sweat whatever supply cuts are needed to balance the market out of the U.S. shale oil sector."" 
As that message began to dawn last week, the price rout quickened, with Brent lurching to its lowest level since 2010. 

""Until about three days ago the absolute and total consensus in the market was the Saudis would cut,"" said McNally. That is no longer a foregone conclusion, he said. ""The market suddenly realizes it is operating without a net.""

There will be no floor trading on the Comex on Monday because of the Columbus Day holiday in the U.S. All electronic transactions will be booked with Tuesday's trades for settlement.
Demand for safe haven assets remained underpinned after the International Monetary Fund last week cut its forecasts for global growth in 2014 and 2015 and warned that the recovery remains weak and uneven.
The organization is now forecasting global economic growth of 3.3% this year, down from 3.4% in July and expects growth of 3.8% in 2015, compared to an earlier prediction of 4.0%.
Sentiment was also hit by fears that Germany, the euro zone’s largest economy is being dragged into a recession after recent data indicated unexpected weakness in manufacturing and exports.
Meanwhile, gold traders continued to speculate over the timing of a rate hike in the U.S. after the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s September meeting released last week showed that some officials were concerned over the impact of the stronger dollar on global growth and the outlook for U.S. inflation.
The minutes prompted investors to trim back expectations for an earlier-than-expected hike in U.S. interest rates.

London-traded Brent futures hit $87.10 a barrel earlier, the weakest level since December 2010.
Oil prices sold off after Saudi Arabia privately told oil market participants that it is ready to accept oil prices below $90 per barrel, and perhaps down to $80, for an extended period.
The move may be aimed at slowing the expansion of rival producers in an effort to retain its market share across Asia and Europe.
Saudi Arabia is the largest exporter among OPEC members and produces approximately 10 million barrels of oil a day.
In addition, Kuwait's oil minister Ali al-Omair said OPEC is unlikely to cut output to support prices. Al-Omair was quoted as saying that a drop to the $76 to $77 a barrel range might be the level that would end the recent slide in prices.
London-traded Brent prices have fallen nearly 23% since June, when it climbed near $116 following violence in the Middle East and North Africa, while WTI futures are down almost 21% from a recent peak of $107.50 in June.
OPEC oil ministers are scheduled to meet in Vienna on November 27 to consider whether to adjust their production target of 30 million barrels per day for early 2015.
Global supplies have far outpaced demand in recent months, sparking speculation among traders about whether OPEC would lower production to keep prices high.
A report last week showed OPEC oil output hit a two-year high of 31 million barrels per day in September, led by higher output from Iraq and Libya.
Some market analysts believe that only a cut in output by the oil cartel will halt the decline in prices.
Investor sentiment was also hit amid concerns over the global economic outlook.
The International Monetary Fund cut its global economic growth forecasts for the third time this year last week and warned that the recovery remains weak and uneven.

Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $83.33 a barrel, the low from July 3, 2012, and resistance at $91.79 a barrel, last Friday's high.
A stronger dollar coupled with concerns that slumping European and Asian economies will cut demand for crude has sent the commodity plummeting by around 18% since July, though by Friday after a rough week, oil prices rose on demand from bottom fishers.
Still, gains were cautious, as concerns persist that a stronger dollar, slumping demand outside of the U.S. and an abundance of global supply will spell further losses for crude down the road.

Three lawsuits filed on Friday from Sioux City, Iowa, Omaha, Nebraska and Springfield, Illinois allege that Syngenta “destroyed the export of U.S. corn to China and caused depressed prices for all domestic corn,” according to according to Courthouse News Service.
The product in question, Agrisure Viptera, also known as MIR162, is a corn seed that’s modified to protect against insects such as the corn borer and corn rootworm, which have evolved over the past few years to resist ordinary fertilizers. Syngenta released an original version in 2009 and another version this year.  

While it was approved for production in the United States, Chinese regulators have yet to give it the green light, and have rejected more than 2,000 tons of corn imports this year.
The National Grain and Feed Association said earlier this year that American corn exports to China were just 171,000 tons between January and April, down 85 percent since the same period a year earlier.

In addition, the U.S. unemployment rate ticked down to 5.9% last month from 6.1% in August.
Analysts had expected the rate to remain unchanged, and the numbers boosted the dollar by cementing expectations for the Federal Reserve to close its monthly bond-buying program later this month and begin hiking interest rates in 2015, which sent oil prices heading south.

123,By International Business Times,"<span>Oct 02, 2014 02:45PM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices Hit 2-Year Low,"By Maria Gallucci - Crude oil prices slipped to a 27-month low Thursday, spurred by sudden price cuts from Saudi Arabia, the top oil producer. The dip follows months of declining prices caused by weaker-than-expected growth in China and Europe and a surge in U.S. supplies, according to energy analysts.
Brent crude, the main international benchmark, was down 2 percent and trading around $92 a barrel on Thursday morning. West Texas Intermediate, the American index, was around $88.60 a barrel -- dropping below $90 for the first time since April 2013, the New York Times reported.

State-owned Saudi Aramco had announced Wednesday that it was slashing prices for Asian and U.S. buyers to expand its market share. Observers expected Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would instead reduce their output, which would help shore up global crude prices. The move has market watchers nervous that Saudi Arabia could cut its competitors out of the market, Michael Loewen, a commodities analyst at TD Securities in Toronto, said in an interview.
The Saudi news is just one of several recent developments that explain the lower crude prices, Loewen said. Earlier this week, a slew of reports showed disappointing growth in the U.S. and Chinese manufacturing sectors, a trend that could curb demand for shipments of crude oil. A Consumer Board index found that American consumers are less confident in the economy than they were in recent months, which could slow down spending and overall growth.
“A lot of people were banking on the big recovery in the U.S. economy this quarter and next” to lift crude prices, Loewen said. “The numbers are so far not going in that direction.”
That could exacerbate the effects of falling demand from Europe, which is grappling with economic stagnation and deflation, and from China, where gross domestic product forecasts have steadily declined.
In September, the International Energy Agency (IEA) slashed its forecasts for global oil demand growth for the third month in a row, calling the slowdown “nothing short of remarkable.” The Paris-based watchdog now expects oil demand to grow by 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) for all of 2014 -- the slowest rate since 2011, according to its latest report. For 2015, it reduced its estimates slightly to 1.2 million bpd.
At the same time, the world is producing more oil than it needs, further depressing oil prices.
Much of the global crude glut is driven by the U.S. shale drilling boom. American production reached around 8.5 million bpd in August -- a nearly three-decade high, the IEA reported this week.
The dramatic increase is weighing down domestic prices, but it’s also affecting the international market. The U.S. is importing less crude from other nations now, with imports likely to account for just one-fourth of U.S. petroleum consumption this year, down from 45 percent in 2011, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said.
On top of that, Canada is importing more U.S. oil, meaning that tankers carrying North and West African crude are now struggling to find buyers. That’s forced some companies to sell oil at a discount to Asian refineries, the Wall Street Journal reported this week.
More crude is also coming out of Libya after the government reclaimed two oil export terminals from rebel groups in early July. Since then, Libyan oil production has shot up from 200,000 bpd to 900,000 bpd in the span of just six weeks, Loewen said.
In Iraq, Russia and other conflict-torn countries, oil production has held steady, despite initial speculation about possible supply disruptions.
Cheaper crude oil isn’t likely to batter the economies of Russia and most of the Middle East, Andrew Kenningham, a senior global economist at Capital Economics, said in a recent report cited by Bloomberg News. However, emerging economies such as Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela could be hit harder “primarily because they have not been saving much of their oil windfalls,” he said.
Loewen said that if prices continue to dip, some smaller U.S. drillers could be forced to postpone exploration and production. “Right now, you’re getting to that point where it’s not as economically feasible to keep drilling in certain basins,” he said.
Globally, prices could rise if the U.S., Chinese or European economies picked up and regained their thirst for petroleum production. Renewed strife in Libya or an escalation of violence in Iraq would eat into the supply glut. Still, for oil prices to fully rebound, “you need a supply response from OPEC,” Loewen said. He added that the production cut of 500,000 bpd that Venezuela and other members are proposing likely won’t be steep enough to close the supply-demand imbalance. “That’s not going to cut it; you’d need quite a bit more,” he said.

Cooler temperatures are expected across a good portion of the central and eastern U.S. in the coming days, though concerns mercury readings may be milder than once thought sent natural gas prices falling.
""Several weather systems will sweep across the north-central U.S. over the coming week while drawing cooler Canadian air into the central and eastern U.S. This will increase early season heating demand as overnight lows drop into the 30s and 40s,"" Natgasweather.com reported in its midday update for Wednesday.
""The Northeast will see cooler conditions as well, although coastal cities will often remain just ahead of these weather systems where warmer temperatures will be observed, limiting the amount heating demand needed compared to if the cold fronts were able to push just another 50-100 miles toward the coast.""
Supplies remained in focus as well.

A strong U.S. nonfarm payrolls report was likely to add to speculation about when the Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates, while a weak number could boost gold by undermining the argument for an early rate hike.
Expectations that the Fed is growing closer to raising interest rates have boosted the dollar against the euro and the yen in recent months, as the European and Japanese central banks look likely to stick to a looser monetary policy stance.
The Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, traded at 86.10, not far from the previous session's four-year high of 86.33.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Gold futures sank 6.1% last month, while silver prices tumbled 13% amid speculation that the Fed could raise interests sooner and faster than previously expected.
Gold and silver cost money to store and struggles to compete yield-bearing assets when interest rates are on the rise.

China is the world's largest copper consumer, accounting for nearly 40% of global demand.
The industrial metal lost 4.8% in September amid indications China's economy is losing momentum and as a broadly stronger U.S. dollar dampened the appeal of dollar-denominated commodities.

A day earlier, U.S. oil prices plunged $3.41. Futures were likely to find support at $90.58 a barrel, the low from September 23, and resistance at $94.90 a barrel, the high from September 30.
Wednesday’s government report was expected to show that U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose by 0.7 million barrels last week, while gasoline stockpiles were forecast to decrease by 0.8 million barrels.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said that U.S. crude inventories fell by 464,000 barrels in the week ended September 26, compared to expectations for an increase of 0.9 million barrels.
The report also showed that gasoline stockpiles decreased by 2.5 million barrels, while distillate stocks fell by 1.8 million barrels.
Market players also looked ahead to the release of key U.S. data later in the session for further indications on the strength of the economy and the future path of monetary policy.
Later in the day, the U.S. was to release the ADP report on private sector job creation, as well as a report by the Institute of Supply Management on manufacturing activity.
Meanwhile, investors awaited the release of the latest U.S. employment report, due for release on Friday, for further indications on the strength of the recovery in the labor market, a key factor in deciding the future path of monetary policy.
Expectations that the Federal Reserve is growing closer to raising interest rates have boosted the dollar against the euro and the yen.
The Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, traded at 86.18, not far from the previous session's four-year high of 86.33.
Oil prices typically weaken when the U.S. currency strengthens as the dollar-priced commodity becomes more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for November delivery inched up 18 cents to hit $94.86 a barrel during European morning trade.
London-traded Brent prices hit $94.24 on Tuesday, a level not seen since June 2012 as global supplies were seen as ample despite ongoing violence in North Africa and the Middle East.

147,By International Business Times,"<span>Oct 01, 2014 02:45AM ET</span>","US, Brazil To Resolve Trade Dispute Over Cotton Subsidies","By Sneha Shankar - The U.S. and Brazil have settled a long-standing trade dispute regarding subsidies that Washington provided to American cotton growers, Associated Press, or AP, reported, citing a source. The dispute has colored relationships between the two countries since 2002.
The official said, according to AP, that though the deal has not been officially announced by the two countries, the new agreement, which is to be signed Wednesday, is expected to allow Washington to fully implement the farm bill, which was approved by Congress in February. The new agreement also includes a new insurance program for cotton growers, which was put in place to adhere to new rules of the World Trade Organization, or WTO. Brazil will also not challenge the support promised to American cotton farmers by the farm bill, AP reported.
In 2002, Brazil had filed a complaint in the WTO against the U.S. stating that the trade subsidies the American government provided its cotton growers were disrupting trade and was a violation of global trade rules, according to Bloomberg. Brazil won the case and the WTO allowed Brazil to seek $830 million in penalties from the U.S., which instead agreed to pay Brazil’s cotton industry $147 million in annual aid. According to AP, the U.S. agreed to make a final one-time payment of $300 million to the Brazil Cotton Institute.
When the annual aid was stopped in October 2013, to pave way for federal budget cuts, Brazil threatened higher tariffs on American products. However, the new farm bill includes modified cotton programs to help assuage Brazil’s concerns, Bloomberg reported.

Relations between Brazil and the U.S. were further strained after revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden showed that the National Security Agency had spied on Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff had demanded an apology from the U.S., which said that it regretted the incident but did not issue a formal apology, according to Reuters.
The deal, to be signed Wednesday by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, and their Brazilian counterparts, according to AP, comes just days ahead of elections in Brazil."

150,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 30, 2014 05:00PM ET</span>",Oil Prices Tumble On High Dollar,"By Meagan Clark - Oil prices tumbled by about 3 percent Tuesday after reports that OPEC production is surging higher than expected, slow manufacturing growth in China and Japan and the EU is dampening demand for oil, and traders are pulling out of contracts at the end of the quarter as the dollar reaches multiyear highs.
Brent crude prices, the benchmark international price, fell about 2.5 percent from $94.74 per barrel Tuesday morning to $94.24 midmorning before inching back up to $94.67 by midafternoon. Last week, Brent crude prices both rose and fell, but the trend has been downward for three months, falling 16 percent. U.S. oil prices slid the most in 17 months on Tuesday, by nearly 4 percent to $91.27 midafternoon. West Texas Intermediate crude has lost 13 percent this quarter, the most since June 2012.
The oil supply of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which supplies a third of the world’s oil, rose to its highest in nearly two years this month, a Reuters survey found, as Saudi Arabia and especially Libya have increased production by 810,000 barrels per day. Libya increased production by 280,000 barrels a day, followed by Saudi Arabia, Angola, Nigeria and even Iraq, despite fighting in Iraq and Libya that threatens oil supplies and transport.

Manufacturing indices published this week showed factory activity expanded at a slow pace in China and Japan and slowed down in the EU in September.
And at the end of each three-month quarter, it’s common for hedge funds to pull money out of the market. This quarter in particular, traders are pulling out because the dollar is at four-year highs against foreign currencies. A high dollar weighs down crude prices because oil is measured worldwide in dollars, and when the dollar strengthens, oil becomes more expensive for buyers using foreign currencies, suppressing demand.

152,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 30, 2014 03:31PM ET</span>",These Are The 4 LNG Export Terminals That Have Won US Approval,"By Maria Gallucci - U.S. energy regulators this week signed off on a fourth facility to export America’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies. The approval to build the Maryland facility comes amid growing pressure from natural gas proponents to expedite the shipment of LNG abroad -- a move they say will help to squeeze even more profits from the U.S. drilling boom and alleviate Europe’s tenuous dependence on Russian gas.
So far, only one LNG export facility is in operation in the country: ConocoPhillips’ Kenai LNG Terminal near Anchorage, Alaska, which ships fuel mainly to Japan. LNG is made by cooling natural gas until it becomes a clear, colorless liquid. In that form, the fuel takes up much less space than traditional natural gas and is therefore easier to transport and store.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) says at least 14 export terminals have been proposed along the U.S. Gulf Coast, the East Coast and in the Pacific Northwest. Of those, FERC has approved four projects for siting, construction and operation. They include:
1. Cove Point LNG,  Maryland -- Dominion Resources Inc. 

FERC gave the go-ahead Monday after more than two years of analysis. When built, the $3.8 billion facility will be able to export up to 1.8 billion cubic feet natural gas per day. Dominion expects to have it up and running by June 2017.
“Now that our nation is developing a burgeoning surplus of natural gas, Cove Point can help send a small portion … to allied nations looking for stable supplies of clean energy,” Diane Leopold, president of Dominion’s natural gas subsidiary, Dominion Energy Solutions, said in a Monday news release.
Environmental groups and local activists have long opposed Dominion’s efforts to build the LNG export facility on its existing Cove Point site. “Exporting LNG will mean more drilling and fracking, and that means more climate pollution, more risk of contaminated groundwater, and more threats to the health of people who live near gas wells,” Deb Nardone, who directs the Sierra Club’s Beyond National Gas Campaign, said in a statement.
2. Sabine Pass Liquefaction, Louisiana -- Cheniere Energy Inc 

Regulators approved this $10 billion plant in Cameron Parish in 2012, making it the first project to win approval outside of Alaska. The export facility, which is already under construction, will be built next to an existing gas-import terminal that’s connected to major shale oil and gas developments in Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas.
Houston-based Cheniere Energy expects the project will come online in late 2015. It will be able to export 2.8 billion cubic feet of LNG per day, much of which will go to customers based in London, Barcelona, India and South Korea. Cheniere is planning a second export facility near Corpus Christi, Texas, that could begin operating as early as 2017, according to the company.
3. Cameron Liquefaction Project, Louisiana -- Cameron LNG
 
In June, FERC authorized construction on a $10 billion liquefaction and export project in Hackberry, a tiny community in Cameron Parish near the Sabine Pass project. The complex would include three LNG “trains,” or facilities to liquefy and purify natural gas, that would be capable of exporting around 1.7 billion cubic feet of LNG per day. Construction is slated to start in 2014, and the Cameron project could be fully operational by 2019, according to Cameron LNG, a subsidiary of San Diego-based Sempra Energy.
4. Freeport Liquefaction & Export Project, Texas -- Freeport LNG Development LP 

This $11 billion project, which got FERC’s approval in late July, would be built alongside an existing LNG import terminal on Quintana Island, on the Texas Gulf Coast. Construction on the first two liquefaction trains could begin in 2015, and LNG shipments -- most likely to Asian buyers -- could begin in four years.
Oil giant ConocoPhillips, which owns the Alaska terminal, is a major investor in the Freeport project.

154,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 30, 2014 02:15PM ET</span>",Can Afghanistan’s Minerals Save Its Economy? ,"By Kathleen Caulderwood - As a Western-educated former World Bank economist, Afghanistan's new president was elected partly on the hope that he can help resurrect the war-torn country's feeble economy. But on the day Ashraf Ghani was sworn into office, the country's first democratic transition, a suicide bomber killed seven people at a security checkpoint near Kabul, with the Taliban claiming responsibility, reinforcing the security challenges he faces that impede economic development.  
Ghani has brought the issue to the forefront, promoting the country's vast natural resources as the key to development. But in order to attract investors, experts say he'll need to make some big changes. 
“It is hard to overstate the importance of fighting corruption. Far from being just a moral or legal issue, better governance is absolutely central to the efforts both to boost the economy and to create a lasting stability in Afghanistan,” notes Jodi Vittori, Afghanistan adviser at Global Witness, an NGO that investigates economic networks behind conflict, corruption and environmental destruction.
Afghanistan is currently tied with Somalia and North Korea as the most corrupt country in the world, according to Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.
“Such high levels of corruption like those assessed to be in Afghanistan literally clog the wheels of the entire legitimate economy,” Vittori said.
The problems were evident during the election itself. Ghani’s inauguration comes after five months of increasing tensions that worried international observers and investors. About 60 percent of the country’s national budget is funded by the U.S. and other donors, according to Bloomberg. Last year the government raised $2 billion in revenues, less than a third of what it needs.
“The election dispute paralyzed Afghanistan’s economy as investors hesitated to enter the market,” reads a note from the Soufan Group, a consultancy firm. “The accession of the new leaders could encourage donors to cover the deficit and would likely revive the Afghan economy at least in the short term,” it says.
For example, a billion-dollar agreement between the Afghan government and China’s biggest mining company to develop a massive copper mine has been put on hold amid growing security concerns.
On Tuesday, Afghanistan and the United States signed the Bilateral Security Agreement, which will allow some American troops to stay in the country after this year, in part to train local troops to combat Taliban forces. It’s meant to bring stability after five months of political tensions that may help fix the problem with investor confidence.
“From an economic perspective, the BSA will help Afghanistan attract aid and financial cooperation,” government employee Abdul Wahid Frogh, told the Washington Post. “As well, the BSA assures Afghan people that the international community will not let us go forward on our own, and this assurance will lead to an economic boom.”
In theory, Afghanistan’s new government should be able to leverage its massive mineral reserves -- worth an estimated $3 trillion according to the World Bank -- to pull up the economy.
“The rich mineral resources in Afghanistan can transform the country into an industrial nation,”

Ghani said after being sworn in Monday in Kabul. “We broadly depend on imports and foreign assistance, and we aim to create a sound economic system for the country to stimulate exports and develop economy.”
If all goes well, a thriving extractives industry could provide steady jobs, foreign investment and create a middle class of skilled workers. But it isn’t that simple.
“A reliance on natural resources in the absence of strong governance, especially in fragile states with weak institutions, can in fact do far more harm than good,” Vittori said.
Afghanistan has already experienced resource-fueled conflict. This summer, the United Nations reported that illegal marble mining was the second-largest source of Taliban financing in Helmand province, where the group runs 25 to 30 illegal quarries.  Integrity Watch Afghanistan has found that chromite mines in Kunar province are financing local insurgents.
“Natural resources will be especially important to sustainable economic development over the long term, and improving transparency and governance in that sector will be especially crucial,” Vittori said.
But even if the new president follows through on his plans, the process isn’t going to be quick. Afghanistan will be dependent on foreign aid for some time, even with drastic changes.
“Despite economic development initiatives, Afghanistan will remain dependent on foreign aid for many years,” reads a July report from the Congressional Research Service.
Between 2001 and 2013, the United States contributed $93 billion in assistance to Afghanistan, according to the report, with another $6.1 billion this year and $4.5 billion proposed for next year, not including the costs of military operations.

Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB)., the world’s biggest oilfield services provider, said it will withdraw workers who are citizens of the United States and European Union, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday.
The Texas-based company will pull out about 20 mid-level and senior managers, according to two people who asked not to be identified, Bloomberg said. The news comes a day after U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) said it is withdrawing from a joint project with Russia’s state-owned Rosneft (MCX:ROSN) for offshore Arctic drilling because of the sanctions.
Exploration and production companies were expected to spend nearly $52 billion in Russia this year, according to estimates from Barclays PLC and cited by Bloomberg. A large chunk of that money goes to Schlumberger and other service and equipment companies.
The U.S. and EU first targeted Russia’s energy sector in July by banning Western companies from exporting advanced oil technologies to Russia. The country relies heavily on Western aid and expertise to carry out projects in two of its prized sectors: deep-water and Arctic drilling, and shale gas exploration. The sanctions ramped up in August, prohibiting American and European energy companies from working with Russia on future oil and gas developments.
Last month, Schlumberger became the first U.S. energy firm to say that its quarterly earnings will be negatively impacted by the sanctions, Reuters noted.

Schlumberger develops and provides technology for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which involves blasting open shale rock with a mix of water, chemicals and sand to free up oil and gas deposits. Russia relies on fracking for about one-quarter of its oil production, and replacing technology developed by Schlumberger and firms like Halliburton Co. requires “colossal funds,” said Vagit Alekperov, chief executive of Russia’s OAO Lukoil, Bloomberg reported.
Schlumberger gets about 5 percent of its annual revenue from Russia, which amounts to about $2.2 billion, Reuters reported.

US production of liquid petroleum was 11.5 million barrels per day in August, compared to Saudi Arabia's 11.6 million barrels, according to August data from the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Given the rising output of oil and related liquids such as ethane and propane in the country, the US is set to overtake the Middle East country in September or November for the first time since 1991.
Crude oil production in the US is still lagging behind Saudi Arabia's 9.7 million barrels per day in August. Russia is No 1 with 10.1 million barrels per day in the month.
However, the country is expected to catch up with both Saudi Arabia and Russia on crudeproduction by the end of the decade. Hydraulic fracturing or fracking has been changing the world energy map. The US has been the first country to take advantage of the technology and start commercial production of shale gas and oil.
As a result, its production skyrocketed, and it currently accounts for more than 10% of total worldproduction. In 2012, the US became a net exporter of liquefied petroleum gases for the first time.

Saudi Arabia is currently the largest exporter of petroleum liquids in the world and is home to the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, representing 16% of the world's total.

167,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 29, 2014 04:30PM ET</span>",Oil-By-Rail To Spur Major Traffic Jams,"By Maria Gallucci - Life is slowing down in Bozeman, a small city in southern Montana near a major railroad. More shipments of Bakken Shale oil and local coal are passing through, and it’s taking drivers more time to cross the tracks and get around town. Fire trucks, ambulances and police cars have to wait while carload after carload chugs along. “It takes longer for those public safety services to get to us,” says Beth Kaeding, a Bozeman resident and conservationist.
The U.S. shale boom and a rise in coal exports is having a similar effect nationwide, according to a federal transportation report released late last week. If freight flows continue to rise as expected, it could “exacerbate congestion issues” and raise new safety concerns in communities near train tracks, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), an independent agency, said in its investigation.
The report cited a recent incident in Baker, Montana -- about a five-hour drive from Bozeman -- where a fire destroyed a house. Train traffic blocked the town’s two railroad crossings, preventing fire crews from responding in time, it said.
The GAO examined the Department of Transportation’s ongoing to work to establish train safety provisions in the wake of recent derailments and several serious oil accidents, including a deadly explosion in Lac-Megantic, Quebec. The investigators found that officials’ efforts “do not fully consider freight-related traffic congestion,” and that they have failed so far to “fully establish the federal role or identify goals, objectives or performance measures in this area.”
Such omissions could undermine the usefulness of the department’s National Freight Strategic Plan, the GAO said in its Sept. 26 report. The agency conducted the study at the request of Max Baucus, a former Democratic senator from Montana and the U.S. Ambassador to China.  
Oil companies are increasingly turning to railroads because of a lack of existing pipeline infrastructure that could move their crude and refined products to market. About 415,000 railcar-loads of crude oil moved through the United States last year, compared to just 9,500 loads in 2008, according to federal figures.
In North Dakota alone, as much as 70 percent of the more than 1 million barrels of crude oil produced in the Bakken Shale was shipped by rail in the first half of 2014, the North Dakota Pipeline Authority has estimated.
U.S. coal exports are also picking up as domestic demand for coal continues to fall, the GAO noted. Mining companies are shipping more of the fossil fuel to energy-hungry countries like China via ports on the Pacific Coast. Canada already has coal export terminals, and coal companies are proposing two terminals in Washington State and one in Oregon.
In the Pacific Northwest, the congestion is making it harder for agricultural producers and other suppliers to ship their goods via rail. Last month, the operator of a refrigerated rail service, Cold Train, said it was suspending service at a Washington port due to long delays on rail lines and a near-doubling of transit times, in part because of Bakken crude shipments. The service would have guaranteed to deliver Washington’s apples, cherries and potatoes to Midwest markets within three days, according to the company.
Rail congestion “is no longer an abstract concern,” Ross Macfarlane, who manages the business partnership program at Climate Solutions in Seattle, said in an interview. “It’s happening now, and at a much smaller volume than what’s forecast for if the coal terminals … are constructed, and if there’s a continued build-out of oil-by-rail capacity.”
A spokesperson for BNSF Railway, which operates one of the largest freight networks in North America, referred a request for comment to the Association of American Railroads. The industry group’s spokesperson was not available by deadline.
The GAO report found that local communities are largely on their own if they want to increase the number of rail crossings, improve traffic signals or take other measures to alleviate the train traffic and reduce the risks of accidents and derailments. Funding is limited in state and local agencies, and private railroad companies aren’t required to pitch in.

The agency studied two dozen congestion-related improvement projects in communities around the country. It found that private funding contributed to just 1 percent of the $3.2 billion in total expenses. “Railroad companies’ contributions to congestion mitigation projects generally amounted to less than 5 percent of the project’s total cost and were based on the project’s potential operational benefits to the railroad,” according to the report.
The report “clearly shows that there are a lack of resources and ways for communities to get help with the infrastructure needs they have now, and are going to have even more of,” said Kaeding, who is also a member and former chairwoman of the Northern Plains Resource Council, an environmental organization.
“We need to have a better overall view of what’s going on with our rail infrastructure, and these companies need to help in a better way to pay for what has to be done and ease the burden off the taxpayers,” she added.

Since then, suppliers have been rapidly rebuilding storage levels amid a boom in domestic shale gas production.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its report last week that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 97 billion cubic feet in the week ended Sept. 19, up from 90 billion in the previous week and ahead of expectations of 93 billion cubic feet.

174,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 29, 2014 09:45AM ET</span>",Shale Oil Firm To Double US Exports In 2015,"By Maria Gallucci - U.S. exports of condensate are ramping up with the nationwide shale drilling boom. Pioneer Natural Resources says it expects to double its shipments of the ultra-light oil to 50,000 barrels per day next year, Reuters reported Monday.
Pioneer is one of only two Texas oil companies allowed to sell condensate abroad after the U.S. Commerce Department eased a 40-year ban on oil exports in June. The company processes condensate at its Eagle Ford shale site in Texas; it then sells the oil to Enterprise Product Partners, which markets the oil to foreign buyers, according to Reuters.
“We operate 50,000 bpd [barrels per day] and we’re selling probably about 20-25,000 bpd, but eventually we’ll get up to 50,000 bpd” in 2015, Scott Sheffield, Pioneer’s chief executive, told the news agency. He said two cargo ships had already delivered condensate to South Korea and Europe, while a third cargo was on its way to Singapore.
U.S. energy companies have been pushing the federal government to end to export ban amid the recent surge in domestic oil and gas production from shale formations. The hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, process has enabled drilling in otherwise un-tappable areas, and in many places local refineries are struggling to keep up with the processing demands of so much crude oil.
U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said earlier this year that the oil industry hasn’t yet made a convincing argument of why the government should lift the ban, which former President Gerald Ford enacted in 1975 following the Arab oil embargo crisis. But for some oil producers, the allowing of Pioneer and Enterprise to export condensate is a positive signal, the Wall Street Journal previously reported.

Pioneer’s Sheffield said that another 20 to 25 condensate producers are seeking similar exporting permits, Reuters noted. He said he expects the Commerce Department will grant many of those following the U.S. midterm elections in November.
“So we’ll see a lot more exports of condensate starting maybe late this year, early next year,” Sheffield told Reuters. Condensate production in the Eagle Ford basin where Pioneer operates is about 600,000 barrels per day.

190,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2014 01:54PM ET</span>",One of the girls abducted by Boko Haram in Nigeria's Chibok freed -police,"By Tim Cocks 
ABUJA (Reuters) - One of more than 200 schoolgirls abducted by Islamist Boko Haram rebels in the northeastern Nigerian village of Chibok was freed this week, police and a parent of some of the other missing girls said on Thursday. 
Boko Haram militants took the girls from a secondary school in the village near the Cameroon border in April, sparking a worldwide outcry, and have remained in captivity ever since. 
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has been pilloried at home and abroad for his slow response to the kidnapping and for his inability to quell the violence by the Islamist militants, seen as the biggest security threat to Africa's top economy. 
""She was found running in a village. She was in the bush for about four days. She's still receiving medical attention,"" said a parent, who has two girls still with the insurgents and who declined to be named. 
He added that she was now in the northeastern city of Yola. 
Police spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu told reporters in Abuja that the 20-year-old woman was discovered on Wednesday, saying she had been ""dropped off by suspected Boko Haram militants"" at Mubi in Adamawa state, some 100 km (60 miles) from Chibok. 
""Her condition is stable,"" he said, without explaining why she might have been released. 
The Islamists offered last May a prisoner swap to release the girls, but the proposal was rejected by the government. 
A military operation in the northeast has so far failed to quell the rebellion and has triggered reprisal attacks that are increasingly targeting civilians, after they formed vigilante groups to try to help the government flush out the militants. 
Boko Haram militants on motorcycles killed at least 18 people in an attack on the northeast Nigerian town of Shaffa late on Wednesday, witnesses said on Thursday. 
The attack late on Wednesday left bodies in the street, witness Amos Mshelia, who escaped by running into the surrounding bush and on to the nearby town of Biu, told Reuters by telephone. 
""People ran out of their houses in fear, but unknown to many of us the insurgents were nearby and they were pursuing people, shooting as we were fleeing,"" he said. 
Boko Haram has seized several towns in the last two months, although the military said on Wednesday it had pushed them back and that 135 fighters had surrendered this week. 
It also said Nigerian troops had killed a man posing as Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau in several videos, including one in which he threatened to sell the girls into slavery. The military said last year that Shekau himself might have been killed. 

Boko Haram gunmen carried away some 270 girls and women, aged from 13 to over 20, when they raided the Chibok school. More than 50 eventually escaped, but at least 200 remain in captivity, as do scores of other girls kidnapped previously.

BENGHAZI Libya (Reuters) - A war plane attacked a port in Benghazi on Wednesday in a strike claimed by forces loyal to former general Khalifa Haftar, bringing their battle against Islamists to the heart of the eastern Libyan city. 
A Reuters reporter near the port, which is not an oil installation, saw a warplane open fire several times, although it was unclear whether any harbor facilities were hit. 
The port is the main gateway for wheat and fuel imports into eastern Libya, a country struggling with anarchy three years after the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi. 
Saqer al-Jouroushi, head of Haftar's air defense unit, has said an umbrella group of Islamist fighters, Majlis al-Shura, was using the port to bring in supplies and weapons. 
""We warned the port manager that we will not allow ships to dock to supply Majlis al-Shura with weapons,"" said Jouroushi, whose unit controls several planes from Libya's air force. 
He said the plane had deliberately missed the quay and had been issuing a final warning, but added that it would hit next time if another ship tried to offload weapons. Clashes in Benghazi have so far been mainly limited to the suburbs. 
""We are in a state of war and Ansar al-Sharia and its allies are using the port to ship in arms against out troops,"" he said, referring to an Islamist group blamed by Washington for an attack on the U.S. consulate in the city in 2012, during which the U.S. ambassador to Libya was killed. 
Three years after Gaddafi died during an uprising against his rule, Libya is divided. The government and elected parliament have relocated to Tobruk in the far east since losing control of the capital, Tripoli, where a rival government has been created by forces from the western city of Misrata. 
Haftar has emerged as a renegade commander fighting Islamists and has recently entered into a frail alliance with the government in Tobruk. 
Libya depends on foreign imports of food and consumer goods as the desert country does not have any large industry outside the key oil sector. However, shippers have become more reluctant to deal with Libya, some traders have said, and the attack on Benghazi port is only likely to heighten their concerns.

Still, oil futures met the news with muted applause on concerns that despite a more upbeat U.S. recovery, the global economy remains sluggish at a time when oil supplies are ample.
Furthermore, Iraq and Nigeria are reportedly stepping up exports, adding more oil to the market, while output at Libya has rebounded as well.

In addition, Iraq and Nigeria were said to be stepping up exports, adding more oil to the market, while output at Libya has rebounded.
Concerns over the outlook for growth in the euro zone also weighed, after data on Tuesday showed that the bloc's composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors slumped to a nine month low of 52.3 from 52.5 in August.
The bloc’s services PMI slid to a three month low of 52.8 from 53.1 last month, while the manufacturing index ticked down to a 14-month low of 50.5 from 50.7.

204,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 23, 2014 07:30PM ET</span>",Critics Say Europe Isn’t Doing Enough About Conflict Minerals,"By Kathleen Caulderwood - Critics are calling on European policymakers to impose harsher rules to limit the import of conflict minerals, using their American counterparts as an example. “There’s good reason to believe European companies are profiting from mineral trades that are filling the pockets of abusive armed groups in resource-rich countries like Congo and Colombia,” Audrey Gaughran, Amnesty International’s Director for Global Issues, said in a Tuesday statement.
“The EU needs to come up with a meaningful law that effectively tackles the link between European trade and violent human rights abuses overseas,” she said.
Currently, there is no legislation that prohibits the import of conflict minerals in Europe. In March this year, the European Commission announced a proposal “setting up an E.U. system of self-certification for importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten, their ores, and gold originating in conflict-affected and high-risk areas.”
The new rules would require that any company choosing to comply with OECD due diligence requirements will be added to a “responsible smelters and refiners list” which, in theory, will help purchasers find reputable agents to work with.
“Studies show companies simply don’t check their supply chains, unless they are required to,” said Michael Gibb of Global Witness, a London-based organization that investigates economic networks behind conflict, in a statement. “Putting it starkly, this legislation will not meaningfully reduce the trade in conflict minerals.”
The United States government defines “conflict minerals” as any mineral containing tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold that originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. The OECD’s definition includes the same four types, but isn’t geographically specific.

Under section 1502 of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, any company listed on an American stock exchange must investigate its supply chains and publish an annual report, audited by another party, that outlines exactly how it ensures that their materials are conflict-free.
Earlier this year, U.S. companies were scrambling to comply with an even more stringent set of regulations, and European activists hope their governments will follow suit.
Global Witness and Amnesty International are asking authorities to make the rules mandatory instead of voluntary, and expand the scope beyond importers to consumer goods companies that import products such as laptops or mobile phones which could contain the minerals. According to a report that activists released on Tuesday, more than a quarter of all global trade in tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold ores goes through the European Union.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $3.864 per million British thermal units, Monday's low, and resistance at $3.958, the session high.
A blast of cool air sweeping in from Canada might not dip as far south as markets have been expecting, which sent natural gas prices falling on expectations for power thermal plants to burn less of the commodity due to mild mercury readings.
""Every day the weather models hold off bringing cold northern Canadian air toward the U.S., is another day the markets have to find lower prices. We continue to see it this way as the latest weather data holds on to very comfortable temperatures over much of the U.S. for the next two weeks, apart from a few weather systems affecting the western U.S.,"" Natgasweather.com reported in its midday update for Tuesday.
""Overall, most US regions will see highs of 70s and 80s well into the first week of October.

Still, futures dipped into negative territory at times due to uncertainty as how mild temperatures elsewhere may cut into demand for both heating and air conditioning.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in November were up 0.28% at $3.914 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading. The commodity hit a session low of $3.865, and a high of $3.939.
The November contract settled down 1.81% on Friday to end at $3.903 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $3.786 per million British thermal units, the low from Sept. 12, and resistance at $4.100, last Wednesday's high.
After brief cool snap for the Midwest and Northeast, comfortable temperatures will head northward beginning Wednesday, though pockets of warmer air elsewhere may drive demand for air conditioning.
""This will set up almost the entire U.S. with daytime highs reaching the 70s and 80s into next week, with the hottest conditions over the southern U.S. where light cooling demand will be needed,"" Natgasweather.com reported in its Monday midday update.
Uncertainty typical of this time of year prevented prices from rallying.
""We continue to watch closely the strengthening cold pool over northern Canada for signs of it advancing toward the U.S. This likely won't happen until after October 5th, at the earliest. The northern U.S. will see weather systems track across, especially as October begins, but they should fail to tap into the significantly cold northern Canadian air,"" Natgasweather.com added.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report on Sept. 18 that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 90 billion cubic feet last week.
Inventories rose by 64 billion cubic feet in the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average change is a build of 60 billion cubic feet.
Injections of gas into storage have surpassed the five-year average for 22 consecutive weeks, alleviating concerns over tightening supplies.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.891 trillion cubic feet as of last week, narrowing the deficit to the five-year average to 13.3% from 14.2% a week earlier and down from a record 54.7% at the end of March.

219,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 22, 2014 02:30PM ET</span>",Pledges To Divest From Fossil Fuels Are Pocket Change To Oil And Gas Industry,"By Meagan Clark - The decision on Monday by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which controls $860 million in assets and is presided over by heirs of famed oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, to sell its assets tied to fossil fuel companies and to invest in clean energy alternatives made plenty of headlines but will hardly hurt the industry's bottom line.
Fifty foundations in total have shown enthusiasm for the global fossil-fuel divestment movement ahead of a climate change summit at the United Nations Tuesday and after a climate change march in New York that drew about 600,000 activists.  Fossil fuel companies will soon watch $50 billion in assets change hands as philanthropies, institutions, local governments and individuals follow through on pledges to divest from oil and gas in favor of clean energy alternatives, but those divestments amount to a penny for every dollar in the centuries-old industry valued at $4.7 trillion.
“It’s all wishful thinking,” said Fadel Gheit, an oil and gas analyst for Oppenheimer. “Oil is still the easiest, most convenient, best solution so far. I tell people, ‘Don’t throw out your old furniture before you get new furniture or you’ll be sitting on the floor.’”
According to a report by Arabella Advisors, which aims to help philanthropies and individuals give effectively to their causes, about 180 institutions and local governments and more than 650 individuals representing $50 billion in assets have pledged to divest from fossil fuels. Since January, the number of such pledges has more than doubled, the report said.
But the commitments to divest are still miniscule in comparison to the mammoth fossil fuel industry. The nearly 1,500 exchange-listed oil and gas companies are together valued at $4.65 trillion, according to a recent paper by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
“Fossil fuels are investor favorites for a reason,” the BNEF report said. “Few sectors offer the scale, liquidity, growth, and yield of these century-old businesses vital to today's economy… Oil and gas companies are too large, and too widely held, for divestment to be easy or fast.”
The shares dumped by those in the divestment movement won't likely have trouble finding new buyers.
""People don’t see any practical, realistic substitute for oil for decades to come,"" Gheit said. 

Advocates of the divesture movement know they’re up against a huge industry and say their aim is to move finances from oil, gas and coal to renewable energy projects and through that momentum, influence legislation, to in turn squeeze more finances out of oil and gas into renewables.
“This is a movement to start a political discussion. We never expected Harvard to divest overnight,” said Jamie Henn, director of strategy and communications for 350.org, an environmental group involved in the divestment movement, which began on college campuses. Stanford University has decided not to invest in coal mining companies, but others with big endowments like the University of California, Yale University and Harvard University have declined activists' calls to divest from fossil fuels. 
But Henn still sees the movement making an impact. Sitting in a café in Manhattan, he described an Occupy Wall Street activist passing by the window protesting carbon assets. “The discussion of carbon is very real on Wall Street now. And all of that has happened in the last 18 months. We're just getting started.”

The National Association of Realtors reported earlier that existing home sales in the U.S. unexpectedly fell 1.8% to an annual unit rate of 5.05 million in August.
Analysts had expected existing home sales to rise 1% to 5.20 million units, and the figures sent oil prices falling on fears that U.S. recovery continues to face headwinds and may consume less fuel and energy than once thought.
Concerns that global oil supply is outstripping demand also battered crude futures.
While the U.S. economy is gaining steam despite hiccups here and there, Europe and China are still battling potholes, which has taken its toll on energy markets.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said earlier that economic activity in the euro area has slowed and added he saw risks of a further downturn.
""The economic recovery in the euro area is losing momentum. Following some moderate expansion in recent quarters, growth of the euro area real GDP came to a halt in the second quarter of this year,"" Draghi said in prepared remarks of his speech.
""The early information on economic conditions which we received over the summer has been somewhat weaker than expected.

Corn futures hit $3.3140 a bushel earlier in the day, a level not seen since June 2010.
For the week, the December corn contract lost 7.0 cents, or 2.06%, the fifth consecutive weekly decline, as expectations of record yields across much of the U.S. grain belt drove prices lower.

The USDA said on September 11 that U.S. ending stocks were forecast at 698 million bushels, up from a previous estimate of 663 million, due in large part to weak export demand for U.S. supplies.
Global wheat inventories at the end of the 2014-15 season will total 196.38 million metric tons, up from 192.96 projected in August.

235,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2014 02:58PM ET</span>","In film on alternative car fuels, former Shell executive speaks out","By Lucas Iberico Lozada NEW YORK (Reuters) - Frustrated by what he describes as a lack of political courage, a former president of the U.S. unit of Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) takes center stage in a new documentary film that makes the case for using alternative fuels in cars.
The movie, ""PUMP,"" blames oil companies, and what is described as their obstructive tactics, as well as political inertia for preventing the widespread adoption of cheaper and cleaner fuels based on natural gas and alcohol in the United States, world's largest economy.
The former Shell executive, John Hofmeister, has devoted himself to criticizing what he describes as an unhealthy dependence on oil and the high price of gasoline faced by consumers at the pump.
""We have more oil and natural gas than we will ever need"" in the United States, Hofmeister, who ran the Houston-based Shell Oil Company from 2005 to 2008, said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. ""The question is, What is the price of that oil? If oil is too expensive for everyday people ... it depresses the economy overall.""
For Hofmeister, who is a member of the advisory board of the non-profit advocacy group Fuel Freedom Foundation - one of the film's producers - the solution to high prices at the pump could be easily solved by modifying regulations to allow car owners to modify their engines in order to use a mixture of plant- or natural gas-based ethanol or methanol with gasoline, known as ""flexfuel."" Onshore shale drilling has opened up vast new supplies of oil and natural gas in North America in the past few years.
Such a process, Hofmeister said, would cost drivers only a few hundred dollars and would permit the use of whatever proportion of alcohol-to-gasoline is desired.
Hofmeister's vision faces steep obstacles. Currently, modifications to gasoline engines void car warranties. And methanol, which is used primarily in racing vehicles due to its higher octane levels, is illegal for use in street cars.
Moreover, the infrastructure for producing alcohol-based fuels for mass consumption simply does not exist, something Hofmeister blames on onerous federal regulations.
""It's a huge economic stimulus growth opportunity because we don't have the infrastructure for the alternative fuels,"" Hofmeister said. ""There has never been a shortage of investors to invest in the energy infrastructure of tomorrow.""
Hofmeister said he has met with Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Washington over the past six years to push for modifying existing regulations.
""Individual members, both sides I've talked to, love it, absolutely love it. But it's not high enough on their priority list,"" he said.
For Hofmeister, converting some 250 million gasoline vehicles in the United States to ""flexfuel"" would benefit everyone, including oil companies. Losses in revenue from gasoline sales could be offset by shifting investment to natural gas.
""Americans will drive more, enjoy their mobility, and pollute less,"" Hofmeister said. ""Not a bad shift.""

The movie, which was produced by film studio Submarine Deluxe as well as Fuel Freedom, opens in select theaters in New York and Los Angeles on Friday.

Demand for heating could arise, which cushioned the commodity's losses.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in October were down 1.62% at $3.847 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading. The commodity hit a session low of $3.835, and a high of $3.916.

After much of the U.S. experiences highs in the 70s and 80s this weekend, a fast moving weather system will track across the Midwest and Northeast Monday and Tuesday and will drive some light heating demand,"" Natgasweather.com reported in its Friday midday update.
""This will likely be the last somewhat chilly weather system over the central and eastern U.S. until October.""
Thursday's stockpile report kept prices in negative territory as well.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended Sept. 12 rose by 90 billion cubic feet, broadly in line with market expectations.
Inventories rose by 48 billion cubic feet in the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average change is a build of 71 billion cubic feet, a figure that sent prices dropping on Thursday and into Friday as well.

237,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 19, 2014 01:47PM ET</span>",Gold extends losses on strengthening dollar,"Investing.com - Gold prices carried Thursday's losses into Friday as the dollar continued to firm on expectations that U.S. monetary stimulus programs will wrap up next month, while benchmark interest rates will climb next year.
Gold and the greenback tend to trade inversely with one another.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for December delivery traded at 1,216.50 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, down 0.85%, up from a session low of $1,214.90 and off a high of $1,229.10.
The December contract settled down 0.73% at $1,226.90 on Thursday.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,182.00 a troy ounce, the low from Dec. 31, 2013, and resistance at $1,243.20, Tuesday's high.
The dollar earlier firmed on expectations for U.S. and European monetary policies to diverge, which came at gold's expense.
Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve suggested it plans to close its bond-buying stimulus program next month and hike interest rates in 2015.
While some time will pass between those two policy moves, rate hikes could come quickly once the U.S. central bank moves to tighten, many investors have concluded, which bolstered the greenback and softened demand for the yellow metal.
Meanwhile across the Atlantic, the euro came under pressure after the European Central Bank on Thursday said it allotted €82.6 billion to 255 bidders in its new Targeted Long Term Refinancing Operation, or TLTRO. The figure was well below the €100 to €150 billion predicted by analysts.
The European Central Bank recently cut interest rates and announced it would purchase asset-backed securities to stimulate the economy, which has softened the euro, which has made the dollar an attractive buy.

A firmer greenback makes oil less attractive on dollar-denominated exchanges, especially in the eyes of investors holding other currencies.
In the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for delivery in November traded down 0.43% at $91.58 a barrel during U.S. trading. New York-traded oil futures hit a session low of $91.16 a barrel and a high of $92.24 a barrel.
The November contract settled down 1.31% at $91.98 a barrel on Thursday.
Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $89.76 a barrel, Monday's low, and resistance at $94.12 a barrel, Tuesday's high.
Concerns that global oil supply is outstripping demand sent crude futures falling on Friday.
While the U.S. economy is gaining steam and will likely consume more fuel and energy going forward, Europe and China are still battling headwinds, which has taken its toll on energy markets.
A stronger dollar also fueled the selloff.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said that it will likely close its monthly bond-buying program in October and suggested it will raise interest rates in 2015.
While some time will pass when the bond-buying program closes and rates begin to rise, investors concluded that borrowing costs are set to climb in 2015 regardless, which should open the door to a gradual strengthening trend for the dollar.
Wednesday's bearish U.S. storage data also kept prices in negative territory.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report on Wednesday that U.S. crude oil inventories increased by 3.7 million barrels in the week ended Sept. 12, confounding expectations for a decline of 1.7 million barrels, which stoked fears of a supply glut.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 362.3 million barrels as of last week.
The report also showed that total motor gasoline inventories decreased by 1.6 million barrels, compared to forecasts for a decline of 0.3 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles rose by 0.3 million barrels.

On Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that its manufacturing index deteriorated to a three-month low of 22.5 in September from August’s reading of 28.0. Analysts had expected the index to decline to 23.0 this month.
The data came after the U.S. Commerce Department said that the number of building permits issued in August dropped by 5.6% to 998,000 units, while housing starts tumbled by 14.4% to 956,000 units.
Separately, the U.S. Department of Labor said earlier that the number of people who filed for unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week fell by 36,000 to 280,000, the lowest level since mid-July.
A stronger dollar has also kept pressure on oil and other commodities priced in the currency.

261,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2014 08:48AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. considering options if oil export ban challenged,"By Timothy Gardner and Valerie Volcovici 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Obama administration officials are concerned about the legality of a ban on oil exports and have begun discussing how to deal with potential challenges from nations that want to buy U.S. crude, two sources said. 
Officials in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the National Security Council have each held internal talks about potential free-trade challenges from South Korea and NATO allies, two sources familiar with the matter said. 
The internal discussions, which are still at a preliminary stage, are the clearest sign yet that the Obama administration is weighing options for easing the contentious export ban, a move that could dramatically alter global oil trading flows and boost revenues for U.S. producers currently limited to selling their crude domestically. 
EU's top trade official, Mexico's state-owned oil company and South Korea's president have all pressed Washington to relax the ban, enacted by Congress after the 1970s Arab oil embargo. There does not appear to be an imminent challenge to the ban, however, experts and officials said. 
Washington long ago justified the ban on national security concerns and the need to protect against a domestic oil shortage. 
""Not a single one of those exceptions is likely to be able to be successfully defended if somebody challenged it,"" said Alan Dunn, a lawyer at Stewart and Stewart who represented Washington at the talks that created the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
""That puts the White House in a position where it has to figure out what it's going to do."" 
Oil exports also could offer a foreign policy opportunity, allowing the United States to aid NATO allies, for example, as a geopolitical check against energy-rich Russia, one of the sources said. 
A USTR spokesman said no formal talks had taken place on the issue. An NSC spokesman referred questions to the Commerce Department, which administers the export ban. The Commerce Department declined comment. 
Sources declined to elaborate about the early-stage talks. 
The Obama administration could eventually relax the ban, whether through free trade talks or by directly approving oil swaps, in which U.S. light crude exports would be exchanged for imports of heavy crude oil, the preferred crude for U.S. refiners. 
A QUESTION OF FAIRNESS 
For decades the oil ban was not an issue because the United States imported most of its crude. But thanks to the U.S. shale boom, oil output is growing by 1 million barrels a year, and a glut is threatening to lower prices for domestic crude as soon as this fall. 
The United States allows oil exports to Canada as long as the crude is consumed or refined there. And Pemex, Mexico's state oil company, expects to soon import U.S. crude via a swap or a direct import agreement. 
U.S. oil producers have so far failed to convince Congress to fully overturn the ban, amid fears it could drive up gasoline prices and encourage more fracking, which environmentalists say would have dangerous consequences. 
But with Asia thirsty for oil to satisfy fuel and petrochemical demand, and Europe anxious to diversify supplies away from Russia, other countries are urging the United States to practice what it has preached for decades: free trade. 
The fairness issue particularly came into focus after the United States earlier this year won two WTO cases against China, which it accused of hoarding raw materials and rare earth metals. 
""Oil-importing countries are watching to see if the U.S. will apply the same standards of open trade in commodities that are not in short supply to its own economy, while it demands these standards from others,"" the Brookings Institution said in a report released last week on implications of lifting the ban. 
The report said allowing some countries to get U.S. oil while otherwise banning exports could be challenged as inconsistent with the global trade law, Brookings said. 
A report by the U.S. Congressional Research Service in August concluded that under international trade rules, U.S. restrictions on fossil fuels could be difficult to reconcile with the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
OIL DIPLOMACY 
While the sources didn't elaborate about where the administration talks are headed, the discussions could include using exports as a way to bolster relations with allies who supported sanctions on Iran over its disputed nuclear program. 
Other producers have stepped up, but the sanctions halved the OPEC-member's oil exports. 
Neil Brown, a former senior adviser for the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said relaxing the ban could help the U.S. relationship with Europe. 
To stand by a ban would be hypocritical, said Brown, now a principal of KKR Global Institute. 
Pressure to relax the ban is building steadily. 
Karel De Gucht, the EU's commissioner for trade, said last week that oil and gas needs to be freed up now if a wider free trade pact, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), is to be completed. 
And South Korea's President Park Geun-hye asked a delegation of Republican U.S. lawmakers last month to push Congress to send the country more of an ultra light form of oil called condensates. 
Mona Sutphen, former deputy chief of staff for President Barack Obama and now a partner at Macro Advisory Partners LLP, said at an event at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy this month that a big disruption in global oil production, such as one resulting from conflict in the Middle East, could spur a huge discussion about exports. 
Failing that, change could happen at the later stages of long-standing trade talks with Atlantic and Pacific partners, she said. 

""That's really the political path that I see,"" she said.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in October were up 0.93% at $3.968 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading. The commodity hit a session low of $3.863, and a high of $3.977.

Still, forecasts for changing weather patterns prevented a strong rally, as a return of mild temperatures should cut into the need for both heating and air conditioning.
""As the week progresses, warmer temperatures will surge out of the southern U.S. and Plains and towards the Midwest. This will set up very comfortable temperatures over most U.S. regions this weekend, with only the Southwest and southern California being hot and needing above normal cooling,"" Natgasweather.com reported in its Sept.16-22 outlook.

299,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2014 11:10AM ET</span>","Falling oil price tilts political, economic balance in U.S. favor","By David Sheppard and Rania El Gamal LONDON/KUWAIT (Reuters) - The drop in oil prices to their lowest in two years has caught many observers off guard, coming against a backdrop of the worst violence in Iraq this decade, heightened tensions between the West and Russia, and sanctions against Iran.
But as rising supplies of North American crude and tepid demand have pushed prices below $100 a barrel, the move underlies how the shale oil revolution is creating a political and economic advantage for Washington and its Western allies.
Russia and Iran are heavily reliant on oil sales and face budget shortages at current price levels, analysts say, weakening their position when negotiating over Ukrainian sovereignty or the Iranian nuclear deal.
And higher oil production from the United States as well as Canada is providing a buffer against the threat of retaliatory supply curbs from Russia or further disruptions to supplies from the Middle East.
""The increase in production is definitely benefiting the United States,"" said Professor Paul Stevens at the Chatham House think tank in London.
""The Russians are very exposed to lower oil prices. We don't know to what extent it will influence their behavior in Ukraine, but they're certainly going to feel pressure on their budget.""
Russia's ruble currency has already fallen to a historic low against the dollar as its economy is hit by sanctions from the United States and European Union over its involvement in Ukraine. That increases the price Russians must pay for many imports, from vegetables to luxury goods.
Daily oil production in the United States has risen sharply since the financial crisis. In 2010 the country still imported half of the crude it consumed, but the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts that will fall to little more than 20 percent next year.
Even as the United States has largely maintained its ban on exporting crude, it has left a lot of barrels from West Africa and the Middle East looking for new homes. While U.S. energy company profits might take a hit from lower prices, consumers will benefit more from spending less at the pump.
For Iran, a lower oil price not only harms its economy, already hit by sanctions that specifically try to cut its oil sales. It also means there is less pressure on the West to reach a deal quickly over Tehran's nuclear program.
With oil prices falling, the immediate economic incentive of getting Iranian barrels smoothly back to the world market is diminished, analysts say, allowing Western powers more leeway to drive a harder deal.
Some energy analysts even say Islamic State, which has captured a number of oilfields in Syria and Iraq, will be hurt by lower oil prices as it is forced to discount further the black market sales that help fund the militant group.
""Recent advances by the Islamic State (IS) have disrupted Middle East politics and shifted incentives for key regional and global players,"" Bank of America-Merrill Lynch analyst Francisco Blanch said this week, arguing that U.S. ally Saudi Arabia may be comfortable with lower prices.
""Lower oil would hurt IS, Iran and Russia, but help the West,"" Blanch said, adding that he saw the breakeven price for Russia's budget at around $105 a barrel.
OPEC REACTION
For Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, lower prices may create some short-term budgetary pain, but observers believe the kingdom is willing to absorb the impact as it does greater damage to regional rivals such as Iran.
Saudi Arabia has said for years that it will supply the world with the oil it needs.
""Have you ever seen me concerned?"" Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on Thursday in Kuwait when asked whether the price fall was worrying the kingdom.
""This is not the first time prices change, they always change. It's a dynamic process,"" he told Reuters.
Other Gulf delegates attending a meeting of oil ministers from the region said the price drop was unlikely to spur action from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) unless crude fell below $85 a barrel.
""It is a fact which is bound to focus minds in the Gulf and in wider OPEC but we also need to remember that this follows many months with good prices from their point of view,"" Samuel Ciszuk, senior adviser on energy security to the Swedish Energy Agency, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.
Saudi Arabia is likely to ""micromanage"" supplies at it has for a number of years, Ciszuk said, but it was unlikely to push for an official OPEC supply cut.
While U.S. oil output has been rising fast, part of the big jump in supplies has come from countries that remain at risk of supply disruptions, including Libya and Nigeria.
""No fundamental improvement in the stability of those countries has actually taken place, which means that the added supply is extremely vulnerable,"" Ciszuk said.
Libya's oil production has rebounded to more than 800,000 barrels per day, the National Oil Corp said this week, eight times the amount of just a few months ago.
But the increase, which followed a deal to end a near year-long rebel port blockade, has come at a time when the government is losing control of the country, with an armed group taking over the capital Tripoli last week.
For now, however, the U.S.-led surge in supply and weak demand have seen traders start to store additional barrels as they wait for prices to recover.

""Given the volatile situation in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region,"" the International Energy Agency said, ""this is a benefit to global energy security.""

300,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 12, 2014 09:15AM ET</span>",Why Is Demand For Oil So Low? IEA Cuts Forecast,"By Maria Gallucci - The world’s demand for crude oil will grow at a remarkably slower pace this year and next, the International Energy Agency projects. The Paris-based watchdog says it trimmed its growth forecasts again as European and Chinese economies continue to weaken.  
“The recent slowdown in demand growth is nothing short of remarkable,” the IEA said in its September oil market report on Thursday. The agency also cut its forecasts in its August and July reports.
For all of 2014, the agency now expects oil demand to grow by 900,000 barrels per day (bpd), down by 150,000 bpd from earlier projections. For 2015, it reduced its estimates by 100,000 bpd to 1.2 million bpd.
“Euro zone economies, already struggling with stagnation, are getting perilously close to deflation,” according to the IEA, Reuters reported. That could cause “further reductions in economic activity, as market participants delay investment/purchasing decisions.” China is unlikely to see demand grow by much more than 2 percent, the agency said.

IEA analysts said the lower demand growth will help offset some of the drop in production in Iraq and Libya, which have struggled to maintain production, refining and export levels as armed insurgents jeopardize infrastructure and supply routes.
While conflicts in those countries “show no sign of abating, their effect on global oil market balances and prices remains muted amid weakening oil demand growth and plentiful supply” from non-OPEC nations, including the United States, the IEA said.

The research aims to shed light on how the controversial practice of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, may affect people’s health. While fracking has long prompted fears of contaminated groundwater and dirty air, little data has actually been gathered when it comes to residential areas.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) study, published Wednesday, is based on a survey of 492 people in 180 randomly selected households in southern Pennsylvania. Each home used well water and was located in areas of active natural gas drilling. The Yale-led team drove around the area, asking about how often and how many times family members had sought medical attention for skin and respiratory complications like persistent rashes, nose bleeds, sore throats and unexplained hair loss. Researchers then compared that data with each home’s proximity to a gas well.
They found that “the number of reported health symptoms per person was higher among residents living less than 1 kilometer, compared with more than 2 kilometers, from the nearest gas well,” according to the study in Environmental Health Perspectives. “Proximity of natural gas wells may be associated with the prevalence of health symptoms.”
Nationwide, at least 15.3 million Americans have lived within a mile of an oil or gas well since 2000, an analysis by the Wall Street Journal found.
The NIH survey does not establish fracking as the cause of the discrepancy in health issues. But it does raise concerns and point to the need for further investigation, Meredith Stowe, an associate research scientist at the Yale School of Medicine, told the Washington Post. “This is just the start,” she said. “More research is needed down the road.”

Fracking proponents dismissed the research as baseless, the Post reported. Katie Brown, a spokeswoman for the pro-drilling group Energy in Depth, said it was “just a poll” that contracts evidence from direct pollution measurements at fracking sites."

Gold has fallen in recent sessions due to growing expectations for the Federal Reserve to wind down its bond-buying program in October and hike interest rates in 2015, likely sooner than later.
Loose monetary policies support gold, while talk of tightening sends the yellow metal falling, though bargain hunters on Wednesday brought the commodity off earlier lows and poking up into positive territory at times.

321,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2014 11:00AM ET</span>",Venezuela in dilemma over hiking world's cheapest fuel,"By Diego Ore 
CARACAS (Reuters) - President Nicolas Maduro is mulling a politically risky move to raise highly subsidized gasoline prices in Venezuela for the first time in 17 years, but may be put off for now by fears of a social backlash. 
With 95 octane gas on sale for less than two U.S. cents a liter most motorists can fill up for under $1 - less than a small bottle of drinking water. Pump attendants often end up with a bigger tip than the cost of the fuel. 
Subsidizing the world's cheapest gasoline costs the South American OPEC member about $12.5 billion a year, the government says. 
With its finances reeling and generous welfare programs to fund, the socialist government has for months been preparing Venezuelans for a hike of the almost laughably low prices at the pump. Ministers and state media have been constantly mentioning the possibility, while the ruling party has been debating it. 
Fuel prices, though, are a hot-button issue in the country with the world's biggest oil reserves, as many Venezuelans deem cheap fuel a birthright, and Maduro seems to be heeding the public's concerns and potential anger. 
""Be careful. I'm warning the government,"" said Ismael Hernandez, spokesman of a government-affiliated leftist group Marea Socialista. ""Remember that in 1989 the increase in gas price was the trigger for a revolution."" 
The 1989 fuel price increase sparked massive riots that claimed hundreds of lives, traumatized Venezuelans and rocked the presidency of Carlos Andres Perez. The so-called ""Caracazo,"" roughly translated as the ""Caracas disaster,"" still haunts Venezuela, and there has only been one other gasoline price adjustment since, in 1997, without incident. 
About 55 percent of Venezuelans are against increasing gas prices again, according to local pollster Hinterlaces. An increase would hit the poor, the government's traditional base of support, especially hard, given the inevitable inflationary impact on daily costs like buses and food. 
""We deserve subsidized fuel,"" said Antonio Lugo, a 63 year-old lawyer. ""I think it's incredible that in an oil-producing country they want to increase fuel prices on us."" 
""NO RUSH"" 
Maduro, whose popularity has slipped to below 40 percent according to some local pollsters, appears skittish about taking the plunge, out of worry it could revive the three-month protests that rocked Venezuela at the start of the year. 
""I want to tell Venezuelans who may be worried: there's no rush,"" he said last month. 
""The homeland has resources for its development."" 
Then last week, he pushed out the plan's main proponent, Rafael Ramirez, from his twin posts as oil minister and boss of state oil company PDVSA, diminishing market expectations of a hike, even though Maduro has not formally taken it off the table. 
A price increase would pile further pressure on Venezuelans, already struggling with annual inflation over 60 percent and shortages of goods ranging from corn flour to medicines. 
""Gas does need to be increased,"" said Roberto Enriquez, head of opposition party Copei. ""But a gas increase, given Venezuela's current economic contraction, will have a devastating effect on the economy, and an explosive one on inflation."" 
Economists, however, say maintaining the status quo will likely hasten the country's economic decline. Environmentalists, for their part, blast low gas prices for disincentivizing the use of alternative fuels and clogging up roads. 
Some Venezuelans say they are open to an increase, as long as the government stops shipping subsidized oil to allied countries such as Cuba. 
""First they should control the giveaways abroad,"" said taxi driver Jaime Lasarte, 60, as he filled up his 

Chevrolet Impala in Caracas. ""Then they can raise our gasoline.""

323,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 10, 2014 10:00AM ET</span>",U.S. Oil Output To Hit 45-Year High,"By Maria Gallucci - U.S. crude oil production will hit its highest level since 1970 next year, federal energy forecasters say. The surge, driven by the boom in shale oil drilling, will lower oil and gasoline prices and curb the need for U.S. fuel imports.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration now expects America’s output to rise to 9.53 million barrels per day -- up about 1 million barrels per day for a third consecutive year. Last month, the statistics agency predicted 2015 output growth would slow to 800,000 barrels, but it raised the figure amid steady shale production in North Dakota, Texas and other states.
The EIA forecast output of 8.53 million barrels a day in 2014, up from 7.45 million last year, according to its latest short-term energy outlook.
“U.S. production levels are astounding,” Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, told Bloomberg News. “We will see further revisions, because these [drilling] technologies get better over time.”

On a monthly basis, crude oil figures are also on the rise. Production averaged 8.6 million barrels a day in August, a level not reached since July 1986, according to EIA data. The agency projects monthly crude oil production will approach 10 million barrels a day by late next year.
That “will help cut U.S. fuel imports next year to just 21 percent of domestic demand, the lowest level since 1968,” EIA Administrator Adam Sieminski said in a statement.

The agency also reduced the price forecasts from its August report. Gasoline prices will dip to an average $3.41 a gallon, down from $3.46. A benchmark crude oil called West Texas Intermediate will now average $94.67 a barrel in 2015, down about $1.41, while Brent crude is forecast to cost $103 a barrel, versus the $105 projected earlier.
In a separate report, the EIA projected that by 2040, global use of petroleum and other liquid fuels will increase 38 percent to 119 million barrels per day. Developing economies in the Middle East and Asia, including China and India, will drive much of that demand, while consumers in the United States and Europe will consume less. “After a long period of high oil prices, efficiency and fuel switching have reduced or slowed growth of liquid fuels among mature oil-consuming countries,” the EIA said in its latest International Energy Outlook report."

Futures were likely to find support at $1,241.20 a troy ounce, the low from June 5, and resistance at $1,279.20, last Thursday's high.
The dollar saw broad support on hawkish language in a Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco report, which hinted that markets may be underestimating the pace at which rates may rise, evidenced by low volatility.
""Recently, subdued levels of volatility in financial markets have received some attention. For example, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen (2014) noted that 'indicators of expected volatility in some asset markets have fallen to low levels, suggesting that some investors may underappreciate the potential for losses and volatility going forward,''"" the report released on Monday read.
""Prices of financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, are sensitive to unexpected changes in interest rates because their present values are determined by discounting future cash flows. Thus, the low volatility in asset markets could, in part, reflect market participants’ relative certainty about the future course of interest rates.""
By Tuesday, the greenback strengthened on the news, giving gold room to slide.
Gold has seen support on three rounds of Fed asset purchases, rock-bottom interest rates, dovish language and other policies put into play since the 2008 financial crisis, as loose monetary policies tend to weaken the dollar, thus boosting the yellow metal's appeal as a hedge.

346,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 08, 2014 12:45PM ET</span>","EU Sanctions On Russia Near Approval, Oil Industry Targeted","By Dennis Lynch - The European Union is nearing approval of a new round of economic sanctions against Russia for its alleged involvement in the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. The EU will target Russian state-owned oil companies, particularly Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft, blocking them from raising financing in European markets.
EU diplomats said during the weekend the sanctions could be lifted if the cease-fire signed between Ukrainian and rebel forces holds. The sanctions would affect firms with revenues topping $26 billion that make more than half of their money through oil transport and sales. The European Commission presented a list of individuals ""including the new leadership in Donbass, the government of Crimea, as well as Russia decision-makers and oligarchs"" to be potentially targeted with assett freezes, which would block access to funds in European banks and stop them from buying or selling property in the EU. They would also be blocked from entering any EU country. The EU did not specify names of targeted individuals.

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said the sanctions have been ineffective in solving the crisis in Ukraine and warned Russia would ramp up its own sanctions to respond to the EU’s actions. “If there are sanctions related to the energy sector, or further restrictions on Russia’s financial sector, we will have to respond asymmetrically. … For example, we could impose transport restrictions,” Medvedev told Vedomosti. “If Western carriers have to bypass our airspace, this could drive many struggling airlines into bankruptcy. This is not the way to go. We just hope our partners realize this at some point.”
Russia banned all Ukrainian flights from entering Russian airspace in early August. Russia also imposed a one-year trade ban on a large variety of food imports from the EU and U.S. in that same round of sanctions, including on beef, pork, poultry, fish, fruit, vegetables and dairy products. 
The EU has pledged to compensate some sanctioned European sectors for more than $190 billion. Russia has promised targeted Russian businesses the same support.
President Barack Obama announced the U.S. also drew up new sanctions during last week’s NATO summit in Wales but did not specify what they would target or when they could take effect. Earlier rounds of EU and U.S. sanctions targeted the finances and businesses of influential members of Russian political circles.
The official outline of the sanctions is scheduled to be published by the EU Tuesday morning. The sanctions will likely not target the Russian gas industry, which is critical to Europe's energy supplies and economy.

On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, U.S. corn for December delivery surged 2.74%, or 9.4 cents, to settle at $3.5600 by close of trade on Friday.
Updated weather forecasting models raised the prospects of freezing weather that could damage crops in northern areas of the Midwest next week, leading to a round of bargain-buying and short-covering.

Corn prices have been under heavy selling pressure in recent months as expectations of record yields across much of the U.S. grain belt drove prices lower.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the corn harvest will total 14.03 billion bushels, which would break last year's record of 13.93 billion.
Meanwhile, U.S. soybeans for November delivery jumped 1.82%, or 18.2 cents, on Friday to settle the week at $10.2140 a bushel by close of trade.

366,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2014 01:40AM ET</span>",Nigeria nurtures its once-unloved cocoa industry as prices flourish,"By Chijioke Ohuocha AKURE Nigeria (Reuters) - College graduate Omatayo Adeniyi stands in a humid tropical forest of southwest Nigeria and explains why he chose cocoa farming over a white collar job in the city.
""There is money in the ground. The future is bright. I hope to make one tonne of cocoa by next year,"" he says from his farm in Ondo State.
Such optimism has for decades been rare among Nigeria's cocoa farmers: Many abandoned their fields and moved to cities in search of alternative work after commodity prices collapsed in the mid-1980s and the country's booming oil industry siphoned investment away from agriculture.
But years of focus on oil revenues has left Nigeria with a lack of industrial diversity and made it over-dependent on energy, which uses a lot of costly equipment but employs few people. So while the economy has been growing at an average of 7 percent for the past five years, it has failed to create jobs for many of Nigeria's 170 million people.
High unemployment and poverty levels have prompted the government to look again at cocoa with the aim of getting more people to grow a product for which prices have been rising.
Adeniyi's trees have been supplied by the government, which is also distributing plant pods and disease resistant seeds at subsidized rates, alongside cheap fertilisers, agricultural chemicals and training to improve practices.
Agriculture Minister Akinwumi Adesina aims to boost production to 1 million tonnes a year by 2018 - on a par with current number two global producer Ghana and approaching top grower Ivory Coast's projected 1.8 million tonnes for this year.
Nigeria says it's already on track to produce 500,000 tonnes of cocoa next year, double what it grew in 2012, and though analysts say that target may be optimistic, it is clear that no other cocoa growing country is boosting production as fast.
Output from Africa's top four growers - Ivory Coast, Ghana, Indonesia and Nigeria - which makes up over 70 percent of global production, is projected to rise in 2013/14 after staying flat for two years, according to Africa's Ecobank.
""Nigeria has been underperforming for many years because of a lack of investment and the discovery of oil. But in the last two years, there's been genuine commitment ... to develop agriculture,"" said Edward George, Ecobank head of research.
BIGGER, BETTER, MORE
Nigeria currently grows cocoa on less than a quarter of the 3 million hectares of land suitable to produce the beans, and the government is encouraging farmers to expand to the uncultivated savannah grassland.
With the materials the state provides, crops are flourishing. Adeniyi received his high-yield disease-resistant seeds from government two years ago and planted 800 seedlings of which 700 survived - much more than usual. The new trees flower within 18-24 months instead of 3-5 years.
""The materials will increase output more than three times from what farmers had before,"" said Leila Dongo, director at Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria.
However infrastructure still poses a problem - bad roads hamper the transport of beans to market - and many producers are at the mercy of the weather because of their rudimental operations.
In a leafy plantation where rows of cocoa trees sit three inches apart to let in air and sunshine, farmer Rafiu Saliu demonstrates the problem. Picking up a pod from a just-harvested heap he shows how most of it has gone black with fungal disease.
Farmers like Saliu rely on the whims of weather for growing and drying their crops. This year Saliu faced a dilemma: leave pods on trees until the rains pass, and risk them over ripening, or harvest them and risk mould levels exceeding the maximum 5 percent allowed on the market.
""If not for the rains we should be harvesting. All the pods are ripe,"" said 65-year-old Saliu, as more dark clouds spread over his four hectare farm.
To tackle this vulnerability, the government is training farmers to set up warehousing and storage, including creating shared drying spaces covered with plastic sheets that let sun in but keep rain out.
FROM TREES TO FACTORIES
When Nigeria's government turned its back on the cocoa industry, it also scrapped the cocoa marketing board, a farmers' cooperative that regulated farming practices, guaranteed prices to farmers, and provided subsidies through the cocoa board.
Farmers now bear the price risk themselves but have seen cocoa prices swing from a low of less than $1,000 per tonne in 1986 to a peak of $3,500 per tonne in 2011. This month cocoa is trading around $3,252 per tonne.
In Nigeria this year farmgate prices - the amount Saliu and Adeniyi will make on their beans before they go to the wider market - are around 450,000 naira ($2,779) per tonne - up 50 percent on last year. But that could fall quickly if as predicted a bumper West African crop depresses global prices.
So in an attempt to avoid a cycle of boom and bust, Nigeria is encouraging local processing and manufacturing enterprises.
Samuel Oyebade, head of the government's cocoa reform plan in its main growing region Ondo State, told Reuters talks were afoot with U.S. chocolate manufacturer SPAGnVOLA to set up a chocolate factory in which the state would invest around 5 billion naira ($31 million) to build, while SPAGnVOLA would manage the production for export and some local consumption.
Nigeria's beans have been deemed by the global market unsuitable for chocolate because of their high moisture content and so tend to be used more in cake, butter and soaps.
But with expert input from a U.S. chocolate expert their beans could yet make it to premium buyers, for premium prices.
""The industry says cocoa beans from Africa are inferior to those from South America and the Caribbean ... (but) it's how you treat that beans that renders the flavor ... every single tree has the potential for producing fine flavor,"" SPAGnVOLA Chief Executive Eric Reid told Reuters.

367,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2014 01:10AM ET</span>","As cocoa price soars, chocolate makers devour substitutes","By Lewa Pardomuan and Marcy Nicholson SINGAPORE/NEW YORK Sep 5 (Reuters) - Chocolate makers in the fast-growing Asian market are replacing a bigger proportion of cocoa butter, which gives confectionery its melt-in-the-mouth texture, with cheaper palm oil-based alternatives.
The move will help confectioners keep down prices in the price-sensitive region where chocolate sales are forecast to grow more than 5 percent this year to about 917,000 tonnes, according to market researcher Euromonitor International.
This is well ahead of growth of less than 1 percent in the United States and about 1.5 percent in western Europe.
Palm oil-based butter mimics the taste of cocoa butter but is much cheaper. Higher demand for butter alternatives, known as cocoa butter equivalent (CBE), has pushed prices up by about 10 percent to $3,300 a tonne in the past year, but this is still more than $4,000 below the price of butter from cocoa beans.
""We don't normally buy CBE, but now we use it because of requests from customers,"" said Richard Lee, chief executive officer of Aalst Chocolate, a Singapore-based firm that sells chocolate to bakeries, ice cream makers and food manufacturers.
""When butter prices were low, we didn't even use CBE at all,"" said Lee, who estimated that the firm's orders for substitutes were three to four times higher than last year.
Confectioners in Asia and Europe are allowed to add cocoa butter equivalent to chocolate, but hold the maximum amount at 5 percent since a higher content can alter the taste and put off customers. In the United States, products using butter alternatives cannot be labeled ""chocolate"".
COCOA BUTTER PRICES SURGE
Cocoa beans are processed into roughly equal parts butter and powder, which is used in cakes, biscuits and drinks.
Chocolate typically contains about 20 percent cocoa butter, so confectioners in Asia and Europe looking to save money can replace about a quarter of the cocoa butter with something else.
""The whole thing is about affordability - there's no point in paying so much,"" said Mohammad Jaaffar Ahmad, chief executive of the Palm Oil Refiners Association of Malaysia.
Cocoa butter prices jumped 28 percent this year to as high as $8,200 a tonne on strong demand and tight supply after global grinders cut processing to reduce inventory.
The world's capacity for making cocoa butter substitutes of all grades is now about 150,000 tonnes per year, up by 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes since 2013, according to an industry source.
The rise in the price of palm oil-based cocoa butter substitutes has come even as palm oil prices have fallen to five-year lows, underlining the increased demand for the product.
The largest market for vegetable fats in chocolate is countlines, bitesize chocolate bars eaten as snacks, although some of this will be used in the fillings rather than the chocolate itself, according to Euromonitor International.
Nutritionists say both products may be equally bad for you.

""They are both high in saturated fat and will raise total cholesterol, and I would expect that there would not be a great difference from a health perspective,"" said Walter Willett, professor and chairman of the Department of Nutrition for Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Gold futures for December delivery traded at $1,258.80 a troy ounce, down 0.61%, after hitting an overnight session low of $1,267.60 and off a high of $1,277.90.
Overnight, gold prices moved lower after upbeat U.S. service-sector data fueled demand for the greenback, though a ECB decision to stimulate the economy cushioned losses by sending investors hedging the precious metal against a sliding euro.
The U.S. services sector grew at its strongest pace in August since 2005, data that boosted the dollar and sent gold prices dipping, as the two asset classes tend to trade inversely with one another.
The Institute for Supply Management reported earlier that its services index rose to 59.6 in August from 58.7 in July, far surpassing market forecasts for a downtick to 57.5.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector, and the index offset lackluster U.S. employment data.
The Labor Department reported that the number of individuals filing for first-time unemployment assistance in the U.S. last week rose by 4,000 to 302,000 from the previous week’s total of 298,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 2,000 to 300,000 last week.
Elsewhere, payroll processor ADP reported that its nonfarm payrolls report showed that the private sector added 204,000 jobs in August, missing expectations for jobs growth of 220,000.
News out of Europe cushioned losses.
The European Central Bank earlier trimmed its benchmark interest rate to a record-low 0.05% from 0.15%, surprising many market analysts who had expected no change.
The central bank also lowered its deposit facility rate to -0.20% from -0.10% previously and its marginal lending rate to 0.30% from 0.40%.
The euro extended losses after ECB President Mario Draghi said the bank will begin an asset-backed securities purchasing program to shore up the recovery and steer the continent away from deflationary decline.
Draghi did not say how much debt the ECB planned to purchase, as further details will emerge in October.
The ECB cut its forecast for growth this year to 0.9% down from 1.0% previously and cut the forecast for 2015 to 1.6% from 1.7%. The bank also lowered its inflation forecast for this year to 0.6% from 0.7% in June.
The news bolstered gold's appeal as a hedge to a sliding euro.

382,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 03, 2014 08:15PM ET</span>",Florida Economy Threatened As 'Greening' Ravages Citrus Crop,"By Connor Adams Sheets - The bleak outlook for Florida's multibillion dollar citrus industry’s growing season will mean fewer jobs for seasonal workers and a big hit to the state’s economy, experts predict. Analysts expect the state to produce its smallest citrus crop in five decades during the season beginning next month, as up to 75 percent of the state’s 65 million citrus trees are infected by the insidious “greening” disease.
The disease is likely to eliminate a large swath of this year’s citrus crop, posing a serious threat to a longstanding way of life for tens of thousands of largely Mexican seasonal workers and the Sunshine State’s economy -- and even its identity.
“The impact on the economy is difficult to assess, but it is in aggregate a $9 billion industry,” Dr. Fariborz Ghadar, a professor at Pennsylvania State University’s Smeal School of Business and senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Affairs in Washington, D.C., said. “If that’s hurt by, say, 30 percent -- I don’t have an estimate for how much the citrus is being hurt, but reports say it’s serious -- the impact on the Florida economy is billions of dollars. So this is not an insignificant issue.”
The citrus industry in Florida, which represents 70 percent of domestic orange production and employs 75,000 people, has been a major driver of income and employment for the state for decades. But that rich heritage is increasingly imperiled by greening, a common shorthand for an insidious bacteria carried and spread by tiny insects called Asian Citrus Psyllids.
First identified in Florida at least 15 years ago, greening -- known as huanglongbing or “the yellow dragon” in China, where it was originally reported in 1943 -- the disease affects infected trees’ vascular systems, eventually killing the trees.
The disease is leaving little hope for the future of an industry that NPR reports has seen orange production halved over the past ten years, with only about 100 million boxes of the fruit produced last year.
About $90 million has been spent in Florida on research aimed at finding a way to end the scourge of greening since 2008, according the Associated Press. But no cure has been found to date, and experts say that the industry’s 40,000 to 55,000 seasonal, mostly seasonal and immigrant workers will be among those hardest hit by the resulting decrease in citrus production.
Though these types of jobs are typically some of the nation’s lowest paying, the workers who travel to America from Mexico and other countries to fill them during the citrus growing season via the nation’s H-2A guest worker visa program depend on the income they provide, and local businesses rely on their spending.
“While the loss of jobs and income will be devastating for these workers, the knock-on effects will be noticeable in rural Florida,” Jeff Born, a professor at the D’Amore McKim School of Business at Boston’s Northeastern University, said via email. “Because of their low incomes, these farm workers tend to spend just about everything they make (or send it back home) -- so small businesses all throughout rural Florida are likely to feel the pinch, too.”
Meanwhile, the federal government has been slow to issue the H-2A visas that allow seasonal workers to work in Florida citrus groves, as the political debate over immigration has raged in Washington. 

“The H-2A visas, they’re a government responsibility. Delaying this, in particular when the citrus industry is hurting, is inexcusable,” Ghadar said. “Immigration has become such a sensitive issue that nobody wants to stand up and do the right thing and issue the visas, so [it seems] the best thing to do is sit on your hands and no one can blame you for it. But it’s yes and no. The economy needs immigrants.”
Orange juice sales continue to slide, hitting a record low of 34.96 million gallons in the four weeks that ended Aug. 2, down 9.2 percent over a similar period in 2013, according to Nielsen data cited by the Wall Street Journal. That decrease can be chalked up both to the puny domestic citrus crop and consequent higher prices. Frozen, concentrated orange juice futures are up, trading at $1.47 a pound on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange as of Aug. 18, representing a jump of 5.6 percent this year.
And experts expect prices to rise even higher as the coming season's citrus crop is expected to be even more dismal. Price-conscious consumers may increasingly choose to do without O.J., which has for decades been by far the country's most popular fruit juice.

However, gold retreated from the day’s highs after data showed that U.S. gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 4.2% in the second quarter, up from a preliminary estimate of 4% and rebounding from a first quarter contraction.
Reports on Friday showed that U.S. consumer sentiment rebounded to a seven year high in August, with the final reading of the University of Michigan’s consumer confidence index rising to 82.5 from 81.8 in June.
Another report indicated that manufacturing activity in the Chicago region continued to expand in August, pointing to underlying strength in the sector.
The reports offset separate data showing that U.S. consumer spending unexpectedly fell 0.1% in July.
The US Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose to almost one year highs of 82.78 late Friday, as the data pointed to mostly stronger growth. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for buyers who use other currencies as the metal is traded in dollars.
The upbeat U.S. data also fuelled concerns that the deepening recovery could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates sooner. Higher interest rates would make gold a less attractive investment than interest-bearing assets such as Treasury bonds.
Elsewhere in metals trading, palladium prices rallied to thirteen-and-a-half year highs on Friday, amid concerns that more far reaching sanctions against Russia, the world's largest palladium producer, could hit supplies.
Nymex Palladium for December delivery hit highs of $910.40 a troy ounce, and was last up 0.91%, at $906.30 an ounce.
Meanwhile, silver for September delivery slid 0.61% to $19.49 a troy ounce late Friday. Comex silver edged up 0.16% last week, but ended the month with losses of 4.32%.
Copper for September delivery climbed 0.39% to $3.163 a pound by close of trade. Comex copper futures lost 1.86% for the week, extending the month’s losses to 1.37%.
In the week ahead, the Comex trading floor will be closed on Monday for the Labor Day holiday. Investors will be looking ahead to Tuesday’s Institute of Supply Management report on U.S. manufacturing activity and to Friday’s August nonfarm payrolls report for further indications on the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.

413,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 29, 2014 11:45AM ET</span>",Nigerian Transparency Group Struggles To Rein In Oil Corruption,"By Maria Gallucci - Attempts to rein in corruption in Nigeria’s oil sector are reportedly falling short. The head of a government-run transparency initiative says officials have largely ignored his fact-finding reports and made it difficult for his organization to effectively police Africa’s biggest oil industry, Bloomberg News reported on Friday.
“Those who are benefiting from this forgery called Nigeria will like to keep it at all costs,” Ledum Mitee, a lawyer and former activist, told the news agency from Abuja, the capital. “All these people pilfering from the country are in bed together.”
A spokesman for President Goodluck Jonathan did not return Bloomberg’s repeated requests for comments, the news agency said.
Oil and gas exports account for close to 80 percent of government revenue in Nigeria. Allegations of missing oil funds date back to the 1970s, during the infancy of the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NPPC). In the 1990s, an official investigation found that $12 billion in oil revenue was unaccounted for under the government of military ruler Ibrahim Babandgida, Bloomberg noted.
Nigeria set up its Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) in 2004 after the government agreed to comply with international standards that require oil and mining companies and governments to publish all payments. Seven years ago, Nigeria passed a law that allows NEITI to collect and analyze payment data from all energy companies operating in the country, including Royal Dutch Shell PLC (NYSE:RDS.A), Exxon Mobil Corp. NYSE:XOM, Chevron Corp. NYSE:CVX, and Italy’s Eni SpA BIT:ENI.

Shell said this week it was selling its Nigerian assets -- worth up to $5.2 billion -- over concerns of theft and corruption in the Niger Delta region. Last February, the oil giant said it was forced to shut down one of its pipelines after thieves drilled holes through it. Eni and the French company Total SA NYSE:TOT are also selling some of their shares in Nigerian oil infrastructure assets.
NEITI has audited oil and gas industry payments made from 1999 to 2011 and is now examining 2012 to 2013 oil industry payments and revenue, Mitee told Bloomberg. The latest audit report, which looked at 2009 to 2011, found that at least $23.2 billion of oil income wasn’t deposited into the national accounts operated by the central bank and NNPC at JP Morgan Chase & Co. in New York, Bloomberg noted.
Mitee complained that his organization is only equipped to review old files for hints of past corruption. He said that NEITI should be allowed to monitor the oil industry in real time, including by installing meters at pipeline wellheads, which would indicate whether and where crude oil went missing on its way to the export terminal.
The chairman added that Nigerian lawmakers should advance a proposed Petroleum Industry Bill, which has been stuck in parliament for six years due to political wrangling with global oil companies over proposed tax and royalty terms, Bloomberg said. The measure would also help clear up NNPC’s confusing role as industry regulator and national oil company, Mitee told the news agency.

416,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2014 01:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Morgan Stanley plans natural gas export plant in new commodities foray,"By Anna Louie Sussman NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley has quietly filed plans to build and run one of the first U.S. compressed natural gas export facilities, the first sign the bank is plunging back into physical commodity markets even as it sells its physical oil business.
In a 23-page application to the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy submitted in May, the Wall Street bank outlined a proposal to build, own and operate a compression and container loading facility near Freeport, Texas, which will have capacity to ship 60 billion cubic feet a year of compressed natural gas (CNG).
While the size of the project is small compared with bigger liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, the plan highlights the bank's ability to exploit its status as one of two Wall Street banks which are allowed to own and operate infrastructure for the manufacture, storage and operation of raw materials. The other one is Goldman Sachs.
Their physical commodities activities were both ""grandfathered"" in when they became bank holding companies during the financial crisis more than five years ago.
It also showcases a nimble and novel approach to exporting cheap domestic gas that could replace oil for power plants in Caribbean nations, as the United States pumps out record amounts of gas from its fracking revolution.
The strategy skirts the multibillion-dollar upfront investments, long lead times and stringent application processes associated with building liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in favor of using readily-available containers and inexpensive container ships, in one of the first projects of its kind.
The bank plans to ship CNG to countries with which the U.S. has free trade agreements, including the Dominican Republic, Panama, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica, according to the filing, which has not been previously reported.
Those countries now mainly use oil for their power plants. Natural gas, which in the U.S. is often used to power trucks and buses, could provide a cheaper alternative.
""You can collect U.S. gas at $4, it costs you $1 to ship it and gasify it, you bring it in at $5 and the equivalent that they are paying for fuel is $20 plus,"" said a person familiar with the project. ""There is a lot of money to be made.""
A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the plan beyond the contents of the filing.
""VERY SIGNIFICANT""
The boom in natural gas production in the U.S. has pushed prices down to $4.02 per million British thermal units. Natural gas contracts sold outside of the U.S. are often linked to higher-priced oil, which can inflate the cost of the gas.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects total domestic natural gas production to hit 73.9 billion cubic feet per day, portending sustained low prices going forward. About 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas yields 1 million BTU. One barrel of oil is roughly equivalent to 5,800 cubic feet of natural gas.
Billions of dollars are being poured into sophisticated export terminals for LNG, which require specialized equipment to cool the fuel to turn it into a liquid, as well as infrastructure to warm it at the receiving end, and take years to build.
Cheniere Energy, for example, is investing $5.6 billion to expand its Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana to export LNG, which is expected to be operational by 2015.
The permitting process is also lengthy, with almost two dozen applications awaiting approval.
By contrast, the source familiar with Morgan Stanley's plans estimated the cost of building the plant at $30 million to $50 million, with minimal investment needed on the receiving end. The bulk of the expenditure would be in buying thousands of containers to ship the gas.
""They'll lease some land, buy some cranes,"" he said. ""But you need literally thousands of these containers.""
It will take 12 months to complete the plant from the time Morgan Stanley receives final regulatory approvals, according to the filing.
In November 2013, Florida-based energy company Emera CNG LLC applied to export 9.125 billion square feet a year; the status of its application is not clear and its lawyers and executives did not return calls for comment in time for publication.
Andy Weissman, an energy lawyer at Haynes Boone in Washington, said the Morgan Stanley proposal was one of the first such CNG export projects he was aware of.
""This could be something very significant, and if it was done successfully, there would undoubtedly be more of these,"" he said.
LOGISTICS NIGHTMARE
The 50-acre proposed site in Texas is currently being inspected for suitability, according to a second source familiar with the plans. Freeport is a deepwater port on the Gulf of Mexico with a 45-foot draft, and already receives large container ships carrying tropical fruits imported by Dole and Chiquita.
Morgan Stanley will lease pre-existing loading docks there, but plans to supply the containers itself, said the second source.
According to the filing, gas would be piped into the proposed facility on an 11-mile third-party pipeline connected to the Brazoria Interconnector Gas Pipeline (BIG), which moves natural gas within Texas. Gas that travels in a pipeline is already compressed.
After further compressing and containerizing the gas, Morgan Stanley can load the pressurized natural gas containers on standard container ships.
""It's a logistics nightmare, putting [the gas] in containers and shipping them around - it's hard to do. Most people can't figure out how to make money doing it,"" said the second source. ""For once, the price of gas is low enough that it makes sense.""
GRANDFATHER STATUS
The project marks a new foray into the physical commodity market for Morgan Stanley after it sold the bulk of its physical oil operations, ending its long run as the biggest physical oil trader on Wall Street amid intense regulatory pressure.
The assets included oil storage and transport company TransMontaigne Inc (TMG.UL) as well as its global physical oil trading operation, which it has agreed to sell to Russia's Rosneft.
Thanks to a provision in the 15-year-old Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs alone among Wall Street banks enjoy ""grandfather"" status for any commodities activities they engaged in before 1997, although the provision has never been publicly interpreted by the banks' regulators at the Federal Reserve.
It was unclear whether the bank was using its grandfathered status to undertake the natural gas plant. However, the appointment of two of its commodities executives as officers of the natural gas subsidiaries indicates they could have more day-to-day control than in an arm's-length investment done under merchant banking authority.
The application is filed under the name Wentworth Gas Marketing LLC, a Delaware company with a business address in Purchase, New York, home to Morgan Stanley Capital Group, its commodities group.
Wentworth Gas Marketing and another company, Wentworth Compression LLC, are both wholly owned by Wentworth Holdings LLC, which is indirectly owned by Morgan Stanley.
The filing contains an agreement that Wentworth Compression will sell CNG to Wentworth Gas Marketing , which is signed by two Morgan Stanley commodities executives, Deborah Hart and Peter Sherk.
Hart, whose LinkedIn profile lists her as Morgan Stanley's chief operating officer North American Power & Gas, is a vice president of Wentworth Compression. Sherk, a managing director and co-head of commodities trading, is a vice president of Wentworth Gas Marketing.
The Federal Reserve declined to comment on the natural gas project, and Morgan Stanley did not answer questions about what authority it was using to pursue it.

The filing for the project landed just months before the bank bought Deutsche Bank's North American natural gas trading book.

Overnight, escalating tensions in eastern Ukraine fueled safe-haven demand for gold, offsetting upbeat U.S. data that would have otherwise pushed the precious metal lower.
A top Ukrainian military official was reported as saying earlier that a ""full-scale invasion"" was taking place in the country, while separate reports that up to 1,000 Russian troops were in Ukraine to assist pro-Russian rebels boosted the price of gold, a popular safe-haven asset class during times of geopolitical uncertainty.
The U.S. has repeatedly said Russia has been meddling in the fighting in eastern Ukraine, a charge Moscow denies.
The U.N., meanwhile, was holding an emergency meeting to address the crisis, which sent investors seeking safe harbor in the precious metal despite upbeat U.S. data, which tends to send gold prices falling by fueling expectations for tighter U.S. monetary policy.
The U.S. gross domestic product grew at a revised annualized rate of 4.2% in the second quarter of this year, according to the Commerce Department, up from a preliminary estimate of 4.0% and better than market forecasts for a downward revision to 3.9%.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in October were down 0.36% at $3.989 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading. The commodity hit a session low of $3.974, and a high of $4.079.
The October contract settled up 1.37% on Wednesday to end at $4.003 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $3.932 per million British thermal units, Wednesday's low, and resistance at $4.172, the high from July 14.
Recent weather forecasts calling for above-normal temperatures across parts of the eastern U.S. moderated their predictions, which allowed natural gas prices to edge lower.
A Canadian weather system will trek across the central U.S. and bring more comfortable temperatures into the south and Midwest over the next several days.
""This will also bring some cooling into the southern Plains and southeast as highs drop out of the mid and upper 90s and into the upper 80s to lower 90s,"" Natgasweather.com reported in its Aug.28-Sept. 4 daily weather forecast.
High pressure will return to the central and eastern U.S. around Sept. 2nd-3rd and bring warmer weather with it, though longer-range models calls for cool snaps across the northern U.S. between Sept. 5 and 11.
Elsewhere, a low pressure system in the western Gulf of Mexico stood very little chance of intensifying into a tropical cyclone before it makes landfall, which added to Thursday's selling.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2014 10:50AM ET</span>",BP says Whiting refinery still in production after fire,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - BP Plc (L:BP) said its largest U.S. refinery, at Whiting, Indiana, continued to operate on Thursday morning following a blaze the night before that was expected to have a minimal impact on production.
One worker was taken to an area hospital for treatment, but was later released, the company said.
BP said operations at the 413,500 barrel per day (bpd) Whiting refinery ""were minimally impacted as a result of the incident and the refinery continues to produce products for customers.""
Genscape, an energy information service provider, said all monitored units were operating normally except for the Blending Oil Unit, which shut at 9:04 p.m. That unit removes sulfur from distillate and gas oil streams, according to Genscape.
This incident comes nearly a decade after a 2005 explosion at a BP refinery in Texas City, Texas, killed 15 people and resulted in multi-million dollar settlements and tens of millions in fines for the company. The company sold that plant in 2013.
However, operational incidents, including small fires, at refineries are reasonably common, said Daniel Horowitz, the spokesman for the U.S. Chemical Safety Board. The Board, which investigates larger refinery fires, drew that conclusion after a report into a fire at a Chevron refinery. The CSB will follow-up with BP, but is unlikely to investigate a case that doesn't involve fatalities or offsite damage, Horowitz said.
The Whiting refinery is the seventh-largest refinery in the United States and the largest outside of the Gulf Coast.
The plant is the centerpiece of BP's shift over the past two years to emphasize using cheaper, heavy crude oil from Canada's tar sands fields in Alberta.
In November, BP completed a $4-billion revamp of the Whiting refinery to boost its intake of Canadian crude oil from 85,000 bpd to 350,000 bpd.
On July 29, BP's Chief Executive Bob Dudley said during a conference call that Whiting had been refining 270,000 bpd in heavy crude oil in the second quarter of this year and could likely run up to 300,000 bpd.
In its statement on Thursday, the company did not specify which unit was affected by the blaze, but said it was located in the north end of the refinery.
BP said the fire broke out at 9 p.m. Wednesday local time (0200 GMT Thursday). The fire was out by 10:55 p.m. local time Wednesday.
Firefighters from the city of Whiting were placed on stand-by to assist in battling the blaze, but the fire was contained and extinguished by BP's firefighting unit at the refinery.

431,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 27, 2014 02:15PM ET</span>",Thefts Drive Foreign Oil Companies Out Of Nigeria,"By Kathleen Caulderwood -

Royal Dutch Shell PLC AMS:RDSA is one of a handful of foreign oil companies selling their assets in Nigeria, as local companies gain ground amid increasing problems with theft and corruption in the Niger Delta.
“We have signed sales and purchase agreements for some of the oil mining leases, but not all that we are seeking to divest,” Shell said in a statement.
Oil theft is a billion-dollar problem in Nigeria, the largest crude producer in Africa. Criminal gangs steal roughly 250,000 barrels per day, according to Reuters. Generally, thieves tap into pipelines in the Delta and pump the crude into waiting boats and barges. And sometimes they even refine it themselves before illicitly selling it to buyers around the world.
Last February, Shell said it was forced to shut down one of its pipelines after thieves drilled holes through it.
“We closed the Nembe Creek Trunkline on Sunday for the removal of crude theft points,” a company spokesman told reporters at the time. Last year, the company’s Nigerian head said Shell lost more than 60,000 barrels a day to theft.
The Nebme Creek line is one of a handful of fields and infrastructure pieces that Shell plans to sell, according to the recent announcement.
The French company Total and Italian Eni are also selling 10 percent and 5 percent shares in similar assets. Meanwhile, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) owns the remaining 55 percent.
The Financial Times reported that insiders say the sale could be worth up to $5.2 billion, with another $10 billion in assets from foreign companies coming up for sale in the next few years.
“It’s a lot of money,” a banker told the FT. “It’s a great display of the strength of the Nigerian indigenous oil industry.”
Shell said earlier this year that it lost more than $1 billion in 2013 thanks to sabotage.
“Nigeria offers a strong enabling environment for the large-scale theft of crude oil,” a 2013 report from London watchdog group Chatham House says.
Nigeria’s government is heavily involved in exports, with plans to further nationalize the industry over the next few years, benefiting companies such as Seplat Petroleum Development Co. (LON:SEPL), which has claimed it experienced “absolutely no” theft last year, and Oando PLC (JSE:OAO).
“The government’s system for selling its own oil attracts many shadowy middlemen, creating a confusing, high-risk marketplace,” Chatham’s researchers wrote.
The former head of Nigeria’s central bank, Lamido Sanusi, was suspended earlier this year after he reported a $20 billion hole in the country’s oil revenues.
To be sure, there are more factors besides instability causing companies to sell certain assets.
“Nigeria’s ‘difficult’ operating environment, security concerns and the non-passage of the [Petroleum Industry Bill] all provide useful cover for what may essentially be a portfolio optimization process,” Razia Khan, head of Africa research at Standard Chartered, said to Reuters.
Despite problems, Nigeria still produces 2 million to 2.5 million barrels per day, the highest production on the continent. "

434,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 27, 2014 11:15AM ET</span>",Climate Change: Global Clothing Firms Seek Cotton Alternatives,"By Maria Gallucci -

Climate change is threatening to damage the cotton crops we need to make jeans, T-shirts, sweaters and other comfy clothing. So the world’s apparel companies are finding alternatives to the fluffy fiber in part to insulate themselves from the effects of rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, heavier rainfall and other impacts, NPR’s Morning Edition reported Wednesday.
VF Corp. NYSE:VFC, which makes Lee and Wrangler jeans, Timberland shoes and The North Face fleece jackets, said it started looking to diversify its raw materials several years ago, after bad weather events in China and Pakistan -- two of the world’s largest cotton growers -- hit the company’s cotton supply. While the crop grows especially well in hot climates, it is extremely sensitive to water. Not enough H20, and cotton chokes at the vine; too much, and its roots rot.
In the coming decades, water scarcity spurred by climate change will likely hit cotton the most in China's Xinjian county, Pakistan, Australia and the western United States, according to the International Trade Center, a joint agency of the World Trade Organization and the United Nations. Extreme heat waves could also harm cotton crops, as will an abundance of insects, which are expected to adapt and thrive in new environmental conditions.
Letitia Webster, VF’s senior director of sustainability, said that the Greensboro, North Carolina-based apparel firm wants to shield itself from those risks -- and protect its bottom line. ""We actually do want to diversify; we want to make sure that we are insulated from some of that,"" she told NPR.
The company is training 400 Chinese farmers to switch to less water-intensive cotton plants. VF is also ramping up its orders of recycled polyester fibers produced by Unifi Manufacturing Inc. NYSE:UFI, also based in Greensboro. Unifi turns plastic waste from bottles and leftover polyester scraps into a textured, yarn-like string, which the company calls Repreve.
Roger Berrier, Unifi's president and chief operating officer, told NPR that the company struggled at first to sell its high-costing Repreve. Now, however, demand is growing 20 percent a year amid rising consumer interest in recycled goods, volatile cotton prices and increasing interest from alternative-seeking firms like VF.
Webster said that over time, the company hopes that by incorporating cotton substitutes on a massive scale, it can help drive down the costs of newer materials like Repreve and protect the company’s supply chain. “It is all about actually reducing risk, which actually does cost,” she told NPR."

444,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2014 07:00PM ET</span>",U.S. readies duties on Mexican sugar in win for sugar lobby,"By Adriana Barrera and Krista Hughes
MEXICO CITY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is set to slap import duties as high as 17 percent on Mexican sugar in a victory for the powerful U.S. sugar industry but a blow to U.S. candy and soft drink makers who face paying more for the sweetener.
Mexican producers urged a deal to end the spat while the government hinted at retaliation, highlighting the potential for Tuesday's Department of Commerce ruling to increase tensions in a months-long trade dispute over claims cheap subsidized sugar is flooding the heavily protected U.S. market.
The duties mean companies like sweets and food makers Hershey Co, Mondelez International Inc, General Mills Inc and drinks makers such as Coca Cola Co will have to pay up to 5 cents per pound extra for imported Mexican sugar, based on current prices.
The United States is a net importer of sugar and Mexico is one of its largest suppliers. Mexican imports are estimated at 2.1 million short tons for the 2013/14 crop year that runs through Sept. 30.
The preliminary decision could still be overturned but is only the first stage of a case which could lead to a further round of levies. It underscores the influence that U.S. cane and beet growers, a relatively small but politically engaged sector in U.S. farming, have over domestic farm and trade policy.
 Out of a total 2.2 million U.S. farms, less than 4,700 grow cane and beet, according to data from the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.
But the sector accounts for a third of the crop industries' campaign donations and 40 percent of crop industries' lobbying expenditures, it said.
 Tuesday's decision is a victory for the American Sugar Alliance (ASA), which represents U.S. sugar farmers and processors and has pushed for an end to free trade with Mexico since sweetener was included in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) six years ago.
The ASA said on Tuesday it expects final countervailing duties would be even higher than the preliminary decision.
""The finding validates our claim that the flood of Mexican sugar, which is harming America's sugar producers and workers, is subsidized by the Mexican government,"" a spokesman said.
Still, one U.S. sugar importer described the duties as ""devastating"", and warned that U.S. prices would likely rise in line with the new tariff.
U.S. prices are already above the global market because of a government subsidy program that sets minimum prices.
Under the ruling, sugar from state-owned Mexican mills - which account for a fifth of production - will attract duties of 17.01 percent, compared to 2.99 percent for private sector Grupo Azucarero Mexico producers and 14.87 percent for all other producers.
Mexico sugar chamber president Juan Cortina said the industry was prepared to cap exports in exchange for suspending duties, as long as any deal allowed minimum exports of 1 million tonnes per cycle.
The chamber believed a deal could be reached before the U.S. rules on the anti-dumping section of the case in October - which could lead to more duties. U.S. producers claim Mexican sugar is sold at 45 percent or more below fair value.
The U.S. International Trade Commission is also conducting a parallel investigation into whether the imports injure local growers. Its final verdict is due in February.
CONSUMERS PAY THE PRICE
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack has said he would encourage a settlement, but U.S. lawmakers, food manufacturers and commercial users of sugar have warned a deal would inflate food prices and threaten U.S. food manufacturers.
""The likely result is that the growers, particularly in the United States, will make more money, and the consumers will pick up the tab,"" said National Foreign Trade Council president Bill Reinsch.
The Sweetener Users Association said Mexico had become a scapegoat for the failings of the U.S. sugar program and critics argue the case could prompt retaliation against U.S. high-fructose corn syrup.
Mexico's Economy Ministry said the decision was a setback in trade relations and that Mexico will defend its rights and exhaust the legal options to protect its interests under NAFTA and the World Trade Organization.
Concerns about tightening supplies in the United States have pushed domestic prices up 18 percent since the case was filed in March.
Second-month U.S. domestic raw sugar futures traded in New York jumped to a two-week high of 26.75 cents a lb in thin trade after the news but pared the gains by the close.
In the meantime, traders braced for volatile and uncertain trading conditions ahead of the government's decision on antidumping duties on Oct. 24.

""The dumping duty is the big one. This (Tuesday's ruling) should encourage Mexico to try to get a deal, and strengthen the conviction of the (U.S. sugar industry),"" said Frank Jenkins, president of Connecticut brokerage JSG Commodities.

455,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2014 03:50AM ET</span>",Thai rubber farmers feel 'betrayed' by military government,"By Apornrath Phoonphongphiphat
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai rubber farmers who supported anti-government protests that led to a military coup in May say they feel betrayed because the ruling military is failing to help soften the blow of plunging rubber prices.
Thailand is the world's largest rubber producer and exporter, but falling prices and a decision by the military not to extend subsidies risks alienating rubber farmers, most of whom are in the south.
Rubber farmer Somkid Unping joined demonstrations that began late last year, backed by the royalist establishment and aimed at bringing down the populist government of then Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.
The government was ousted in a May 22 coup but Somkid, from the southern province of Surat Thani, said his hopes for a better deal for rubber farmers in return for their loyalty had been dashed.
""We stayed for months because we believed that a new government would not neglect us,"" Somkid said.
""We feel betrayed.""
The junta has tried to step back from a culture of subsidies across the agricultural sector although junta leader General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who became prime minister on Monday, has said the government would offer some help, including soft loans for producers to buy fertilizer.
But disgruntled farmers say that is not enough.
Six rubber farmers' associations are expected to meet General Chatchai Sarikalaya, a member of the ruling National Council for Peace and Order, on Monday to voice their concern.
""We heard General Prayuth say on television last week that he cares about rubber farmers but the intention to help has come too late,"" Boonsong Nabtong, chairman of the Federation of Rubber Planters Association of Thailand and a supporter of the pro-establishment Democrat Party, told Reuters.
There were no plans to protest, he said.
FALLING GLOBAL DEMAND
A bastion of the Democrat Party, southern Thailand is the main rubber-growing region.
The six months of protests in Bangkok that helped bring about the ouster of Yingluck's government were led by Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy premier in a government run by the Democrat Party. Suthep, a southerner, called on rubber farmers to help bolster the protests.
Thailand produced 4.2 million tonnes of rubber in 2013, of which 3.7 tonnes were for export, generating about 200 billion baht ($6.27 billion).
This year, because of falling global demand, physical rubber prices have fallen 24 percent, with the benchmark Thai smoked rubber sheet (RSS3) dropping to $1.85 per kg on Tuesday, from $2.45 early this year, far below the record of $6.40 per kg set in 2011 when demand from China was strong.
Yingluck's government spent 22 billion baht ($690 million) building rubber stockpiles under state-funded price support programs that included buying rubber at above-market rates.
The program mirrored a money-guzzling rice subsidy program that cost taxpayers billions of dollars and fueled opposition to the government from the establishment.
The military's 2015 budget plan has already sparked criticism from some politicians for allocating too much money to compensate for the previous administration's failed populist policies.
But some farmers said they are not looking for handouts but instead wanted the military government to support prices by holding back stocks. The military government approved a plan on Monday to sell its 200,000 tons rubber stockpile.

In Libya earlier, Islamist-led militias seized control over the Tripoli airport, while in Iraq, concerns began to build that multinational force may be needed to halt the ISIS Sunni insurgency all while fears persist the Russia-Ukraine conflict could escalate.
Still, despite the ongoing nature of geopolitical concerns, oil continues to flow, which pushed prices down on Monday due to perceptions that the global economy is awash in crude.
Soft U.S. housing data watered down prices as well.
The U.S. Commerce Department reported earlier that U.S. new home sales dropped by 2.4% to 412,000 units last month, confounding expectations for an increase of 5.7% to 430,000.
New home sales in June were revised up to 422,000 units from a previously reported 406,000 units.

459,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2014 06:31PM ET</span>","Remote, gas-rich islands on Indonesia's South China Sea frontline","By Andrew R.C. Marshall
RANAI Indonesia (Reuters) - The word ""sleepy"" could have been invented for Ranai, the largest town in Indonesia's remote and sparsely populated Natuna archipelago.
It has few cars and only two sets of traffic lights. The cloud-wreathed mountain looming over it resembles a slumbering volcano. Nearby beaches lie pristine and empty, waiting for tourists. 
 From Ranai, it takes an imaginative leap to see Natuna - a scattering of 157 mostly uninhabited islands off the northwest coast of Borneo - as a future flashpoint in the escalating dispute over ownership of the South China Sea, one of the world's busiest waterways.
But that's precisely what many people here fear.
 They know Natuna is quite a prize. Its fish-rich waters are routinely plundered by foreign trawlers. Lying just inside its 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone is the East Natuna gas field, one of the world's largest untapped reserves.
And any quarrel over Natuna would also upset a delicate strategic balance, undermining Indonesia's role as a self-appointed honest broker in the myriad territorial disputes between its Southeast Asian neighbors and regional giant China.
Jakarta's foreign ministry insists there is no problem with China over the status of Natuna, but the Indonesian military has in recent months struck a more assertive tone.
In April, Indonesian armed forces chief Moeldoko accused China of including parts of Natuna within its so-called ""Nine-Dash Line,"" the vague boundary used on Chinese maps to lay claim to about 90 percent of the South China Sea.
EARLY WARNING SYSTEM 
 With maritime tensions rising between China and the Philippines and Vietnam, Moeldoko later vowed to send more troops to Natuna ""to anticipate any instability in the South China Sea and serve as an early warning system for Indonesia"".
 The airforce plans to upgrade Ranai's airbase to accommodate fighter jets and attack helicopters.
 Officially, China and Indonesia don't contest the sovereignty of the islands: both agree they are part of Indonesia's Riau Province. Nor is Indonesia among the five countries - Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan and Brunei - challenging Beijing's expansive claims in the South China Sea.
 This has allowed Jakarta to play a neutral role and seek to mediate in an increasingly bitter and volatile dispute. 
 But Natuna's bit-part in this regional drama reflects ""growing concern within Indonesia about China's actions within the Nine-Dash Line,"" said Ian Storey, a security expert at the Institute of Southeast Asia Studies (ISEAS) in Singapore. 
 Rising maritime tensions with China have induced many Southeast Asian countries to seek closer strategic ties with the United States.
 Since 2010 Indonesia has unsuccessfully sought clarification through the United Nations of the legal basis for the Nine-Dash Line. Indonesia's foreign minister, Marty Natalegawa, told Reuters in April that Indonesia had ""inferred"" from China that the line did not cross Indonesian territory.
 Locals remain unconvinced. ""We're worried they'll take over this territory,"" Ilyas Sabli, Natuna's regent, or district chief, told Reuters, referring to the Chinese. ""That's why it has become our first priority to protect this homeland.""
 DEFENDING OIL AND GAS
 About 80,000 people live on 27 of Natuna's islands, mostly in Ranai and other places on the main island of Natuna Besar.
 Ranai airbase was developed after Indonesia's independence in 1949, and the town grew up around it. Today, a new civilian passenger terminal is being constructed in the hope of attracting more investors and tourists. 
 There was no evidence of an Indonesian military build-up. Two small naval ships lay idle at the end of a nearby pier.
 Plans to upgrade the airbase were ""not a new thing"", but part of a longer-term strategy to improve the airforce's far-flung facilities, base commander Lieutenant Colonel Andri Gandhy told Reuters.
 The plans include lengthening Ranai's runway to handle larger aircraft. Work will start in 2015 or 2016, depending on the funding, said Gandhy.
 Any military build-up would be hampered by budget restraints and fear of antagonizing China, said Yohanes Sulaiman, a security analyst at the Indonesian National Defense University.
 ""The Indonesian military really wants to defend the islands, but with what? How can they fight China?"" he said.
 Neighboring Malaysia has a more convincing blueprint to beef up its military presence in the South China Sea. 
 In October, Malaysia announced plans to build a navy base in Bintulu on Sarawak, the closest major town to the James Shoal, a submerged reef about 80 km (50 miles) off the coast of Malaysia's Sarawak claimed by Malaysia, China and Taiwan. Chinese warships conducted exercises nearby in 2013 and 2014.
The base will host a new Marine Corps, modeled on, and possibly trained by, its U.S. counterpart. Without mentioning China, Malaysia's defense minister said the aim was to protect Malaysia's oil and gas reserves.
 China has never protested against Indonesia's search for oil and gas in Natuna waters, said Storey. The state-owned Pertamina is co-developing the East Natuna gas field with Exxon Mobil Corp, Total SA and PTT Exploration and Production.
 FISHING WARS
 As in Vietnam and the Philippines, it is Indonesia's fishing fleet that feels China's growing maritime presence most acutely.
 Natuna fish stocks plummeted with the arrival of big-net trawlers from China, Vietnam, Thailand and Taiwan, said Rusli Suhardi, 40, a leader of the local fishermen's cooperative. 
 ""Before 2010, we could catch 100 kg (220 lbs) of fish a day. Now it takes three days to catch that amount,"" he said. 
 A nearby bay is littered with the disintegrating wrecks of a dozen or more boats, mostly Vietnamese trawlers confiscated by the Indonesian authorities for fishing illegally. That no Chinese trawlers rot in this marine graveyard is testament to China's growing maritime muscle. 
 In March 2013, armed Chinese vessels confronted a patrol boat from Indonesia's maritime and fisheries ministry and demanded the release of Chinese fishermen who had just been apprehended in Natuna waters. Fearing for his safety, the captain of the Indonesian boat complied.
 Similarly, in 2010, a Chinese maritime enforcement vessel compelled an Indonesian patrol boat to release another illegal Chinese trawler.
 Storey, of ISEAS, said Indonesia has downplayed such incidents, not wanting them to overshadow relations with China.
Those relations are historic. Predating Ranai's airbase is the ethnic Chinese community of Penagi, a ramshackle village built on stilts along a nearby pier. One of its oldest residents is Lim Po Eng, 78, a retired laborer, who said Penagi was founded by his grandfather and others fleeing chaos and poverty in China.
""We settled here and began to develop the place,"" he said. The island was already inhabited by indigenous people, added Lim, ""but they lived in the bush.""
Every morning, an Indonesian flag is raised over Penagi's pier. Many locals say the Indonesian government cares little about the fate of Natuna, which lies closer to Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur than it does to Jakarta.
But this apparent indifference is bred partly by a desire to keep the status quo, said security analyst Sulaiman.
""The government knows there are no good options,"" he said. ""They can't fight China, but if they don't push their claims Indonesia will become a laughing stock.""

460,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 25, 2014 05:15PM ET</span>","A Mining Company, An Ancient City And 5.5 Million Tons Of Copper ","By Kathleen Caulderwood -

Over a decade ago, the world was outraged when the Taliban destroyed two massive Buddha statues in Afghanistan’s Bamiyan valley in a vendetta against all Islamic art. Today, an even larger and older collection of artifacts is under threat, but this time the conflict has more to do with economics than religion.
Mes Aynak is a 9,800-acre archaeological site in Afghanistan’s Logar Province. It was once a major city on the ancient Silk road, and is home to structures dating back more than 2,600 years. Archaeologists say it’s a cultural goldmine, but others are more concerned with what lies beneath it -- 5.5 million metric tons of high-grade copper ore. 
Six years ago, China’s largest mining company signed a $3 billion agreement with the Afghan government for rights to the site, a move cheered for its potential to boost jobs and the country’s struggling economy. But the decision left archaeologists scrambling to recover what cultural heritage they could before work on the mine began. Even though the company has delayed its project for other reasons, tight budgets and a lack of assistance from the Afghan government means the ancient city is far from safe.
 An ancient Buddhist stupa uncovered at the Mes Aynak archaeological site.
“It was very clear since the beginning that the provisional schedule for mining was overly optimistic,” said Philippe Marquis, an archaeologist at the French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan (DAFA) which started working at Mes Aynak a year after the deal was inked.
The area itself, which is just under an hour’s drive from Kabul, is home to some of the oldest Buddhist artifacts in Central Asia. So far, archaeologists have identified more than 70 separate archaeological sites in the valley, including a handful of monasteries, monuments and more than 1,000 statues.
Experts have called the site “one of the most intriguing ancient mining sites in Central Asia, if not the world,” noting the city’s religious and economic significance over the past millennia.

Funded by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they gave Afghan archaeologists more than $1.5 million worth of equipment and provided guidance for the project. A year later, the World Bank asked their group to assess the site and propose a working timeline. Since then,  the plan has been amended at least 20 times.
“The main problem of this excavation is the very low level of local expertise and the lack of infrastructure,” Marquis said. “The quality of excavation is not very high but the biggest problem is the management of what has been found.”
Archaeologists are currently using a strategy known as “rescue excavation,” which is similar to the way looters operate. While traditional methods would require workers to painstakingly uncover, document and preserve the site as it is, archaeologists are now just trying to record what they find and remove anything valuable before its too late.
In 2008, the China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) promised $3 billion to the Afghanistan Ministry of Mines for a 30-year lease on the site, with plans to start digging within five years, and build railways and other infrastructure projects to support the mine.
“As Afghanistan emerges from conflict and transitions from an economy supported by large amounts of foreign aid to a self-sustaining economy, it needs to use its natural resources to help fuel growth,” World Bank researchers wrote in a report on the project at the time, adding that the country has an estimated $1 trillion in natural resource assets.
They also projected that the Mes Aynak project in particular would create 12,000 direct jobs and 62,500 “induced” jobs while adding $250 million in annual revenues once the mine hit capacity -- -- no small thing considering more than 90 percent of Afghanistan’s current economy depends on aid and military spending.

“The Aynak project represents the largest private sector project in the country’s history, and it will generate more jobs, revenues and enhancements to Afghanistan’s infrastructure than any other single project to-date,” the Afghan Ministry of Mines wrote in a 2012 statement.
But not everyone was as pleased.
The Afghan government has never published details of the agreement, despite widespread criticism from watchdog organizations such as Global Witness, which investigates economic networks behind conflict, corruption and environmental destruction.
In their 2012 report “Copper Bottomed?” Global Witness researchers outlined the various problems with the deal’s transparency.
“Since the whole contract has never been published, it’s hard to evaluate what exactly has been promised,” said Jodi Vittori, the firm’s Afghanistan-based policy advisor. She explained that the lack of data amid a swirl of rumors has made it difficult to determine whether any party is being taken advantage of. Meanwhile, many are worried that the country could be experiencing a “resource curse.”
While the site would provide necessary jobs and an economic boost, she and others fear that the Chinese deal, shrouded in mystery, could put Afghanistan at risk of a “resource curse,” in which foreign investors take advantage of its massive mineral stores without much help to the country.
Indeed, it wouldn’t be the first time China would be accused of such things. The vast majority of Chinese investment in other developing regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, is focused on resources, which has led to a great deal of criticism and claims that the economic heavyweight is exploiting low-income countries.

“My fear is that people won’t really care about this until after the fact,” said Brent Huffman, a documentary filmmaker and professor at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, who has been reporting the excavation process since 2011.
His documentary “Saving Mes Aynak” follows the local Afghan archaeologists working at the site. In January the film was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Grant and was recently picked up by Kartemquin Films.
“My fear is that this is just another way Afghanistan is going to lose. With Chinese and Indian companies taking valuable resources out of the country, Afghanistan is left with these toxic craters. My fear is that Mes Aynak is a stepping stone towards that,” Huffman said.
In Afghanistan, “China is generally viewed in the region as a benign power, because it doesn’t get involved politically,” said Marvin Weinbaum, political science professor at the University, who formerly worked for the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
“That said, it doesn’t want the place to become chaotic,” he said, referring to this year’s election which, fraught with charges of fraud and corruption, has only served to increase tensions in the country as it plans a transition to a self-sustaining economy.
Amid the instability, MCC moved to renegotiate its contract, delaying the dig in the face of a slowing Chinese economy, falling copper prices and increased instability. But while the development should have given archaeologists more time to work, that isn’t exactly the case. In the face of budgetary mismanagement and growing insecurity, recovery work on the site has ground to a hault.
“All budget for archaeology got stuck somewhere between the Ministries of Finance and Mines,” Marek Lemiesz, an archaeologist with the Afghan Ministry of Mines, told International Business Times. “It seems to be now clear to everybody that Mes Aynak should be, in normal circumstances, excavated for at least 20 years and we have been given a maximum three years.”

He said that all archaeological activities were cut off in May on order from the Ministry of Mines for a variety of reasons. Among other reasons, the Afghan archaeologists hadn’t been paid for more than seven months and finally went on strike.
But it’s not just getting paid, workers are also worried about their safety. This year’s Afghan election was fraught with fears of fraud and corruption that have only increased tensions, especially in the rural areas where local groups can pose a threat to foreign workers.
“Another serious issue is a significantly decreased security in Logar,” Lemiesz said. “In the past months we were faced with a series of serious incidents such as rocket attacks, IEDs set inside the so-called ‘Security Zone’,” he said, adding that he was “seriously concerned” about the safety of expats on the ground.
The region is an important one for China. “There are so many factors that make Chinese investment of economic, political and strategic capital in the region a logical posture,” Kendrick Kuo, China and foreign policy specialist and author of the Asian Crescent blog.
He said that Chinese interest in the region goes as far back as the 1980s. While its largest competitor there is Russia, its advantage is a larger economic clout.
“The delay on the Mes Aynak mine is arguably a wait-and-see tactic to see how the chips fall,” Kuo said. “China can’t help but to be involved in Afghanistan, especially economically, but it is also not as risk-tolerant as some may think,” he said.
The city is still likely doomed to be demolished and replaced with a copper mine, but for now, that fate may be delayed for a bit longer. "

462,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 25, 2014 02:15PM ET</span>",Enbridge Pumps More Canadian Oil To US Amid KXL Delays,"By Maria Gallucci -

Enbridge Inc. NYSE:ENB is steadily advancing plans to build a pipeline network akin to the Keystone XL. The Calgary-based company is progressing on at least two projects in the works that will help it move more Canadian tar sands oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast, according to recently revealed documents and a federal ruling last week.
In one project, Enbridge is proposing to switch crude oil from one pipeline to another before it crosses into the United States – a move that enables the company to circumvent a lengthy federal permitting process. Environmental groups first learned about the plan, which wasn’t previously publicized, after the U.S. State Department released documents related to the crude switch. The organizations, including the National Wildlife Federation and Sierra Club, flagged the plans to the media on Thursday.
The same green groups last week decried a federal judge's decision to let a second Enbridge project move forward. The company is building a $1.9 billion line between Pontiac, Illinois and Cushing, Oklahoma, which will link together two existing pipelines and effectively achieve what the Keystone XL aims to do: connect oil fields in the Alberta province to refineries in Texas. Environmentalists had sued to require that the project undergo an extensive environmental review.
Enbridge’s maneuvers join an array of efforts by North American energy firms to alleviate the crude oil bottleneck in Canada’s tar sands region. The lack of existing infrastructure – and major environmental opposition to new pipelines – is delaying deliveries out of Alberta and depressing the price that developers can fetch for their crude. In the absence of TransCanada Corp.'s NYSE:TRP Keystone XL, companies are racing to capitalize on the demand for more capacity.
“Everybody is looking at other ways of moving crude from Alberta to the U.S., and they’re having to be creative … and do a variety of smaller things that can accomplish the same goal,” John Auers, executive vice president of Turner, Mason & Co., a Dallas-based engineering consultancy, told International Business Times. Enbridge’s plans are “just a logical extension of that strategy.”
U.S. and Canadian environmentalists are mobilizing to block such strategies, which they warn could undermine any global or national efforts to scale back global warming pollution. Mining and processing tar sands crude oil emits more carbon dioxide than conventional oil extraction. The crude itself has also proven to be more difficult to clean up when it spills into waterways.
For the oil-switching project, Enbridge would build four links between its Alberta Clipper line and the adjacent Line 3, both of which are in operation. The connector would allow Enbridge to transfer oil from the Clipper to Line 3 in Gretna, Manitoba, about 1.5 miles north of the border with North Dakota. About 16 miles into the United States, Line 3 would transfer the oil back to the Clipper, which connects to terminals in Superior, Wisconsin.
Enbridge detailed the plans in a June letter to the U.S. State Department, which oversees cross-border infrastructure projects. The company is applying to nearly double the Clipper’s capacity to 880,000 barrels a day, a proposal that remains under the agency’s review. In a July 24 letter, a mid-level State Department official said that Enbridge could proceed with its plan.
Environmental groups charge that the move is illegal. “It’s just blatantly in violation of what the law requires,” Jim Murphy, senior counsel for the National Wildlife Federation, said in an interview. He noted that the Clipper expansion proposal is undergoing an extensive environmental review, and that allowing Enbridge to move more oil via Line 3 “makes the current permitting process basically meaningless … It amounts to an illegal approval of their expansion plans with no public process.”
Enbridge spokeswoman Terri Larson said that the State Department “has been fully briefed on the interconnection plans and has confirmed that this work does not require any federal approvals, nor does it require any state, or local approvals in the U.S.” In a statement provided to IB Times, she said that the project is part of Enbridge’s “system optimization efforts to provide the flexibility and efficiency to transport increased volumes of crude oil from Canada into the United States under our existing presidential permits.”
Larson noted that that work on the four interconnections is “well underway” and is expected to be “substantially completed” this September.
Murphy said his organization is considering legal options to stop the Clipper-Line 3 connection project, though environmental groups hope that by bringing the plans to the public’s attention, they can pressure government officials to revoke their approval.
The talk of a legal fight comes just days after National Wildlife Federation and Sierra Club lost their challenge to Enbridge’s Illinois-to-Oklahoma pipeline. The groups argued that the government violated the National Environmental Protection Act by failing to conduct an environmental impact review. Construction on the project began about a year ago.
On August 18, a U.S. district ruled that because the 600-mile line is primarily on privately-owned land – and is entirely within U.S. borders – “no federal statue authorizes the federal government to oversee or regulation the construction project,” according to a written opinion. When complete, the Flanagan South Pipeline Project will have an initial capacity of 600,000 barrels of oil per day and eventually ramp up to 880,000 barrels – slightly more than the proposed capacity of the Keystone XL. The pipeline will also cross through Missouri and Kansas.
As Enbridge advances its plans, however, TransCanada’s Keystone XL remains mired in delays. The project awaits a federal permit from the Obama administration, which is under increasing pressure from the project’s backers and opponents to make a decision about the 1,179-mile pipeline. If built, the Keystone XL would carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta down to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would connect with an existing southern leg that runs to refineries in the Texas Gulf Coast.
Obama has postponed his decision until a legal dispute in the Nebraska Supreme Court is resolved. That might not happen until 2015. Three landowners are challenging a state law that gave Gov. Dave Heineman the power to approve the 300-mile pipeline section in Nebraska. In February, a district court judge ruled in the landowners’ favor and invalidated the route. Heineman has asked the state Supreme Court to overrule that decision. While the court is expected to hear oral arguments from both sides on September 5, a final ruling probably won’t be delivered until the new year."

465,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2014 11:30AM ET</span>",Brazil's drought-hit coffee belt turns to machines to lower costs,"By Caroline Stauffer
COMUNIDADE DOS MARTINS Brazil (Reuters) - Years of low coffee prices followed by the worst drought in decades in Brazil have pushed even the smallest family farmers to buy modern machinery rather than rely on increasingly scarce and expensive labor.
Brazil's crop supply agency Conab noted an ""intense trade in machinery, mainly harvesters,"" in the main coffee-growing states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais this season, in response to a 46 percent average rise in day laborer wages from a year earlier.
Large producers in Brazil, which supplies about a third of the world's coffee, started buying machinery, much of it from the United States, 15 years ago. Now modernization has become a necessity for cash-strapped small farmers.
Michael Reguim, 26, purchased an automated harvester in 2008 and this season became the first in his mountain community of 82 farmers to buy a machine that strips the skin off coffee cherries, a job he previously paid four people to do.
""You used to buy machinery to try to improve margins – now you do it to survive,"" said Reguim, showing off the two-storey contraption imported from Colombia that he bought and installed for 72,000 reais ($31,718), with a government loan.
The machine has the added benefit of reducing water consumption in a region that saw drought sap at least 30 percent off 2014 coffee output. Reguim originally expected to harvest 4,000 bags of coffee in southern Minas Gerais this year.
""Now, I'll be happy with 2,000. If I hadn't mechanized I would not survive this,"" he said of the drought.
Coffee is the only major export commodity that is still produced by a significant number of small families in Brazil, which has evolved from a net food importer into a modern agricultural superpower over the last few decades with grain fields as sophisticated as those in the United States.
In southern Minas Gerais, a region responsible for a quarter of Brazil's coffee, half of all harvesting is now automated, up from 20 percent five years ago, said Luiz Reis, an agronomist at the government's rural assistance agency Emater. He expects field work there to be 70 percent automated next year. Some remote mountain regions are impossible to harvest mechanically.
Bruno Reguim Filho, Michael Reguim's cousin, bought an automated harvester with his brother last year and plans to pay off a loan he used to pay for it over 10 years. Unable to find willing coffee pickers in 2013, he hired 20 migrant workers from Bahia state, 1,000 kilometers away.
Now, Bruno's harvesting costs dropped from 300 reais per hectare to 100 reais per hectare with automation, he said, as a whirring machine whisked the last of 2014's ripe coffee cherries into a giant sack.
Even though arabica prices rose 55 percent in the last 12 months to their highest in two years after the drought, farmers said they are still struggling to compensate for smaller output.
""Even with mechanization, costs are very high. Anyone who isn't mechanized is not able to make ends meet,"" said Luiz de Castro Junior, an economist and associate professor at the federal university in Lavras, Minas Gerais.

478,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 23, 2014 11:50PM ET</span>","Behind Indonesia mining deal, newly minted minister and U.S. mining legend","By Randy Fabi, Fergus Jensen and Michael Taylor
JAKARTA (Reuters) - As negotiations to resolve an increasingly bitter dispute over Indonesian mining rules teetered on the brink of collapse, the chairman of Freeport-McMoRan Inc James ""Jim Bob"" Moffett flew to Jakarta for last-ditch talks.
Indonesia's chief economics minister, Chairul Tanjung, said he had got to a point where he felt only talking directly to the 76-year-old U.S. mining legend might break a deadlock in the six-month row, which had already cost Southeast Asia's top economy more than $1 billion and put thousands of jobs at risk.
In less than two hours the two men had reached an agreement, setting the stage to resume exports and restore badly needed government revenue to the world's fourth most populous nation.
""I just convinced him that this was the maximum the government can give,"" Tanjung said in an interview. ""He believed me, I believed him and we shook hands. Very simple.""
Tanjung, one of Indonesia's richest businessmen, was appointed minister in May and made reaching a deal to get mining exports going again a priority to revive an economy suffering its sharpest slowdown since the global financial crisis.
But a looming presidential election had made it even harder to reach a politically unpopular compromise with foreign miners.
Aside from any chemistry between the two successful businessmen, the breakthrough came because Moffett had taken a more flexible approach, said Tanjung.
The dispute with Freeport had centered on its refusal to pay an escalating mineral concentrate export tax and its bid to extend its mining contract. The meeting was only attended by a small number of Indonesian officials and Freeport, and according to Tanjung the solution was to focus on what the two could agree on to get exports restarted and set other issues aside for now.
Freeport agreed to a $115 million downpayment for a smelter, to pay higher royalties and divest more of its Indonesian unit.
Indonesia in return substantially cut the concentrate export tax for Freeport and other miners building smelters.
Moffett is a likeable and larger-than-life Louisiana businessman, known for his Elvis impersonations during lighter moments, but also a shrewd deal maker.
Starting his career as a wildcat prospector in Louisiana, Moffett founded McMoRan Oil & Gas Co with two of his partners in 1969 and put together the merger with Freeport 12 years later.
With a 47-year history in Indonesia, Freeport's fortunes were transformed by the discovery of the Grasberg mine in Papua, one of the world's biggest deposits of gold and copper.
Helped by Moffett's ties to late autocratic President Suharto, Freeport won the right in 1988 to mine Grasberg, which has been a lightning rod for grievances over its impact on the environment, security arrangements and revenue sharing.
The recent talks did not touch on Freeport's controversial links to the Suharto family or environmental issues, said Sukhyar, director general for coal and minerals at the ministry, who played a role in the negotiations.
HIGH STAKES
In January, Indonesia introduced a mineral ore export ban and the escalating tax on metal concentrate shipments in a bid to force miners to process raw materials to lift their value.
But the tough measures in some cases backfired as miners such as Freeport and Newmont Mining Corp said the rules breached their contracts and exports stopped.
The stakes were high on both sides.
The Grasberg complex in Papua provided around a fifth of Freeport's global revenue last year.
In Indonesia, the company employs 24,000 including contractors, and is one of the country's largest tax payers.
Freeport believed the new mining rules, particularly the export tax, violated its contract. The company refused to pay the tax and invest in a copper smelter unless the government provided assurances it would be allowed to continue operating after its contract expires in 2021.
Freeport wanted certainty to spend more than $15 billion to build what would be the world's biggest underground mine, while the government said it could not renegotiate until 2019, two years before the contract expired.
Freeport Indonesia CEO Rozik Soetjipto said the breakthrough came when the new minister arrived with a business background.
""He understood that it is impossible for a company to continue such huge investments if there are no legal guarantees for the long term continuation and fiscal certainty.""
A trained dentist, Tanjung, 52, was ranked as Indonesia's fifth-richest man by Forbes with a net wealth of $4 billion. His company CT Corp now operates two of the country's top five TV stations and has retail and banking interests.
DENGUE FEVER
Freeport had sent its chief executive, Richard Adkerson, to Jakarta in June to focus on negotiating a deal.
Despite weeks of talks, which included meeting at a Jakarta hospital after a senior negotiator fell ill with dengue fever, the two sides remained deadlocked.
""Adkerson was here for a month. He was running from pillar to post and nothing was happening,"" said a senior industry official with knowledge of the negotiations, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.
According to the minister, Adkerson, an accountant by training, wanted to stick very closely to the terms of Freeport's contract.
""He wanted to continue their Contract of Work. He wanted to keep paying the same royalties – the old rate,"" Tanjung said.
Freeport's Soetjipto said Adkerson's contribution in reaching a deal was ""very important"".
Requests for comment from Moffett and Adkerson sought via a spokesman at Freeport's head office in Phoenix were declined.
An emailed statement said: ""the Company and its executives have sought to engage in constructive discussions and to maintain good relations with Indonesian officials including the President, Ministers, Parliamentary representatives, and local officials of each respective administration.""
""BIGGER PICTURE""
By the end of June, talks were at a breaking point and some were questioning whether Freeport had a future in Indonesia.
""I told them, 'If they want to continue business here I don't want to discuss it with Adkerson any more,'"" Tanjung said. ""I want to talk with the chairman.""
At the same time, negotiations with Indonesia's second-biggest copper producer Newmont also reached an impasse and the U.S. miner decided to file for international arbitration.
The move soured relations and the government threatened to terminate Newmont's contract if the company did not withdraw its legal challenge.
Freeport chose a different path and decided instead to keep negotiating, with Moffett flying to Jakarta.
At the private meeting in Jakarta in early July, Tanjung and Moffett agreed to leave the most contentious issues over contract renegotiations to the next government and instead focus on getting exports restarted.
Tanjung told Reuters he felt he needed to bring Moffett in because ""as a chairman you can see a bigger picture.""
A memorandum of understanding that was initially 90-pages long was whittled down to just 10 pages, the bare bones of what the two sides could agree on, said an industry official with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named.
The government also agreed to a framework valid for at least six months that could be used to renegotiate the contract under the next administration.
The final step left was for the cabinet and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to approve the MOU, though the unfolding presidential election delayed ratification and there were concerns the deal could still fall through.

But finally drawing a line under the near seven-month dispute, a shipment of 10,000 tonnes of copper concentrate left Indonesia for China on Aug. 8.

Speaking at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual Jackson Hole symposium, Janet Yellen said the U.S. economy is recovering and added the labor market is improving as well.
""More jobs have now been created in the recovery than were lost in the downturn, with payroll employment in May of this year finally exceeding the previous peak in January 2008. Job gains in 2014 have averaged 230,000 a month, up from the 190,000 a month pace during the preceding two years,"" Yellen said in prepared remarks of her speech.
""The unemployment rate, at 6.2 percent in July, has declined nearly 4 percentage points from its late 2009 peak. Over the past year, the unemployment rate has fallen considerably, and at a surprisingly rapid pace.""
Yellen's comments sparked a rally earlier for the dollar, which trades inversely with gold, though the yellow metal rebounded after markets concluded that the Fed will still take its time raising interest rates to avoid disrupting recovery.
""Underutilization of labor resources still remains significant. Given this assessment and the Committee's expectation that inflation will gradually move up toward its longer-run objective, the Committee reaffirmed its view 'that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after our current asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored,'"" Yellen said in prepared remarks of her speech.

Tropical weather systems in the Gulf of Mexico often send prices rising, as rigs are evacuated and supply slows.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in September traded at $3.866 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, down 0.60%. The commodity hit a session low of $3.851, and a high of $3.894.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $3.786 per million British thermal units, Thursday's low, and resistance at $3.955, Thursday's high.
A low-pressure system in the western Atlantic Ocean appeared poised to develop into a tropical cyclone, with the National Hurricane Center giving the storm a 60% chance of becoming a tropical depression in 48 hours and a 80% chance in 5 days.
Still, the latest model runs at the time of writing appeared to keep the system in the Atlantic Ocean and out of the gas-rich Gulf of Mexico, which allowed natural prices to soften on Friday.
Investors also digested Thursday's bearish supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended Aug. 15 rose by 88 billion cubic feet, surpassing expectations for an increase of 83 billion cubic feet, which sent prices falling earlier Thursday.
Inventories rose by 58 billion cubic feet in the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average change is a build of 48 billion cubic feet.
Injections of gas into storage have surpassed the five-year average for 18 consecutive weeks, alleviating concerns over tightening supplies.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.467 trillion cubic feet. Stocks were 500 billion cubic feet less than last year at this time and 535 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 3.090 trillion cubic feet for this time of year.

486,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2014 03:37PM ET</span>",Exclusive: France forced to import wheat as rain hits crop quality,"By Valerie Parent 
PARIS (Reuters) - France's rain-hit wheat crop has delivered the first shock of the 2014/15 season: the EU's top grower and exporter is buying Lithuanian and British milling wheat to mix with its unusually poor-grade crop to meet contracts signed before the harvest. 
French exports exceed those of Britain and Lithuania on the world market, but a wet summer has meant France is set to produce more wheat for animal feed and less higher grade bread-making grain this year. 
The imports are the latest signal that France might struggle to retain its market share of milling wheat exports this season because a large part of its crop is failing to live up to its traditional clients' criteria. 
During the past 13 years for which Reuters has records, France has only once imported significant amounts of Lithuanian wheat. 
That was during the 2010/2011 season, which was also beset by quality problems. 
The total amount imported then, at 22,600 tonnes, was less than the single shipment of 27,500 tonnes of high protein-content wheat, which trade and port sources told Reuters was being unloaded at the Port of Rouen on Thursday. 
The French imports point to the potential for more unusual global grain trade flows this season. 
""Clearly there is a significant quantity of feed wheat in France which is normally not there, therefore they are struggling to fulfill some of their normal export destinations and obligations,"" said a trader in Britain. 
""Consequently grain has been bought to replace that French wheat from Scandinavia, Germany, Poland, the UK."" 
France's key markets in North Africa, particularly the world's fourth-largest wheat importer Algeria, are expected to look beyond their traditional supplier for future purchases but in the meantime, French exporters are meeting existing contracts by mixing in higher quality foreign wheat. 
""I think that France will certainly have a problem with high-volume sales to some of its traditional markets this year, especially Algeria and Morocco,"" a German trader said. 
""The French are also likely to be aggressive sellers of feed wheat which could be offered in the Arabian and Asian markets as a competitor to corn,"" he added. 
As for British milling wheat, a shipment of 3,000 tonnes reached Dunkirk earlier this week. A second, for 4,400 tonnes, was in Rouen on Thursday, and others should follow, the sources said. 
Britain, which had a reasonably good quality harvest this season, is a more regular supplier of wheat to France, but its exports are usually aimed at the lower quality animal feed market. 
FRENCH WHEAT MISSING ALGERIA STANDARDS 
While quality readings are still emerging in France, reports so far suggest a large portion of the crop will fail to meet the flour-making standards of its traditional markets outside the EU, mainly its top client Algeria. 
Britain is already eyeing increased market share in Algeria, with one trader estimating exports of 0.5 million tonnes by the end of the year. 
""I wouldn't rule out a record year of exports to Algeria,"" said Jack Watts, senior analyst at Britain's Home-Grown Cereals Authority. 
This could lead France to ship more wheat within the bloc than on the world market for the first time in seven years. 
The main quality concern has been weak Hagberg falling numbers, a measure of the flour-making quality of wheat and one that is hard to remedy even by blending low-grade grain with superior wheat. 
Varied results in France have often been well below the 230-240 Hagberg minimum required by top client Algeria, the 250 sought by Moroccan importers or the 200 set by the state grain buyer in Egypt, the world's top wheat importer. 
Algeria also has high standards for other milling criteria, such as specific weight and protein content. 
""There will be all sorts of grain flows,"" another trader in Britain said. ""People have got contractual obligations and people have to do odd things (to meet those obligations)."" 

(This version of the story was corrected to say ""specific weight"" from ""specific gravity"" in the penultimate paragraph.)

Inventories rose by 58 billion cubic feet in the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average change is a build of 48 billion cubic feet.
Injections of gas into storage have surpassed the five-year average for 18 consecutive weeks, alleviating concerns over tightening supplies.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.467 trillion cubic feet. Stocks were 500 billion cubic feet less than last year at this time and 535 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 3.090 trillion cubic feet for this time of year.
Prices jumped back up in volatile trading session fueled by uncertainty over how weather patterns may affect prices.
A low-pressure system in the western Atlantic Ocean appeared poised to develop into a tropical cyclone, with the National Hurricane Center giving the storm a 50% chance of becoming a tropical depression in 48 hours and a 70% chance in 5 days.
The latest model runs at the time of writing appeared to keep the system in the Atlantic Ocean and out of the gas-rich Gulf of Mexico, but uncertainty priced in the possibility that the storm could disrupt operations should it develop.
Elsewhere, weather uncertainty over the lower 48 states fueled volatility as well.
Weather systems will trek across the northern U.S. through the first week of September and push milder temperatures into the central and southeastern U.S.
Mild temperatures cut into demand for air conditioning this time of year, which is bearish for natural gas.
""Shorter term; it will remain quite hot over the southern U.S. and Midwest through this weekend, but then temperatures will begin to scale back as the Canadian weather system we have been advertising gradually tracks across the country,"" Natgasweather.com reported in its Thursday midday update.
""Weather patterns continue to look quite bearish after the current warm up over the central and eastern U.S. plays out. With a cool blast next week, followed by what looks to be a mostly comfortable U.S. pattern going into the first week of September, and also with the threat of a hurricane becoming essentially nil, we think eventually $3.75 will again get tested,"" Natgasweather.com added.
""Right now, the markets are moving irrationally, and we think it's best to step aside unless you see an entry point you think is too good to pass up.""

490,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 21, 2014 11:45AM ET</span>",Brazil Doubles Its CO2 Emissions From Energy As Drought Cuts Hydro Power,"By Maria Gallucci -

Brazil’s power sector has doubled its global warming emissions in the past two years, a new analysis found. The uptick threatens to offset some of the country’s gains in slowing deforestation – an effort that climate groups say has led to dramatic cuts in carbon dioxide pollution. That could diminish the government’s negotiating power ahead of global climate talks in Paris next year, analysts say.
From January to July 2014, the cumulative monthly average of emissions grew by 182 percent for every one megawatt-hour of electricity produced, compared with the same period in 2012, according to data from Brazil’s Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, São Paulo-based newspaper Valor Economico reported on Thursday (link in Portuguese).
Overall, the energy sector accounts for about 30 percent of Brazil’s total greenhouse gas emissions.
The rise in emissions is largely tied to the country’s enduring drought. In a normal year, Brazil gets about nearly all of its electricity from hydropower, but record-low rainfall coupled with surging demand is forcing power operators to burn more natural gas, petroleum and coal to keep the lights on.
In São Paulo state, the country’s major industrial and economic hub, rainfall over the past year is more than 17 inches below normal, causing the state’s worst dry spell in nearly eight decades, according to Accuweather.com. As a result, São Paulo’s reservoirs are at historically low levels, with the main Cantareir watershed less than 100 days from running dry.
Two years ago, hydroelectric power accounted for 89 percent of electricity production from January to July, while fossil fuels accounted for 7.3 percent of the mix. This year, hydroelectric is down to about 75 percent of the total, with fossil fuels rising to about 22 percent, Valor Economico said, citing data from the national electricity operator.
The findings contradict Brazil’s global image as a major crusader in the fight against climate change. A study in Science magazine in June praised Brazil for doing more than any country to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers found that, by reducing deforestation by 70 percent, Brazil managed to keep 3.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere – about seven times Brazil’s total emissions in 2012.
“Brazil has always appeared as a hero abroad – and rightly so – because it’s one of the few countries in the world that has reduced deforestation and emissions,” Jose Goldemberg, a research scientists and University of São Paulo professor, told Valor Economico.
Brazil is among a group of developing nations that is arguing for a lesser role in a global pact to reduce emissions. Along with China, India and South Africa, the country maintains that richer nations – namely the United States – should shoulder more of the burden, since those economies created the bulk of historical emissions. Brazil sees its dramatic deforestation efforts as a crucial bargaining chip ahead of the United Nations climate conferences in Peru in December and in Paris in 2015, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month.
Now, the country’s rising reliance on fossil fuels could put that in jeopardy, Goldemberg said. “With energy emissions growing this way, it’s going to lose the privileged position it occupies in the negotiations on climate,” he told Valor Economico.
Despite the energy emissions increase, however, analysts said that Brazil is still likely to meet its goal of reducing emissions by at least 36 percent in 2020, thanks to continued efforts on deforestation and slower-than-expected economic growth."

502,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 20, 2014 02:39PM ET</span>",Gold falls on hawkish Federal Reserve minutes,"Investing.com - Gold prices traded lower on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve's July policy meeting minutes revealed that rate hikes could come sooner rather than later if the job market continues to improve.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for December delivery traded at 1,290.10 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, down 0.51%, up from a session low of $1,288.90 and off a high of $1,298.90.
The December contract settled down 0.20% at $1,296.70 on Tuesday.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,283.30 a troy ounce, the low from Aug. 5, and resistance at $1,304.90, Monday's high.
The Federal Reserve voted to leave benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.00-0.25% and added it would cut its monthly bond-buying program to $25 billion from $35 billion at its July 29-30 meeting.
The Fed said that the overall economy is improving, though slackness remains in the labor market despite growth, which prompted monetary authorities to continue tapering its asset-purchasing program by only $10 billion per policy meeting.
The Fed's stimulus bond-buying program is seen concluding around October, and rate hikes are expected in 2015, though the timing of the latter remains up in the air.
While some monetary authorities favored studying more data before deciding, others felt action should come sooner rather than later.
""Many participants noted that if convergence toward the Committee's objectives occurred more quickly than expected, it might become appropriate to begin removing monetary policy accommodation sooner than they currently anticipated,"" the minutes released earlier Wednesday read.
""Indeed, some participants viewed the actual and expected progress toward the Committee's goals as sufficient to call for a relatively prompt move toward reducing policy accommodation to avoid overshooting the Committee's unemployment and inflation objectives over the medium term,"" the minutes added.
Gold prices fell on the news, as Fed bond purchases and rock-bottom interest rates bolster the yellow metal's appeal as a hedge to a weaker dollar.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that the U.S. economy is improving though monetary authorities continue to note slackness in the labor market, though the minutes revealed some monetary authorities feel that slackness may be absorbed in the near future.
""Many members noted, however, that the characterization of labor market underutilization might have to change before long, particularly if progress in the labor market continued to be faster than anticipated.""

508,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2014 07:10AM ET</span>",Alaska oil tax supporters fending off repeal efforts,"By Steve Quinn JUNEAU Alaska (Reuters) - Alaska voters looked on track to narrowly uphold a new law that cuts taxes on oil production and is worth up to $1 billion a year to companies such as ConocoPhillips (N:COP), BP Plc (L:BP) and Exxon Mobil Corp (N:XOM).
With 80 percent of voting precincts reporting results in Tuesday's primary, those favoring the law held a four-point lead, according to unofficial returns posted by the Alaska Division of Elections.
Upholding the 8-month-old tax reduction ushered in by Governor Sean Parnell means the state would not revert back to the system implemented by his old boss, Sarah Palin, who raised taxes in 2007.
Results will not be certified until Sept. 2, said state elections director Gail Fenumiai, who added that nearly 11,000 absentee ballots needed to be counted over the next 10 days.
Parnell, who claimed his own victory in the state's Republican primary election on Tuesday night, has said his tax rollback will make Alaska more competitive for investment and North Slope oil producers. He called the More Alaska Production Act crucial to the state's long-term future because it would reverse declining output.
Repeal backers got on the ballot last year with a petition featuring 50,000 signatures shortly after Parnell signed Senate Bill 21. They have faced opposition that has raised close to $15 million compared with their several hundred thousand dollars.
Those pushing for the repeal said Parnell's system only put more money in the oil companies' pockets for investment elsewhere while depleting the state's fiscal war chest.

526,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 18, 2014 03:00PM ET</span>",Natural Rubber Glut Shrinks Amid China Car Boom,"By Maria Gallucci - Natural rubber supplies ballooned in recent years as Asian producers cranked up the tree taps and consumers curbed their demand. Now, the glut appears ready to pop. The global surplus is poised to shrink by nearly 50 percent in 2015 as the trends reverse, according to the International Rubber Study Group.
Rubber production will exceed demand by 202,000 metric tons next year, compared to 371,000 tons this year and 650,000 tons in 2013, the Singapore-based inter-governmental group confirmed to Bloomberg News. Actual inventories of rubber are still expected to grow.
Harvesting rubber, a $25 billion industry, is still a fairly low-tech business. Farmers cut through the tree’s bark – though not deep enough to slash the trunk – to access the milky white latex, which flows through a spout and drips into a bucket hanging off the tree. The rubber is primarily used to make automotive and airplane tires, and it also supplies the latex for surgical gloves and condoms. About 70 percent of the world’s supplies comes from Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, and most producers are small-scale farmers.
Three years ago, record-high rubber prices drove producers to ramp up their output. But as more product hit the market, China – the world’s top rubber buyer – experienced an economic slowdown, and new Chinese car sales dropped. The resulting rubber glut caused futures prices to drop 28 percent this year, hitting the lowest level in nearly five years in June, Bloomberg reported.
In response to low prices, producers are tempering their activity at the taps – all while China regains its automotive appetite. 
Global vehicle production is slated to rise by 21 million unites to 106 million units per year by 2021, with China making up half the growth, according to ISH Global Insight’s automotive forecasting arm. ""If we turn the focus to China and emerging Asia we are bombarded by announcements that capacity will be increased,” Mark Fulthorpe, director of ISH’s global vehicle production forecasting, told CNBC this spring. About 70 percent of rubber consumed in China is used to make tires for lightweight vehicles.
The rubber surplus could shrink even further as some producing countries diminish their domestic industries.

In Thailand, the top grower and exporter of rubber, government officials want to replace about 8 percent of the country’s total rubber-growing area with more profitable oil palm trees, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. While rubber trees need about seven years to reach a rubber-tapping stage, oil palms can be harvested within three or four years of planting, giving them a quicker return. “Many farmers have already stopped tapping rubber trees as the returns are poor. Palm oil will provide better returns,” Pongsak Kerdvongbundit, managing director at Von Bundit Co., one of Thailand's biggest rubber exporters, told WSJ.
Even so, total rubber inventories will jump to 4.33 million tons in 2015, about 15 percent more than 2014’s expected total and about 50 percent over 2013 amounts, The Rubber Economist Ltd. projects, Bloomberg noted.

The October contract settled up 1.32% at $95.32 a barrel on Friday.
Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $93.43 a barrel, the low from Jan.21 , and resistance at $98.45 a barrel, the high from Aug. 8.
Ongoing concerns that the world is awash in crude battered oil prices on Monday, especially as tensions between Ukraine and Russia appeared to wane.
Russian and Ukraine foreign ministers held talks earlier and while no resolution to end the conflict emerged, the flow of humanitarian aid deliveries into Ukraine from Russia continued, which eased nerves in global markets.
Crude prices have spiked in recent sessions on fears the conflict will heat up and disrupt shipments out of Russia.
Upbeat U.S. data failed to seriously cushion's oil's slide on Monday.
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index increased to 55.0 in August, a seven-month high, from 53.0 in July, beating estimates for a reading of 53.0.
A level above 50.0 indicates a favorable outlook on home sales and below indicates a negative outlook.
“As the employment picture brightens, builders are seeing a noticeable increase in the number of serious buyers entering the market,” said NAHB Chairman Kevin Kelly.
Separately, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil futures for October delivery were down 2.05% and trading at US$101.41 a barrel, while the spread between the Brent and U.S. crude contracts stood at US$7.67 a barrel.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in September traded at $3.808 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, up 0.83%. The commodity hit a session low of $3.731, and a high of $3.817.
The September contract settled down 3.33% on Friday to end at $3.776 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $3.725 per million British thermal units, the low from July 28, and resistance at $4.020, last Tuesday's high.
Forecasts for mild weather to edge out a heat wave over portions of the eastern half of the U.S. sent natural gas prices plunging on Friday, though by Monday morning, bottom fishers felt the commodity had fallen too far.
Milder temperatures cut into the need for natural gas this time of year, as households and businesses throttle back on their air conditioning, though longer-range forecasts earlier Monday called for a return of seasonably warm temperatures next week, which also supported prices.
Investors also continued to digest Thursday's supply report.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ending Aug. 8 rose by 78 billion cubic feet, below expectations for an increase of 83 billion cubic feet.
Inventories rose by 70 billion cubic feet in the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average change is a build of 45 billion cubic feet.
Injections of gas into storage have surpassed the five-year average for 17 consecutive weeks, alleviating concerns over tightening supplies.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.467 trillion cubic feet. Stocks were 530 billion cubic feet less than last year at this time and 575 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 3.042 trillion cubic feet for this time of year.
The EIA's next storage report is slated for release on Thursday, Aug. 21, with analysts expecting a build of 82 billion cubic feet for the week ending Aug. 15.
Elsewhere on the NYMEX, light sweet crude oil futures for delivery in October were down 1.91% at $93.50 a barrel, while heating oil for September delivery were down 1.51% at $2.8050 per gallon.

530,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 18, 2014 12:00PM ET</span>",Australia Oil Find Could Ignite Drilling Boom Off Country's Northwest Coast,"By Maria Gallucci - An oil boom could be on tap for Australia’s northwest coast. U.S. energy firm Apache Corp. NYSE:APA says it has made what might be Australia’s largest oil discovery in decades, in a region that drillers had previously abandoned after coming up empty-handed.
The oil field off of Western Australia’s Canning Basin potentially holds up to 300 million barrels of oil, according to Apache, though only a slice of those deposits would be recoverable. The finding was made by the Phoenix South-1 well, which was initially exploring for gas when it stumbled upon the vast oil patch.
The country needs new oil sources to replace its quickly diminishing reserves from existing fields, the Wall Street Journal noted. Australia oil production in 2013 dropped by 17 percent to 416,000 – a four-decade low – as conventional fields dried up, according to BP PLC NYSE:BP.
The possible economic gains from the find come at a good time for Western Australia, which has recently suffered from the bursting of its iron ore export bubble. According to the Sydney Morning Herald benchmark iron ore prices are 31 percent off their January 1 level, and that decline has been aggravated by an almost 5 percent rise in the local currency this year.
Iron ore, one of the world's most fundamental commodities, sold off sharply beginning in 2013 after several months of rising prices prompted producers to boost output at the same time that demand in China waned.
Furthermore, the IBTimes UK reported in June that staff at one of the world's largest mining groups was bracing themselves for around 3,000 job cuts as BHP Billiton is pegged to slash headcount to cut costs in its iron ore business. 
The nation's coal industry uhas also taken a big hit, losing more than 12,000 jobs since 2012, amid rising competition and volatile commodities prices.
Apache’s drilling results so far “point to a commercial discovery,” Thomas Voytovich, a senior executive at the firm’s international arm, told reporters. “If these results are borne out by further appraisal drilling, Phoenix South may represent a new oil province for Australia.”

Boosting the company’s optimism is the oil’s high-grade “light” quality, which is easier to produce than heavier blends and attracts premium prices, analysts said, according to the Sydney-Morning Herald.
Peter Strachan, a principal at StockAnalysis, told the paper that that the discovery could likely hold up to 60 million barrels of recoverable oil. He estimated the field would cost about $1 billion to develop using a floating production vessel, which could potentially produce up to 25,000 barrels of oil per day.
The full significance of the Phoenix South discovery, however, likely won’t be known for decades, Simon Andrew, an energy analyst at Perth-based broker Hartleys, told the WSJ.

543,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2014 01:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Oil-by-rail project for shut California refinery nears approval,"By Kristen Hays (Reuters) - The first new crude-by-rail project at a California refinery is likely to win approval next month after more than a year of scrutiny, the head of the Kern County planning division told Reuters, and it could help reopen the shuttered plant.
The facility at independent refiner Alon USA Energy Inc's Bakersfield plant would increase crude offloading capacity to 140,000 barrels per day from its current 13,000 bpd and open up significant access to cheaper inland U.S. and Canadian crudes.
Alon's Bakersfield plant is in Kern County, home to about 65 percent of all California oil production, where crude has been produced for more than a century.
Alon shut the 70,000 bpd Bakersfield refinery in late 2012 because its reliance on more expensive imports and lack of access to other crudes without significant rail rendered the plant unprofitable.
Other California refiners also struggle with profitability because of reliance on expensive imported crude and costly fuel manufacturing regulations in the biggest gasoline market in the country.
""We're supportive of what Alon is doing with this refinery,"" said Lorelei Oviatt, director of the county's planning and community development department. ""This refinery is not operating at full capacity. We would like to see this refinery operating at full capacity.""
Alon didn't respond to requests for comment.
The Alon project is among several proposed at California refineries, some of which face growing opposition in light of a spate of crude train crashes in the past year as the U.S. oil boom sent amounts of crude moving by train soaring.
The worst by far was in Quebec in July last year when a runaway crude train exploded in the town of Lac-Megantic, killing 47 people.
Several California refiners, largely isolated by the Rocky Mountains from the growing cheap bounty from oilfields in Texas, North Dakota and Canada, want to tap those sources via rail because no major pipelines carry crude from those areas into the Golden State, nor are any planned.
More than half of the 1.7 million barrels of crude processed by California refiners each day is imported.
But proposals have faced lengthy delays for comprehensive environmental reviews, public input, and revisions.
Valero Energy Corp, the largest U.S. refiner, postponed its plans to send crude by rail to its San Francisco-area refinery because of such delays, and withdrew permit applications for a similar project at its Los Angeles plant.
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners operates the state's most substantial oil-by-rail facility at a terminal in Richmond, which handles up to 72,000 bpd. Local planners last year approved, without an environmental review, a revised ethanol offloading permit to allow the terminal to handle crude. But opponents are suing to temporarily shut it down and force that kind of review.
Tesoro Corp faces similar growing opposition for a 360,000-bpd railport project in southwest Washington state that could ship crude to California refineries by tanker.
That could let California refiners - which includes Tesoro's Los Angeles-area plant - replace more than 40 percent of more expensive imported oil with North American crudes if all of it were shipped to the state.
Alon is considering possibly leaving the Bakersfield refinery shut and running the facility as a rail and logistics terminal.
If the refinery remains shut, the rail operation would be similar to a separate 70,000-bpd oil-by-rail facility Plains All American plans to open in October and eventually expand to 140,000 bpd. That project was approved two years ago before it was acquired by Plains.
Alon bought the Bakersfield plant out of bankruptcy in 2010 from Flying J Inc, which had shut it in early 2009 shortly after seeking bankruptcy protection. Alon restarted the hydrocracker in the summer of 2011, but operational problems led to more shutdowns and startups.
David Hackett, president of Stillwater Associates, a refining consultancy in Irvine, California, said the refinery's spotty operational history may better support a future as a rail hub.
""They haven't run it as a refinery in a long time. I don't think they'll restart Bakersfield, and I don't understand why they didn't pull this off two years ago,"" he said.
ESTABLISHED OIL HUB
Bakersfield sits in the center of the state's oil production where the oil industry is long established. Plains executives have said its crude-friendly climate and existing infrastructure make the area more attractive for such projects.
""I think Bakersfield is probably the best place to build a rail facility in California, because it's not sitting in San Francisco or LA, and it has access to pipes going north and south. It just seems like it's going to be a struggle to develop rail in other locations,"" Plains' Chief Operating Officer Harry Pefanis told analysts in May.
Alon had hoped to have its Bakersfield rail project up and running by the end of 2013, but it, like others in the state, underwent a lengthy environmental review and public comment.
Oviatt said the Kern County planning department had considered all issues during that review, including safety and spill preparedness.
Now the project is slated to go before the county's board of supervisors for a vote at a Sept. 9 public hearing. Oviatt, who is not one of the five members of the board, said she expected a final decision at that time.
The planning department has signed off on it, and Oviatt said the board tended to be supportive of business.
""I can't say how the board would vote, but I do believe that given their business-friendly attitude, they're going to take all of this into serious consideration.""

548,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2014 06:11PM ET</span>","Rail oil tankers, victim of U.S. safety rules, also unwanted in Canada","By Patrick Rucker and Nia Williams WASHINGTON/CALGARY (Reuters) - Thousands of oil train tankers soon to be deemed obsolete in the United States are unlikely get a second life in Canada's oil sands industry, undercutting a U.S. government forecast that the costly cars will continue in use in the energy sector.
If thousands of obsolete tank cars are scrapped, it could add hundreds of millions of dollars to the cost of the proposal, industry officials said - unwelcome news for regulators trying to craft a safety plan that does not add crippling costs to industry.
Regulators on both sides of the border are contemplating rules to prevent oil train accidents like the July 2013 Lac Megantic disaster in Quebec, in which a runaway train loaded with fuel from North Dakota's Bakken oil patch derailed, killing 47 people.
Those plans would modernize the current U.S. fleet of roughly 90,000 tank cars with puncture-resistant shells and other costly upgrades that government and industry sources expect to cost more than $3 billion.
The U.S. Department of Transportation has said the transition will be eased with about 23,000 existing cars going into service to cart Canadian oil sands crude - a molasses-like fuel, bitumen, that is less flammable than ordinary crude oil.
""No cars will retire as a result of this rule,"" the DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) said in its oil train proposal released in July.
But industry experts said it is not feasible to simply retrofit the older cars to the specifications needed to carry oil sands, making it likely thousands of cars will be scrapped.
""We don't anticipate we will see the cars here,"" said Julie Puddell, investor relations manager of Keyera Corp, which operates a loading terminal in Edmonton, Alberta, with Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP.
While the general purpose cars can be used to transport bitumen diluted with a light fuel called condensate, many oil sands shippers prefer speciality-built tank cars with internal heating coils, because heat stops the bitumen from solidifying while in transit and makes it easier to unload at refineries.
Industry sources say adding heated coils to a standard tank car - which can have a useful life of forty years or more - would have prohibitive costs.
""There are ways to retrofit, but it could make them even more expensive than a new-build,"" Puddell said.
A spokeswoman for Cenovus Energy Inc, Canada's No. 2 oil producer which aims to ship 30,000 barrels per day of oil by rail by year-end, said the company was focused on leasing new heated and coiled cars.
And Valero Energy Corp has ordered more than 2,900 heated tank cars for delivery in the next twelve months to take bitumen to its St. Charles, Louisiana refinery and elsewhere.
Between rail and barge deliveries, the largest U.S. independent oil refiner expects to be receiving more than 55,000 bpd of bitumen from Canada by mid-2015. A Valero spokesman said the company principally relies on heated cars to move the fuel.

A U.S. Transportation Department official said the agency's proposal was open to amendment following a public comment period that ends on Sept. 30.
""Regulators are academic when they write these rules. They always underestimate costs,"" said Larry Bierlein, a veteran hazardous materials lawyer and former hazmat counsel to the Department of Transportation.
""That will become clear as the industry digests this proposal and prepares for the political push-back,"" Bierlein said."

561,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 13, 2014 06:00PM ET</span>",Diesel Used Illegally In Hundreds Of Fracking Wells: Report,"By Maria Gallucci - U.S. fracking firms have illegally injected diesel fuel into hundreds of oil and gas wells in a dozen states, a new analysis asserts. The study taps into a long-simmering debate among industry, regulators and environmental groups over whether drilling companies should disclose all the chemicals they pump into the ground – or whether they can keep some secret.
At least 33 companies used diesel to drill 351 wells from 2010 to July 2014, according to the Environmental Integrity Project, a Washington, D.C.-based organization. While drillers can blast a mix of chemicals, water and sand into shale formations, they have to get federal permits to include diesel in the mix. None of the companies listed had applied for or received a diesel permit, according to EIP conversations with state regulators.
“Companies that injected diesel without permits should be fined for ignoring the laws,” Mary Greene, a senior managing attorney with EIP and the report’s author, said on a Wednesday press call. “This is first and foremost a public health issue. Injecting diesel into fracked wells threatens drinking water and human health.”
Greene, a former enforcement attorney at the federal Environmental Protection Agency, said she hadn’t received an initial response from the EPA or state officials about how they might use the report’s findings.
Diesel contains toxic compounds – such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene – that are known to cause cancer and neurological effects, even in very small doses. In fracking, diesel helps to keep shale formations from absorbing all the fluids used to crack open the rock or clay. But it’s highly mobile in water, making it a particularly potent groundwater contaminant.
The EPA oversees fracking when diesel is included, but for the most part, the fracking process is largely exempt from the Safe Drinking Water Act’s requirements, thanks to a 2005 energy law. In May 2012, the agency proposed new guidance to remind companies of its authority over diesel and emphasize the permitting process. Last February, the EPA adopted the guidance, defining five substances as diesel that require a permit for use in fracking.
The oil and gas industry has pushed back against the ruling. It argues that fracking firms have already phased out diesel fuel from their drilling operations, so additional guidance just complicates business. “By perpetuating this regulatory process, the rule threatens to primacy of states’ underground injection control programs,” Lee Fuller of the Independent Petroleum Association of America told reporters at the time.
EIP found the wells on its list by scouring FracFocus, the online registry that drillers use to disclose fracking chemicals. The site is the only national database for such data and is managed by the Ground Water Protection Council, a nonprofit group of state water quality regulators, and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, a multi-state government agency. Once the environmental group found the sites, it had to buy identifying information from PIVOT Upstream Group, a Houston consulting firm.
At first, the organization listed 497 wells. Researchers hit a troubling snag, however, when they noticed that some of the well operators had removed “any and all indication of past diesel use” from their FracFocus disclosures, Greene said. The EIP initially planned to publish its findings June 19, but postponed the release until Wednesday so it could confirm that its results were still correct. The team later lowered its figure to 351 wells, which includes only the companies that still mentioned diesel injections between June 18 and Aug. 5, 2014.
Greene criticized the FracFocus system for allowing companies to quietly change their forms without explaining why or indicating that they had. “It is not acceptable that prior documentation of diesel use – self-disclosed information – can just disappear at a time when the EPA expresses renewed interest in enforcing the Safe Drinking Water program,” she said.  

Mike Nickolaus of the Ground Water Protection Council said he had spoken with several companies that removed their diesel disclosures because, after conducting internal audits, they learned that diesel hadn’t been used after all.
He added that the FracFocus database – which holds 77,000 records – doesn’t indicate where documents have been altered because “the system just doesn’t have any place for something like that. It wasn’t designed with the idea that these records would be amended, because in a lot of cases these were regulatory records,” he told International Business Times. FracFocus also doesn’t have the capacity to investigate why a company changed its disclosure or if its data is accurate. “How would we know that’s the correct reason?”
Still, Nickolaus said that state regulators do receive notifications of amended records and can investigate the changes further if they want. “It’s not like it’s some deep, dark secret,” he said.
Greene and other environmental advocates, however, have criticized the industry-backed disclosure system for enabling secrecy and making it harder for the public and regulators to know what is being pumped into the ground and where. Nickolaus countered that FracFocus is “fairly transparent.”
Asked on the call if the Environmental Integrity Project might take legal action to force regulators to penalize diesel users, Greene said, “We’re considered what kind of citizen suit enforcement opportunities might exist. But our primary purpose is to make EPA and the states aware of this so that they can do their own compliance evaluations and take appropriate enforcement where indicated.""

563,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 13, 2014 01:30PM ET</span>",Texas Regulators Strengthen Fracking Wastewater Disposal Rules Following North Texas Earthquake Swarm,"By Maria Gallucci - The U.S. oil and gas boom is prompting concerns in several states about earthquakes related to wastewater disposal wells. The latest response comes from Texas, where oil and gas regulators are proposing tougher guidelines for well operators following the recent seismic outbreak in North Texas.
The changes, announced on Tuesday, would require oil and gas companies to disclose more details when applying for permits for underground injection wells, which house large volumes of wastewater from drilling operations like fracking. If the Texas Railroad Commission votes for final approval, firms would have to supply data from the U.S. Geological Survey about area fault lines, past earthquake activity and geologic mapping, the Dallas Morning News reported.
More than 30 registered earthquakes rocked the Dallas-Fort Worth area from November to January, causing damage to homes and properties and raising safety concerns. State officials have come under intense scrutiny since then to address the rash of sudden and unexpected seismic activity.
Federal geologists say that while most of the country’s thousands of wastewater wells don’t cause earthquakes, some can. Depending on the volume and location, wastewater injections can pry fault lines apart and cause them to “slip,” which triggers earthquakes. The Railroad Commission has said that there’s no conclusive link between the recent earthquakes and disposal wells. Southern Methodist University scientists have set up monitors to track local earthquakes, but they say the results could be years off, the Dallas Morning News noted.
“Whether there is a definitive link or not between disposal wells and seismic activity in Texas has not been determined,” Railroad Commission spokeswoman Ramona Nye told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “As our agency continues to work with the scientific community to coordinate an exchange of information ... we have seen a need for laying the groundwork for some basic industry best practices.”
In Oklahoma, however, geologists are increasingly convinced that the swarm of earthquakes now rippling across the state is man-made. That has prompted the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, the state’s public utility regulator, to stop approving permits for wells in earthquake-prone areas without additional information from applicants. The commission will also start requiring operators to supply real-time data related to well pressure and volumes so that scientists can better study the link between seismic activity and wastewater injections.

So far this year, Oklahoma has experienced more than 290 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater, up from an average of just two a year before the state’s oil and gas boom began in 2008, according to the Oklahoma Geological Survey. The largest, a 2011 temblor that reached a 5.7 magnitude, caused nearly $1 million in damage across the small town of Prague.
Along with tighter permitting rules, the seismic upswing is also drawing lawsuits from residents seeking compensation for property damage or personal injury related to the quakes. Last week, a Prague resident sued two-dozen energy companies seeking at least $75,000 in damages. In Dallas last December, two families filed suit against drilling companies and well operators. In Arkansas, where several minor earthquakes shook the state in 2010 and 2011, nearly 40 homeowners are suing Chesapeake Operating Inc. and BHP Billiton Ltd. NYSE:BHP.
The new permitting proposals are unlikely to ease the concerns of environmentalists and worried residents, however. Sharon Wilson of the environmental group Earthworks said the Railroad Commission’s proposals on Tuesday “don’t go far enough in ensuring protection of Texans living near oil and gas production,” she told the Dallas Morning News. “They are neither identifying instances where specific earthquakes have occurred nor holding the responsible party liable for damages caused to the property owners,” she said.

577,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 12, 2014 12:45PM ET</span>",Keystone XL Decision Likely Delayed Until 2015,"By Maria Gallucci - A final decision on the Keystone XL pipeline now seems unlikely until at least 2015, extending the bitter controversy over the Canada-to-Texas project into its seventh year. The timing for President Barack Obama's verdict largely hinges on a Nebraska Supreme Court ruling over the pipeline’s proposed path in the state, lawyers and activists told Reuters.
The state court is to hear oral arguments on Sept. 5 from landowners who oppose the proposed 300-mile route and state officials who support it. But a final ruling probably won’t be delivered until the new year. ""These things typically take three to six months,"" Jane Kleeb of the group Bold Nebraska, which is leading the landowner opposition to the pipeline, told Reuters. ""We have always thought the decision will come in January.""
The Obama administration, which has the final say on the entire 1,179-mile project since it crosses an international boundary, said in April that it might await the Nebraska decision before rejecting or approving a presidential permit for the Keystone XL. If the court rules against the state, that would send the pipeline’s builder, TransCanada Corp. NYSE:TRP, and Nebraska regulators back to the drawing board, delaying construction even further.
It also means that while the Keystone XL controversy is likely to come up in several congressional campaigns, the outcome will remain in limbo past the U.S. midterm elections on Nov. 5, Reuters noted.
If built, the Keystone XL would carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day from western Canada’s oil sands region down to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would connect with an existing southern leg that runs to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast. 

The Nebraska dispute stems from a 2012 state law that gave Republican Gov. Dave Heineman the power to approve the pipeline’s route in the state. Three landowners – Randy Thompson, Suz Straka and Susan Dunavan – challenged the law, and in February, a district court judge ruled in their favor and invalidated the route. Heineman has asked the state Supreme Court to overrule that decision.
Along with the outcome of the Nebraska case, the Obama administration is also weighing the Keystone XL’s projected climate effects. In June 2013, Obama announced that greenhouse gas emissions are a key factor in his decision, saying he would approve the project only if “it does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.”
Earlier this week, a new analysis concluded that the proposed pipeline could have four times the global warming impact as initially assumed – a finding that garnered mixed reviews from experts. Researchers said the U.S. State Department didn’t take into account that added oil from the pipeline would lower global oil prices and drive up consumption, boosting greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.

The September contract settled up 0.08% on Monday to end at $3.965 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $3.858 per million British thermal units, last Thursday's low, and resistance at $4.012, Monday's high.
While showers and thunderstorms may cool off parts of the U.S. this week, a heat wave will hold its ground through the third week in August.
""Weather systems over the northern U.S. early in the outlook will lead to cooler than normal temperatures over many regions. However, high pressure will strengthen after August 20th and bring a nice warm up to much of the U.S.,"" Natgasweather.com said in its Aug. 19-25 outlook earlier Tuesday.
""The southern U.S., including Texas, will remain very warm to hot throughout with highs reaching the 90s and 100s.""
Higher temperatures often fuel demand for more natural gas as households and business ramp up their air conditioners.
Supply data remain in focus as well.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report on Aug. 7 that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 82 billion cubic feet during the week before.

591,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 11, 2014 01:40PM ET</span>",Natural gas dips as showers seen dampening U.S. heat wave,"Investing.com - Natural gas futures edged slightly lower on Monday after updated weather-forecasting models called for showers and thunderstorms to offset a heat wave trekking across the U.S., which should crimp demand for air conditioning.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in September traded at $3.951 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, down 0.29%. The commodity hit a session low of $3.923, and a high of $4.012.
The September contract settled up 2.22% on Friday to end at $3.962 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $3.858 per million British thermal units, Thursday's low, and resistance at $4.163, the high from July 9.
While seasonably warm and even above-normal temperatures are present across the heavily populated eastern half of the country, showers and thunderstorms are expected to pop up and cool down temperatures at times, which sent natural gas prices edging lower on Monday.
""Weather systems sweeping through the Midwest and eastern U.S. this week will bring showers, thunderstorms, and cooler-than-normal temperatures as highs only warm into the 70s and lower 80s. Several degrees of cooling is also expected to push deep into the high cooling demand states of the Southeast, where many areas will see 80s instead of 90s,"" Natgasweather.com reported in its Aug. 11-17 daily weather forecast earlier.
""Texas and portions of the southern Plains will remain seasonably hot with highs in the 90s and 100s and will drive the strongest cooling demand in the country. The western U.S. will see showers and thunderstorms early this week with cooler than normal temperatures, but will warm late in the week as high pressure strengthens.""
Investors continued to digest Thursday's supply report.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended August 1 rose by 82 billion cubic feet, below expectations for an increase of 84 billion cubic feet.
Still, inventories rose by 90 billion cubic feet in the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average change is a build of 49 billion cubic feet, which sent prices falling.
Injections of gas into storage have surpassed the five-year average for 16 consecutive weeks, alleviating concerns over tightening supplies.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.389 trillion cubic feet. Stocks were 538 billion cubic feet less than last year at this time and 608 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 2.948 trillion cubic feet for this time of year.
Elsewhere on the NYMEX, light sweet crude oil futures for delivery in September were up 0.44% at $98.08 a barrel, while heating oil for September delivery were up 0.36% at $2.8872 per gallon.

592,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2014 01:00PM ET</span>","After offshore oil failure, Cuba shifts energy focus","By Marc Frank HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba has shifted its focus away from offshore oil, concentrating on renewable energy and improving output from onshore wells due to a lack of interest by foreign companies for further deepwater exploration, sources close to the industry say.
With so much oil readily available around the world, oil companies including those from allies China and Russia see little incentive in drilling off the Caribbean island, delaying the Cuban dream of oil wealth that could inject vigor into its socialist revolution.
With the U.S. trade embargo of Cuba further complicating drilling plans, the country is seeking investors in renewable energy such as biomass and wind while attempting to increase output from existing onshore and shallow water wells.
Russia's state-run Rosneft and the China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) separately agreed last month to help Communist-run Cuba extract more oil along the traditional northwest heavy oil belt, but did not sign on to deepwater exploration.
The northwest heavy oil belt is a 200-mile (320-km) stretch of the northern coast from Havana to Villa Clara and reaching up to 3 miles (5 km) offshore. It produces poor quality oil that meets 40 percent of the country's needs.
Rosneft and CNPC will also support the horizontal drilling of new wells from shore and join Canadian firm Sherritt International (TO:S) and another Russian state-run oil company, Zarubezhneft, which are already carrying out similar work.
Cuba had hoped Russia and China, whose presidents visited in July, would explore deepwater offshore fields that it says may hold 20 billion barrels of oil and end its dependence on socialist ally Venezuela.
Venezuela sends 115,000 barrels of oil per day to Cuba under favorable terms.
""The Cubans have stopped talking about offshore oil exploration in the state-run media and in private appear more interested in new recovery methods for existing wells, biogas projects and windmill farms,"" a European diplomat said.
Three deepwater wells drilled in 2012 by Spanish, Norwegian, Indian, Malaysian, Russian and Venezuelan firms came up dry. All but the Norwegian state firm Statoil ASA and Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA have pulled out, and those companies are inactive. Future drilling has been postponed for the foreseeable future.
A BIG GAMBLE
Difficult geology from hard rock encountered while sinking the wells, alternative prospects elsewhere and U.S. sanctions that require oil rigs to carry less than 10 percent U.S. technology are discouraging further drilling, according to Western diplomats.
""Exploration is not a one-shot deal, but in Cuba due to many factors it is. Drilling is like playing once at a roulette wheel with $100 million chips,"" said a diplomat whose country was involved in exploration.
Jorge Pinon, an expert on Cuban oil at the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy at the University of Texas in Austin, said, ""They are shifting their focus and efforts to the known coastal reservoirs rather than on the unknown offshore deepwater reservoirs.""
Cuba's heavy crude fields have a recovery factor of about 10 percent (10 barrels for every 100 barrels in a well), due to the viscosity of the crude and the porosity of the rock formations from which it is extracted, Pinon said.
""If successful, Cuba could increase its present recovery factor from 10 percent to maybe 17 to 20 percent adding an additional 12,000 to 15,000 barrels of new production if not more to their current level of approximately 50,000 barrels per day,"" Pinon said.
Vice President and politburo member Marino Murillo told parliament in July that Cuba planned to invest $3.6 billion over the next 15 years in alternative energy, which is a priority for foreign investment.
Murillo said 96 percent of energy generation came from oil and that the goal was to reduce that by 2030 to 76 percent, with the remainder coming from 19 bioelectricity plants attached to sugar mills, 13 wind parks and solar facilities.

He did not mention deepwater oil exploration.

593,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 11, 2014 10:45AM ET</span>",Keystone Climate Impact Worse Than Estimated: Study,"By Maria Gallucci - The proposed Keystone XL could have four times as much global warming impact as previously assumed, a new analysis concludes. The finding comes as President Obama weighs the project’s climate effects in his final decision on the Canada-to-Texas pipeline.  
Researchers said the U.S. State Department didn’t take into account that the added oil from the pipeline would lower global oil prices – by about $3 a barrel – and drive up consumption, which in turn would boost greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. All of those factors would ultimately increase pollution by as much as 110 million tons of carbon dioxide a year – or four times the 30 million tons that the State Department calculated in its environmental impact statement in February.
“The sole reason for this difference is that we account for the changes in global oil consumption resulting from increasing oil sands production levels, whereas the State Department does not,” wrote authors Peter Erickson and Michael Lazarus, Seattle-based scientists at the Stockholm Environment Institute, a nonprofit research organization. Their report was published this week in the journal Nature Climate Change.
If built, the Keystone XL would carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada’s oil sands region down to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would connect with an existing southern leg that runs to refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast. The State Department is authorized to approve the $5.3 billion pipeline because it crosses international borders, but Obama is expected to make the final call.
In June 2013, Obama announced that greenhouse gas emissions are a key factor in his decision, saying he would approve the project only if “it does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.”
Environmental groups have long contended Canadian oil sands crude is more carbon-intensive than conventional sources, but Erickson said that “an even bigger impact of expanding oil sands production” would be its influence on the global oil markets, he told Canada’s Postmedia Network.

Outside experts not connected to the report gave the findings mixed reviews, according to the Associated Press. The American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s main lobbying group, said the study was “irrelevant” because Canadian crude would be shipped by rail if not by pipeline. Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex, pointed out that an increase of even 110 million tons of carbon is “merely a drop in the bucket” compared to the 36 billion tons of carbon that the world released into the atmosphere last year, the AP noted. 
Other researchers welcomed the report, even as they acknowledged that the numbers will be hotly contested. Mark Jaccard, a sustainable energy expert at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, called it a “sound analysis” that points to “a flaw” in the State Department’s assessment of Keystone’s impact on greenhouse gas emissions, Postmedia Network reported.
The Obama administration is unlikely to issue a decision until later this year or beyond. In April, the president said he would delay his decision because of a Nebraska state court decision that invalidated the pipeline’s route through the state. The Nebraska Supreme Court said it will review the case in September.

Investors flocked to gold on Wednesday on fears the conflict in Ukraine is set to escalate.
Reports that Russia has amassed more troops near its border with Ukraine have bolstered gold prices due to the safe-haven appeal the yellow metal enjoys during times of geopolitical uncertainty.
Since the West slapped sanctions on for allegedly meddling in Ukraine's affairs by supporting separatists, Russian troops along the border have reportedly jumped to 20,000 from 8,000.
Still, upbeat jobless claims data in the U.S. capped the precious metal's advance.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported earlier that the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending Aug. 2 fell by 14,000 to 289,000 from the previous week’s total of 303,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 2,000 to 305,000 last week, and the numbers confirmed market expectations for the Federal Reserve to close its monthly bond-buying stimulus program in October and begin hiking interest rates afterwards in 2015.

615,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 07, 2014 11:15AM ET</span>",Offshore Fracking On The Rise In Gulf Of Mexico,"By Maria Gallucci - Global oil and gas firms are increasingly turning to offshore fracking to extract more fossil-fuel riches from the bottom of the ocean.
The Gulf of Mexico in particular could see fracking activity grow by more than 10 percent over this year and next, according to Baker Hughes Inc. NYSE:BHI, which operates about a third of the world’s offshore fracking fleet, Bloomberg News reported  Thursday.
Though environmentally controversial, hydraulic fracturing (aka fracking) operations have taken place in waters around the world since the early 1990s, including in California’s Santa Barbara Channel, the Arabian Gulf and the North Sea. Much like onshore fracking, the practice involves pumping vast quantities of water, sand and chemicals underground to crack open rocks and free up deposits of shale gas and oil.
Until recently, offshore fracking was primarily used to boost the productivity and reliability of existing deep-sea wells rather than to drill new wells. The practice accounts for only about 5 percent of the fracking market as a whole, according to About Oil. But advances in fracking technology in recent years – coupled with vast offshore discoveries – have emerged to make large-scale fracking an increasingly feasible business, Bloomberg noted.
In response to growing demand for offshore fracking, oil services companies like Baker Hughes and Schlumberger Ltd. NYSE:SLB have increased their global fleet of fracking ships by 31 percent since 2007, according to an Offshore Magazine survey cited by Bloomberg. The ships, called simulation vessels, measure 300 feet long and carry roughly 7 million pounds of people and equipment, including rock-crushing engines and stores of sand. Schlumberger said it launched five new vessels last year for work in the deepwater Gulf, Indian Ocean and North Sea.

The full scope of offshore fracking’s environmental impacts is still a mystery to drillers and their regulators. While the process has been linked to groundwater contamination onshore, officials are less clear about what could happen in the depths of the ocean.
Fracking’s effects “are not well understood. To date, little data has been collected,” Alison Dettmer, a deputy director at the California Coastal Commission, told the Associated Press in February. At the time, the federal government had just approved three new fracking operations off the California coast.
Oil firms say that’s why they are proceeding with caution. “It’s the most challenging, harshest environment that we’ll be working in,” Ron Dusterhoft of Halliburton Co. NYSE:HAL, the world’s largest fracking operator, told Bloomberg. “You just can’t afford hiccups.”

623,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 06, 2014 04:45PM ET</span>",Mexico Passes Oil And Gas Reform Laws,"By Maria Gallucci - Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto’s oil policy came one step closer to fruition on Tuesday when legislators passed the Mexico Congress' energy bill that's set to finalize a broad overhaul of the country’s natural resources wealth. The move is expected to boost Mexico energy production and open Mexico's oil fields through privatization.
The legislation cleared Mexico’s Senate on Tuesday and passed the lower chamber early on Saturday following several months of debate. President Peña Nieto is expected to announce the Mexican energy reform package in a speech this evening.
“This is monumental,"" Jorge Piñon, an oil expert at the University of Texas at Austin, told International Business Times about the measures. “It shows the commitment of the Mexican government to move forward.”
The new Mexican energy reform  rules hash out the fine print of the wider policy approved in December, which revised the Mexican Constitution to allow private and foreign firms to explore for and produce energy in the country, ending the 75-year Pemex monopoly. Pemex is Mexico's state-run oil company. The new laws govern changes in areas such as energy regulation, tax policy, concessions and joint ventures.
Proponents of Mexico's energy reform hope it can stem declining production from Mexico’s onshore and offshore oil fields by attracting outside expertise. Mexico is among the world’s top 10 oil producers, but the Pemex monopoly has made it difficult to attract technology and resources needed to tap abundant, unconventional oil reserves in the Gulf of Mexico and in shale deposits in the northern states, they say.
Last year, Pemex produced about 2.5 million barrels of crude oil per day, a slight dip from 2012 and a stark fall from the 2004 peak of nearly 3.5 million barrels per day, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration statistics.  Pemex expects its crude output to fall farther to 2.41 million barrels a day this year -- its lowest production in two decades, Bloomberg News reported in July.
Major oil companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. NYSE:XOM, Chevron Corp. NYSE:CVX and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (NYSE:RDS:A) have long expressed interest in tapping Mexico’s oil reserves, as have mid-sized companies and petroleum services firms like Baker Hughes Inc. NYSE:BHI and Halliburton Co. NYSE:HAL. Under the new laws, Mexico could attract an additional $20 billion in foreign direct investment as soon as 2015, according to Bank of America Corp.

“We think that it would be a win-win if ever there was one,” William Colton, Exxon’s vice president of corporate strategic planning, told reporters in December ahead of the constitutional reform.
President Enrique Piñon Nieto listed two key reasons for the global oil industry’s interest in Mexico. First, the country’s resource base is largely proven, and U.S. oil companies already have experience tapping offshore reserves and shale deposits north of the border. The Burgos Basin, one of Mexico’s largest shale deposits, for instance is estimated to hold 600 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas and 13 billion barrels of recoverable shale oil, the sixth-largest and eighth-largest resources in the world, respectively.
Mexico is “not a new frontier area that has to be discovered, and in which there will be high-risk exploratory drilling,” he said.

Second, Mexico’s proximity to the United States makes it easier and cheaper to transfer equipment, personnel and technical support from company headquarters in Texas or Louisiana, compared to setting up shop in the Middle East, “There’s an attractiveness from a cost perspective,” Piñon said.
Mexican energy officials have modest ambitions for oil and gas output under the new energy landscape, saying they expect to increase output by roughly 500,000 barrels a day -- to reach about 3 million barrels a day – by 2018, the New York Times reported this week. Over the longer term, the government hopes that private investment in offshore and shale fields will boost output even higher.
Mexico’s energy  reform still faces fierce opposition from legislators on the left and much of the public, who fear that Mexico’s oil wealth will flee the country and instead line the pockets of private and foreign companies. But Piñon said he doesn’t think a public referendum to reverse the reforms is likely, since the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN) control the majority of seats in Congress and the bulk of Mexico’s 31 states. “I think this is irreversible,” he said of the overhaul.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2014 12:44PM ET</span>",Oil group wants highest-danger label for Bakken rail shipments,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. oil industry group is recommending that all crude shipped by rail from North Dakota's Bakken fields be labeled as the most-dangerous type of oil cargo, a designation that could hasten the use of new or upgraded tank cars.
On Monday, the North Dakota Petroleum Council (NDPC) released the final results of a wide-scale study on the quality characteristics of Bakken crude, which has been involved in several fiery oil-train derailments over the past year.
The study confirmed preliminary findings released in May suggesting that Bakken was little different from other forms of light, sweet U.S. crude and posed no greater threat versus other fuels when transported by rail.
The NDPC also issued a series of recommendations following the study, however, including one urging oil-by-rail shippers to classify all Bakken crude oil as ""Packing Group I"" hazardous materials.
That is the highest-risk level of a three-tiered danger assessment, and the NDPC said it was recommended ""even though the majority of samples tested for the study would fall within specifications for PG (Packing Group) II.""
Current methods for testing boiling point, the key criteria for differentiating PG I and II classifications, can be inconsistent, the NDPC said. Because it typically contains a high proportion of very light hydrocarbons and petroleum gases, Bakken crude tends to boil at lower temperatures.
""The margin of error for the test methodology can result in different labs testing the same sample with values meeting both PGs. PG I has the more stringent standards and is therefore recommended to avoid further confusion,"" said the NDPC report, which was prepared by industry consultants Turner, Mason & Co.
Historically the Packing Group label has made no material difference in how oil is handled on trains; its only purpose was to inform emergency responders about the cargo. The DOT-111 tank car, the model used almost exclusively to ship oil by rail, is able to transport any Packing Group. Many oil companies have been using PG I routinely simply to ensure they were compliant.
But under new regulations proposed last month by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Packing Group determination could become a pivotal factor in determining how quickly shippers use new or upgraded tank cars that will gradually replace older-model DOT-111s long seen as flawed.
The NDPC represents major producers in the Bakken including Marathon Oil Corp (N:MRO), ConocoPhillips (N:COP), Continental Resources (N:CLR) and Hess (N:HES).
Authorities had already begun to crack down on misclassified oil shipments after the Lac Megantic tragedy in Canada last year, when a runaway oil-train with cargo from the Bakken energy patch derailed and killed 47 people in the center of a Quebec town.
In February, the DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) fined three companies for using incorrect Packing Group labels for their Bakken cargoes. Two of them had mislabeled shipments as PG II, when in fact they should have been labeled PG I. A third company had used a PG III label rather than PG II.
The DOT rules last month said older model DOT-111 cars would not be allowed to carry Packing Group I crudes within two years, while less dangerous crudes that fall into PGs II and III could still be shipped in the older cars for three and five years.

The rules are open to public comment and may not be finalized for several months.
In its own study released last month, the PHMSA said most crude from the Bakken tested as PG I or II material - ""with a predominance to PG I"". It also said the oil was ""more volatile than most other types of crude,"" a finding disputed by both the American Petroleum Institute and NDPC.

Higher demand from Asia and an anticipation of accelerating inflation are lifting the price, the precious metal dealer’s chief market analyst Peter Grant told Bloomberg. Gold bullion prices will rise even if the Federal Reserve increases interest rates, what banks charge one another for short-term loans, which affects the interest rates banks charge customers for loans, to combat future inflation. That’s because higher borrowing costs will likely come with rising consumer prices, he said.
“If you look back over time, there are plenty of instances where rates have risen and gold has risen as well,” Grant said.
When the Fed raised interest rates from June 2004 to June 2006, gold futures rose 57 percent.
Typically, gold investors view rising interest rates as bad news for the metal's price and seek out higher-yielding investments. 
Money Morning's resource specialist Peter Krauth said July 29 that ""with low interest rates that are likely to stay low for some time, the opportunity cost of owning gold is next to zero, making it an attractive asset.""

Last month, gold prices fell by 3 percent as the prospects of rising borrowing costs dampened the appeal of gold as an asset. On July 30, the central bank reduced its monthly bond-buying program to $25 billion, the sixth consecutive $10 billion cut.
In June, gold shipments to India, the world’s second-largest gold user, spiked by 65 percent after the Fed allowed more banks and traders to buy gold overseas.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for December delivery traded at 1,288.60 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, down 0.48%, up from a session low of $1,287.10 and off a high of $1,296.40.

U.S. stocks rose on Monday after legendary investor Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway beat expectations, which cut into the need for safe-haven gold positions.
Meanwhile, a second take on Friday's U.S. July jobs report left investors concluding the labor market continues to improve despite persistent slackness, which leaves the Federal Reserve on track to dismantling stimulus programs that have supported the yellow metal for years.
The Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, missing expectations for an increase of 233,000, though July marked the sixth consecutive month that the U.S. economy created over 200,000 new payrolls.
The report also showed that the U.S. unemployment rate ticked up to 6.2% last month from 6.1% in June. Analysts had expected the rate to remain unchanged in July, though the report revealed that more unemployed Americans were entering the labor force in search of work last month, a positive sign.
The unemployment rate does not include discouraged unemployed individuals who have given up actively searching for work, so a decision by many to look for jobs can send the headline rate higher, though it also suggests out-of-work Americans are more hopeful with their job prospects.
Meanwhile, silver for September delivery was down 0.82% at $20.203 a troy ounce, while copper futures for September delivery were up 1.02% at $3.247 a pound.

""Late this week, temperatures will further increase as high pressure strengthens over most of the country. A much larger than normal build is expected from this week’s weather due to cooler than normal temperatures starting the week over many regions and the influences of several weather systems late in the week, even as the southern U.S. continues to heat up,"" Natgasweather.com said in its Aug. 4-10 forecast.
In its Aug. 11-17 forecast, Natgasweather.com reported that high pressure will hover over the western, southern, and eastern U.S. with temperatures warming into the 90s and 100s.
""Much warmer temperatures will also set up over the Midwest and Northeast with highs into the 80s and lower 90s. However, the northern U.S. will remain vulnerable to a cooler Canadian weather system around August 13-15th, and if it pushes fairly deep into the Midwest and East, temperatures will again become comfortable over many regions,"" Natgasweather.com added.

649,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2014 11:37AM ET</span>","Armed with new technology, oil drillers revisit Gulf of Mexico","By Swetha Gopinath and Sayantani Ghosh (Reuters) - Advances in drilling technology are reviving the prospects of oil companies in shallow parts of the Gulf of Mexico, helping to squeeze more from older fields while the U.S. shale bonanza lures others onshore.
Apache Corp and a handful of smaller independent companies are using seismic surveying and horizontal drilling - techniques perfected during the onshore fracking boom - to tap mature fields and find hidden reserves on the shelf.
The methods appeal to investors hungry for the quick profits that cannot be delivered by deepwater drilling, where a dozen years of planning and billions of dollars in investment can be required to get oil pumping.
The technology, already used successfully by Apache in the North Sea, has revealed oil and gas reserves that were previously hidden in water less than 500 feet (150 meters) deep.
""3D seismic has not only helped us in acquiring new leases with new reserves on them, but also in sharpening targets for development drilling in our existing fields,"" Andy Clifford, president of Saratoga Resources Inc, told Reuters.
Replacing reserves and increasing production has long been a challenge on the Gulf of Mexico shelf. The easy-to-find oil has already been drilled, resulting in a drastic fall in production.
But the use of seismic data, much more precise than previous mapping techniques, is tempting geologists to take a second look for new fields and re-evaluate older deposits to see what might be left behind.
After an unusually harsh winter, higher prices for natural gas - abundant on the shelf - are an added incentive to drill.
""We are re-shooting all of our large fields to make sure that we haven't missed anything,"" said Matt McCarroll, chief executive of Fieldwood Energy LLC, a private equity-backed company that bought shelf assets from Apache and SandRidge Energy Inc last year.
Total proved reserves in the Gulf of Mexico are currently about 4.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
But Stephen Trammel, an analyst at market research firm IHS, said some estimates peg reserves at nearly 10 times this amount.
With a market value of $1.8 billion, Energy XXI Ltd is worth a fraction of Apache or any of the oil majors, but has grown to become a big presence on the Gulf shelf since it deployed horizontal drilling and seismic tools.
Energy XXI's proved reserves, which are mostly to be found off the Louisiana coast, jumped by 50 percent in 2013 alone.
John Schiller, the company's founder and chief executive, said Energy XXI had extracted 5 percent of its reserves in the Gulf of Mexico and expected technology to squeeze out a further 5 percent.
""That's a meaningful number when we talk about 6 billion barrels of oil in place underneath our top 10 fields,"" he said. Even at a 5 percent recovery rate, the company would be able to produce 300 million barrels of oil.
'INVISIBLE' NO MORE
Horizontal drilling, which allows companies to set up miles-long pipes through a single rock formation, can deliver up to 20 times the production of wells tapped by vertical drills.
The technology is not entirely new. Companies in the Gulf of Mexico have been drilling horizontally for about two decades, though with limited results compared with developments onshore.
When twinned with recent advances in seismic tools, the biggest advantage of horizontal drilling today is its ability to identify the maximum amount of oil and gas in rock formations.
New seismic tools involve using sound waves that allow drillers to ""see"" oil and gas trapped in rocks through high-resolution 3D images.
""The best place to find oil and gas is where you know it already exists,"" said Michael Breard, a research analyst at Hodges Capital, a Dallas-based investment advisory firm.
Production in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico more than halved in the last decade to 534.8 million boe in 2013. Trammel said he expects production to turn the corner, and soon.
Apache is among the companies likely to drive that growth. Despite selling assets worth more than $10 billion in the last year, primarily to focus on shale, it has kept 50 percent of the unexplored portions of shelf properties it sold to Fieldwood.
Thomas Voytovich, chief operating officer of Apache's international operations, says new drilling techniques have led the company to previously ""invisible"" parts of the Gulf.
""We are not going to be doing anything in the deep water in the foreseeable future,"" he said. ""Most of the prospects that we are developing right now are literally in jack-up rig territory, which is 300 feet or less.""
Jack-up rigs - mobile platforms with a floating hull - were the one bright spot in rig contractor Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc's recent quarterly results. Revenue from its deepwater business declined.
Shallow-water wells are also cheaper. Using infrastructure left over from earlier drilling, they can be installed for about $10 million; a deepwater well would cost upward of $50 million.

The returns, so far, have been good. Each of Saratoga's three horizontal wells are yielding double to triple the initial production of vertical wells. Seismic technology is helping the company to drill deeper, said Clifford.
""It's all about getting more bang for your buck,"" he said.

666,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 01, 2014 01:15AM ET</span>",India Uncovers New Gold Smuggling Route,"By Reuters - India is scrambling to crack down on a new gold smuggling tactic that it fears could accelerate a flood of illegal imports of the precious metal into the world's second-biggest buyer.
India -- whose appetite for gold is only rivaled by China -- last year imposed a record 10 percent import duty and made it mandatory to export a fifth of all bullion imports, seeking to curb bullion demand that has blown out the trade deficit.
With the lure of big profits from avoiding duty, smugglers have come up with innovative ways to bring in gold ranging from swallowing nuggets to hiding bars in dead cows.

In the latest smuggling case, a gold exporting firm attempted to use a tax-free special economic zone to try to bypass restrictions and sell to the local market.
The scam was uncovered after police stopped a car trying to take 25 gold bars, worth about $1 million, out of a tax-free special economic zone in Surat in June to sell to the domestic market, according to a government document seen by Reuters. The owner of the firm was arrested.
The new government of Narendra Modi had been expected to loosen the policies, but its first budget maintained the tough stance, which has resulted in an explosion of gold smuggling and cast doubt on how accurately official data reflects gold flows in the world's second-biggest buyer.
Government figures show that only 2.34 tons of smuggled gold was retrieved last year, while the World Gold Council estimated 200-250 tons of gold illegally entering India.
""Since the import restrictions are still in place, smuggling will remain rampant and that will distort total import figures,"" said Carsten Fritsch, an analyst with Commerzbank AG.
The June arrest was the first time authorities had seized gold being smuggled out of a special economic zone, according to a government source, and appears to reveal a more sophisticated scam to get gold into the local market.
""We had intelligence report and intercepted the car, with the manager of the firm in it. The manager said the gold was concealed by the proprietor of the firm,"" said another senior government official with direct knowledge of the case, adding that the gold was to be illegally sold in the domestic market.
""The authorities know that such things are happening and intelligence gathering has been strengthened,"" the source said.
The ministry of commerce, which is in charge of special economic zones, did not reply to requests for comment.
FAKE RECEIPTS
Illustrating the extent of smuggling, India's junior civil aviation minister said this week staff of the national carrier, Air India [AIN.UL], had been found smuggling in gold in 13 instances in the last few years.
But special economic zones could be especially vulnerable since exporters do not pay duty to bring gold into India, and thus can make a huge profit by diverting supplies to the domestic market. There are 185 such zones in India.
Last year's restrictions on imports have curbed supply and pushed up domestic premiums -- the difference between local and global prices -- to a record $160 an ounce last December.
Indian gold imports plunged by a fifth last year to 825 tons though jewelry and investment demand rose 13 percent.
One of the government sources said that others are likely to be using special economic zones to bring in gold.
""After all how would you know if somebody is taking out gold in their cars?""
To account for the disappearance of the gold, exporters are likely to be using either fake receipts or imitation copper jewelry, according to the official.
Some exporters also buy back supplies that they have sold into the market when premiums fall, thus making a profit off the premium arbitrage, said Sudheesh Nambiath, a senior analyst at Thomson Reuters GFMS in Mumbai.
""Policymakers are increasingly aware of such practices. So I wouldn't be surprised if we see further tightening of rules around exporters in tax-free zones,"" said Nambiath."

703,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 28, 2014 05:00PM ET</span>","Britain, New Zealand Luring Oil And Gas Drillers","By Maria Gallucci - Big oil and gas companies are shifting their focus to wealthier countries after decades of exploring and producing in developing nations, lured by political stability and more predictable returns. At least two governments – Britain and New Zealand – are aiming to capitalize on the switch.
On Monday, the U.K. opened up more than half of Britain to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in an effort to entice energy companies to explore the region’s shale reserves. The Department for Energy and Climate Change said it will invite firms to bid for onshore oil and gas licenses for the first time in six years, according to media reports. The drilling zone will encompass 37,000 square miles of untouched parcels and stretch from central Scotland to the south coast.
Michael Fallon, the former UK energy minister, has previously called shale oil and gas as “an exciting prospect, which could bring growth, jobs and energy security,” the Telegraph noted.
In New Zealand, energy officials are pushing a “Petroleum Action Plan” meant to lure oil companies to its millions of unexplored offshore acres. The government also hired an executive from oil-and-gas-rich Oklahoma to sway prospectors, the Wall Street Journal said in a Sunday story.
Developments in the two countries underscore oil companies' rising interest in investing in safer and stabler nations. In recent years, violence, tension with governments and power struggles with state-owned oil companies have weakened the allure of less-developed nations in North Africa and Central Asia, where lax regulations and cheap labor costs once promised hefty profits for oil companies, the WSJ noted.
In 2013, the biggest global oil firms – Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (AMS:RDSa) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) – spent about two-thirds of their exploration and production budgets in OECD countries, up from 49 percent in 2003, estimated Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd., a U.S. financial research company, the WSJ reported. Some of the spending reflects the North American shale gas boom, where fracking and horizontal drilling technologies are producing record amounts of fossil fuels. U.S. production could climb even higher if President Obama opens the Atlantic seaboard to offshore exploration and drilling.
Norway’s Statoil ASA (OSLO:STL) is exploring in New Zealand for the first time because the company likes the “very attractive commercial regime … and the very stable political regime,” Pal Haremo, Statoil’s senior vice president of exploration, told the WSJ. The oil firm pulled out of an Iraq project in 2012.

The push in Norway, Britain and other oil-rich developed nations like the United States is meeting staunch resistance from environmental groups and landowner advocates, who worry that ramping up oil and gas drilling will exacerbate global warming, increase air and water pollution, and invade citizens' private property rights.
Louise Hutchins, a U.K. energy campaigner for the advocacy group Greenpeace, said the government’s Monday announcement could mean millions of homeowners will be stripped of their right to stop companies from drilling under their property, the Guardian reported. Now communities will face a fracking ""lottery,” she said.
Thousands of protestors in New Zealand have taken to picketing the country’s beaches to protest deep-sea oil drilling. The group leading the pickets, Banners on the Beach, has argued that offshore drilling is too risky; a spill would destroy natural habitats and blanket New Zealand’s shores with toxic oil.
Still, the payoffs may prove too promising for governments to pass up. Energy companies spent about $1.27 billion exploring New Zealand in 2012, up from $346 million a decade ago, the WSJ noted.

714,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 28, 2014 01:30AM ET</span>",Australia Approves $15.5B Carmichael Coal Project,"By Reuters - The Australian government on Monday approved Indian firm Adani Mining Pty Ltd's controversial A$16.5 billion ($15.5 billion) Carmichael coal and rail project in Queensland, subject to strict conditions to protect groundwater.
The Carmichael mine, which could become Australia's largest coal mine at 60 million tons a year, has sparked protests from green groups and marine tour operators worried about carbon pollution and export of the coal from a port near the Great Barrier Reef.
Greenpeace said the conditions imposed on the project would do little to protect the environment from the bigger impact of shipping through the World Heritage-listed reef and burning the huge amounts of coal the mine will produce.
""A massive coal mine that will damage the Great Barrier Reef and do damage to the local environment and fuel climate change is not protecting the environment,"" said Ben Pearson, Australia Pacific programme director for Greenpeace.
The Carmichael coal lode is in the outback Galilee Basin, where massive reserves of coal remain untapped due to the hefty costs of building ports and rail lines to the east coast nearly 500 kilometers (310 miles) away.
Hurdles to Galilee Basin projects have increased as coal prices have sunk to near five-year lows and as global pressure to cut coal to curb carbon emissions has stoked uncertainty over long-term demand, making it tough to raise funds for projects.

Despite the challenges, Adani and compatriot GVK, which is working on a rival Galilee Basin coal project with Australia's richest woman, Gina Rinehart, are still planning to build large new mines, rail lines and a port terminal.
""We welcome the Minister's approval of the Carmichael Mine and Rail project, which takes us another step closer to delivering our multi–billion dollar mine, rail and port development,"" Adani Chairman Gautam Adani said in a statement.
The environmental conditions imposed on Adani's project were largely to address concerns raised by landowners worried that coal projects in the area will affect groundwater supply from the Great Artesian Basin.

717,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 27, 2014 12:30PM ET</span>","Deutsche Bank, HSBC And Bank Of Nova Scotia Accused Of Messing With Silver Prices ","By Angelo Young - Three banks abused their power to manipulate the daily benchmark price for silver, violating U.S. antitrust laws and rules established by the Commodity Exchange Act, according to a lawsuit filed in Manhattan on behalf of traders.
The accusations come as banks have fallen under increased scrutiny since the summer of 2012 when they were found to be manipulating the daily London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, which affects the cost of borrowing worldwide, from business borrowing to car and home loans.
A complaint filed in a federal court in Manhattan Friday alleges London’s HSBC Holdings Plc (LONDON:HSBA), Frankfurt’s Deutsche Bank (XETRA:DBKGn) and Toronto-based Bank of Nova Scotia (TO:BNS) established, “positions in both physical silver and silver derivatives prior to the public release of silver fixing results, allowing them to reap large illegitimate profits.”
HSBC and Deutsche Bank are the world’s second- and third-largest banks by the value of the assets they own.
Earlier this year Barclays (LONDON:BARC), the world’s 10th-largest bank, was fined $45 million by Britain's Financial Conduct Authority after a trader at the bank admitted to manipulating the daily spot price for gold in 2012. Like the accusations made public Friday, critics argued the way the gold benchmark price is set is antiquated and ripe for abuse because the figure is established in secrecy among the world’s largest financial institutions.

""Prices should be determined by market forces of supply and demand and not due to a bank's determination,” Mark O'Byrne, research director at broker GoldCore, told AFP earlier this month.
Friday’s lawsuit filed by J. Scott Nicholson, a resident of Washington state, seeks class-action status representing precious-metal traders against the three banks that set the daily silver benchmark price. The current system of setting the silver prices is more than a century old.
The scrutiny into how banks set the base price of gold and silver has caused some to back out of the process. Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank said it would stop participating in the setting of metals benchmarks.

725,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 25, 2014 12:15PM ET</span>",Railroad Sues Maryland To Keep Crude Oil Shipment Routes Secret,"By Maria Gallucci - A major rail company is suing Maryland to block national media organizations from learning about crude oil shipments through the state, and another railroad may soon file such a lawsuit. The privacy tussle comes as regulators ramp up their scrutiny of the industry amid rising concerns about crude oil train derailments and spills.
Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC), an eastern rail company from Norfolk, Va., filed a lawsuit in a Baltimore City court this week to stop the public release of information about the shipments. Two weeks earlier, the publishing company McClatchy Company (NYSE:MNI) and the Associated Press had filed state Public Information Act requests, which Maryland officials indicated they would fulfill, McClatchy’s Washington bureau reported.
A similar lawsuit from CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX), a rival eastern rail company, is reportedly likely to also file suit in Maryland.
While railcars have moved crude oil in the past, shipments are reaching unprecedented levels amid the oil boom in North Dakota’s Bakken shale region. The area lacks sufficient pipeline infrastructure, forcing oil companies to move supplies via rail tankers instead of underground. Last year 415,000 rail-carloads of crude moved through the United States, compared to just 9,500 loads in 2008, according to a new report by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).  
The uptick in rail activity has led to a spate of derailments and several serious oil accidents. In July 2013, an oil train in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, exploded and killed 47 people. Most recently, an oil-carrying freight train in May derailed in Lynchburg, Va., and spilled 30,000 gallons of oil into the James River.

In response, the DOT has pushed to improve the safety of rail tankers carrying hazardous materials. On Wednesday, the department proposed rules that include phasing out older and more vulnerable cars and replacing them with stronger cars, reducing operating speeds and upgrading braking systems. And in May, the DOT issued an emergency order requiring rail companies to alert state emergency management officials about shipments of 1 million gallons or more of crude rail shipments within state borders. The notifications were meant to help fire departments better prepare for potential derailments, McClatchy reported.
Rail companies asked state officials to sign confidentiality agreements, arguing that sharing the data with the public could threaten security and market share. The DOT found that no federal law protects the information from public disclosure, and several states – including California, Washington, Illinois and Florida – have fulfilled open records requests, McClatchy noted.
The Norfolk Southern lawsuit appears to be the first time a rail company has gone to court to keep the information confidential.

742,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 23, 2014 01:41PM ET</span>",Crude gains on upbeat U.S. inventory report ,"Investing.com - Crude futures rose on Wednesday after data revealed that oil stockpiles in the U.S. fell more than expected last week.
In the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for delivery in September traded up 0.67% at $103.08 a barrel during U.S. trading. New York-traded oil futures hit a session low of $101.80 a barrel and a high of $103.33 a barrel.
The September contract settled down 0.46% at $102.39 a barrel on Tuesday.
Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $101.48 a barrel, Monday's low, and resistance at $103.45 a barrel, Tuesday's high.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that U.S. crude oil inventories declined by 4.0 million barrels in the week ended July 18, well beyond expectations for a decline of 2.8 million barrels.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 371.1 million barrels as of last week.
The report also showed that total motor gasoline inventories increased by 3.4 million barrels, above forecasts for a gain of 1.3 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles rose by 1.6 million barrels, below expectations for an increase of 2.1 million barrels.
That boosted oil prices by fueling sentiments that demand is on the rise even in an economy that is awash in crude.
Geopolitical concerns kept prices higher as well.
Earlier Wednesday, reports that two Ukrainian jet fighters were shot down over the rebel-held city of Donetsk only days after pro-Russian separatists allegedly shot down a Malaysian Airlines flight with a missile rattled nerves, stoking supply concerns.
Fears the conflict could threaten Russian oil exports supported oil prices, though concerns the conflict could drag on global recovery dampened gains.
Separately, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil futures for September delivery were up 0.46% and trading at US$107.83 a barrel, while the spread between the Brent and U.S. crude contracts stood at US$4.75 a barrel.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in August traded at $3.796 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, up 0.64%. The commodity hit a session high of $3.817 and a low of $3.756.
The August contract settled down 2.00% on Tuesday to end at $3.772 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $3.741 per million British thermal units, the low from Nov. 26, 2013, and resistance at $3.893, Monday's high.
Natural gas prices dove in recent sessions after weather-forecasting services predicted a summertime cool snap to make its way across parts of the heavily-populated Midwest and northeastern U.S. over the coming days.
In its daily weather forecast, Natgasweather.com reported that the current cool snap hasn't been significantly impressive, ""but it will open the door for additional weather systems to impact the northern U.S. late this weekend and all of next week with unsettled weather and lower than normal cooling demand.""
Demand for natural gas tends drop when temperatures fall in the summer, as households throttle back on their air conditioners.
Still, prices rose as investors bet hotter temperatures will return, as mild temperatures typical of fall are still months away for most of the U.S.
Supply data remained in focus.
This weekly’s supply data was expected to show that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 95 billion cubic feet in the week ended July 18.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.129 trillion cubic feet as of last week, narrowing the deficit to the five-year average to 25.5%, down from a record 54.7% at the end of March.
Injections of gas into storage have surpassed the five-year average for 13 consecutive weeks.

745,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 23, 2014 10:30AM ET</span>",Japan Boosts Support For Overseas Coal Plants,"By Maria Gallucci - Japan is boosting its financial support for coal-fired power plants built overseas, an official said Wednesday, shrugging off calls from the Obama administration and global environmental groups to scale back public funding for carbon-intensive coal.
By providing public loans and insurance for new coal technologies, developed nations can prevent emerging countries from building cheaper, dirtier and inefficient facilities, Takafumi Kakudo, coal director at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said, the Wall Street Journal reported. He spoke at a meeting of government energy experts who approved the pro-coal policy on Wednesday.
Without such support, “It could aggravate the CO2 emissions issue,” Kakudo said, the WSJ noted.
The move comes as the United States, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden are attempting to stem public financing for new coal plants built abroad because of concerns about global warming. The U.S. Export-Import Bank in December announced its guidelines would no longer support “high-carbon intensity projects,” except in countries where no other financial feasible options are available, or in cases where plants come equipped with carbon capture technology.
In April, dozens of international green groups sent Prime Minister Shinzo Abe an open letter that called on his administration to “align Japan’s overseas investments with the international community and end support for coal plants.” The groups wrote that “the Japanese government claims that they are helping to mitigate climate change by using state-of-the-art coal technology, but there simply is no way to make a coal plant clean.”
Japan is the world’s largest public financier of overseas coal projects, followed by the United States and Germany. Japan invested $19.7 billion in overseas coal from 2007 to 2013, according to a recent count by the Natural Resources Defense Council, while the United States spent $9.01 billion over that period and Germany invested $6.07 billion in public dollars. All told, total investments from development banks and international financial institutions totaled nearly $60 billion during that seven-year stretch.
In Japan, the government-owned Japanese Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) has led the country’s financial support for overseas coal plants and mines, which typically involve the exchange of Japanese technology, equipment and expertise. In the past decade, the bank has invested in nearly two-dozen coal facilities in Indonesia, India, Vietnam and the Philippines, largely in collaboration with private banks.

Most recently, JBIC announced a $202 million credit line last week for Vietnam Electricity to buy Japanese equipment for a new coal facility in that country.
In its policy adopted on Wednesday, Japan defended its coal investments, arguing that developing nations would need more coal-fired power to support their economic growth. “Encouraging the adoption of the most efficient coal technology as possible is a realistic way to cut CO2,” according to the policy statement, the WSJ reported. Critics of coal power, by contrast, say the best move for the climate is to invest in renewable energy technologies today rather than lock countries into decades of coal-fired power.

Natural gas prices took a dive after weather-forecasting services predicted a summertime cool snap to make its way across parts of the heavily-populated Midwest and northeastern U.S. over the next severl days.
""Fresh weather data continues to stream in, and it's still on track with a series of cooler Canadian weather systems impacting much of the central and eastern U.S. during the last week of July. The first system will weaken the ridge later this week and open the door for a more impressive cool blast that develops from the merging of two weather systems,"" Natgasweather.com reported in its mid-day update on Tuesday.
""This will create a fairly impressive massive trough of low pressure that will cover all of the eastern U.S. by next Tuesday. This will again bring very comfortable 70s and lower 80s to many regions, with 60s again over the extreme north.""
Demand for natural gas tends drop when temperatures fall in the summer, as households throttle back on their air conditioners.
Supply uncertainty weighed on the commodity as well.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report on July 17 that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 107 billion cubic feet during the week before last, well above expectations for an increase of 98 billion cubic feet.

Injections of gas into storage have surpassed the five-year average for 13 consecutive weeks.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.129 trillion cubic feet as of last week, narrowing the deficit to the five-year average to 25.5%, down from a record 54.7% at the end of March.

759,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2014 09:50AM ET</span>","Libya oil output slips, fresh fighting in Tripoli","TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libyan oil production has fallen, turning back a hard-won increase since April in the revenue flow for the government facing increased fighting around the airport in the capital and in the eastern city of Benghazi. 
The El-Feel oilfield last week was forced to cut back due to events in Tripoli, where two rival brigades of militias have fought over control of the airport. 
El-Feel, operated by state-run National Oil Corporation and Italy's ENI, is protected by security guards from the northwestern Zintan region, whose fighters also protect the airport where clashes have gone on for a week. 
National Oil Company spokesman Mohamed El Harari said output as of Monday was around 450,000 bpd compared with 555,000 bpd on Thursday. 
 At least 47 people have died in the week-long Tripoli airport clashes, which involved artillery, Grad rockets and anti-aircraft guns, in some of the heaviest street fighting since the 2011 civil war. 
Fresh fighting broke out on Monday night in Tripoli and Benghazi where armed forces and troops loyal to a renegade former army general are battling Islamist militants who have set up base there. 
There were no immediate reports on casualties from Monday's fighting in Benghazi or the Qasr Ben Ghashir neighborhood near Tripoli airport where residents have been forced from their homes or trapped by the gun battles. 
""There are a lot of families still stuck and not able to get out because of the intensity of the shelling and bombing, which is with all kinds of heavy weapons,"" said local area mayor Mohammad Abdullah. 
 The clashes have stopped most international flights, damaged more than a dozen planes parked at the airport - one Airbus jet billowed black smoke after being hit on Monday - and prompted the United Nations to pull its staff out of Libya. 
The airport clash reflects national divisions between two main factions: those from the western town of Zintan and their allies who are loosely tied to the National Forces Alliance political movement, and the more Islamist-leaning Misrata brigades and allied militias who side with Justice and Construction Party, a wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. 
 Libya's oil resources have often been targeted by armed groups since 2011 to push the government for financial or political gain. Last year a string of protests slashed oil output to less than half the usual 1.4 million barrels per day. 
A negotiated deal in April mostly ended a year-long blockade by a former rebel commander over four key oil ports, allowing Libya to slowly rebuild production, shipping crude and earning vital oil revenue. 
One of Libya's ports, Brega, is expected to be operating within a ""few days"" after the government reached a deal with protesting security guards to end a blockade, NOC's Harari said. 

According to Reuters AIS Live tanker tracking service, no tankers had loaded so far at Brega. One crude shipment left the 230,000 barrels-per-day Zawiya port, supplied by the El Sharara oilfield, which was recently reopened. The Olympic Spirit II, carrying Aframax, crude oil, headed to the Spanish port of Bilbao having left July 20.

768,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 21, 2014 02:30PM ET</span>",Maine Town Weighs Crude Oil Ban,"By Maria Gallucci - A small town in southern Maine is throwing a wrench in the oil industry’s plans to increase the flow of Canadian tar sands crude.
On Monday night, South Portland’s city council is expected to approve a ban on the export of crude oil from the local waterfront. The ordinance would effectively prevent the possibility of using an existing Maine-to-Montreal pipeline to ship Canadian crude into the U.S. Northeast for export.
The vote follows a year-and-a-half long campaign by residents, city officials and local environmental groups who say they are worried that piping tar sands crude – a particularly heavy and carbon-intensive form of oil – into South Portland would dirty the air, contaminate the water and increase emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.
For oil companies, the ordinance has two major implications. First, it will likely galvanize efforts by local opponents and national environmental groups to stop proposed pipeline projects like the Keystone XL, which would carry tar sands crude over 1,179 miles from Alberta, Canada to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would connect with an existing segment to the Texas Gulf Coast. In Nebraska, a groundswell of community opposition has helped create significant delays for TransCanada Corp., the pipeline’s builder.
The South Portland measure “will be seen across the industry as a shot in the arm for people opposing the dramatic expansion of tar sands,” Dave Stember, a national organizer at the climate advocacy group 350.org, told International Business Times. 350.org is a member of the Tar Sands Free Northeast, a loose coalition of green groups. “This is a very encouraging sign that we’re seeing at the local level.”
Second, the ordinance limits oil companies’ options for getting their supplies of tar sands crude out of the landlocked Alberta province. The lack of transportation pipelines is creating a bottleneck that is driving down prices for Canadian crude and forcing developers to scale back their expansion efforts. In May, for instance, French energy giant Total SA decided to shelve an $11 billion tar sands mine because of the rising cost pressures.

The 236-mile Maine-to-Montreal pipeline currently moves conventional crude oil from South Portland to Canadian refineries, but its owner, Portland-Montreal Pipe Line had previously floated plans to reverse the flow to carry tar sands crude. The oil industry has threatened to oppose the effort. In December, the American Petroleum Institute (API), the industry's main lobbyist, sent the city council a five-page letter warning of legal challenges.
""Maine is just another example of radical activists inserting their off-oil agenda into local politics, putting jobs and energy security at risk,"" API spokeswoman Sabrina Fang said in an e-mailed statement. ""This is not the American way. We need to stand up for the middle class and protect their jobs.""

771,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 21, 2014 10:45AM ET</span>",US Natural Gas Drilling's Unabated Rise Lifting Corporate Profits ,"By Maria Gallucci - U.S. natural gas drillers are flocking back into the fields amid a recent recovery in gas prices, and major services and equipment providers are reaping the benefits.
Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) on Monday reported record second-quarter revenues of a total $8.1 billion, up 11 percent from revenues of $7.3 billion in the first quarter of 2014.
Its key oilfield services competitors also saw strong second quarters, with Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) reporting revenues of $12.05 billion – a 7 percent rise over the first quarter of 2014 – and Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE:BHI) announcing record second-quarter revenues of $5.9 billion, up about 3.5 percent from the previous quarter.
The second-quarter gains signal an industry-wide recovery in North America after a two-year slump, Reuters reported. Until recently, weak fuel prices had kept drilling firms away from natural gas basins, forcing Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes to compete for a dwindling number of contracts.
All three firms suggested a bright outlook for the third quarter of 2014 as U.S. offshore and onshore oil and gas drilling continues to pick up.

“We expect North America activity levels to continue to improve, with margins approaching 20 percent in the third quarter,” Dave Lesar, Halliburton 's chairman, president and CEO, said in the quarterly statement.
“We have concluded, based on the strength of this outlook, that we will immediately accelerate additions to our hydraulic fracturing fleet and logistics capabilities, with new crews available for service beginning later this year,” he said.

The company has been preparing to sell the facilities since late last year, it said. In the first quarter of this year, Severstal reported a $100 million loss on revenue of $3 billion.
“The sale of Columbus and Dearborn unlocks substantial value to Severstal’s shareholders,’’ Alexey Mordashov, Severstal’s chief executive, said in a statement.
Steel Dynamics said the $1.6 billion purchase of “one of the most modern mini-mills in North America,” in Columbus, Mississippi, will expand its operating base by 40 percent.

""We have been positioning our balance sheet and organizational structure for growth such as this,"" Mark Millett, CEO of Steel Dynamics, said in a statement.
AK Steel said the $700 million purchase of the Dearborn, Michigan, steel plant will add about one-third additional capacity to the company’s operations.

788,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 18, 2014 02:30PM ET</span>",North Dakota's Oil Exports By Rail May Have Peaked,"By Meagan Clark - North Dakota, the largest oil-producing U.S. state after Texas, expects output to surge this summer as good weather allows workers more time to pump from the fields, and it appears that oil moving by rail in the state has peaked as oil moving by pipeline increases.
Output climbed the most in May since last August, by 3.6 percent to 1.04 million barrels a day, the state’s Department of Mineral Resources said this week. Lynn Helms, director of the department, told reporters on a conference call that she expects production growth to hit 5 to 6 percent a month in June, July and August.
Since May 2011, the boom in oil production from North Dakota and Texas has increased the amount of oil riding trains nationwide by more than 400 percent, causing some fiery and sometimes fatal derailments and sparking a national debate about rail safety. But since the beginning of the year, oil-by-rail shipments have been declining, while oil exports by pipeline have increased.
About 34 percent of North Dakota’s oil was shipped by pipeline and 59 percent by rail in May, according to the North Dakota Pipeline Authority. That’s the lowest rail percentage since November 2012. In April, 63 percent of the oil produced in North Dakota was shipped by rail, down from a peak of 75 percent in April 2013, according to the NDPA.

“We did have open space available on some of our pipeline systems that were able to allow for the barrels [of oil] to then have that option to be moved onto the rail network,” said Justin Kringstad, director of the agency.
The state has several pipeline projects lined up that will dramatically expand capacity, including two before the end of the year, the Butte Loop and Hiland Double H, with a combined capacity of 160,000 barrels of oil per day. In May, the Plains Bakken North pipeline came online and took 40,000 barrels per day to Canada.
Kringstad expects that as pipeline capacity expands, more oil will move through pipes, since it's usually a cheaper method than rail. But he’s quick to clarify that the NDPA can’t predict.
“We don’t know what production levels are going to be,” he said."

791,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 18, 2014 12:15PM ET</span>",Obama Paves Way For East Coast Offshore Oil,"By Maria Gallucci - Just days after unveiling a slate of climate change initiatives, the Obama administration has paved the way for offshore oil drilling near the U.S. East Coast.
The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy and Management on Friday approved the use of controversial sonic cannons to discover oil and gas deposits under the ocean -- opening the Eastern seaboard to offshore oil exploration for the first time in decades, the Associated Press reported. The government estimates that the technology could harm nearly 140,000 sea creatures, including fish and endangered whales and sea turtles.
The sonic cannons are used to detect underground deposits and can shoot sound waves 100 times louder than a jet engine. The pulses of sound reverberate beneath the sea floor and bounce back to the surface, where computers translate the measurements into high-resolution 3-D images, AP noted. The cannons will be deployed in federal waters from Florida to Delaware.
""It's like a sonogram of the earth,"" Andy Radford, a petroleum engineer at the American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas trade association in Washington, D.C., told the AP. ""You can't see the oil and gas, but you can see the structures in the earth that might hold oil and gas.""
News of the sonic cannons follows Obama's announcement Wednesday of a slew of new programs to help local U.S. communities prepare for the effects of climate change, which is caused in part by burning fossil fuels like offshore oil and gas deposits.

The cannons could potentially be fired for weeks or months at a time. The intense noise pollution poses a major threat to sea creatures such as whales, turtles and fish that use sound to communicate across hundreds of miles of ocean. Most at risk are already-endangered north Atlantic right whales -- only 500 remain in the world, marine experts said.
""No one has been allowed to test anything like this on right whales,"" Scott Kraus, a right whale expert at the John H. Prescott Marine Laboratory in Boston, told AP. The Obama administration has “authorized a giant experiment on right whales that this country would never allow researchers to do.""

809,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2014 05:40PM ET</span>","U.S. hits oil giant Rosneft, other firms with toughest Russia sanctions","By Anna Yukhananov and Steve Holland WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama imposed the biggest package of U.S. economic sanctions yet on Russia on Wednesday, hitting Russia's largest oil producer Rosneft and other energy, financial and defense firms, with what he called significant but targeted penalties.
Obama's latest round of sanctions came after close consultations with European leaders, who announced a less-ambitious package. The ultimate impact of the U.S. sanctions likely depends on whether the European Union follows suit.
The extent of the sanctions against key parts of the Russian energy and financial industry, including Gazprombank, was intended to serve notice to Moscow that its refusal to curb violence in eastern Ukraine has consequences.
The targeted companies also include Russia's second-largest gas producer, Novatek, Vnesheconombank, or VEB, a state-owned bank that acts as payment agent for the Russian government, and eight arms firms.
The U.S. Treasury Department said the measures effectively closed medium- and long-term dollar funding to the two banks and energy companies. But the sanctions did not freeze those four companies' assets, or otherwise prohibit U.S. firms or companies from doing business with them.
It is the first time the United States has imposed such narrowly targeted measures as it seeks the maximum impact on Russia, a huge energy producer, while avoiding any immediate shock to global oil markets or U.S. and EU companies.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking in Brasilia, said the sanctions would damage U.S. energy companies, and bring relations with Russia to a ""dead end.""
One analyst said the sanctions remained limited in their scope and were likely to prompt a ""war of words"" more than anything else.
""I think that the impact on oil sales will be negligible,"" said sanctions expert Douglas Jacobson, attorney at Jacobson Burton in Washington. ""It is another classic shot across the bow and a message from the United States that sanctions can be ramped up.""
Obama said Putin had so far failed to take steps needed to resolve the crisis peacefully.
""We have emphasized our preference to resolve this issue diplomatically, but that we have to see concrete actions and not just words that Russia, in fact, is committed to trying to end this conflict along the Russia- Ukraine border,"" he said.
Washington said on Wednesday that up to 12,000 Russian combat forces were back on the border with Ukraine and that weaponry was crossing over to pro-Russian separatists.
The increase in the Russian presence occurred several weeks after Moscow had drawn down its forces in the area to about 1,000 troops.
POSSIBLE FURTHER SANCTIONS
Obama said the United States could impose further sanctions if Russia did not take concrete steps to ease the conflict.
The United States has already imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russian and Ukrainian senior officials since the start of the violence, including Rosneft's chief executive, Igor Sechin. But the sanctions have had only a limited impact on the Russian energy industry, a cornerstone of the country's $2 trillion economy.
It is not yet clear how large an impact the new measures will have on Rosneft, which had sales of $40 billion in the first quarter, about 8.6 percent of Russia's gross domestic product, or the companies it does business with.
Sechin, who like Putin was speaking in Brasilia, said the sanctions would not affect Rosneft's current project with ExxonMobil, but would damage the shareholders of U.S. companies cooperating with Rosneft.
The new sanctions would not appear to prevent Rosneft from selling its oil, but may raise questions about the company's more than $15 billion worth of oil-related finance arrangements with companies including BP, which now owns almost a fifth of Rosneft, and Glencore.
Morgan Stanley, which is selling the majority of its global physical oil trading operations to Rosneft, declined to comment.
The sanctions stopped short of targeting Russia's Gazprom, the world's largest natural gas producer and provider of much of Europe's energy supplies. Gazprombank is 36 percent-owned by Gazprom.
RUNNING OUT OF PATIENCE
""These sanctions are significant, but they are also targeted, designed to have the maximum impact on Russia while limiting any spillover effects on American companies or those of our allies,"" Obama told reporters.
The new measures were announced on the same day that EU leaders met in Brussels and agreed to expand their own sanctions on Russia.
The new U.S. sanctions also include Feodosiya Enterprises, a shipping facility in Crimea, and senior Russian officials, several of whom had already been targeted by the European Union.
The affected senior officials included the deputy head of the State Duma, or parliament, the minister of the Crimea, a commander of the Russian intelligence agency FSB, and a Ukrainian separatist leader.

Obama in recent weeks has repeatedly threatened new sanctions, and appears to have run out of patience as fighting continued to rage in eastern Ukraine.
The new sanctions were unlikely to please Republican lawmakers, many of whom have been calling for the imposition of sanctions on entire Russian industries, rather than specific companies, as the best way to control Putin.
Republican lawmakers said they welcomed the additional sanctions but that Obama should go further. Several lawmakers, Republicans in particular, have called for broader sectoral sanctions targeting important Russian industries like energy and banking.
""Until now, the administration's response to Putin's aggression has given him little reason to change his behavior. Continuing to go after the Russian economy is the way to send the most effective message,"" Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican, said.

810,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2014 05:00PM ET</span>",China seeks to build railways in Brazil to ship out commodities,"By Anthony Boadle BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil hopes that during a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping it can boost ties with its biggest trade partner beyond the exchange of commodities for manufactured goods, but that may be wishful thinking.
Accords China will sign with Brazil when Xi meets with President Dilma Rousseff on Thursday focus on improving infrastructure to make sure raw materials China is hungry for make it to port, with railways a top priority.
Brazilian officials are portraying Xi's state visit as a milestone in deepening a strategic partnership that will lead to Chinese investments in Brazil's manufacturing industry.
Trade between China and Brazil soared to $83.3 billion last year from $3.2 billion in 2002, with iron ore, soy and oil making up the bulk of Brazilian exports.
The Chinese have been making investment promises for years and failed to deliver. Three years after announcing plans to invest $2 billion in a soy-crushing plant and a giant storage hub in western Bahia, Chongqing Grain Group Corp has only managed to bulldoze a 100-hectare (250-acre) field.
There have been few success stories in the trickle of investment that has come in. Dongfeng Motor Corporation, one of China's largest automotive groups, has shelved a plan to build a 1 billion Brazilian reais ($450 million) truck factory in Brazil after falling out with its Brazilian partner.
Analysts say the Chinese are not interested in investing in manufacturing in Latin America, especially in Brazil where labor costs are high and regulatory hurdles abound.
""The Brazilians have to understand that Brazil is not terribly attractive,"" said Riordan Roett, Western Hemisphere director at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. ""There is no growth in credit and the government has not delivered on promises to improve infrastructure. The Chinese are very much aware of that.""
Unless Brazil can become more competitive, Chinese investment will go to Asian countries, or those in the burgeoning Pacific alliance, like Mexico, Roett said.
Brazilian officials say China wants to enter partnerships to build railways to ship grains and minerals to Brazilian ports.
Projects under consideration include railways to the ports of Ilheus in the state of Bahia and Itaqui in Maranhao, which are closer to the Panama Canal and would lower freight costs.
China is also interested in studying a railway across the Andes to the Pacific coast of Peru, which could shorten the trade route significantly, a trade ministry official said.
Brazilian officials expect no progress during Xi's visit in resolving an impasse over China's refusal to allow giant, bulk iron ore carriers used by Brazil's Vale SA to dock at Chinese ports, forcing the miner to transship cargoes from ports in the Philippines and Malaysia and increasing its costs.

Brazilian efforts to manufacture goods in China have also run into problems. China has not approved plans by Brazil's biggest bus maker Marcopolo to build a factory or plane maker Embraer to refit its plant in Harbin to make E-190 passenger planes.

811,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 16, 2014 04:00PM ET</span>",Denton May Become First Texas City To Ban Fracking ,"By Meagan Clark - Even Texans are hotly debating fracking.
Fed up with what it claimed were serious health-related issues among the community’s children,  the Denton Drilling Awareness Group, a grass-roots group in a town of the same name, has managed to get the state’s first referendum on whether to ban further permitting of the controversial oil-drilling practice within city limits.
“Parents there had to keep their kids indoors for weeks because the toxic fumes were so overwhelming,” according to Adam Briggle, vice president of the community group that organized a petition to push a vote on the ban.  “Children got nosebleeds, breathing problems and headaches.  … we can either have fracking or we can have a safe and healthy city.”
After listening to hours of community testimony late into the evening, the city council of the North Texas college town voted early Wednesday to allow a public vote in November to determine whether Denton will become the first city in Texas to ban fracking.
""What you’re seeing is in Denton, folks who otherwise are completely supportive of the oil and gas industry --  all the sudden when it’s happening to their neighbor are turning around,"" Kevin Roden, the councilman who called for the ban and who has lived in Denton for 24 years, said. ""I think there’s a reasonable way to develop these minerals. I don’t think the majority of the people who signed the petition are anti-fossil fuel.""
The council could have immediately adopted the ban, but instead voted 5-2 against that option. According to the Denton Record-Chronicle, of the 500 people who attended the meeting, 155 filled out comment cards favoring the ban and 46 filled out cards opposing the ban.
Brad Davis, who lives in a ranch house in northwest Denton, where most of the fracking occurs, says he can see and hear the drilling from his back porch, “kind of a soft hum” and “bright lights at night.”
“It’s not nearly as loud as the train,” he said. “If you didn’t know what it was you might not notice.”
A ban in the community, which ranges from rural pastures to multistory apartment complexes and sits atop the natural gas-rich Barnett Shale, will be closely watched. At least 423 local governments nationwide have passed measures that ban or restrict fracking, the vast majority in the northeast, but only four in Texas, according to Food and Water Watch.
However, even if Denton residents vote to ban fracking, state authorities would likely claim that the mineral rights on properties cannot be taken away from the landowners.
Other measures to restrict fracking in Texas fall short of the proposed Denton limits. A measure passed in June 2010 in Flower Mound, Texas, requires oil and gas companies fracking in the city to disclose the chemicals it mixes with water and sand pumped underground. Bartonville, a wealthy community outside Dallas and where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson has lived for years, tried to deny a fracking permit but was forced by the state to issue it in 2012, the Wall Street Journal reported.

A series of amendments Denton passed in 2013 prohibits drilling from closer than 1,200 feet from homes, parks, schools and anywhere else people, especially children, may gather. But state laws allow companies in the city to operate wells based on the rules that existed at the time they first received permits for them, some as early as 2002. What's more, a rising population encouraged some residential developments to expand their fences up to old wells that were dormant until new drilling technologies like fracking and changing natural gas prices made them profitable again. 
""That’s what’s been highly problematic,"" Roden said. ""Texas law isn’t helping out, so citizens are taking measures in their own hands.""
After New York’s Supreme Court ruling in late June that upheld dozens of city-imposed bans on fracking, Andrew Weissman, senior energy advisor for Haynes and Boone LLP, said the measure is likely to encourage similar efforts in other states but not likely to be successful in states like Texas where significant oil and gas development is occurring.
That is evident from this map of the nationwide anti-fracking movement by Food and Water Watch, which shows fracking measures heavily concentrated in the northern part of the Marcellus Shale in the northeast but not in most of the country with large shale deposits and booming oil industries like Texas and North Dakota.
""The drilling simply goes elsewhere,"" Tom Gellrich, Philadelphia-based oil and gas analyst at Topline Analytics, added.

Trafigura, co-founded by French billionaire Claude Dauphin, said it has been drawn in by India's primary metals market that is forecast to grow at up to 8 percent a year.
Small and medium businesses contribute to more than a third of the market, but most of them depend on traditional methods of procurement. Per-capita consumption of nearly all metals in India, Asia's third-largest economy, is far below world levels.
The online store, named Lykos, will sell consignments of 1 to 24 tonnes of aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc at index-linked prices, Trafigura said in a statement on Wednesday.
""There is a strong demand for refined metals such as aluminium, copper and zinc in smaller lot sizes, but currently the market suffers from lack of automation, erratic supply, poor quality control, complex transportation logistics and opaque pricing,"" said Raoul Bajaj, chief executive of Trafigura India.
Customers will have to take delivery from warehouses newly built near manufacturing centers in Gujarat, Rajasthan and West Bengal. More warehouses are planned.
Trafigura's move comes as storage of metals is in focus globally. The company and other metal merchants, Wall Street banks and the London Metal Exchange face more than two dozen class-action lawsuits alleging they artificially restricted supplies from warehouses and inflated aluminum and zinc prices. They have all denied the allegations.

More recently, Chinese authorities have launched an investigation into whether a private metals trading firm, Decheng Mining, and its related companies used fake warehouse receipts at Qingdao Port to obtain multiple loans secured against a single cargo of metal. Decheng has not commented on the probe.
Trafigura, incorporated in the Netherlands, has a vast portfolio of assets from African petrol stations, Texas docks to a Brazilian port and iron ore terminal, a private equity vehicle, vast offtake deals and almost 9,000 employees across 58 countries.

824,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2014 08:30PM ET</span>",China oil rig finishes exploration in disputed waters off Vietnam,"
By John Ruwitch and Nguyen Phuong Linh 
SHANGHAI/HANOI (Reuters) - A Chinese oil rig has finished drilling near the disputed Paracel islands in the South China Sea after finding signs of oil and gas, a top Chinese energy firm said on Wednesday, more than two months after its deployment hurt ties with Vietnam. 
Vietnam's coastguard said the $1 billion deepwater rig was being moved towards China's southernmost island province of Hainan. China's official Xinhua news agency said it would be relocated to an area off Hainan but gave no details or a date. 
The rig's relocation could reduce tensions between the two neighbours and will also likely be welcomed by Washington, which has accused China of ""provocative"" actions in the disputed South China Sea in recent months. 
Hanoi has said the rig was in its 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone and on its continental shelf. Beijing has said it was operating completely within its waters around the Paracel islands, which China occupy. 
China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), the dominant oil and gas producer in China, said in a statement the rig ""smoothly completed"" its drilling on Tuesday and found signs of oil and gas. The next step would be to analyse the geological data and evaluate the layers of oil and gas, it said. 
CNPC's preliminary analysis showed ""the area has the basic conditions and potential for oil exploration, but extraction testing cannot begin before a comprehensive assessment of the data"", Xinhua quoted Wang Zhen, deputy director of the CNPC Policy Research Office, as saying. 
China had previously said the rig was scheduled to explore the waters around the Paracels until mid-August. It was not clear why it had finished one month ahead of schedule, although Xinhua said July was the beginning of the typhoon season. 
Admiral Ngo Ngoc Thu, chief of staff of the Vietnam coastguard, told Reuters by telephone the rig was about 30 nautical miles from Triton island in the Paracels and had been moving towards Hainan since late on Tuesday night. Thu said Vietnamese boats were still watching the area closely. 
Deployment of the rig on May 2 set off deadly anti-Chinese riots in Vietnam, while scores of Vietnamese and Chinese ships have regularly squared off around the platform. There have been several collisions. 
A Reuters reporter on a Vietnamese coastguard vessel on Tuesday witnessed a group of Chinese ships chase the Vietnamese boat away from the area in what has been a near daily cat-and-mouse routine. 
The rig is owned by state-run China National Offshore Oil Company Group (CNOOC Group), parent of flagship unit CNOOC Ltd. 
POTENTIAL FOR PRODUCTION 
China claims 90 percent of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also claim parts of the waters, whose estimated energy potential varies widely. 
Discoveries near the coasts of Southeast Asian countries in recent years have been mostly natural gas, reinforcing the belief among geologists and explorers that there is more gas than oil in the South China Sea. 
Chinese industry experts have said the rig had a good chance of finding enough gas to put the area into production. That would give China its first viable energy field in the disputed South China Sea, as well as make it a source of friction with Hanoi for years to come. 
The world's largest energy user imports nearly 60 percent of its oil needs and more than 30 percent of its natural gas. 
In a 2013 report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a government agency, said geological evidence suggested the Paracel islands themselves did not have significant potential in terms of conventional hydrocarbons. 
However, the chance of making a major gas discovery near the islands was high because there had been several gas finds already in the area, experts have said. 
Vietnam has two fields to the left of where the rig had been stationed, much closer to its coast, where U.S. giant Exxon Mobil Corp discovered oil and gas in 2011 and 2012. 
Some energy production is taking place in the South China Sea but deepwater areas remain untapped, largely because tensions between rival claimants have made oil companies and private oil service companies reluctant to explore contentious acreage well away from sovereign coastlines.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in August traded at $4.112 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, down 0.86%. The commodity hit a session high of $4.158 and a low of $4.098.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.092 per million British thermal units, Monday's low, and resistance at $4.173, Monday's high.
A weather system similar to the Polar Vortex from last winter will bring below-normal temperatures to the U.S. Midwest and head east this week, which sent natural gas prices dipping on Tuesday.
In its July 15-21 weather forecast summary, Natgasweather.com reported that the strong Canadian blast of cool air moving across the central and eastern US with the cold front will bring highs reaching only into 60s and 70s in its wake.
Temperatures will be 8-20⁰F cooler than normal over a good chunk of the eastern half of the U.S., while overnight lows will drop into the upper 40s and 50s across the upper Midwest.
Below-normal temperatures this time of year cut into demand for air conditioning, which curbs demand for natural gas, though prices didn't plummet, as warmer air will prevail elsewhere.
""Over the western and extreme southern U.S., high pressure will hold strong and continue to bring hot temperatures with highs warming into the 90s and 100s along with afternoon monsoon thunderstorms,"" Natgasweather.com reported.
""High pressure will begin to strengthen this weekend in the wake of the departing low. This will allow temperatures in the 80s and lower 90s to surge into much of the northern U.S. with mid 90s and 100s setting up over the southern U.S.""
Meanwhile, concerns over tight supplies continued to fade away after weekly supply data released last week showed that utilities in the U.S. added 93 billion cubic feet of gas into storage in the week ended July 4.
The five-year average change for the week is an increase of 72 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.022 trillion cubic feet as of last week, 24.4% below their level this time last year and 27.5% below the five-year average.

Supply data from last week pressured prices as well, though bottom fishing prevented prices from plummeting and stabilized the commodity.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report last Thursday that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ending July 4 rose by 93 billion cubic feet, above expectations for an increase of 92 billion cubic feet.

847,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 13, 2014 09:30PM ET</span>","Whiting To Buy Kodiak For $3.8 Billion, Create No. 1 Bakken Producer","By Reuters - Whiting Petroleum Corp (NYSE:WLL).  said on Sunday it would acquire Kodiak Oil & Gas Corp (NYSE:KOG) for $3.8 billion in stock, to become the largest producer in North Dakota's Bakken shale oil formations, eclipsing Harold Hamm's Continental Resources Inc (NYSE:CLR).
By surpassing Continental, Whiting is signaling its desire to become the pre-eminent player in what is considered one of North America's most-prolific shale formations, where more than 1 million barrels of oil are extracted daily.
""It's going to allow our production at the combined company to grow faster than Whiting standalone did before,"" Whiting Chief Executive James Volker said in an interview.
Whiting said the deal, valued at $6 billion when Kodiak's net debt of $2.2 billion is included, is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Kodiak shareholders will receive 0.177 share of Whiting stock for each share of Kodiak common stock they hold, representing a value of $13.90 per share based on the closing price of Whiting shares on July 11.
That would be a 5.1 percent premium to the volume weighted average price of Kodiak shares during the last 60 trading days.
Whiting's Volker added the combined company will have greater access to capital which will accelerate development of oil production. The deal is expected to be accretive to the combined shareholders for cash flow, earnings per share and production per share for 2015 and beyond.
The companies' combined output from the Bakken/Three Forks formations in the first quarter was more than 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 855,000 combined net acres and almost 3,500 net future drilling locations.
To compete with Continental, which has gobbled up more that 1 million acres of land, Whiting had to acquire a smaller North Dakota rival. The CEOs said in a joint interview the merger of the two Denver companies had been considered for years but came together in the past few months.
Kodiak's appeal stems from its long-standing policy of marketing itself to Wall Street as a ""pure-play"" bet on North Dakota's oil revolution, and CEO Lynn Peterson had made bold and expensive bets to increase production.

For example, Peterson actively touted Kodiak's use of expensive ceramic proppant during the hydraulic fracturing process to hold cracks open in shale rock and extract oil and natural gas. While pricey, ceramic proppant is considered by Peterson and some others in the industry the best way to increase production.
Whiting, however, does not widely use ceramic proppant, and it wasn't immediately clear if Whiting would cut costs at Kodiak once the company is absorbed. Whiting's management will lead the company while Kodiak's Peterson will join the board along with Kodiak executive James Catlin.
Whiting's financial advisor was JPMorgan , while Foley & Lardner and Stikeman Elliot provided legal counsel. Petrie Partners Securitiesadvised Kodiak while Credit Suisse provided a fairness opinion. Dorsey & Whitney and Miller Thomson were Kodiak's legal advisers.

854,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 11, 2014 07:00PM ET</span>","Kurds Seize Iraq Oilfields, Ministers Exit Government","By Reuters - Kurdish forces seized two oilfields in northern Iraq and took over operations from a state-run oil company on Friday, while Kurdish politicians formally suspended their participation in Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government.
The moves escalated a feud between the Shi'ite-led central government and the autonomous Kurdish region driven by a Sunni insurgency which threatens to fragment Iraq along sectarian and ethnic lines three years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops.
The Kurdish forces took over production facilities at the Bai Hassan and Kirkuk oilfields near the city of Kirkuk, the oil ministry in Baghdad said. It called on the Kurds to withdraw immediately to avoid ""dire consequences.""
Kurdish forces took control of nearby Kirkuk a month ago after Iraqi troops withdrew in the face of a lightning assault by Islamic State militants, who have seized large parts of northern and western Iraq.
The two oilfields have a combined production capacity of 450,000 barrels per day but have not been producing significant volumes since March when Baghdad's Kirkuk-Ceyhan export pipeline was sabotaged.
An oil ministry spokesman in Baghdad described the takeover as dangerous and irresponsible and called for the Kurdish forces to withdraw immediately.
Kurdish authorities said they had moved to ""secure the oilfields of Bai Hassan and the Makhmour area"" of the giant Kirkuk oilfield after hearing that the oil ministry planned to disrupt a pipeline designed to pump oil from Makhmour.
Bai Hassan and the Makhmour part of the Kirkuk oilfield had been under the control of the state's North Oil Company (NOC).
""The Kurdish Regional Government learned on Thursday that some officials in the federal Ministry of Oil gave orders to a number of NOC staff to cease their cooperation with the KRG and to dismantle or render inoperable the valves on the new pipeline,"" the Kurdish authorities said in a statement.
The statement said the Bai Hassan field and other fields in the Makhmour district were under Kurdish government management and that NOC staff had been told they should cooperate with Kurdish authorities from Saturday or leave. It also said any production at the fields would be used primarily for domestic supply.
The Baghdad ministry rejected Kurdish assertions that they had acted to protect oil infrastructure, saying it had worked to raise output at the fields and increase investment in local gasoline production.
Fighting between government forces and militants is raging in and around several cities in northern and western Iraq, some insurgent-held - like Tikrit - and others under tenuous control of government forces like Ramadi in Anbar province.
Security forces repelled an Islamic State militant surge on Friday on the Anbar Operations Command centre and police headquarters in Ramadi.
Fighting lasted several hours before the militants were pushed back, a security source in Ramadi told Reuters, adding that the situation in Ramadi had worsened in recent weeks as the militants had become more aggressive in their attacks.
On the southern edge of Kirkuk province, where thousands of displaced have fled from the city of Tikrit and other areas overrun by militants last month, 18 civilians were killed and 26 more severely wounded when a suicide bomber drove a car into a checkpoint, police and medics said.
POLITICAL DEADLOCK
Efforts to reach agreement on a new government in Baghdad to confront the insurgents have been complicated by the tensions between Maliki and the Kurds. The United States, the United Nations and Iraq's own Shi'ite clerics have urged lawmakers to form a new government swiftly to deal with the Sunni insurgency.
The first session of the national parliament elected in April took place last week but failed to reach agreement on nominations for the top three government posts. The second had been due to be held on Tuesday but was delayed until Sunday.
Regional Kurdish President Massoud Barzani told his parliament in Arbil last week to prepare a referendum on independence, infuriating Maliki.
The relationship hit a new low this week when Maliki accused the Kurds of allowing their capital to be used as a base for the Islamic State and others, including former members of Saddam Hussein's now-banned Baath Party.

In protest against the accusation, the Kurdish political bloc announced they were suspending participation in the Baghdad government on Friday. Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari said the Kurds would continue to attend parliament.
Zebari, who is a Kurd, said Iraq risked falling apart if a new inclusive government is not formed soon as ""the country is now divided literally into three states - ""Kurdish, a black state (ISIL) and Baghdad"".
Unless Iraqi leaders rose to the challenge ""the consequences are very dire: complete fragmentation and failure"" of the country, he said.
Zebari said the suspension decision would be re-evaluated if Maliki apologised for his comments.
After the announcement, Maliki appointed Hussain al-Shahristani, the deputy prime minister, as acting foreign minister, an official in Shahristani's office told Reuters.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shukri met Maliki in Baghdad on Friday to stress Cairo's support for efforts to avoid ""the threat (of) sectarian confrontation and the spread of extremism and terrorism in the name of religion"".
CALL FOR CALM
A spokesman for Kurdish leader Barzani said Maliki, who is seeking a third term in office in the face of political opposition, ""has been afflicted by a true hysteria"".
The increasingly bitter political accusations prompted the country's senior Shi'ite cleric on Friday to urge Iraq's leaders to end their bickering and for fighters to avoid targeting people because off their sect or politics.
""We have repeatedly called for the closing of ranks and for unity and to refrain from radical discourse,"" Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani said in a sermon delivered by an aide.
Sectarian rhetoric from politicians had already incited Iraqis and could destabilise things even further, he said.
Tens of thousands of people responded to a call from Sistani on June 13 to take up arms against the Sunni insurgency.
Fighters should ""not ... transgress against any innocent citizen, no matter their sectarian or ethnic affiliation or whatever their political stance,"" aide Abdul Mehdi Al-Karbala’i told worshippers at the Imam Hussein shrine in the Shi'ite holy city of Karbala.
A senior Iraqi Shi'ite politician has told Reuters that in the first week after Sistani's call, Sunnis were killed by militia that had quickly mobilised. They had now been brought under control.
But there have been continued reports of disappearances and suspected mass killings. On Wednesday, south of Baghdad, Iraqi security forces found 53 corpses, blindfolded and handcuffed, with bullets to the chest and head.
Locals found the corpses of three men on Friday in Injana village near the town of Adaim, north of Baghdad in Diyala province, a police officer told Reuters. The bodies were apparently dumped on the street.
A medical source said the men had been killed recently because their bodies had not decomposed. The area is mainly Sunni. The identity of the dead was not immediately clear, the police officer said.
Baghdad had seen few attacks compared to the violence in other areas hit by the Islamic State's offensive last month, though bombs still hit the capital on a fairly regular basis.
In the predominately Shi'ite district of northern Baghdad, three civilians were killed by a roadside bomb on Friday afternoon, police and medics said.

Libya recently struck a deal with rebels occupying oil ports under terms that would have insurgents give up control over terminals that have been closed for a year.
The deal should add 500,000 barrels per day of crude back into the global energy market, and reports that shipments are on the rise already bruised oil prices on Friday.

858,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 11, 2014 11:15AM ET</span>",Exxon Fights Criminal Fracking Case,"By Maria Gallucci - Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) says that Pennsylvania prosecutors are unfairly picking on the oil behemoth in an effort to stop hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in the gas-rich state.
The company’s subsidiary, XTO Energy Inc, is fighting criminal charges over a 2010 wastewater spill that Pennsylvania authorities say leaked pollution into a tributary of the Susquehanna River. The charges are the first of their kind against a public company drilling in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale, the Wall Street Journal reported.
In a recent motion, XTO accused Attorney General Kathleen Kane of singling the company out as part of “an arbitrary and improper law-enforcement agenda” whose goal might be to “end hydro-fracturing in Pennsylvania altogether.”
Kane fired back this week in a court filing that calls XTO’s claims “nothing more than weak attempts to obfuscate the truth,” the WSJ reported. Carolyn Myers, a spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office, told the WSJ that the state has convicted more than 800 individuals and companies of environmental crimes. “No single industry has been targeted,” she said.
The case involves a 57,000-gallon spill of wastewater that had been used in fracking operations in the north-central part of Pennsylvania four years ago. Fracking requires blasting millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals into dense shale rock to crack open deposits of natural gas, and much of the liquid returns to the surface. XTO had arranged for contractors to store the flowback fluid in large tanks where it could be treated and reused for other fracking jobs.

When a Pennsylvania inspector showed up unannounced at the storage site, however, the state employee found that wastewater was leaking from a partially open valve. The discovery set in motions investigations by Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the WSJ noted.
XTO maintains that the contractor is responsible for the leak and that the energy firm therefore can’t be held liable. In July 2013, XTO settled civil litigations that it violated the federal Clean Water Act and agreed to pay a $100,000 penalty and take measures to prevent wastewater spills.
In September, Pennsylvania prosecutors filed eight criminal misdemeanor charges against XTO. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of $25,000 a day. The company in response called the criminal charges ""unwarranted and legally baseless because neither XTO nor any of its employees intentionally, recklessly or negligently discharged produced water on the site,"" according to a statement.

859,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 11, 2014 10:19AM ET</span>","IEA: Global Oil Demand & Supplies Rising, But Risks Are High","By Maria Gallucci - Global economic growth will drive up the world’s demand for oil next year, while accelerated production in the United States and Canada will help satiate that thirst, the International Energy Agency said Friday.
But the Paris-based energy watchdog cautioned against complacency, warning that geopolitical tensions in oil-producing nations and the unsteady economic recovery still pose acute risks to global oil markets, according to its monthly oil report.
“Supply risks in the Middle East and North Africa, not least in Iraq and Libya, remain extraordinarily high,” the IEA said, Reuters reported. “Oil prices remain historically high and there is no sign of a turning of the tide just yet.”
The IEA forecast that growth in demand for oil will accelerate to 1.4 million barrels a day in 2015, up from 1.2 million barrels a day this year as macroeconomic conditions improve. However, the 2014 demand forecast is down slightly – by about 130,000 barrels a day – from the IEA’s prediction a month ago, due to weaker than expected global mid-year economic data.
""Newly industrialized and emerging market economies are once again forecast to lead the gains,"" the IEA said.
Oil supply from non-Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will increase by around 1.2 million barrels a day next year, continuing the trend of rising North American production and eroding OPEC market share.

OPEC supplies remained flat in June at about 30 million barrels a day, as lower Iraqi production offset production gains in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nigeria and Angola, the agency said.
Iraqi production dropped by 260,000 barrels a day last month to 3.17 million barrels after a Sunni Islamist insurgency unfolded in northwestern Iraq and forced the closure of Iraq’s largest refinery in Baiji while curtailing output from the giant Kirkuk field, the Wall Street Journal noted.
North Sea Brent oil futures surged in mid-June to a nine-month high of $115 a barrel as Sunni insurgents gained ground, but prices later dropped as analysts remained confident that Baghdad’s southern fields – the country’s most productive – would remain untouched by the violence. Improved prospects for Libyan crude exports following an agreement between the government and local militias to reopen export terminals also helped bring prices back down. Brent last traded at $108.20 a barrel and the West Texas Intermediate index at $102 a barrel.

860,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 11, 2014 10:15AM ET</span>",Iran's Oil Exports Lowest Since October: IEA,"By Meagan Clark - Iran’s oil exports fell to their lowest level since October but are still expected to spill over an agreed upon cap by the end of July, according to data released by the International Energy Agency (IEA).
A nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers requires Iran to export only about 1 million barrels of oil a day on average , excluding condensates, ultralight and gassy types of oil, over six months ending July 20. Over the past five months, those exports have averaged around 1.1 million barrels a day, about 100,000 barrels a day over the limit agreed upon Jan. 20.
IEA said Iran’s oil exports including condensates declined 26 percent in June to 1.08 million barrels a day after cuts from China and India, its two largest Asian buyers. The last time Iran exported that low level was in October when the country exported about 715,000 barrels a day, according to IEA.
China reduced its Iranian oil imports by 36 percent over the past two months to 510,000 barrels a day, while India reduced its Iranian oil purchases by 29 percent over the same period to reach 141,000 barrels a day, IEA said.

The nuclear deal in January allowed Iran to keep its oil exports unchanged at 1 million barrels a day and offered limited sanctions relief for Iran to scale down its atomic program. Unless Iran’s oil sales decline this month, its six-month average will pass the cap of 1 million barrels a day.
The U.S. and five other world powers are negotiating what is supposed to be a final resolution by July 20 of a nearly decade-long dispute with Iran over its nuclear program.

Investors sought safety in the dollar and the yen in addition to the precious metals complex but the broad dollar strength failed to prevent a gold rally.
The yellow metal rallied to as high as $1344 on 10 July, its highest since 17 March. It has been on a rising trend since the start of June and the dovish FOMC on 18 June aided the confirmation of the reversal of the downtrend since mid-March.
Shares of Banco Espirito Santo plunged more than 17% on Thursday, reflecting market worries that the Portuguese situation if worsens will trigger risk aversion contagion across Eurozone and even the global markets.
The Portuguese central bank's word of guarantee after Espirito Santo's parent company missed debt paybacks had failed to ease investor concerns.
Technical Outlook
Gold has formed a 'flag pattern' on the daily chart after the June FOMC and the Thursday's jump made the upside break of the 'flag'.
The metal has failed below the $1345 resistance now but it doesn't seem to be a big target as long as the $1315 support stays. Further north, gold has targets at $1355 and $1370 before retesting the 17 March high of $1392.

On the downside, a break below $1315 will weaken the momentum gained after the flag break and will find next support at $1300 ahead of $1275, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the March-June selloff.
At 7:33 GMT, spot gold traded at $1335.92 from the previous close of $1335.32.

866,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 10, 2014 05:45PM ET</span>",Oil By Rail Protests Are Rippling Nationwide ,"By Meagan Clark - One year after a train carrying hazardous oil derailed and exploded in Quebec, killing 47 people, environmental groups and concerned citizens from Sacramento to Fargo to Philadelphia have coordinated protests, marches and rallies in efforts to make rail and oil companies and government agencies report publicly how much volatile crude passes through towns and major cities.
A sudden boom in oil production from the Bakken oil field has fueled a nationwide increase in crude-by-rail transport and associated accidents, prompting a heated debate about whether more regulation of oil and rail companies is needed, and whether rail companies should be legally required to publish the routes and amounts of Bakken oil they transport. The rail industry argues publishing this information would invite terrorism.
The “Oil by Rail Week of Action,” led by a coalition of environmentalists from ForestEthics, 350.org, the Sierra Club, Oil Change International and Lac-Megantic, kicked off Sunday and is wrapping up this weekend. Activists are gathering Thursday night in Chicago and Friday in Birmingham, Detroit, LaCrosse in Wisconsin, Bellingham in Washington and Washington, D.C. 
ForestEthics, a San Francisco-based forestry group leading the protest in the capitol, has produced an oil train “blast zone” map estimating 25 million Americans live in areas vulnerable to an oil train explosion.
On Wednesday afternoon, activists gathered outside an espresso parlor in Fargo, North Dakota to “say no to bomb trains.”
“What right do unregulated, the-North-Dakota-way Bakken oil companies have to send tanker cars of crude, brimming with bubbly explosive gases , purposely left in the oil so they can make more money, through your city, endangering the lives of citizens and first responders?” Fargo activist Ron Schalow asked the IBTimes.
A recent Wall Street Journal investigation found that companies fracking oil from South Texas invested hundreds of millions of dollars to make the crude safer to handle, but nobody installed that equipment in North Dakota’s Bakken oil field.

“If the oil producers in the Bakken had installed the proper equipment, years ago, when they discovered the fizzy nature of the crude, like they should have been required to do,  there would have been no explosions,” Schalow said.
Some states, including Wisconsin, Montana and Washington, have decided the public right to know trumps the rail company’s security concerns, while California, New Jersey, Virginia, Minnesota and Colorado have sided with rail companies. New York and North Dakota are currently weighing whether the restrictions on the information would violate their state public record laws and whether disclosing the information would threaten security more than not publishing it.
Activist from Vancouver, Washington and part of Vancouver Action Network Matt Landon began leading groups to count oil trains and estimate the amounts of crude passing through his community several months ago. The network of “train watchers” has since expanded from Washington to California and Missouri, and they are not backing down any time soon.
“The states that rolled over and signed the nondisclosure clauses pretty much shot themselves in the foot by not standing up to the railroads and providing that information to the citizens,” Landon said. 
More protests are scheduled Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Rodeo, California; Sandpoint, Idaho; Seattle, Washington; Leesburg, Virginia and New Orleans, Louisiana.

880,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 09, 2014 04:00PM ET</span>",Wisconsin Reveals Oil Train Routes For First Time,"By Meagan Clark - The sudden boom in oil production from North Dakota’s Bakken Shale deposits has fueled a nationwide increase in crude-by-rail transport and associated accidents and has prompted heated debate about publicizing rail routes companies use. The debate centers over which is more important, security for the cargos in transit or the public’s right to know.
Wisconsin is the latest state to weigh in on the matter and it chose the public’s right to know when it recently revealed the routes and counts of trains carrying the volatile Bakken oil through the state. In doing so Wisconsin rejected arguments from the rail industry, and formerly the federal government, that this information should only be released to those with a “need to know” and not the general public to prevent terrorist acts.
Last month, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) said that details about volatile oil train shipments are not sensitive security information, ordering railroads that ship more than 1 million barrels of Bakken oil a day to report to state officials the routes and volumes of oil that trains are carrying so that emergency responders can better prepare for accidents.  
State officials in New York and North Dakota are still weighing whether the restrictions on the information would violate their state public record laws and whether disclosing the information would threaten security more than publishing it.
“I think it’s a valid argument, because if you pop some of those off in a heavily populated area, I don’t know how many lives would be lost,” Edward McConnell, mayor of Casselton, North Dakota where an oil train derailed and exploded in December but didn’t injure anyone, told the IBTimes in May. “It could be horrific.”
The Wisconsin documents, obtained first by DeSmogBlog through the state’s Public Records Act, show that of three companies shipping more than 1 million barrels a day of North Dakotan oil through the state, Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) transports the most, along the Mississippi River, the state’s western edge. For the week of June 5 to June 11, the rail company moved 39 oil trains along the river, more than 3 million barrels of oil, the documents show.

State officials from Montana and Washington have also supported the public release of oil-train information, asking railroads to publish the records, while California, New Jersey, Virginia, Minnesota and Colorado have agreed to keep the information confidential over security concerns cited by railroads BNSF, CSX (NYSE:CSX) and Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), according to the Associated Press.
Matt Landon, an activist with the Vancouver Action Network, said Wednesday that the argument that the information is security sensitive just doesn’t make sense.
“People can see those rail cars, the oil trains,” he said. Landon organized a group of train watchers to estimate the amount of volatile oil passing through Vancouver, Washington by counting the trains, clearly designated with placards.
“The fact that you can see it is one thing and also, communities need to be involved in risk assessment, and they need to have situational awareness to be able to do this assessment,” Landon said. “By not having all the information about risks, even if they are just passing through, that’s not complete information.”
Since July 6 marked the one-year anniversary of the worst of the recent accidents, a Quebec oil train disaster that killed 147 people, groups like Landon’s, climate-focused 350.org and Forest Ethics have organized an ""oil train week of action,"" including marches and protests. They are protesting at DOT and Federal Railroad Administration offices across the country Thursday and Friday, with the message, “No exploding oil trains.”

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in August traded at $4.215 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, up 0.26%. The commodity hit a session high of $4.229 and a low of $4.168.
The August contract settled down 0.50% on Tuesday to end at $4.204 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.129 per million British thermal units, Tuesday's low, and resistance at $4.608, the high from June 26.
Gas prices fell in recent session amid weather forecasts calling for below-normal temperatures trekking across portions of the eastern U.S., which should curb demand for air conditioning.
Bargain hunters sent prices back into the positive territory, as typical summertime temperatures should return and hike demand for air conditioning, thus prompting thermal power producers to burn more of the commodity to meet demand.
In its July 9-15 forecast, Natgasweather.com reported that a Canadian weather system will bring showers, thunderstorms and cooler temperatures to the Midwest and New England in the coming days, while hot temperatures will prevail over the southern and western U.S.
""After the Midwest weather system departs, temperatures will again surge into the 80s and 90s over the northern U.S. as the ridge returns this weekend. Texas, the southern Plains, and the Southeast will also see temperatures warm several degrees above normal as upper 90s and 100s become widespread,"" Natgasweather.com reported.
Still, prices didn't surge, as ""the return of northern U.S. heat will be short lived as another cooler-than-normal Canadian weather system will weaken the ridge and bring below-normal temperatures to the U.S. next week,"" Natgasweather.com reported.
Elsewhere, supplies remained in focus.
Thursday’s government report is expected to show that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 92 billion cubic feet in the week ended July 4. The five-year average increase for the period is 72 billion.
Natural gas stockpiles have grown by 100 or more billion cubic feet for eight consecutive weeks, a record streak since 1994.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.929 trillion cubic feet as of last week, 25.7% below their level this time last year and 29.1% below the five-year average.
Elsewhere on the NYMEX, light sweet crude oil futures for delivery in August were down 1.01% at $102.36 a barrel, while heating oil for August delivery were down 0.19% at $2.8682 per gallon.

884,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 09, 2014 10:45AM ET</span>",Q&A: A Swiss Real Estate Developer Hopes To Cash In On North Dakota Oil Town's Growth,"By Meagan Clark - In five years, Williston, North Dakota has morphed from a drowsy farm town into one of the nation’s fastest-growing small cities, attracting people from all over the world seeking jobs and high wages in the Bakken oil field. The influx of workers has more than doubled the area’s population (counting temporary residents) since 2010, causing a housing shortage with rents that rival Manhattan apartments as well as a shortage of retail within an hour’s drive.
Terry Olin plans to change that. As the co-founder of Switzerland-based investment company Stropiq LLP and a North Dakota State University alum, Olin is building a $500 million real estate project in the center of town. Named Williston Crossing, the center will carve out 1 million square feet for retail, entertainment, hotel, office and multifamily buildings. Already, Stropiq is polishing up a 93-unit apartment complex in the city for tenants to rent in August.

IBTimes talked with Olin about Stropiq’s interest in and plans for the Williston area.
So you went to college in North Dakota and then left. When did you first become interested in investing in North Dakota?
I was a stock broker after college and went to Russia as an investment banker. I left Fargo in 1993 and went to Russia thinking nothing interesting would ever happen in North Dakota. Twenty years later, it seems like the most interesting place in the world. When did I first get interested? I don’t even know what the answer is... Friends in the area would send little clippings of news. I’ve always been hearing about it, but when the western part of the state was suddenly inundated with new people, with new work, that’s when I reached a breaking point and had to come back. That was about a year ago. My partner is German…  we first came over to look at the Bakken in early 2013, three to four months after they got jet service in Williston.
Is your Williston project, Williston Crossing, similar to projects you’ve done in Russia?
In Russia, we were doing city-centered projects. They are similar in that we did some landmark things that changed the face of Moscow, but we built vertically. In Williston, we’ll be building over a large area. 
What are some of your better-known projects?
The Geneva House in Moscow, a beautiful landmark building. And Turandot Residences on Arbat Street, an iconic pedestrian street in Moscow. Jade Jagger, a pretty well-known designer, did that one.
The apartments you’re opening this month in Williston aren’t luxury, right?
Oh no, not luxury. It’s a market-commodity building spread over two city blocks. It definitely is on the better end of what’s being produced in town but not luxury. Williston Crossing will be a destination.
Do you have retailers lined up for the Crossing? Can you name any?
We are comfortable with retail anchors to fill the first 430,000 sq. ft. but at this point, we can’t name them.
Is whether or not families are moving to Williston a big consideration? 
Absolutely. There’s a leap of faith involved because many retailers expect to see a mixed customer base. The population growth was at least in the first phase predominantly men. And that’s not the ideal customer base for a retailer. We can’t fill a retail center with male-oriented shops.
But families are moving in. We see it happening. Just imagine that your significant other brought you and you have to drive two hours to a shopping center. The only retail you’ve got is a Wal-Mart, and that’s if you live in Williston. We will be lowering that bar. As projects like this take place, more families will move in. There’s a rec center in town now, it cost north of $73 million, and it’s always full of people.
What’s the timetable for Williston Crossing?
We’re breaking ground next spring. Most of next season, that year will be spent prepping, putting in infrastructure, and the following year we'll be going vertical. Realistically, probably 2017, Williston crossing exists. That will be a pretty brilliant delivery. We’re not building for the population that’s there today, we’re building for the population that’s going to be there three years from now.
Are you considering other investments in the U.S. or is Williston an outlier for the company?
We might do something else in the Bakken. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I’m not sure that’s even putting it quite strong enough. There’s a monumental population shift and the technology has created an industry that wasn’t here before. The Bakken is the center of that. Today, we have the only place in the U.S. and maybe in the developed world where a population of 50,000 is a minimum one hour away from a Target or similar retail. We’re in the center of 150,000 people who have to drive hours to get to retail. There’s so much to be done. We really don’t need to look at other markets. We just hope we get to know our own.

887,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 09, 2014 10:00AM ET</span>",Nebraska Defends Proposed Keystone XL Path,"By Maria Gallucci - Nebraska lawyers defended the Keystone XL pipeline’s proposed path through the state on Tuesday, arguing in Nebraska’s highest court that the route was legally drawn. The state is aiming to reverse an earlier ruling that found the pipeline plans to be unconstitutional.
The outcome of the Nebraska case could have major implications for the Canada-to-Texas oil sands pipeline. The Obama administration, which has the final say on the cross-border conduit, has said it might wait until after the Nebraska Supreme Court’s final ruling this fall to reject or approve a presidential permit. If the court rules against the state, that would send the pipeline’s builder, TransCanada Corporation (TO:TRP), and Nebraska regulators back to the drawing board, further delaying the $5.4 billion project.
At issue is a 2012 state law, L.B. 1161, which gave Gov. Dave Heineman the power to approve a new 300-mile route for the Keystone XL in the state. Three landowners challenged the law, and in February Judge Stephanie Stacy ruled in their favor and invalidated the route. The judge declared TransCanada a “common carrier” like a railroad operator, which is regulated by Nebraska’s Public Service Commission – not the governor’s office – under the state constitution.
In their Tuesday filing, lawyers for Nebraska argued that the Public Service Commission’s authorization to regulate common carriers applies only to transportation-related activities inside Nebraska, and not the interstate Keystone XL, Bloomberg News reported.
The Nebraska landowners made their own case to the state Supreme Court in late June, urging judges to uphold the February ruling that cancels the route.

Earlier this month, TransCanada was dealt a separate setback when a certificate allowing the Canadian company to build its pipeline through South Dakota lapsed. TransCanada now has to reapply for permitting and will likely face fierce opposition from environmental groups and South Dakota landowners.
If built, the 1,179-mile pipeline would carry as much as 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta, Canada to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would connect with an existing 487-mile stretch from Oklahoma to the Texas Gulf Coast.
Nebraska’s Supreme Court has said it would hear the case in September, although the ruling might not come until after Congressional midterm elections in November.

893,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2014 03:22AM ET</span>","Shale boom confounds forecasts as U.S. set to pass Russia, Saudi Arabia","By Catherine Ngai 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Four years into the shale revolution, the U.S. is on track to pass Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's largest producer of crude oil, most analysts agree. When that happens and by how much, though, has produced disparate estimates that depend on uncertain factors ranging from progress in drilling technology to the availability of financing and the price of oil itself. 
Forecasts for U.S. shale oil production vary from an increase of 7.5 million barrels per day by 2020 – almost doubling current domestic output of 8.5 bpd -- to a gain of 1.5 million bpd, or less than half of what Iraq now produces. 
The disparities are a function of the novelty of the shale boom, which has consistently confounded forecasts. In 2012, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that production from eight selected shale oil fields would range from 700,000 bpd of so-called tight oil to 2.8 million bpd by 2035. A year later, those predictions had been surpassed. 
""The key issue is not whether production grows, it's by how much,"" said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup in New York. ""We're only at the beginning of the first inning and this is a nine-inning game."" 
The stakes couldn't be bigger, ranging from the multibillion-dollar investments needed to explore and drill to oil supply issues that go to the heart of U.S. foreign policy. Relations with countries ranging from Iraq and Iran to Russia, Ukraine, Libya and Venezuela are colored to one degree or another by the question of energy. 
The U.S., a nation transformed by the 1973 Arab oil embargo, could become energy independent by 2035, according to bullish forecasts from BP Plc (L:BP) and the International Energy Agency. Coupled with growing output from oil-rich neighbors, the continent has a growing shield from supply shocks. 
""Looking at North America, including Canada and Mexico, we're much more politically stable,"" said Lisa Viscidi, program director of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. 
Still, many drillers have found that healthy forecasts of oil in the ground don't guarantee it can be economically extracted. 
For example, based on the promise of free-flowing oil, Chesapeake Energy's (N:CHK) then-top executive Aubrey McClendon bought up land in Ohio's Utica shale oil field and touted it in 2011 as a $500-billion opportunity. State geologists estimated the shale play could hold as much as 5.5 billion barrels of reserves. 
But last year, after months of drilling, Chesapeake's average output per well per day was just 80 barrels. Competitor BP wrote off $521 million and exited the Utica just two years after leasing 85,000 acres. 
SIX ESTIMATES 
Shale production from the oldest shale patch, the Bakken of Montana and North Dakota, alone may rise to as much as 1.74 million barrels per day in the second half of this decade, according to the highest of six estimates compiled by Reuters. The lowest was 1 million bpd. Even that range belies disagreement over just how fast output will grow -- and when it may peak. (Graphic: http://link.reuters.com/ref32w) 
The EIA, the U.S. agency responsible for energy forecasts, predicts that tight oil output will rise 37 percent from about 3.5 million bpd in 2013 to 4.79 million barrels per day by 2020. The forecast includes the Bakken, Three Forks and Sanish, Eagle Ford, Woodford, Austin Chalk, Spraberry, Niobrara, Avalon/Bone Springs and Monterey. 
""There are other forecasts that are much more optimistic than this one,"" said agency administrator Adam Sieminski, speaking at a conference in New York. ""We're still a little concerned about what the geology looks like for crude oil production. As technology moves, these numbers could grow."" 
The agency has already made some big adjustments to previous estimates. It recently slashed its forecast recoverable reserves for California's Monterey shale to just 600 million barrels, 96 percent less than the total amount of oil in place, citing the difficulty in pumping it out economically. 
IHS Energy's projections are higher, with an estimated 6 million bpd from the Bakken, Eagle Ford and sections of the Permian and Niobrara by the end of 2020. 
At the low end, Energy Aspects Ltd sees production of 3.5 million barrels a day from shale by 2017, a 1.5-million bpd increase from its current output estimate of 2 million bpd. 
""In order to keep production going, you have to maintain your drilling and therefore, capex investments need to be in a continuous cycle,"" said Virendra Chauhan, an oil analyst at Energy Aspects in London. 
McKinsey & Co.'s forecasts illustrate the uncertainty. While the consulting firm uses a reference case that puts tight oil production at the equivalent of 7.1 million bpd by 2020, it said the number could range from 5 million to 9 million bpd. 
In its annual outlook released last month, BP estimated that U.S. tight oil production will increase to 4.5 million bpd in 2035. Exxon Mobil Corp. (N:XOM) says global tight oil production, driven by North America, will rise 11-fold from 2010 to 2040, when it will account for 5 percent of global liquids output. Exxon added that in 2015, North American tight oil supply in 2015 will likely surpass any other OPEC nation's current oil production, with the exception of Saudi Arabia. Iran is the second largest OPEC producer, with about 4.2 million bpd. 
TRICKY FORECASTS 
Production forecasts are inherently problematic, especially years in the future, as they fail to anticipate major new discoveries or abrupt depletion rates. 
Even so, the industry's reliance on multi-year mega-projects such as those off the coast of Angola or in Brazil's sub-salt region -- which progress along generally predictable time frames and produce stable volumes of oil for years afterward -- made it relatively simpler to anticipate new oil coming onto the market. 
The shale oil industry is more complicated. 
For instance, the rapid development of reserves in places like China and Russia could force prices lower, curtailing U.S. drilling. New technology may render development cheaper and more efficient, speeding it up. A change in current domestic policy, particularly an easing of the ban on crude exports, would also shape the forecasts. 
Add to that growth the pipelines connecting Canadian producers to U.S. refiners, including TransCanada Corp's (TO:TRP) 830,000 bpd Keystone XL pipeline, whose approval has been delayed by the U.S. government for more than five years. 
Never mind the vagaries of the credit cycle, which has also become a larger part of the puzzle. Companies face high levels of reinvestment to ensure the same levels of return for drilling oil, meaning companies have to take on additional amounts of debt. 

Consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates that it would require capital spending of $9.58 to $32.97 a barrel to drill in the Eagle Ford basin, depending upon which part of the formation was targeted. 
""We're operating at present in a low interest rate environment, but a risk is what happens if the cost of credit rises,"" Energy Aspects' Chauhan said.

897,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2014 03:03PM ET</span>",New Potash Corp CEO sticks with output strategy as competition builds,"By Rod Nickel
WINNIPEG Manitoba (Reuters) - The new chief executive officer of Potash Corp of Saskatchewan (TO:POT) says he will stick with the Canadian company's focus on supporting the price of potash by matching output of the crop nutrient to demand, rather than maximizing sales volume to fend off competition.
Profits at Potash Corp, the world's second-biggest potash producer, have dropped sharply as potash prices hit a six-year low earlier this year. The breakup nearly a year ago of global potash trading partnership Belarusian Potash Co (BPC) accelerated the slide in price, as it created more competition among producers.
""The principle and the strategy of aligning production with demand has been a very successful one, and so therefore the answer is, there's no reason to change that going forward,"" CEO Jochen Tilk told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. Tilk, an engineer raised in Germany, replaced longtime Potash Corp CEO Bill Doyle on July 1.
Potash Corp sells potash outside North American through its Canpotex partnership with Mosaic Co (N:MOS) and Agrium Inc (TO:AGU).
Tilk said ""your guess is as good as mine"" on whether potash producers Uralkali OAO (MM:URKA) and Belaruskali forge a new BPC partnership, which could boost potash prices.
Tilk also faces the prospect of additional competition in his own backyard in Canada, as Germany's K+S AG (DE:SDFGn) and Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton PLC (L:BLT) build new mines in the province of Saskatchewan.
A former CEO of Inmet Mining, a now taken-over copper, zinc and gold producer, Tilk said it's too soon for him to outline specific plans for Potash Corp. But he said lowering operating costs is a priority, as that would leave the company well-positioned for a conservative demand scenario while maintaining idled capacity that would be available if markets heat up.
Global expansion of potash mining capacity, led by Potash Corp's own decade-long buildout, has exceeded the pace of demand growth, adding further pressure to prices.
In December, the company said it would slash its workforce by 18 percent as it struggled with slumping demand and weak prices. It has since recalled nearly 100 workers due to tight conditions in the granular potash market.
Tilk said that although it has surplus capacity, the company is committed to completing the last piece of its potash expansion next year, with less than $1 billion still to spend on the program. Once it's complete, Potash Corp should have more free cash flow, and Tilk said the company will look at whether to use it to buy back shares, increase its dividend or for other purposes.
Examining internal opportunities to grow is a bigger priority than making acquisitions, he said.
""The No. 1 focus right at this point in time, the priority is, really, look at Potash Corp and the organic opportunities that we have.""
The company owns minority stakes in three other potash companies: Israel Chemicals Ltd (TA:ICL), Chile's SQM (SN:SQMa) and Arab Potash Co PLC (AM:APOT). Former CEO Doyle abandoned efforts to take over ICL last year because of strong opposition in Israel.
Those equity stakes will have to prove they can create value for shareholders, Tilk said.

""If that's indeed the case, they're great investments. If it turns out they don't create that value, at least not in the setting they are, then the company has to look at that.""
Doyle will stay on as a senior adviser to Tilk through June 2015.

900,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2014 12:18PM ET</span>",Libya's El Sharara oilfield restart another breakthrough for Tripoli,"By Feras Bosalum and Ulf Laessing
TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya's oil sector took another big step back to normality with the restarting of an oilfield that could double its current meager crude output, a week after blockades ended at major ports.
The 340,000 barrels per day El Sharara oilfield has resumed operations after protesters ended a four month strike, state-run National Oil Corp (NOC) said on Tuesday,
The field is in Libya's remote southwest and its connecting pipelines have been blocked several times since the autumn by protesters making financial and political demands, part of nationwide blockades of fields and oil ports.
Last week, eastern rebels handed over to the government the Ras Lanuf and Es Sider oil ports, ending an almost year-long occupation. Both terminals had accounted for 500,000 bpd.
Experts say, however, it will take time to restart production as fields and pipelines will require maintenance after standing idle so long.
Still, the restart of El Sharara and the two eastern ports give hope to the weak central government to restore vital oil production and revenue to help fight a worsening budget crisis.
Output was 327,000 bpd on Tuesday, NOC said, a fraction of the 1.4 million barrels a day the OPEC member used to pump last summer when the protests started.
""El Sharara will return to production after the pipelines were opened,"" said NOC spokesman Mohamed El Harari, adding that pumping had started at 1400 local time.
In May, NOC's production head Anwar Aghil said the field might take months to reach full output as at least 20 pumps inside wells need to be replaced. Operator Akakus, run by NOC and Spain's Repsol, might need up to six month to fix the pumps.
On Sunday, NOC lifted force majeure from the Ras Lanuf and Es Sider ports after rebels agreed to end a blockade. The waiver of contractual obligations was imposed last summer.
Disputes over Libya's oil resources have been among the many triggers for conflict between rival brigades of former rebels and allied political factions since civil war ended four decades of Muammar Gaddafi one-man rule in 2011.
The government and parliament in Tripoli are too weak to control heavily-armed militias which helped topple Gaddafi but now defy state authority and carve out small fiefdoms in the vast desert country.
Eastern port rebel leader Ibrahim Jathran had agreed in April to reopen two smaller eastern ports, Zueitina and Hariga, and then gradually free up Es Sider and Ras Lanuf.
After that deal, shipments from Zueitina were delayed because of damage from the blockade, while Hariga has seen only a few tanker loadings, hampered by a separate protest temporarily closing the port again.

Saudi Arabia has one-fifth of the world’s natural gas reserves, according to U.S. government data, but production has remained limited. Kidan, for example, is rich in sour gas and near a giant oilfield, but the high levels of potentially deadly hydrogen sulphide in sour gas make it more difficult to produce than conventional gas reserves.

912,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2014 02:14AM ET</span>",Total CEO keeps costly drilling strategy to end: 2014,"By Michel Rose 
PARIS (Reuters) - The chief executive of French oil major Total (PA:TOTF) is giving himself until the end of the year to strike oil at a big new field somewhere in the world before considering whether to change direction and cut the exploration budget. 
The Paris-based oil major, which launched a drilling strategy that it termed ""high-risk, high-reward"" two years ago, has had disappointing explorations results so far. 
""It's not a success in terms of results for the moment,"" Christophe de Margerie told Reuters in an interview. ""But exploration takes more than two years to yield results."" 
De Margerie was asked whether the group could drop the expensive strategy, which had been a shift from Total's previous, more cautious approach. ""Not before the end of the year; at the end of the year we'll see if we didn't get enough,"" he said. 
""If we have to change, we'll do it, but there won't be a revolution where we stop everything and start over,"" he said, adding that the company had yet to drill so far in countries such as Angola, South Africa and Bulgaria. 
In any event, he expected Total's exploration budget to drop next year from the $2.9 billion set for this year, which represented an increase of about 12 percent compared with 2012. 
Total, like other big oil majors, has been under pressure from shareholders to cut costs and raise dividends. France's biggest company by market value and the Western world's No 4 oil and gas firm said last year it would engage in what De Margerie called a ""soft-landing"" in capital investments. 
COFFIN AND CANDLES 
De Margerie also played down the importance of reaching the production capacity target he set for 2017: 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
""It's clear that if we continue to have problems like today in Nigeria, Venezuela, Libya and elsewhere, countries with problems beyond our control, then we can't reach the 3 million,"" he said. 
Total has cut its staff in Libya to the bare minimum due to increasing violence in the North African country, for example, while security issues and oil theft have hurt its output in Nigeria. 
De Margerie said he should be judged based on new projects launched under his watch such as a string of African fields including Angola's CLOV and Nigeria's Egina and Ofon Phase 2 as well as Laggan-Tormore off the coast of Scotland, not on existing production areas affected by political tensions. 
""If the old fields are stopped for reasons like embargos, etc, then we won't reach the 3 million. I know we'll be slammed, but it's ok,"" he said. 
""What I'm interested in is CLOV, Egina - projects where we've ploughed new investments. If they don't deliver, that would be a failure."" 
Asked whether missing the objective could harm the group's credibility, de Margerie said being ambitious was necessary to put pressure on his teams and that he was ready to take on the critics. 
""I have no regrets at all. But if I'm at 2.6 million by June 30, 2017, start preparing the coffin and the candles,"" he joked. 
NO SIZE PROBLEM 
Embarking on acquisitions also is not a good way to make up for a potential miss in its production target, he said. 
""Mergers don't automatically work out well; it's not an easy exercise. I'm not under the impression that Total has a size problem."" 
He said the best way to reorganise its asset portfolio would be through joint-ventures, especially in the upstream business. 
He was also focussed on costs after having cut $4 billion from the Kaombo project launched last April in Angola and ""several billions"" from the Yamal LNG project in Siberia, which kicked off last December. 

De Margerie, who will turn 63 this year and has held the CEO position since 2007, also confirmed that Total would seek a successor from within the company rather than an outsider. 
He said he would eventually suggest a name to the board, which would then approve it or not, but that he had no favourite candidate at the moment.

937,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 03, 2014 01:19PM ET</span>","Gasoline Costs Highest In 6 Years, But There's No Slowing Road Trips","By Meagan Clark - Fourth of July gasoline prices will be the highest in six years, but that’s not keeping drivers off the road.
Despite paying 15 to 20 cents more per gallon than expected, 34.8 million Americans will drive 50 miles or more over the holiday weekend, the highest number since the financial crisis began in 2007 and 5 million more than on Memorial Day, automobile club AAA predicts. AAA defines the holiday travel period as July 2 to July 6.

“With school out for summer, the Fourth of July holiday is typically the busiest summer travel holiday,” AAA’s chief operating officer, Marshall Doney, said in a statement. “Steady improvement in the economy has spurred increased consumer confidence and spending.”
U.S. employers added more jobs than expected in June, marking the fifth consecutive month with significant job gains, the first time that's occurred since January 2000. However, wages have only increased 2 percent over the past year. The recent rise in consumer spending is due to Americans’ willingness to “take on credit card debt, not an increase in income,” according to AAA’s Independence Day Travel Forecast.
The national average gas price on Thursday was $3.67, 19 cents higher than this time last year and $1.05 higher than 2009. Gas prices have largely fallen since 2008. On July 4, 2008, the national average gas price hit $4.10.
Gas prices usually decline between Memorial Day and Fourth of July, but this year prices rose because the conflict in Iraq pushed up crude oil prices. In recent days, oil prices have fallen slightly, but the change won’t trickle into gas prices for a few weeks. By Labor Day, gas prices will likely fall by 7 to 12 cents per gallon, according to GasBuddy.com oil analyst Tom Kloza.
Crude oil prices account for 65 percent of the gasoline price, according to federal energy data. Refining the oil, which requires purchasing U.S. and foreign oil, accounts for 13 percent of the gas price, transport and marketing accounts for 11 percent, and taxes, which vary state-by-state, account for about 12 percent of the gas price.
Drivers in California, Washington, Hawaii and Alaska are paying more than $4 per gallon, while drivers in South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas are paying less than $3.50 per gallon. Strict regulations on gasoline drive up prices in western states, while states with large refining capacity and with low populations demanding gasoline enjoy lower prices. And gas prices would be even higher if not for an expanding U.S. oil and refinery industry.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas for delivery in August fell to a session low of $4.331 per million British thermal units, the weakest level since May 15, before turning higher to last trade at $4.397 during U.S. morning hours, up 0.91%, or 4.0 cents. Futures traded at $4.341 prior to the release of the supply data.
Natural gas futures ended Wednesday’s session down 2.2%, or 9.8 cents, to settle at $4.357 after updated weather-forecasting models pointed to cooler summer weather, which was likely to dampen demand for the cooling fuel.
Futures were likely to find support at $4.289 per million British thermal units, the low from May 15 and resistance at $4.459, the high from July 2.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended June 27 rose by 100 billion cubic feet, in line with expectations.
The five-year average change for the week is an increase of 68 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.929 trillion cubic feet. Stocks were 666 billion cubic feet less than last year at this time and 790 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 2.719 trillion cubic feet for this time of year.
Natural gas stockpiles have grown by 100 or more billion cubic feet for eight consecutive weeks, a record streak since 1994.
Producers would need to add approximately 2.6 trillion cubic feet to storage by November 1 to meet typical winter demand, analysts said.
Elsewhere on the Nymex, crude oil for delivery in August shed 0.52%, or 55 cents, to trade at $103.94 a barrel, while heating oil for August delivery dipped 0.26% to trade at $2.938 per gallon.

Rebel leaders agreed to hand over the Es Sider and Ras Lanuf export terminals on Wednesday after reaching a deal with the government. The exchange puts to rest a years-long oil export blockade that crippled Libya’s petroleum industry and reduced exports to just 320,000 barrels a day.
Libya’s National Oil Co. said it may formally lift a ban on exports from the eastern oil terminals as early as later Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported. The restarting of the two facilities, which have a combined capacity of 560,000 barrels a day, would quintuple the country’s current crude-export capacity.
""I officially declare this is the end of the oil crisis,"" Libya’s acting Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni said, Reuters reported.              
The prospect of higher Libyan output sent global oil prices falling on Wednesday. The U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate for August declined by 86 cents, or 0.8 percent to close at $104.91 a barrel on the New York Mercantile exchange. London’s Brent North Sea crude index for delivery in August fell by $1.05, or 0.9 percent to $111.24 a barrel, its lowest price since June 11, Agence France-Presse reported.

Libya exports totaled 1.5 million barrels in 2010 but began to plummet three years ago amid the widespread civil war that culminated in Muammar Qaddafi’s ouster and subsequent killing. In July 2013, the rebels seized the Es Sider and Ras Lanuf facilities as part of a broader campaign to establish self-rule in the eastern region of Libya. The self-declared Executive Order of Barqa initially demanded an oil-revenue-sharing agreement to make up for the area’s neglect under Qaddafi’s 42-year regime, Bloomberg News reported.
The Libyan government has agreed to “in the next few days” grant amnesty to and pay the salaries of Petroleum Facilities Guard members who defected to the Barqa group during the year-long blockade, a rebel spokesman told Bloomberg.

Libyan rebels agreed to open two of its ports for oil exports on Wednesday. The two terminals have a capacity to export up to 560,000 barrels of oil a day.
Meanwhile, indications that Iraqi oil exports from the southern part of the country remained insulated from the sectarian violence that has swept the north in recent weeks also weighed.
Futures rallied to nine-month highs amid fears that an insurgency in northern Iraq would spread to the oil-rich south and disrupt the nation's oil production.
Iraq produced approximately 3 million barrels a day of oil last month, making it OPEC’s second-biggest oil producer behind Saudi Arabia.

943,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2014 06:30AM ET</span>",Global food prices fall as cereal supply outlook improves: U.N.,"ROME (Reuters) - The outlook for world supplies of cereals and vegetable oils improved in June, contributing to the third straight monthly drop in global food prices, the United Nations' food agency said on Thursday.
The Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAO) price index, which measures monthly price changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy, meat and sugar, averaged 206.0 points in June, down 3.8 points or 1.8 percent from May.
The figure was almost 2.8 percent below June 2013 and the lowest since January, as cereal prices fell on better crop prospects and reduced concern over disrupted shipments from Ukraine.
The FAO's cereal price index averaged 196.2 points in June, down 10.9 points or 5.2 percent from a revised 207.0 points in May, mainly due to falls of almost 7 percent in wheat and maize.
The U.N. agency raised its forecast for global cereal production for 2014 by 21.5 million tonnes, compared with a previous forecast given in May, to 2.478 billion tonnes.
The forecast was boosted by a more favorable production outlook for maize, almost 1 percent higher than it reported in May but still 1.4 percent down from 2013.
The FAO revised its estimate for world cereal stocks at the close of the crop season ending in 2015 to 604 million tonnes, up 28 million tonnes from the previous estimate. This would represent a 5.3 percent jump from the 2013-2014 season and the highest level for more than a decade.

Vegetable oil prices fell 2.4 percent in June, year-on-year, as prices of palm oil, the most widely traded edible oil, dropped to a nine-month low and expectations for a record world soybean crop dragged soy oil prices to a four-year trough.
FAO said it expected global wheat output this year to be 702.7 million tonnes, slightly higher than the forecast it gave in May, but 1.8 percent lower than last year's record harvest.

950,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 02, 2014 04:00PM ET</span>",Keystone XL Certificate Expires In South Dakota,"By Maria Gallucci - The long and bitterly contested attempt to build the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico just received another setback.
A certificate allowing TransCanada Corporation (TO:TRP) to construct the pipeline through South Dakota lapsed over the weekend, meaning the company will have to reapply for permitting. The process is sure to draw fierce opposition from environmental groups that argue the project will endanger water supplies and exacerbate global warming, as well as landowners who object to construction on their property.
South Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission approved the project on June 29, 2010, by issuing a certificate that placed certain conditions on the project. Four years later, TransCanada will have to prove that it can still meet those conditions.
An evidentiary hearing will be held once TransCanada applies to recertify, Gary Hanson, chairman of the South Dakota utility regulator, told the Financial Post. “I would anticipate that there will be challenges … by a number of organizations and possibly citizens.”

TransCanada spokesman Davis Sheremeta told the publication in an email that the company is “waiting to determine exactly what will be required by the South Dakota PUC” before it reapplies for certification. “We are pulling everything together and will submit our recertification in due course.”
The Keystone XL pipeline would carry tar sands crude oil over 1,700 miles, starting in Canada’s Alberta province and ending at refineries in Texas. TransCanada completed the pipeline’s southern leg, a 487-mile stretch from Cushing, Oklahoma, to Nederland, Texas, earlier this year, and oil is already flowing from the $2.3 billion segment.

But the Alberta-to-Nebraska component remains mired in legal and permitting challenges. Since the northern leg crosses an international border, the U.S. State Department must approve it, although President Barack Obama is expected to make the final call. The Obama administration says further review is still needed to determine the full scope of the pipeline’s environmental and economic impacts. And in April, it said it would delay a decision on the Keystone XL until a legal fight is resolved in Nebraska.
A state district court in February invalidated the pipeline’s route through Nebraska, striking down a state law that would have let TransCanada and Gov. Dave Heineman avoid regulators in locating a 300-mile segment in Nebraska. The state attorney general is appealing the judge’s ruling.

Gold and the greenback tend to trade inversely with one another.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for August delivery traded at 1,329.70 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, up 0.23%, up from a session low of $1,322.20 and off a high of $1,332.70.

Futures were likely to find support at $1,311.00 a troy ounce, Monday's low, and resistance at $1,334.90, Tuesday's high.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said earlier that an appetite for risk is on the rise, though the country's top economist sees no need to immediately alter today's accommodative U.S. monetary policy.
Corporate bond spreads have been falling as have volatility indicators such as the VIX, which may indicate that investors are taking on risks despite the possibility of facing losses for which they might not be fully prepared, Yellen said in a speech at the International Monetary Fund.
Still, policy will remain accommodative, as Fed policies aren't a panacea to deal with financial risks such as asset bubbles.
Her words sent gold prices rising, as loose monetary policy bolsters the precious metal's appeal as a safe-haven hedge.
Still, better-than-expected jobs numbers capped gains by reminding investors that the Fed will tighten policy one day, likely within a year after it winds down its monthly bond-buying stimulus program.

Iraq, the second-largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), produced a little over 3 million barrels a day in April, according to OPEC’s May 2014 oil market report.
North Dakota’s oil production topped 1 million barrels a day in the same month for the first time in history, nearly tripling its production over three-years, EIA said in its monthly petroleum supply report. The two oil-producing states accounted for nearly half of the country’s total crude production in April, 8.4 million barrels a day.
While the rest of the country’s oil production grew at only 2 percent annually over the last three years, production volumes in Texas grew an average 28 percent and in North Dakota, 37 percent. The third-largest source of oil in the U.S. is the Gulf of Mexico, but production there declined from 27 percent to 17 percent of the country’s total over the same period.

The gains in Texas came from unconventional tight oil and shale plays in the Eagle Ford, Western Gulf Basin and Permian Basin, regions where the controversial drilling method hydraulic fracturing, or fracking has developed quickly.

North Dakota’s production growth comes from its Bakken shale, also a tight oil reservoir, which has caused a boom in crude-by-rail transport that has led to several deadly accidents.

Loose monetary policies tend to weaken the dollar, thus bolstering gold's appeal as a hedge.
Speaking Monday, San Francisco Fed President John Williams underlined this view, saying the bank will probably need to hold interest rates near zero for at least another year to ensure recovery remains on track.

968,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 01, 2014 01:45PM ET</span>",New York Ruling Allowing Towns To Ban Fracking Could Ripple Across US,"By Meagan Clark - New York state’s highest court ruled Monday that towns and cities can ban fracking, a decision closely watched by the energy industry as local governments across the U.S. are considering using zoning laws to stop oil and gas drilling.
The ruling may discourage oil and gas companies from investing in New York and encourage other states’ local governments to push for fracking bans.
“This sends a really strong and clear message to the gas companies who have tried to buy their way into the state that these community concerns have to be addressed,” Katherine Nadeau, policy director for Environmental Advocates of New York, an anti-fracking group, told Bloomberg. “This will empower more communities nationwide.”
 The ruling ""just means we as an industry need to work harder to educate communities about the truth and the benefits of this fracking boom that is driving our economic recovery and bringing America energy security,” Chris Faulkner, CEO of Breitling Energy Corporation, said. 
Pennsylvania, which shares the underground Marcellus Shale natural gas resources with New York, West Virginia and Ohio, passed a similar ruling last year after trying to prohibit local governments from banning fracking but losing in court.
In the past 11 years, fracking technology has powered a boom in gas extraction from the Marcellus Shale. Though fracking has been around for many decades, the drilling practice is newer to the region than other areas of the country like the Barnett Shale of Texas, where modern fracking technologies were developed. In 2007, the shale play had only 27 wells, but by 2010, that number rose to 1,386, according to Geology.com.
Natural gas production from the Marcellus is expected to grow 36 percent by 2035 as drilling technologies continue improving,  according to ICF International in its latest quarterly report.
Three cities in West Virginia tried to ban fracking within their jurisdictions in 2011, but state courts quickly ruled that the state’s authority to regulate drilling and fracking trumps local authorities.
Another city tried to ban fracking within its city limits in Ohio. Beck Energy Corp. began drilling on private properties in Munroe Falls in 2011 with a permit from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, so the city filed a lawsuit, joined by another half-dozen communities.
Ohio’s legislature gave the state’s natural resources department sole authority in 2004 to regulate permitting, location and spacing oil and gas wells, but that law could be overturned soon. The case has reached Ohio’s Supreme Court, whose decision (to be announced soon at an unspecified date) will determine what authority if any Ohio cities have over oil and gas drilling and whether they can ban fracking.
Local fracking bans could extend beyond the Marcellus to California and Texas as well.

Cities and counties in California already have legal authority to temporarily or permanently ban oil and gas development, including bans on fracking, within their borders. A bill that would have halted fracking statewide while the state studies its impacts on health and groundwater during a severe drought barely failed in the California Senate in late May, but regional bans are popping up and passing across the state, including in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and Santa Cruz.
In North Texas, fracking opponents in Denton have petitioned the City Council to pass a law that would make the city the first in Texas to ban fracking. If the Council doesn’t pass the ban, voters may pass it in November.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.375 per million British thermal units, Friday's low, and resistance at $4.608, Thursday's high.
Natural gas prices rose earlier as seasonably warm summer weather settled in over much of the U.S., though a tropical system could shoot up alongside the eastern seaboard and cool off the region with showers and cloudy weather.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
High pressure over the U.S. will bring very warm to hot temperatures over the western and southern U.S. in the coming week, with warm temperatures also settling in over the Ohio Valley and Northeast, Natgasweather.com reported in its July 1-7 weather forecast summary.
A weather system bringing rain and cooler air will push into the central and eventually eastern U.S., though high pressure to the west will heat up California and drive demand for cooling.
Changes could be in store, however.
""Tropical convection off the Florida coast may develop into a tropical storm and track north along the Atlantic coast with showers and thunderstorms this weekend,"" Natgasweather.com report.
The National Hurricane Center upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Arthur earlier Tuesday.
Still, natural gas prices didn't plummet, as summertime temperatures will return soon.
""After the northern U.S. weather system weakens, temperatures will again surge into the 80s and 90s over the Midwest and Northeast by early next week,"" Natgasweather.com reported.
Elsewhere, investors braced for Thursday's weekly supply report.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its last weekly report on Thursday that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended June 20 rose by 110 billion cubic feet, above forecasts for an increase of 102 billion cubic feet.
The five-year average build for the week is 81 billion.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.829 trillion cubic feet. Stocks were 690 billion cubic feet less than last year at this time and 822 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 2.651 trillion cubic feet for this time of year.
Natural gas stockpiles have grown by more than 100 billion cubic feet for seven consecutive weeks, a record streak since 1994.
Producers would need to add approximately 2.6 trillion cubic feet to storage by November 1 to meet typical winter demand, according to analysts.

972,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 01, 2014 09:45AM ET</span>","New York Towns Can Ban Fracking, But Only Some Will","By Meagan Clark - New York state’s highest court ruled Monday that towns can use land use ordinances to ban hydraulic fracturing, the method of natural gas extraction also called fracking, ending a three-year battle over whether the state or local governments can control where and if shale gas development can occur.
For six years, the state had a moratorium on fracking and has been studying the potential health effects, the New York Times reported. Concerned that the state may eventually allow fracking, more than 170 communities have banned fracking or passed moratoriums.
However, those communities are some of the least attractive for shale gas extraction, according to Shale Gas Review. In southern communities sitting atop the Marcellus Shale, a booming gas field, many local governments support fracking. XTO Energy, a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil, has paid farmers across the Pennsylvania border $110 million to test drill on their land.
The case before the court concerned two towns, Dryden and Middlefield, which amended zoning laws to ban fracking in 2011, citing residents’ health, environment and the community’s character as reasons. Before the ban, an energy company in Dryden had bought oil and gas leases there and a dairy farm in Middlefield had leased land to a gas drilling company, so the two parties filed legal complaints arguing that state oil and gas law preempted the towns’ new zoning laws.

The State Court of Appeals ruled 5-2 rejecting that argument and finding that the towns do have the authority to ban fracking through land use regulations. The decision supports a plan proposed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in summer 2012 that began issuing permits to areas where communities and industry want to develop natural gas resources.
The future of fracking in New York rests on whether the state legislature clarifies the state’s role in gas drilling operations, or if it bans fracking altogether, though fracking bans have so far failed in the state Senate. Cuomo could also decide at any time to withdraw the fracking study but is not likely to until after election day Nov. 4 when he is expected to run for a second term.

About $5.6 billion in planned energy subsidies were cut out of next fiscal year’s budget, Finance Minister Hany Kadry Dimian told the press at a news conference, neglecting to mention details about how the savings would be accomplished. He also said there is no timeline for petroleum price increases or other reforms.
Egypt’s president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi had rejected the budget’s first draft, which he said was too extravagant, and approved a tighter budget on Sunday that aims to narrow the deficit to 10 percent of gross domestic product in the coming fiscal year and goes into effect Tuesday, according to Daily News Egypt. The budget deficit was about 14 percent in the fiscal year ending June 2013.
A spokesman for the government said the energy savings would come through redistribution and restructuring, Reuters reported.

Oil producers in Egypt have been exporting their products at international prices, but gas suppliers have been paid lower, domestic prices for selling to the Egyptian market. Several foreign gas companies have been waiting for the gas price to increase in Egypt to make further exploration and drilling there profitable.
“The gas price simply has to increase” and that will “unlock exploration” because some fields are not economic to drill at the current tariff, David Thomas, chief operating officer at Petroceltic, told Bloomberg. “The country is full of opportunity. My question is, when the race will start?”

988,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 30, 2014 09:00AM ET</span>",Shale Oil: Scotland May Have Up To 6 Billion Barrels And That Could Change Debate On Independence,"By Meagan Clark - Scotland’s most densely populated areas may have billions of barrels of shale oil underground, according to a report released Monday by the British Geological Survey. The discovery comes as Scotland debates independence before a referendum in September.
The Midland Valley of Scotland between Glasgow and Edinburgh may contain 6 billion barrels of oil, though only part of it would be practical to extract, the survey found. The oil could expand the U.K.’s 3 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, held mostly offshore Scotland in the North Sea.
The Scottish government says the North Sea fields will be enough to pump the economy of an independent Scotland, but critics say the reserves are declining and would leave the country vulnerable.
“This report will give reassurance to investors who wish to explore for oil and gas onshore in Scotland,” Ken Cronin, CEO of U.K. industry lobby the Onshore Operators Group, said in a statement.
Scotland’s 80 trillion cubic meters of shale gas resources (about 2,800 trillion cubic feet) could cover U.K. gas needs for more than three decades, the report shows, but it’s only 6 percent of Britain’s potential. Most of the gas resources are across northern England.

U.K. Energy Minister Michael Fallon spoke of the discovery as strengthening the U.K. as a whole.
“Only the broad shoulders of the United Kingdom can attract investment in new energy sources and maintain the U.K.'s position as one of the world's great energy hubs – generating energy and generating jobs,” he said in a statement.
None of Britain’s shale gas drillers have used hydraulic fracturing or fracking, the process used widely in the U.S. where water, sand and chemicals are injected into shale to break apart the rock and release oil and gas. Critics of shale gas say it damages the environment because of the chemicals used in extraction. In six years, Britain’s oil and gas industry will bid for permits in the shale areas for the first time.

991,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2014 06:01AM ET</span>","Following long ban, U.S. could dominate global light oil supply","By Edward McAllister 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - After decades of isolation, the United States is set to become a major player in the global trade of ultra light oil as recent government export approvals attract interest across the world. 
Following rulings disclosed this week, U.S. companies can now export the light, gaseous petroleum known as condensate after a forty-year ban, giving them access to needy markets in Latin America and Asia and potentially threatening the dominance of other established producers in the Middle East and Africa. 
Companies are ready to ship condensate from some of the United States' massive oil and gas fields within weeks. By the end of the year, as much as 300,000 barrels could be exported each day, according to analysts at Citi in New York, a timely event as Asian countries increase capacity to import and exporters elsewhere face headwinds. 
""It could have an enormous impact,"" said Al Troner a condensate expert and president of Asia Pacific Energy Consulting. ""It could happen within the next two weeks."" 
Up to one million barrels of condensate is produced each day in the United States, all of which can be exported after some basic refining to reduce volatility, known as stabilizing, according to the U.S. ruling. That is double the amount exported by Qatar, the world's leading condensate producer. 
The amount exported and where it goes depends on the kind of condensate that is produced and whether it is the right grade to feed petrochemical plants in China or Japan or to dilute heavy crude produced in Latin America. 
Enterprise Products Partners and Pioneer Natural Resources this week both said that they have received private go-ahead from the Commerce Department to export condensate. Enterprise said it is ready to start exporting anytime. 
Exports of condensate, a major feedstock for the petrochemical industry, will provide the first outlet for the vast amounts of oil and gas now produced in the United States. It will also give an inkling of the impact that a U.S. drilling boom could finally have abroad if other types of crude are approved for export. 
Buyers are already interested, not just in nearby Latin America - the closest destination for U.S. condensate - but further afield in India and east Asia, traders and sources said. 
In Latin America, companies could use condensate as a substitute for naphtha to lighten local heavy crude. Venezuela's state-run oil producer PDVSA and firms operating in Colombia including Ecopetrol and Pacific Rubiales, some of which already buy from West Africa, are ""lined up waiting to buy light crudes and condensates if the price is right"" said one trader working in crude purchases, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
In India, Essar Oil's chief executive L K Gupta said ""we will look at buying condensate from the United States if the pricing is right. We do buy condensate and if a new source is opening up that is good for us"". 
It is unclear what the cost of U.S. condensates would be, given that the price depends on the density and where it is produced. Some condensate from the Eagle Ford play in Texas does appear to be cheaper than some grades currently exported from Australia's North West Shelf, according to traders and Reuters data. 
""According to an internal analysis at our company, the U.S. condensate based upon (U.S.) WTI pricing appears to have cost competitiveness compared with those from the Middle East based upon Dubai crude,"" said one Seoul-based refining source, adding that competitive U.S. exports could help bring down global prices. 
LENGTH TO TIGHTNESS 
The Middle East dominates supply of condensate. Qatar and Iran export 760,000 barrels per day combined, about half daily global supply, according to a presentation in November by analysts at Facts Global Energy. Australia and Africa make up most of the rest. 
The majority of supply heads to Asia, where importers like China, Japan and South Korea have build processing plants known as splitters that can turn condensate into naphtha and other oil-related products. In Asia Pacific, splitters can process up to 900,000 barrels per day of condensate, according to Facts. 
But as demand rises, production from existing exporters is faltering. In Australia, where condensate is a by-product of liquefied natural gas production, exports are already declining in part because new gas produced is ""drier"" than before. In Qatar, domestic demand is set to slow exports. Iranian output has been hampered by sanctions. 
""The condensate market East may move from length to tightness,"" the Facts report said. 
It remains to be seen if the United States can fill the gap, and it is expected to take time to determine whether U.S. condensate is compatible with Asian importers' needs. Some said that no moves have been made to export condensate to Asia from the United States. Sampling could take months, others said. 

But with demand on the rise, the United States could offer unexpected respite. 
""What we hope is this (U.S.) export will help pull down prices of shipments from the Middle East as overall supplies in the global market increase,"" the Seoul-based refinery source said.

1010,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 26, 2014 01:45PM ET</span>",Energy Analysts Split Over Significance Of New US Oil Exports,"By Meagan Clark - Two companies have obtained permission to sell ultralight oil overseas as soon as August outside of a decades-long ban on U.S. crude exports, and energy analysts couldn't disagree more over the significance of the new exports.
After the news broke Tuesday, oil refiner stocks fell 6 to 10 percent, and oil producer stocks rose 2 to 3 percent, but “investors jumped the gun,” according to Fadel Gheit, an oil and gas analyst for Oppenheimer.
“The market exaggerated the impact,” he said Thursday. “It’s much ado about nothing.”
Andrew Weissman, an energy market analyst and attorney at Haynes and Boone, called the ruling “very, very significant,” saying the stock market reacted fairly strongly and appropriately.
In a private ruling earlier this year, the Obama administration permitted Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) and Enterprise Products Partners LP (NYSE:EPD) to ship a variety of ultralight oil known as condensate to foreign buyers, the Wall Street Journal first reported Tuesday.
Condensate can flow as a frothy liquid at normal temperatures and a gas underground, causing disagreement within the industry on its definition. Its flammable and volatile properties make it difficult to transport, highlighted by recent fiery train derailments.
The ban on oil exports applies only to unprocessed crude, not gasoline, diesel and other petroleum products, but the permits toe the limits of the ban because the condensate to be exported needs only minimal processing. Permits are not needed to export petroleum products, but the private ruling gives the companies legal protection.

“It does not constitute a loosening of the ban on crude oil exports,” Benjamin Salisbury, senior energy policy analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co, told clients in a research note Tuesday. “Processing oil, including condensate, through a distillation tower has been the defining feature of a product allowable for export for years under Department of Commerce rules.”
However, the move could calm oil producers’ fears of an oversupply of condensate in the U.S. that would cause oil prices to drop, he added.
“From a legal standpoint, from what’s been disclosed, the ruling really opens the door to anyone in the U.S. who wants to export condensate and has the equipment to process it,” Weissman said. He believes that by the end of the year, the industry may export as much as 1 million barrels a day of condensate.
Gheit said he talked to 15 oil companies this week, and “not one said they were interested in exporting condensate.”
“What [condensate] they have, they have already found a home for,” he said, adding that many refineries are opting not to invest in equipment to process the ultralight oil because they think the shale boom won’t last. Some refineries have, however, been investing in what are called condensate splitters to help them process the ultralight crude, and they will lose the benefit of cheaper U.S. crude as more is shipped overseas. 
Whether or not oil and gas companies choose to export condensate will have ""some major repercussions for natural gas prices,"" Weissman said. 
Already, drillers tend to opt for liquids over gas because producing oil is often more profitable with relatively low natural gas prices, and the ability to export condensate could encourage companies to choose oil over gas until natural gas prices rise.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.453 per million British thermal units, Tuesday's low, and resistance at $4.784, the high from June 18.
Natural gas prices fell in recent sessions on expectations for rainy weather and cooler mercury readings to prompt households to throttle back on their air conditioning.
Prices rose on Wednesday, as weather services called for warm air to return.
""A weather system stalling over the northern Plains will attempt to track across the Midwest and Northeast late next week with a few degrees of cooling. But the latest data comes in with what we have been expecting with high pressure again flexing its muscles and pushing right back into the northern U.S. with even hotter temperatures to end the first week of July,"" Natgasweather.com reported in its midday update for Wednesday.
""This pattern also has the potential to hold for quite some time. What this means is temperatures will warm into the upper 80s and 90s over much of the northern U.S. over the coming weeks.""
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Meanwhile, market players kept an eye out for Thursday's weekly supply report.
Early injection estimates range from 93 billion cubic feet to 101 billion cubic feet. The five-year average build for the week is 81 billion.

1025,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 25, 2014 01:15PM ET</span>","South Africa’s Miners Back To Work, But Business As Usual Will Take Time ","By Kathleen Caulderwood - An historic five-month mining strike in South Africa is finally over as thousands of workers made their way back to work on Wednesday, but this is far from the end for the companies that produce more than two-thirds of the world’s platinum supply as well as the struggling South African economy.
“It’s going to take the economy quite a few months to recover. There will probably be parts of the platinum belt that never recover,” economist Mike Schussler told The Wall Street Journal.
The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union, which represents about 80 percent of workers at the companies, demanded an increase in worker wages from  $473 to $1, 184 (5000 rand to 12,500 rand) a month. By the end of talks, the union accepted a 20 percent raise.
“The market is probably still underestimating the true cost of the strike on the companies’ balance sheet and the cost of returning operations to production,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Edward Sterck, to Reuters.
After more than 70,000 platinum workers walked off the job 152 days ago, companies Lonmin (LONDON:LMI), Anglo American Platinum Ltd (JO:AMSJ) and Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd (JO:IMPJ) lost a combined $2.25 billion (24 billion rand) in revenue.
It’s been enough to cause  a 0.6 percent contraction in South Africa’s economy this quarter, left miners and their families starving without a livelihood after forfeiting nearly $900 million in lost wages according to a report on mining.com.
Even now, it will take time for some workers to return after going back to their distant family homes.

“Some of the miners may not come back at all, so crews will be a bit smaller,” Jonathan Butler, precious metal strategist at Mitsubishi, said to The Financial Times.
The staff also needs to undergo various health checks and inspect long-untended work areas underground before getting back to business as usual.
“We await more detail on a recovery plan but clearly the company isn’t out of the woods yet, with the health of employees, damage underground from prolonged inactivity, retraining, etc, etc, all issues to overcome,” Investec said in a note about Lonmin, according to Reuters.

1027,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 25, 2014 11:45AM ET</span>",US Oil & Gas Company Profits Surged 53% In 2013,"By Maria Gallucci - U.S. oil and gas companies saw their after-tax profits climb 53 percent to $33.4 billion last year, spurred by rising fuel prices and a boost in production along America’s shale formations.
The figures are a welcome relief to energy firms, which suffered a 58 percent decrease in after-tax profits in 2012, due largely to low natural gas prices, Ernst & Young said Tuesday in its annual U.S. oil and gas reserves study.
The financial services provider analyzed the 50 largest publicly traded oil and gas exploration and production companies, based on their oil and gas reserves estimates at the end of 2013. Companies reported a 9 percent increase in the oil reserves that they plan to tap within five years.
E&Y said that the profit increase came as companies shifted away from acquiring property along the country’s shale rock formations and toward drilling wells and extracting resources from the ground. The increase in oil production and oil prices helped drive up revenues by 11 percent to $199 billion last year. 
“There are some big plays out there, and what you're seeing is a pullback on the pure acquisition of acreage,"" said John Russell, the U.S. oil and gas assurance leader at E&Y, the Houston Chronicle reported. ""It's time to start getting some cash flow coming in. When they make those investments, they can't be investments forever. They've got to turn around and make some profit off of them.""

Oil prices averaged $96.90 per barrel last year, up from $94.68 per barrel in 2012, based on monthly spot prices on the West Texas Intermediate benchmark. Natural gas prices increased to $3.67 per unit last year, compared to $2.76 per unit in 2012, according to the average monthly spot prices on the Henry Hub, the central location for the pricing of natural gas contracts.
E&Y also attributed part of the profit gains to a 7 percent drop in energy firms’ capital expenditures, which totaled $173.5 billion last year. “That is due in part to the advancement in technologies and processes that are making exploration and production less expensive and more efficient,” Deborah Byers, E&Y’s oil and gas leader, told Oil & Gas Journal.
The report found that U.S. oil reserves increased by about 2.1 billion barrels last year to nearly 25.4 billion barrels — a 52 percent climb from 2009. The Houston Chronicle noted that almost all of those gains in reserves come from smaller independent producers, as opposed to the larger energy firms that also refine and market their fuel products.

“We should approve this bill, this project in particular, and build it for Americans,” Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said, the Times-Picayune noted. “It is better for our environment. It is for our economy, most of all, it is better for our workers.”
Under the bill, called the North American Energy Infrastructure Act, pipeline developers would need to obtain a “certificate of crossing” for cross-border oil pipelines and transmission facilities—not a presidential permit. The U.S. Secretary of State or Energy would be required to issue the certificate within four months of final action on the project’s environmental impact statement, unless the project is deemed to not be in the interest of the American public.
The White House has threatened to veto the House bill. Curtailing the approval process “could result in serious security, safety, foreign policy, environmental, economy and other ramifications,” the Obama administration said in a statement.
A similar attempt by Senate Republicans to expedite the Keystone XL’s approval failed on Tuesday after Senate Democrats blocked the proposed legislation.
House Democrats largely railed against the fast-track bill, arguing that the build-out of more tar sands pipelines would dramatically boost greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbate global warming.
“A modern, 21st century infrastructure must address the threat of climate change, the biggest energy challenge we face as a country,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., said.

Henry Waxma, D-Calif., said that the bill “creates a process that rubber-stamps the project and eliminates a meaningful environmental review or public participation. This will undoubtedly benefit TransCanada and other multinational oil companies … but it will harm the American people that we’re here to represent.”
Waxman tried unsuccessfully to attach an amendment to the House bill that would exclude the Keystone XL and other projects with pending permit applications from the bill’s new requirements.
The Obama administration in April postponed its decision on the Canada-to-Texas pipeline, citing “uncertainty” following a Nebraska Supreme Court ruling that could lead to changes in the pipeline’s route.

1030,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 25, 2014 10:15AM ET</span>",US Oil From Fracking More Volatile Than Previously Believed ,"By Meagan Clark - The millions of barrels of oil pumped from shale rock around the country, in Colorado, Texas and other states, not just North Dakota, are full of unpredictable and flammable gases that make the crude difficult to move and process into fuel.
After a series of fiery train derailments in the past year, federal investigators in May identified the “ultralight” oil travelling by rail from North Dakota’s Bakken Shale as an “imminent hazard,” meaning it significantly inflicts risk of death and injury to people and the environment, because of what they called its unusually flammable nature.
Now energy experts say the high levels of gas in North Dakota’s Bakken crude are present also in oil pumped from many shale formations, including the Niobrara Shale in Colorado and the Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin in Texas, the Wall Street Journal reported.
U.S. oil production has risen in the past few years at levels not seen since the 1970s, lifted by applying new drilling techniques like hydraulic fracturing to plentiful shale formations to extract so-called tight or light oil. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects American oil production to rise by 48 percent from 2012 to 2020, with tight oil accounting for 81 percent of that increase.
Until the recent boom, much of the oil U.S. refiners processed was dirty and heavy. Now the crude can be so light and gassy that it froths over refinery units like champagne, and refiners must invest in new equipment to process more of the oil.

The bump in supply has pushed the price of the new oil down $10 or more than the level of traditional crude, so energy companies are keen to ship their oil abroad, where buyers would be willing to pay more. Though there’s a decades-old ban on crude exports, federal officials recently gave two companies permission to export oil that’s been minimally processed.
With the ban still in place, companies can export refined fuel, which means refineries must continue investing in equipment to process the new light oil. But if more companies are granted permission to export minimally-processed oil, U.S. refineries will face more competition to process the oil, even after investing in the right equipment.

Futures were likely to find support at $4.453 per million British thermal units, the low from June 24 and resistance at $4.633, the high from June 20.
Early injection estimates for Thursday’s storage data range from 93 billion cubic feet to 101 billion cubic feet. The five-year average build for the week is 81 billion.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.719 trillion cubic feet as of last week, nearly 29.1% below their level this time last year and 33.1% below the five-year average.
Utilities added 113 billion cubic feet of gas into storage last week, above forecasts for an increase of 110 billion cubic feet.
Natural gas stockpiles have grown by more than 100 billion cubic feet for six consecutive weeks, a record streak since 1994.
Producers would need to add approximately 2.6 trillion cubic feet to storage by November 1 to meet typical winter demand, analysts said.
Meanwhile, expectations for a return of hotter temperatures next week across most parts of the U.S. further boosted prices.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.

1039,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 24, 2014 08:45PM ET</span>",US And Oil Gas Sector Facing Climate Risks,"By Maria Gallucci - The U.S. oil and gas sector is facing a challenge: The production and burning of fossil fuels is changing the climate, which in turn is upping the risks of flooding, heat waves and sea-level rise in the very places where companies extract, store and refine their products.
Climate change could be especially troublesome for oil and gas operations in the Great Plains region, the U.S. Southeast and the state of Alaska, according to the “Risky Business” report unveiled on Tuesday by a bipartisan coalition of senior political and economic leaders.
“Our findings show that, if we continue on our current path, many regions of the U.S. face the prospect of serious economic effects from climate change,” the report said. Climate-related events and weather changes could not only cost companies and governments billions of dollars in infrastructure and operational damages, they could also create widespread disruption in the production and delivery of critical energy resources.
“A lot of things are going to happen that none of us are going to like to see,” former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, one of the report’s main backers, told the New York Times.
In the Great Plains, two states alone account for about half of U.S. energy production: Texas -- which provided nearly 35 percent of crude oil production last year and supplies most of the country’s natural gas production -- and Wyoming, which accounted for nearly 40 percent of the coal mined in the country in 2012, according to federal energy statistics. North Dakota has also become a major energy player in recent years, with its shale oil fields accounting for more than one-tenth of all U.S. oil production.
As global temperatures inch upward, Texas and other southern states in the region could see an increase in the number of extremely hot days, according to the new report. Over the past 30 years, average residents of these states experienced 39 days per year with temperatures above 95 degrees Fahrenheit. That could jump to 60 days per year by mid-century and 114 days per year by 2100 -- meaning that energy sector workers out in the field would experience three to four additional months of sweltering conditions each year.
The Texas Gulf Coast, home to hundreds of refineries and industrial facilities, as well as the exit point of the Keystone XL’s southern leg, will see its coastlines erode in the coming decades. Sea levels in that area will likely rise by up to two feet by 2050 and as much as 4.9 feet by the end of the century, the report said.

The U.S. Southeast will likely see even higher sea level rise, as well as greater flooding during hurricanes and other coastal storms -- which will intensify because of climate change. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida and Georgia are all states with high concentrations of oil and gas infrastructure, including pipelines, offshore drilling platforms and refineries.
The increasing intensity of hurricanes threatens to both damage that infrastructure and disrupt the production and shipping of oil and gas. Rising sea levels could also boost flood damage at coastal facilities, according to a 2012 report on the Gulf Coast.
And in Alaska, where more than 80 percent of the state’s GDP comes from oil and gas production, global warming is likely to create transportation problems for major oil developers in the state’s North Slope region. Companies depend on the use of ice roads to move around the frozen Arctic land. But Alaska’s average temperature is expected to rise by between 7.6 degrees to 16 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, leading to shorter ice road transport seasons and melting ice roads.
Federal energy researchers explored the U.S. energy sector’s vulnerability to climate change in much deeper detail last year. They said that while it is difficult to know the probability, timing and severity of climate change's effect on the country’s energy operations, current attempts to bolster infrastructure and protect supply networks from extreme weather don’t go far enough.
“The magnitude of the challenge posed by climate change on an aging and already stressed U.S. energy system could outpace current adaptation efforts, unless a more comprehensive and accelerated approach is adopted,” according to a U.S. Department of Energy report.
The agency also built an interactive map to show where climate change has already impacted the nation’s energy sector. Here's a snapshot:

Brent oil on the ICE futures exchange rose 0.3% to $114.46 a barrel with the spread with West Texas Intermediate widening by 48 cents to $8.43 a barrel.
Brent typically reacts more strongly to geopolitical tensions because U.S. oil production is high and most domestic crude can't be exported.
Investors locked in gains stemming from fears that the Iraqi insurgency will disrupt supply and sold for profits, as the violence still remains far away from the country's main oilfields in the south.
Iraq produced approximately 3.5 million barrels a day of oil last month, making it OPEC’s second-biggest oil producer behind Saudi Arabia, and reports earlier confirmed market sentiments that crude continues to flow from the crisis-ridden country.
Exports from Iraq's southern terminals averaged 2.53 million barrels per day (bpd) up to June 21, according to shipping data and Reuters sources, a that suggests production remains on track to resemble May's average of 2.58 million bpd - the highest since 2003.
U.S. new home sales rose to a six-year high, surging 18.6% in May to an annual rate of 504,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. May's figure was the highest level since May 2008 and the largest monthly increase since January 1992.

Fed stimulus programs such as monthly bond purchases weaken the dollar by suppressing long-term interest rates, which sends investors to assets like stocks in hopes lower borrowing costs will spur investment and hiring, with gold serving as an attractive hedge to the weaker greenback.

In the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for delivery in August traded at $105.78 a barrel during U.S. trading, down 0.37%. New York-traded oil futures hit a session low of $105.28 a barrel and a high of $106.46 a barrel.
The August contract settled down 0.62% at $106.17 a barrel on Monday.
Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $105.11 a barrel, last Thursday's low, and resistance at $107.45 a barrel, Monday's high.
Investors locked in gains stemming from fears that the Iraqi insurgency will disrupt supply and sold for profits, as the violence still remains far away from the country's main oilfields in the south.
Iraq produced approximately 3.5 million barrels a day of oil last month, making it OPEC’s second-biggest oil producer behind Saudi Arabia, and reports earlier confirmed market sentiments that crude continues to flow from the crisis-ridden country.
Exports from Iraq's southern terminals averaged 2.53 million barrels per day (bpd) up to June 21, according to shipping data and Reuters sources, a that suggests production remains on track to resemble May's average of 2.58 million bpd - the highest since 2003.
Prices fell on the wire service report, though upbeat U.S. data cushioned losses.
U.S. new home sales rose to a six-year high, surging 18.6% in May to an annual rate of 504,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. May's figure was the highest level since May 2008 and the largest monthly increase since January 1992.
Analysts were expecting new home sales to rise 1.6% to 440,000 units.

1055,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 23, 2014 04:00PM ET</span>",Mexico's Drug Cartels Threaten Fracking Boom,"By Maria Gallucci - Violent drug cartels running rampant in northern Mexico are threatening to forestall the country’s much-anticipated fracking boom.
In a recent incident in Tamaulipas state, about 30 workers for oil and gas company Weatherford International were caught in the crossfire of gangs feuding for control of the U.S. drug market, Bloomberg News reported. Gunmen rolled up in a makeshift tank and blasted the hotel where the Weatherford workers were staying with bullets. The employees were forced to flee under police escort.
Mexico shares part of the Eagle Ford shale formation with southern Texas, where drillers have sparked an oil and gas revival and are helping place the United States on track to become the world’s top oil producer in the coming years. But while developers have completed nearly 9,000 wells in Texas, only a handful of test wells have been drilled in Mexico, in large part because of the drug-related violence.
“Shale will not take off in Mexico like it did in Texas in the near future,” Dwight Dyer, a Mexico City-based senior analyst for consulting firm Control Risks, told Bloomberg. “Unless the security situation along the northeastern border improves significantly, smaller companies will probably take their time before jumping in.”
The Eagle Ford deposits are critical to boosting Mexico’s oil production, which has steadily declined since its peak in 2004. Mexico’s Burgos Basin is estimated to hold 600 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas and 13 billion barrels of recoverable shale oil, the sixth-largest and eighth-largest resources in the world, respectively, according to Oilprice.com.
Unless new resources can be tapped, Mexico could become a net importer of oil within a few years.
The federal Ministry of Energy has estimated that $100 billion in investment is needed over the next decade to develop Mexican shale resources, money that will likely come from private developers. Last year, the Mexican government amended its constitution to allow foreign companies to drill in Mexico, potentially ending the 76-year monopoly held by state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos. So far, Pemex has invested only about $250 million in Mexico shale gas exploration and production, Oilprice.com noted.
Dueling drug gangs aren’t the only hurdles Mexico must clear before it can partake in the shale boom. To tap the Eagle Ford deposits, developers will need to use hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which requires blasting vast amounts of water, chemicals and sand into dense rock to release crude oil and natural gas. Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon, the three Mexican states with the most shale deposits, are comprised mostly of desert, limiting the amount of available water supplies needed for fracking to drill wells.

Fracking also requires a substantial infrastructure network and a pool of highly-trained employees, both of which Mexico currently lacks. Pipelines, roads and rail networks are needed to transport raw materials and capital equipment, and they're also needed to store, transport and refine the fossil fuels. Skilled engineers, geologists and other experts are needed to run the unconventional drilling operations, the San Antonio Business Journal said.
Violence is likely to keep smaller oil and gas wildcatters away from Mexico’s shale deposits for the time being.
The gang activity “does raise the cost of doing business,” Duncan Wood, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, told Bloomberg. “For the bigger companies that’s not a big deal, but for the smaller companies, it’s something they have to factor in.”

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in August traded at $4.477 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, down 1.66%. The commodity hit a session high of $4.592 and a low of $4.475.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.364 per million British thermal units, the low from May 27, and resistance at $4.773, Wednesday's high.
Weather forecasts called for a break in a heat wave across the U.S. over the next five days, though expectations for a return of hotter weather in the Midwest and eastern U.S. next week prevented prices from falling too far.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Meanwhile, market players continued to assess the outlook for U.S. supply levels. Utilities added 113 billion cubic feet of gas into storage last week, above forecasts for an increase of 110 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.719 trillion cubic feet as of last week, nearly 29.1% below their level this time last year and 33.1% below the five-year average.
Natural gas stockpiles have grown by more than 100 billion cubic feet for six consecutive weeks, a record streak since 1994.
Producers would need to add approximately 2.6 trillion cubic feet to storage by November 1 to meet typical winter demand, analysts said.

1059,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 23, 2014 12:00PM ET</span>",7 Global Consequences Of Soaring Oil Prices,"By Meagan Clark - Crude oil prices  in the U.S. and around the world are hitting highs last seen in September amid the ongoing crisis in Iraq as militants of terrorist group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) continue seizing cities and oil refineries in their march toward Baghdad.
Here are seven ways that rising oil prices will impact global economies:
1.       Growth in the eurozone, dragged down by France and Germany, is grinding to its slowest pace of growth in six months, according to a June survey released Monday. About 5,000 companies across the currency area and in the manufacturing and services sectors reported higher input prices and specifically higher oil prices as “a key cause of rising costs,” according to survey compiler Markit. Apparently, oil prices are not yet high enough to weigh down manufacturing and service sectors in the U.S. and China, where Markit surveys found conditions are reviving despite fears of a slowdown.
2.       India is dependent on oil imports for more than three-fourths of its needs, and about 13 percent of its imports come from Iraq. That means Asia’s third-largest economy, whose stock market has performed among the best in the world this year, could see an economic crisis unfold if oil prices don’t fall again. Since India subsidizes many fuels like diesel and kerosene, aiming to shield the poor from price fluctuations, the government must compensate losses to fuel retailers. Every dollar increase in the oil price raises the subsidy burden by about $997 million, an Indian oil official told the Wall Street Journal.
3.       The price of gasoline in the U.S. is closely pegged to the international price of oil. In general, a $10 increase in the oil price will cause a 25-cents rise in gas prices. (This is known as the Hamilton-to-a-Quarter Rule, a ten-dollar-bill with Alexander Hamilton’s face to a quarter.) This rule only roughly estimates the national average price of gasoline, and prices always vary by region. For example, gas prices soared past $4 a gallon in California on Sunday, but are around $3.80 in Michigan.

4.       Another handy rule: a one-penny shift in U.S. gas prices generally leads to a $1 billion increase in American household energy consumption. If gas prices rise by a dime, that’s a $10 billion increase in household energy consumption. Analysts have said gas prices could rise 5 to 10 cents this summer if the turmoil in Iraq continues.
5.       Since energy, particularly oil, is about 10 percent of the consumer price index, a 10 percent increase in energy prices increases inflation by an additional 1 percent (added to an economy’s inflation from other factors), according to Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Joseph LaVorgna.
6.       Rising oil prices also hits gross domestic product. In general, a $10 increase in the price of oil cuts 0.2 to 0.3 percent from GDP. That means, so far the uptick in oil prices is causing about a 0.15 percent decline in global GDP. The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that global GDP would grow at about 3.7 percent this year. 
7.       The global economic recovery will be weak and unsustainable as long as oil prices remain above $100 per barrel, according to the macroeconomic think tank Capital Economics. Julian Jessop, head of commodities research, said June 20 that if the unrest in Iraq drags on like the civil war in Syria has, he expects even with Western oil reserves and increased output from Saudi Arabia adding to global oil supply, prices could settle at $120 per barrel “for an extended period.”
“This would be the level at which global growth has faltered in the past,” he added.

On Thursday, the precious metal rallied 3.25%, or $41.40, after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled the central bank was in no hurry to raise interest rates.
The Fed cut its bond purchases by $10 billion a month, to $35 billion, saying there was ""sufficient underlying strength"" in the U.S. economy to continue tapering.
Despite this, the Fed also lowered its forecast for growth this year to a range of 2.1% to 2.3% from 2.8 to 3.0% previously, due to ""unexpected contractions"" in the first quarter as a result of the unusually harsh winter.
The Fed acknowledged the recent increases in inflation and drop in unemployment, but Chair Janet Yellen said no formula was in place for when interest rates would start to rise.
Meanwhile, gold traders monitored events in Iraq, as the conflict between Sunni Islamist insurgents and Iraqi army forces continued on Friday.
U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday he would send 300 members of the special-operations forces to Iraq and added he was prepared to take ""targeted"" military action later if deemed necessary.

1073,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 20, 2014 08:45PM ET</span>","With Situation Tense, Beijing Sends 4 Oil Rigs To South China Sea ","By Reuters - China has sent four oil rigs into the South China Sea in a sign that Beijing is stepping up its exploration for oil and gas in the tense region, less than two months after it positioned a giant drilling platform in waters claimed by Vietnam.
Coordinates posted on the website of China's Maritime Safety Administration showed the Nanhai number 2 and 5 rigs had been deployed roughly between southern China and the Pratas islands, which are occupied by Taiwan. The Nanhai 4 rig was towed close to the Chinese coast.
The agency did not say who owns the rigs.
Earlier this week, it gave coordinates for a fourth rig, the Nanhai 9, which it said would be positioned just outside Vietnam's exclusive economic zone by Friday.
The announcement comes at a time when many countries in Asia, particularly Vietnam and the Philippines, are nervous at China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea, where sovereignty over countless islands and reefs is in dispute.
The Global Times, a popular tabloid published by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, quoted Zhuang Guotu, director of the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at Xiamen University, as calling the rig deployment a ""strategic move"".
""The increase in oil rigs will inevitably jab a sensitive nerve for Vietnam and the Philippines,"" Zhuang said.
China's state oil behemoth CNOOC Ltd (HK:0883) has said it had four new projects scheduled to come on stream in the western and eastern South China Sea in the second half of 2014.
It was unclear if the four rigs were part of those projects. A CNOOC spokesman declined to comment, but the company has long said that in a bid to boost production it wanted to explore in deeper waters off China.

CNOOC has said it would increase by up to a third its annual capital spending for 2014 to almost $20 billion.
Anti-Chinese violence flared in Vietnam last month after a $1 billion deepwater rig owned by CNOOC Group, the parent of the listed unit, was parked 240 km (150 miles) off the coast of Vietnam.
Hanoi says the rig is in its 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zone and on its continental shelf. China has said the rig was operating completely within its waters.
China claims about 90 percent of the potentially energy-rich South China Sea. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have claims to parts of the waters.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for August delivery traded at 1,316.10 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, up 0.15%, up from a session low of $1,307.20 and off a high of $1,322.40.
The August contract settled up 3.25% at $1,314.10 on Thursday.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,258.00 a troy ounce, Tuesday's low, and resistance at $1,322.00, Thursday's high.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left benchmark interest rates unchanged at 0.00-0.25% and cut its monthly bond-buying program to $35 billion from $45 billion in widely expected move.
The dollar weakened and gold strengthened, however, after the U.S. central bank stopped short of offering a timetable as to when interest rates may rise. Gold and the dollar tend to trade inversely with one another.
Markets viewed the Fed's language as somewhat dovish.
""It likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored,"" the Fed said in its Wednesday policy statement.
Geopolitical concerns kept gold prices elevated.
Iraqi security forces fought with Sunni militants for control of a 300,000 barrel-per-day refinery on Thursday, which pressured oil prices higher by stoking supply concerns, and gold prices followed suit on concerns higher oil and gasoline prices could slow the pace of U.S. recovery.
Still, many of the country's major oilfields remain far south of the fighting, which eased fears somewhat and allowed gold to give back some of its gains in profit taking.
U.S. President Barack Obama said on Thursday that he was sending up to 300 U.S. military advisers to Iraq and added he was prepared to take ""targeted"" military action later if deemed necessary.

1075,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 20, 2014 01:30PM ET</span>",Lumber Prices Expected To Rise -- Report,"By Alicia Perez - An increase in U.S. housing construction is expected to raise significantly the price of lumber by the end of the year, offsetting the depressing effect China's recent downturn in property investment has had on lumber demand.
Capital Economics, a London-based financial research consultancy group, expects prices to increase almost 30 percent, from $313 per 1,000 board feet to $400, by the end of 2014. The group attributes the expected rise to increased demand in the U.S. housing market.
Lumber's recent price weakness stems partially from China slowing down property investments. China’s “reduction in commodity-intensive activity” had a hand in the fall in lumber prices, as well as construction metals, because Chinese demand accounts for roughly 10 percent of North American production exports, Capital Economics said in a note Friday.

Lumber prices fell in May for the first time in two years. 
Construction is revving back up in the U.S. but slowed considerably because of the unusally cold winter, hitting a nearly two-year low in March.
While the report states the future of the U.S. housing sector looks positive and a quarter of the mills that closed in 2004 have reopened, “a significant amount of capacity is likely to have been permanently lost, as mills fell into disrepair and skilled labour moved onto other jobs. This will prevent output quickly ramping back up to 2004 levels.”

1078,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 20, 2014 12:00PM ET</span>",Kurds Look For Oil Buyers As Tension With Iraq Increases,"By Meagan Clark - After weeks of seeking a buyer for a disputed cargo of millions of barrels of oil pumped and exported from the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in Iraq, the cargo remains floating on the Mediterranean Sea amid conflicting ownership claims with Iraq’s central government.
The ship has been tracked to waters nearby Israel's Ashkelon port and Reuters reported that the tanker is expected to dock early on Saturday, although it was not clear whether the oil on board the SCF Altai tanker had been sold to a local refiner or was going to be stored. ""We do not comment on the origin of crude oil being imported by the private refineries in Israel,"" an Israeli energy ministry spokeswoman was quoted as saying by Reuters.
“If that tanker docks, Iraq’s Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) will take an important step toward independence,” Nihat Ali Ozcan, an analyst at the Economic Policy Research Foundation in Ankara, Turkey, told Bloomberg.
Facing legal threats from Baghdad, European governments have been wary of accepting the contentious cargo that left the Turkish port of Ceyhan in early June.
The KRG exported the crude via a new pipeline from the autonomous region in Iraq to the Turkish port of Ceyhan. The pipeline's construction, designed to bypass the central government's own pipeline network, is at the center of the ongoing row between Baghdad and the Kurds.
Baghdad and the KRG have been locked in a dispute over the right to sell oil produced in the autonomous region for months. Both parties insist that Iraq's constitution allows them to export the oil independently.
The KRG, which accuses Baghdad of withholding government funds it is owed, has long sought to increase its financial independence from the central government.
The SCF Altai tanker loaded the disputed crude from the United Emblem tanker during a ship-to-ship transfer near Malta, ship tracking data showed. The United Emblem was the second shipment of Kurdish crude to leave the port of Ceyhan. The first, United Leadership, remains at sea.
Kurdish administration representatives denied on Friday that they’re offering the load at half-price, according to a Bloomberg report.
Kurdish armed forces wrested control of Iraq’s key northern oil city, Kirkuk, from Islamist militants, who in turn took control of the city from the Iraqi army last week. The Kurds have long claimed the city should be a part of their autonomous region. Selling the oil would allow the Kurdish region to become one step closer to financial independence from Iraq and feed its expanding territory’s economy.
The Kurdish government views the oil exports as within its rights under the Iraqi constitution.

“The big question is: ‘who will control the oil’? Counterparts in Baghdad did not identify ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ KRG actions – they just wanted to control the issue completely,” KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani said on June 4, in an address to Parliament. “We do not view this issue as a path towards Kurdistan’s independence, but rather as the expression of our constitutional rights… upon which we agreed when we returned to Iraq in 2003 and 2004, and they have to be implemented in Iraq.”
Turkey also sees the Kurdish oil, exported through its Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, as “entirely legitimate,” Turkey’s energy minister Taner Yildiz told Bloomberg. At the World Petroleum Congress in Moscow this week, he said the next shipment of oil is scheduled for Sunday, and that currently, 100,000 to 120,000 barrels of oil flow each day from northern Iraq, and 2.3 million barrels of oil are stored in Ceyhan.
According to Bloomberg, Iraq’s Deputy Prime Minister Hussain al-Shahristani said on Iraqiya television Tuesday that “the Iraqi people won’t forget those who conspired against them during tough times,” and “Turkey should be aware that this is like playing with fire. This is plundering the wealth of Iraq.”

1079,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 20, 2014 11:00AM ET</span>",NATO Chief: Russia Backing Europe's Anti-Fracking Groups,"By Maria Gallucci - Clandestine Russian operatives, ever lurking in the shadows, are working to thwart Europe’s natural gas sector by funding and orchestrating environmental groups.
At least that’s what the outgoing head of NATO claimed this week, a charge that prompted ridicule and criticism from environmentalists who oppose hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” the controversial method of forcing oil and gas deposits from tight shale rock.
Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and a former Danish prime minister, told reporters that the Kremlin is coordinating opposition to fracking in order to protect Russia’s position as Europe’s top gas supplier.
“I have met allies who can report that Russia, as part of their sophisticated information and disinformation operations, engaged actively with so-called non-governmental organizations—environmental organizations working against shale gas—to maintain European dependence on imported Russian gas,” he said at the Chatham House foreign affairs think tank in London.
Rasmussen didn’t elaborate further, saying only that, “This is my interpretation.” The politician clarified that he believes fracking should be used to bolster Europe’s energy security and reduce its reliance on imports, according to media reports.
The practice of fracking has yet to sweep Europe the way it has the United States, where shale drilling has been associated with methane leaks and groundwater pollution. But protests have taken off in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe amid concerns that fracking could create environmental damage and exacerbate global warming emissions, the Guardian reported.
Environmental groups leading the anti-fracking movement balked at Rasmussen’s assertion that Russia was a secret benefactor.
“The idea we’re puppets of Putin is so preposterous that you have to wonder what they’re smoking over at NATO HQ,"" a Greenpeace spokesman said. “Mr. Rasmussen should spend less time dreaming up conspiracy theories and more time on the facts.”
Thirty Greenpeace activists and journalists were threatened with long jail terms last year after Russian security forces blocked their attempts to stop a Russian tanker from unloading its shipment of Arctic oil in Rotterdam, the Independent noted.

Andrew Pendleton, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said that, “Perhaps the Russians are worried about our huge wind and solar potential and have infiltrated the UK government.”
NATO's press office told the Guardian that Rasmussen’s remarks were his own and not official policy. However, an official did warn against the potential for Russia to use its energy supplies as a means of influencing foreign policy dealings with Europe. “No country should use supply and pricing terms as tools of coercion,” the official told the newspaper.

The rapidly growing economies of China and India accounted for 88 percent of global growth in coal consumption, which saw a 3 percent rise in 2013, while growth in natural gas consumption actually decelerated everywhere except North America, according to the review. There are several reasons: Coal is relatively abundant around the world, it's cheap to burn compared to other methods of generating electricity, and in the past two years prices for coal have declined.
The strong demand for coal shows how difficult it will be to replace as efforts by developed nations to reduce pollution and add renewable energy to their power grids will be overwhelmed by the growth of developing nations relying on coal.
Only oil meets a larger share of global energy demand, 32.9 percent last year, according to BP (LONDON:BP). Massive investment in shale fueled the world’s largest increase in oil production in the U.S. last year and one of the largest increases in oil production the world has ever seen, offsetting numerous disruptions in global oil markets and keeping prices stable, BP chief executive Bob Dudley wrote about the report.
However, there’s a possibility coal could outpace oil. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasted in 2012 that coal would become the world’s top energy source by 2017. IEA expects that between 2012 and 2017, annual global coal consumption will rise by 1.2 billion tons, the amount of coal consumed by Russia and the U.S. combined in 2013.

Still, coal consumption’s growth last year was below its 10-year average of 3.9 percent, and new government regulations like those U.S. President Barack Obama and his administration has imposed will force many coal plants to close. Much of coal’s future depends on China, which accounts for nearly half of global coal consumption but is trying to reduce smog and increase its use of natural gas. China’s demand for coal grew in 2013, but at its slowest rate since 2008, according to BP.

1086,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 19, 2014 05:15PM ET</span>",Major Louisiana Gas Project Wins Federal Approval,"By Maria Gallucci - A major gas export project in Louisiana received the final federal go-ahead on Thursday, clearing the way for American fossil-fuel producers to ship supplies to Europe.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission voted unanimously to let Sempra Energy’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal move forward, according to a statement.
The approval comes amid a recent push by U.S. energy officials and congressional lawmakers to ramp up U.S. oil and gas exports and make the nation an energy “superpower,” one whose fuel supplies can supplant those of more problematic nations like Russia, which annexed the Ukrainian region Crimea, or Iraq, a nation suddenly embroiled in a bloody civil war.
The Cameron plant in Hackberry, La., could cost up to $10 billion to build and likely won’t be fully operational until 2018. When complete, it will pipe in, liquefy and export as much as 15 million metric tons of natural gas per year.
“Today’s approval is another important step in delivering natural gas to America’s trading partners abroad,” Sempra Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Debra Reed said in a statement, Bloomberg News reported.
The Cameron facility is only the second LNG export terminal to win U.S. government approval. The other plant, also in Louisiana, is Cheniere Energy Inc.’s Sabine Pass plant, which is scheduled to begin exporting fuel in late 2015, according to the company.

Federal energy regulators today approved more than 75 conditions on the Cameron terminal to reduce potential environmental harm in western Louisiana. The commission in April concluded that the plant wouldn’t cause significant environmental damage, but did recommend steps for minimizing “some adverse environmental impact” in the state, Bloomberg reported.
The approval follows a recent announcement by Alaska’s Gov. Sean Parnell that the state will partner with Canadian pipeline builder TransCanada Corp. on an LNG export “mega-project.” If approved, that project would pipe gas over 800 miles from Alaska’s North Slope to the coastline of its south-central region, where the gas would be chilled into LNG and exported to the Pacific Rim.

1088,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 19, 2014 03:00PM ET</span>","Thailand's Rice Is Stuck In The Country, Driving Up Prices","By Michelle FlorCruz - Though Thailand’s coup d'etat has been relatively calm and largely successful in maintaining social order among the people, the economic effects have become more apparent, now effecting the country’s lucrative rice-export industry.
Thailand’s Rice Exporters Association announced that severe worker shortages will cause delays in rice export shipments by as much as three weeks. A significant portion of Thailand’s migrant workers from neighboring countries like Cambodia and Myanmar are involved in the grain export industry, and represent a large majority of the work force at rice warehouses. The loading rate has slowed significantly, down to about 300 tons of rice a day, compared to standard shipments of 1,500 tons normally, the shipping director for Thailand’s Chaiyaporn Group, said.
The association’s honorary president, Chookiat Ophaswongse, told Bloomberg that as many as 70 percent of the workers involved in the export of rice shipments had left the country as a result of the Thai’s military seizing power. Political turmoil has threatened Thailand’s migrant population as fears of crackdowns on illegal labor and opposing political alliances.
“The source of the exodus appears to be politically motivated rumors either by ultra-nationalist coup hardliners trying to rile neighboring Cambodia—long seen as a haven of support for [ousted] Thaksin—or by pro-Thaksin forces in Phnom Penh trying to stir the cauldron in Thailand to undermine the junta,” Christian Lewis, Southeast Asia researcher for the Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy firm, said via email.
According to U.S. Department of Agriculture data, Thailand is expected to account for 22 percent of global rice exports this year, positioning the nation as the second-largest exporter of the grain, after Vietnam. The worker shortage has restricted supplies and boosted prices in the short-term, as exhibited by rice prices hitting a three-month high, Chookiat explains. Thai five-percent broken white rice, a common benchmark for Asian rice prices, rose by 1.5 percent for a third week yesterday, to $398 per ton.

As a prominent rice-producer, the delays put the supplies of several countries in jeopardy, including long-time importers in Africa, like Nigeria, South Africa and the Ivory Coast. As a result, these importers could potentially look elsewhere to fulfill their needs, allowing nearby competing markets to usurp Thailand’s dominance. “Nigeria is historically the largest importer of Thai rice, but substitute high quality exports from India and Vietnam will plug gaps in global supply, and Myanmar may be able to contribute to supply of lower-grade grains,” Lewis said.

Concerns the crisis will escalate and disrupt oil production sent prices higher, though Iraq's major oilfields still remain far south of the fighting, which capped gains.
Upbeat U.S. data supported the commodity as well.
In a report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that its manufacturing index rose to an eight-month high of 17.8 in June from 15.4 in May. Analysts had expected the index to dip to 14.0 in June.
The data came after the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending June 14 declined by 6,000 to 312,000 from the previous week’s revised total of 318,000. Analysts had expected jobless claims to fall by 4,000 to 314,000 last week.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in July traded at $4.610 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, down 1.06%. The commodity hit a session high of $4.700 and a low of $4.580.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.504 per million British thermal units, the low from June 11, and resistance at $4.773, Wednesday's high.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ending June 13 rose by 113 billion cubic feet, above forecasts for an increase of 110 billion cubic feet.
Stockpiles increased by 92 billion cubic feet in the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average build for the week is 87 billion.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.719 trillion cubic feet. Stocks were 706 billion cubic feet less than last year at this time and 851 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 2.570 trillion cubic feet for this time of year.
Producers would need to add approximately 2.6 trillion cubic feet to storage by November 1 to meet typical winter demand, analysts have said.
Meanwhile, updated weather-forecasting models showed that warmer weather was expected in the central and eastern U.S. over the next five days, though cooler temperatures may edge in afterwards, which sent prices falling as well.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.

1091,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 19, 2014 01:15PM ET</span>","Higher Oil Prices, Gasoline Prices Won't Cause Major Economic Slowdown (Yet)","By Meagan Clark - Oil prices have risen since the terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) seized Iraq’s second-largest city Mosul on June 10 and began invading south toward the capital Baghdad, but they aren’t yet sparking fears among economists of a major global economic slowdown.
After the news of ISIS’s advance, the Brent crude oil price, the international benchmark, wavered around $109 per barrel, compared to the May average of $110 per barrel. The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, used in the U.S, paused at about $104.35.

The next day, when it became more apparent that the attacks were escalating, WTI crude shot up past $106.50 per barrel, and Brent crude rose to about $112.50. Brent crude has since risen to more than $114 per barrel, hitting a nine-month high, and WTI crude has settled just over $106 after hitting $107 per barrel. And betting that oil prices will keep rising now costs more than it has in the past three years.

Highlighting the abrupt departure from expectations, the U.S. Energy Information forecasted, just before news of the Iraqi crisis began taking headlines, that Brent prices would average $107.82 this year and WTI prices, $98.67.
The higher oil prices have already begun trickling down to consumers, and there’s no relief in sight. Regular unleaded gasoline prices averaged $3.69 a gallon in the U.S. Wednesday, the highest for that day in six years, eight cents more than a year ago, and three cents more than a month ago. That’s a penny shy of this year’s high from April 28, according to AAA, an automobile club and non-profit that tracks daily gas prices in the U.S. In May, AAA had predicted that gas prices would fall 10 to 15 cents this month, as prices often peak in spring and fall in June.
""Despite hopes for a less expensive summer, it looks like Americans are stuck paying above-average gas prices,"" AAA spokesman Michael Green said. ""If the situation [in Iraq] continues to get worse, American consumers can expect to pay more at the pump.”
The last time gas prices were this high, in 2008, global oil prices were more than $150 per barrel.
Current prices are still only a little above the average $110 per barrel (for Brent) since the wave of revolutionary protests known as the Arab Spring swept through the Middle East and North Africa in 2011. While global economic growth has been slow since the Brent price rose above $100 per barrel, if history is any indication, oil prices would need to rise past $120 per barrel to sharply slow economic activity, Julian Jessop, chief global economist of macroeconomic think-tank Capital Economics said in a note Tuesday.

Generally, a $10 rise in oil prices slices 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points off of global growth, according to Jessop, which means so far, the dip in oil prices may be causing a 0.15 percent decline in global GDP.
“In the event of widespread disruption, the West could decide to draw on ample stockpiles of crude oil held in strategic reserves in the U.S. and elsewhere,” Jason Tuvey, Middle East economist for the think tank, said.

Gov. Sean Parnell announced earlier this week that the state and TransCanada—the company behind the proposed Keystone XL pipeline—had agreed to work together on the proposed Alaska gas pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project, the Associated Press reported. The Alaska Gasline Development Corp, BP (NYSE:BP), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), are also partners in the venture.
The project would pipe gas over 800 miles from Alaska’s North Slope to the coastlines of its south-central region, where the gas would be chilled into LNG and exported. Although initially intended to serve North American markets, the project will now primarily ship LNG to the Pacific Rim.
Alaska’s legislature in April approved a plan allowing the state to negotiate a partnership with TransCanada and the three oil and gas companies, who told officials in 2012 that the venture would represent a mega-project of “unprecedented scale and challenge,” AP reported at the time. The state would retain 25 percent ownership of the LNG plant.
The next step is for all the parties to sign a joint-venture agreement that spells out the responsibilities and cost-sharing, which will accelerate work on preliminary engineering and design, AP noted.

Initial estimates put the project at between $45 billion and $65 billion, but those estimates will be further refined in the next phase, Platts reported in April. If all goes as planned, the LNG pipeline and export project would start operating in 2024.

Clashes between the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Iraq’s counterterrorism units, were expected to ramp up Thursday following a day of assaults that heavily damaged a major gas line and two large fuel tanks, the Wall Street Journal reported.
The refinery in Baiji, located 130 miles north of the capital Baghdad, is the largest in Iraq and is the main fuel source for domestic consumption. The Sunni takeover has prompted fears of major supply shortages in Iraq and across the region, which in turn has triggered a spike in global oil prices.
ISIS forced the refinery to shut down and cut electricity earlier this week, and on Wednesday the militants took over three-fourths of the refinery, though which parts the rebels are controlling is disputed.
An official inside the refinery told media yesterday that the production units, administration building and four watch towers were all under ISIS control. An engineer at the plant told the WSJ that while gunmen are controlling some areas, Iraqi security forces are still manning the administrative office and production department.
An Iraqi military spokesman, Gen. Qassim Attam, has denied that insurgents overtook the refinery at all and said Wednesday that it remained under full government control, WSJ said.
Brent crude, an oil price benchmark, has risen past $114 a barrel—a nine-month high—as investors increasingly worry about exports from Iraq, Reuters reported.

Iraqi officials have said that major oilfields in the southern parts of Iraq are still safe from the armed insurgency. But oil companies have started pulling foreign staff out of the country amid fears that violence could engulf the entire nation.

1098,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 19, 2014 07:15AM ET</span>",India To Pay Iran $1.65B In Oil Dues,"By Sneha Shankar - India plans to pay Iran about $1.65 billion in past dues for the purchase of oil through UAE's central bank, as part of an interim nuclear deal that allowed Tehran to access $4.2 billion in blocked crude oil funds.
The payment will come after a delay of over a month, caused by the failed talks between Iran and six world powers over its nuclear program. As part of the deal, India would pay $550 million to the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates on June 16 and keep ready another $1.1 billion in two equal payments to be made at a later date, for the oil it purchased from Iran. The move comes after Iran resumed talks Tuesday about its nuclear program with the six world powers -- the U.S., UK, France, Germany, Russia and China -- in Vienna.
While Iran continues negotiations about its nuclear program, the payment from India will mark the first inflow of oil payments to Iran through regular banking channels since the imposition of economic sanctions in 2012. As part of the sanctions, Iran was barred from using regular banking channels to receive oil payments, crippling the country's economy, which relies heavily on oil revenues.
The $4.2 billion in crude-oil funds, which Tehran is to receive in eight installments in six months, were made accessible to the country in November under a deal that demanded a halt to its nuclear programs. Iran has so far received payments of up to $2.55 billion till date through four channels from Japan and one from South Korea, according to Indian Express, a local newspaper.
Under the deal's terms, UAE's central bank will hold a rupee account to receive the funds from India. The rupee funds will then be converted to dirhams and transferred to Iran's central bank. And, once India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, receives confirmation from the Iranian central bank, the RBI will transfer an equivalent amount in dollars to Iran. The RBI will later settle its dollar purchases with the money in the rupee account created by UAE's central bank.

""It is indeed a complex mechanism but it has been devised to bring in transparency in the money transfer to Iran,"" Reuters reported, citing a source.
India, which imports nearly 4 million barrels of oil a day, has reduced oil imports from Iran to 5.7 percent in 2014, down from Iran's two-thirds contribution to India’s overall oil imports five years ago.
""The respective payments by the four refiners will be same for the first two installments. Numbers for the third installment are yet to be worked out,"" Reuters reported, citing sources.

Alexander Medvedev, the company’s deputy chief executive, insisted the deal will make money for stated-owned Gazprom, though he declined to disclose the price that China National Petroleum Corp. agreed to pay for the Russian natural gas, the Wall Street Journal reported.
It would be “complete nonsense” to suggest that Gazprom could lose on the deal, Medvedev said, according to WSJ.
He also announced that China will pay Russia $25 billion in pre-agreed advance payments. The capital will help to build the “Power of Siberia” pipeline, which will ship gas from untapped gas fields in Eastern Siberia to China’s main consumption centers starting in 2017, Penza News reported.
Russia and China inked the $400 billion deal in May after a decade of negotiation. Medvedev at the time heralded the agreement as “an epoch-making event” because it could allow Russia to reduce its reliance on the European gas market and discover “the Asian gas market for ourselves,” Reuters noted.
The deal comes as Gazprom’s European exports, which comprise the bulk of its sales, are increasingly in jeopardy, given the Western sanctions against the Kremlin for its annexation of Crimea. The timing has raised questions in Russia about whether the gas company prioritized political interests over economic criteria, WSJ reported.

Energy experts have said Russia likely lost significant potential profit on the deal, since China was able to secure gas supplies from other nations while the Gazprom proposal hung in limbo, Penza News wrote.
Under the May deal, Russia will supply China with an annual average of 38 billion cubic meters of gas for 30 years. Earlier this month, Russian officials touted the prospect of a second major energy deal in China, suggesting that Gazprom might resume talks with China over a long-stalled western pipeline.

UK-based BP is a major investor in Iraq through the giant Rumaila field. A BP spokesman said Wednesday the company would not comment further at this time.
BP has evacuated 20 percent of its staff, and Texas-based Exxon has carried out a “major evacuation” of its staff, the head of Iraq’s state-run South Oil Company Dhiya Jaffar told Reuters.

ExxonMobil did not immediately comment. 
""I assure the companies that the current developments in the country have not affected and will not affect in any way the operations in the south,'' he said. He expects that Iraq’s export level for June will be 2.7 million barrels per day, unaffected by the crisis in the north.

1119,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 17, 2014 10:15PM ET</span>", Russian Trade Deal May Not Go Over Well With US Steel: Sources,"By Reuters - The U.S. steel industry is considering challenging a trade deal with Russia that governs imports of hot-rolled steel, potentially reviving a decades-old dispute amid mounting tensions over Russia's actions in Ukraine, two sources said.
A so-called suspension agreement struck after the Cold War has sheltered Russian steelmakers from steep anti-dumping duties on hot-rolled coil, instead setting a cap on HRC imports and a minimum price that many in the U.S. industry believe is too low even after a 2012 revision.
An industry source familiar with the situation said steel companies were looking at urging the U.S. administration to drop or adjust those exemptions.
Imports of hot-rolled, flat-rolled, carbon-quality steel products from Russia rose 162 percent in the three months through April, compared with the previous three-month period.
""Given the volume of imports coming in, the industry is actively exploring its options to terminate or modify the agreement,"" an attorney familiar with the Russian case said.
""We are in the process of preparing a filing for the U.S. government.""
The discussions come at a sensitive time for U.S. relations with Moscow, following Washington's decision to impose travel bans and asset freezes on dozens of Russian officials after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine.
The move also reflects concerns about weak global prices, oversupply and sluggish demand for hot-rolled steel, which is used in appliances and autos.
Overcapacity has already sparked other trade disputes, including a high-profile U.S. case over imports of steel tubes used by the oil and gas industry.
Even so, the news will likely rattle traders already worried about the impact of escalating tensions over Ukraine on steel trade flows. Russia is one of the biggest foreign suppliers of HRC.
If the deal is revised or canceled, domestic companies such as United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and possibly also AK Steel (NYSE:AKS)could benefit.
If the agreement dating from 1999 is ditched, Russia's Severstal would be hit with anti-dumping duties of 73.59 percent and other Russian producers, such as Novolipetsk Steel and Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works, would face duties of 184.56 percent.
The original deal was agreed as the United States moved to stem a flood of Russian steel imports after the Cold War ended.It can be terminated with 60 days notice, or modified by negotiation. Duties would apply immediately upon termination.
While it is unclear if there will be a challenge, the discussions come just two years after the countries renegotiated terms with substantially higher price floors to prevent Russian steel being sold below cost, or dumped, in the U.S. market, an official at the Commerce Department said.
""The Department currently has no plans to further amend or revoke this remedy,"" the official said.
Under the agreement, reference prices for Russian hot-rolled steel products for the current quarter range from $554.61 per tonne to $709.90 per tonne.
The United States also has suspension agreements in place on imports of Russian uranium and carbon steel plate.

1125,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 17, 2014 01:30PM ET</span>",Iraq’s Impact On Global Oil In Four Easy Charts,"By Meagan Clark - In less than a week, al Qaeda splinter group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has seized several key cities in the north and center of Iraq, the world’s seventh-largest oil-producing country, causing Iraq’s largest oil refinery to shut down Tuesday and bumping up international oil prices as traders fear the escalating violence could inhibit oil production.
Energy industry watchdogs have expected Iraq to expand its oil production considerably in the next decade, which would help keep global oil prices stable and meet rising global oil demand, particularly in China. To show the impact that Iraqi oil production has in the global market, here are four charts from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, based on data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Since IEA’s forecasts were made before ISIS claimed control in the north, they are likely to be revised down if ISIS is not contained soon.

IEA has said that North America’s rising oil production may not be enough to meet global demand in the long term, and that growth in production of crude oil and natural gas will be needed from the Organization for the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). On Tuesday, IEA’s report forecasted that 60 percent of expected growth in OPEC's crude production capacity in 2019 would come from Iraq.

IEA forecasted last week that global oil demand will rise this year by 1.3 million barrels a day to 92.8 million barrels a day, compared to last year. Global oil supplies rose in May to 92.6 million barrels a day this year, mostly on a 440,000-barrels-a-day increase in non-OPEC production. Here’s a look at IEA’s prediction that the growth of North American oil production will soon taper.

Iraq produces about 3.3 million barrels of oil a day, about 4 percent of the world’s total supply, and its crude production capacity growth was expected to rise by 40 percent, 1.3 million barrels a day to 4.5 million barrels a day, by 2019, according to IEA.

“Worsening political stability and security issues add major downside risk in Iraq, Libya” and others, IEA said. That’s led to delays in contract awards and infrastructure plans that would secure oil projects.
A quarter of Iraqi oil reserves are in the north and center of the country, closest to ISIS. The other three-fourths of the oil fields are in the south.

When asked Tuesday if IEA would update its forecasts regarding Iraq to reflect recent events, an IEA spokesman said the next update on Iraq, if needed, would not be published until IEA's monthly oil market report. The June report will be released in mid-July.

Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.606 trillion cubic feet as of last week, nearly 31% below their level this time last year and 35% below the five-year average.
Early injection estimates for this Thursday’s storage data range from 90 billion cubic feet to 105 billion cubic feet.
Stockpiles increased by 92 billion cubic feet in the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average build for the week is 87 billion.
Producers would need to add approximately 2.6 trillion cubic feet to storage by November 1 to meet typical winter demand, analysts said.
Elsewhere on the Nymex, crude oil for delivery in August eased down 0.14%, or 15 cents, to trade at $106.16 a barrel, while heating oil for July delivery tacked on 0.21% to trade at $3.00 4per gallon.

1128,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 17, 2014 09:30AM ET</span>","China, BP to Ink $20 Billion Gas Deal","By Maria Gallucci - Energy-hungry China will sign another major natural gas contract this week, its second deal in less than a month’s time, as the country races to match rising energy demand and curb pollution from coal plants.
Oil giant BP (LONDON:BP) announced the $20 billion long-term contract on Tuesday at the World Petroleum Congress in Moscow. The British fuel producer will supply liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation for 20 years, the Wall Street Journal reported.
British Prime Minister David Cameron and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang will preside over the formal signing in London this week, WSJ said.
The agreement marks one of BP’s largest deals to date with Beijing, and it is expected to involve supplying China with LNG from projects globally, Sky News noted.
“It is a fair price for them and a fair price for us. It is a good bridge between the UK and China in terms of trade,” Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, told reporters.
LNG is made by cooling natural gas until it becomes a clear, colorless liquid and is used to heat homes, to generate electricity or as an alternative transportation fuel. As a liquid, it takes up much less space than traditional natural gas and is therefore cheaper to transport and store.

Proponents of LNG say the fuel can help countries to reduce their global warming emissions since it is less carbon-intensive than coal. But the process of extracting, processing, chilling and shipping the chilled liquid fuel releases large amounts of carbon dioxide, and the fuel itself releases methane—another greenhouse gas.
The BP-China LNG deal follows a $400 billion natural gas agreement in May between state-owned China National Petroleum Company and Russian gas giant Gazprom to pipe the fuel from Siberian wells to China's main consumption centers.

1129,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 17, 2014 09:30AM ET</span>",Shale Boom To Spread Beyond U.S. By 2020,"By Meagan Clark - The North American shale boom that has transformed the oil industry here will spread beyond the continent before the end of the decade, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said Tuesday in its annual five-year oil market report.
That’s sooner than IEA previously expected. Techniques like hydraulically fracturing or “fracking” in the U.S. have allowed drillers to extract previously inaccessible oil reserves, which has fueled a surge in production and put the country on track to become the world’s largest oil producer by 2020, according to IEA. Shale production has been slow to spread to other countries though, due to legal, political and investment hurdles.
IEA believes these hurdles are melting faster than expected. Russia and Latin America, for example, are set to encourage fracking technologies on a large scale.
Still, IEA forecasts shale coil production from outside the U.S. at about 650,000 barrels a day by 2019, a small amount compared to the forecasted 5 million barrels a day from the U.S. in 2019. Though IEA expects North America to produce about 20 percent of the world’s oil supply by the end of the decade, it also expects U.S. oil production growth to plateau.
IEA also forecasts a slowdown in global oil demand growth, challenges to OPEC oil production capacity growth, and regional imbalances in gasoline and diesel markets.

“We are continuing to see unprecedented production growth from North America, and the United States in particular,” IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven said as she released the report in Paris. “At the same time, while OPEC remains a vital supplier to the market, it faces significant headwinds in expanding capacity.”
Ageing fields are plaguing almost every OPEC producer, while security concerns above-ground have deterred some investment and international oil companies. As much as three-fifths of OPEC’s expected growth in capacity by 2019 is set to come from Iraq, but the forecast was drafted last week before a terrorist group seized several key cities in northern and central Iraq.

(NSE:ADEL) faces a new delay on a planned coal mine in Australia, amid worries that a port expansion to accommodate the project could hurt the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef.
Australian Environment Minister Greg Hunt has extended his review of Adani's A$16.5 billion ($15.5 billion) Carmichael coal and rail project to August 1, a spokesperson for the minister said on Tuesday.
""The date for a decision has been extended to ensure the minister can thoroughly consider the large volume of material associated with this project referral,"" Hunt's spokesperson said in an email to Reuters.
The project in the untapped Galilee Basin, designed to produce 60 million tonnes a year of thermal coal used in power stations, has been attacked by green groups opposed to both new coal mines and the rail lines and ports needed to ship the coal.
The port that Adani plans to use, Abbot Point, is facing a legal challenge from green groups fighting an expansion that will dredge up 3 million cubic meters of sand to be dumped near the Great Barrier Reef.
The government's move to postpone a decision on the Carmichael project comes just as UNESCO's World Heritage Committee is due to consider a proposal to vote next year on putting the Great Barrier Reef on the ""in danger"" list.

""Approving (the project) now would have been tantamount to an act of provocation, with UNESCO currently mulling the status of Australia's greatest natural icon,"" Greenpeace programme head Ben Pearson said in a statement.
The state of Queensland, eager to promote new coal developments to boost the economy, approved the project in May with 190 conditions.

1158,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 13, 2014 09:00AM ET</span>",Oil Prices Soar To Highest Of The Year,"By Meagan Clark - Crude oil prices hit a nine-month high near $115 a barrel on Friday amid growing concern about a violent uprising in Iraq.
Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose about 1.2 percent to $114.20 per barrel Friday morning and then fell to $113.35. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. standard, rose 0.5 percent, at $107.11 per barrel.
The turmoil will likely drive up regular unleaded gasoline prices by 5 cents to 10 cents this week and could keep summer prices elevated, gasbuddy.com analyst Tom Kloza told USA Today. The timing of the political unrest is particularly bad for consumers, as summer driving season typically means a surge in gas demand and higher prices.
Iraq has been the largest source of growth in OPEC oil production in recent years, and traders are likely worried that Sunni-led terror group Islamic State of Syria and Iraq (ISIS) will continue wresting control of the region, including oil fields and refineries crucial to maintaining production levels.
In March, Iraq’s oil production fell by 300,000 barrels a day, leading OPEC’s decline of more than half a million barrels a day, the group said in its March oil-market report. Fighting in Libya and Syria and international sanctions against Iran has reduced their production. Venezuela and Nigeria, also OPEC members, have also struggled to maintain production. Even Saudi Arabia’s production, the largest producer in the cartel, has been falling.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are expected to ramp up production to fill any gaps left by Iraq and Libya, but that means meeting any further shortages will be increasingly tough as their buffer between capacity and production shrinks.

The International Energy Agency, a Paris-based independent industry watchdog, has said for years that North America’s rising oil production may not be enough to meet global demand in the long term, and that growth in production of crude oil and natural gas will be needed from the OPEC countries.

1168,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 12, 2014 09:45AM ET</span>",Oil Supply Will Meet Demand in H2 2014,"By Maria Gallucci - Global oil production will be enough to meet growing demand in the second half of 2014, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said Thursday.
The group’s monthly oil market update aimed to allay international concerns that OPEC’s member countries could face significant supply disruptions in the coming months as strikes, sanctions and armed insurgencies sweep the region, the Wall Street Journal reported. OPEC assured that non-OPEC oil production will help fill in any remaining gaps in demand later this year.
OPEC, whose 12 members supply a third of the world’s oil, forecast that other suppliers would increase output by 1.2 million barrels a day in the next six months, which, together with OPEC output and healthy stock levels, would be enough to balance oil markets, WSJ reported. Last month, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said that OPEC will need to boost its output by 800,000 barrels a day in next six months in order to meet global demand.
OPEC’s update comes as global oil prices climb on fears of escalating violence in northern Iraq. Reuters reported that the Brent crude oil—an international benchmark—rose by $1.85 to nearly $112 a barrel on Thursday after an  al Qaeda splinter group reportedly took over the northern city of Kirkuk, home of some of Iraq’s main oilfields.

Oil analysts said the Kirkuk takeover has no immediate implications for Iraq’s oil exports because the bulk of the country’s oil production and export facilities are largely in Shi’ite areas in the south, where al Qaeda-aligned groups have less of a stronghold, Reuters noted.
""A $2 move is nothing in historical terms but we have seen very low oil price volatility in recent months and that makes this move more significant,"" Gareth Lewis-Davies, a strategist at BNP Paribas, told Reuters. ""But a lot would have to happen before we saw a serious disruption to exports so that is not an immediate risk.""

1176,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 11, 2014 09:00PM ET</span>",Biden Remarks Highlight Paradox of 'All-Of-The-Above' Energy Strategy,"By Maria Gallucci - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday heralded America’s oil and gas boom but urged private investors and government leaders to aim, ultimately, to shift their investments away from carbon-intensive fuels.
“What is the long play? To state the obvious, I’m not an investment banker, but I wouldn’t go long on investments that lead to carbon pollution. I’d bid a little more on clean energy,” Biden said in a keynote speech at Goldman Sachs’ North American Energy Summit in New York City. “There’s a convergence around addressing climate change and carbon emissions, both here and abroad.”
The U.S. is now the world’s biggest producer of natural gas and the top exporter of petroleum products, thanks in large part to advancements in drilling technology and discoveries of “tight” shale resources. Biden credited the fossil fuel growth with expanding the U.S. economy and shrinking its trade deficit. Expanded energy production, he said, gives the White House greater influence in foreign policy as U.S. exports supplant supplies from “bad actors” like Russia.  “All of this has made us a world energy superpower,” he said.

But Biden also highlighted the rising risks of investing in carbon-based projects. He noted that major publicly traded companies are accounting for a potential price on carbon when they make their business decisions, and in China, the government is moving aggressively to stem air and carbon pollution to address simmering political tensions. And last week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules to cut carbon emissions from power plants by 30 percent by 2030.
“We should look at this energy boom as a transition not only to greater energy independence, but also renewable energy,” he said.
Biden also cautioned against a future scenario in which the U.S. fails to invest sufficiently in renewables like wind and solar power and ends up importing technology and products from other countries -- just as it did with oil and gas.
""We should see this as an extraordinary window of opportunity before us to secure an economic advantage,"" he told the summit.
The United States is second to China for the largest share of total clean energy investments, according to a recent report by Pew Charitable Trusts. U.S. investments totaled $36.7 billion in 2013, down 9 percent from the year before. Chinese investments topped $54 billion.
The two-day Goldman Sachs event gathered hundreds of leaders in the public and private sectors, including CEOs, energy officials and experts from the United States, Canada and Mexico. The three nations have ""created a trillion dollar trade relationship, and our energy cooperation is growing closer every day -- with a few bumps in there. Speak to our Canadian friends about the bumps,"" Biden said, hinting at the tensions over the proposed Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL pipeline.

1179,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 11, 2014 03:06PM ET</span>",Iraqi Uprising Exposes Global Oil Prices To Risk ,"By Meagan Clark - An armed uprising in Iraq led by a masked terror group could ratchet up global oil prices just after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to stick with its cap on production Wednesday.
According to the Paris-based International Energy Agency, the rise in unconventional oil production in North America is enough to meet growing global demand in the near term, but towards 2020, non-OPEC oil supply will likely tail off, requiring “substantial growth in production of crude oil and natural gas liquids from the OPEC countries.”

“Americans seem to think that the vast increase in domestic oil production from shale deposits has immunized the U.S. economy from Middle East instability. Not by a long shot,” Ken Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote Tuesday in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal.
Oil futures rose on Wednesday as the latest violence in Iraq rattled the market. Brent crude traded in London hit $110 a barrel after Islamic militants advanced on Iraq’s biggest oil refinery Wednesday, a day after they took control of Mosul, the country’s second-largest city. The armed Sunni fighters took control of a refinery in a town called Baiji on Wednesday that can process 300,000 barrels of oil per day, nearly 9 percent of Iraq’s total daily production of 3.5 million barrels a day.
Saxo Bank’s vice-president and head of commodity strategy Ole Hansen told the Telegraph newspaper that, “The worst case scenario is that we see production from Iraq slip down to levels in the last Gulf war, then oil could spike $20 a barrel very quickly. In that scenario, the entire economic recovery, which is still fragile, could stall and we could even slip back into recession in some regions.""
Iraq's oil minister Abdul Kareem Luaiby said at OPEC’s meeting that his country’s oil comes largely from the southern region. ""The accident is only in the north of Iraq… the south is a very, very safe area,” he said.
And OPEC said in a statement that member countries affirmed they would ""if required, take steps to ensure market balance which is so important to world economic activity."" Member countries also ""reiterated their willingness to firmly respond to developments that might jeopardize oil market stability,” OPEC said.
Both Iraq and Iran have planned to increase oil production in the next few years. Iran hopes Western sanctions imposed over its nuclear program will be lifted and allow it to reclaim its rank as the No. 2 producer in OPEC from Iraq.
“If this unrest can be contained and Iraqi production continues to rise, the bigger news in oil markets might be if Iran can successfully negotiate the lifting of Western sanctions,” Kyle Davis, an energy expert at international law firm Goltsblat BLP, said.
But Iran’s production is not guaranteed, and the terror group in Iraq could stunt any production growth if its control expands.
“The shocking escalation in violence in Iraq raises the prospect of potential output losses,” Helima Croft, Barclays’ head of North American commodities research, said in a note Wednesday. “It comes as other key producers, like Libya, have also seen exports 'evaporate' amid rising unrest. Iraqi oil is an important swing factor. The south of the country is not beyond the geographic reach of extremist groups seeking to foment civil unrest.”
U.K.-based oil drillers doing work in Iraq are watching the situation in the north unfold but don’t have any plans to pull crews from the country, according to the Telegraph.
Iran has the second-largest oil reserves in the world, while Iraq’s under-developed gas reserves could double with proper exploration, Luay Al-Khatteeb, visiting fellow at Brookings Doha Center, which provides policy analysis on the Middle East for Brookings Institution, noted last month.
Though Iran and Iraq could supply the world market with more affordable oil and gas, they “have been hamstrung by political barriers, be they international economic sanctions or the need to combat domestic political instability and terrorism,” Al-Khatteeb said.
Despite Iran and Iraq’s pledges to increase production, OPEC has agreed to leave its total production target of 30 million barrels a day for the year, the Nigerian oil minister announced Wednesday after the cartel’s meeting in Vienna. The conference of oil ministers representing 12 member countries noted that world oil demand is forecasted to rise from 90 million barrels a day in 2013 to 91.1 million barrels a day this year, while non-OPEC supply is expected to grow by 1.4 million barrels a day this year if OPEC supplies remain near its 30 million barrels-a-day ceiling.

1181,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 11, 2014 02:15PM ET</span>",Duke Energy's Coal Ash Agreement Too Narrow: Advocates,"By Maria Gallucci - Duke Energy Corporation's (NYSE:DUK) recent agreement to clean up a toxic coal ash spill in North Carolina and Virginia doesn’t do enough to address questions about the utility’s broader coal-related pollution problems, clean water advocates say.
Duke, the nation’s largest power company, signed an agreement on Monday with environmental and wildlife officials from both states requiring the utility to pay any “reasonable” cost associated with a Feb. 2 sludge spill at its power plant near Eden, N.C., the Associated Press reported. The accident sent coal ash, a byproduct of coal generation, floating down 70 miles of the Dan River, which also flows into Virginia. The agreement also requires Duke to foot the bill for continued monitoring by government agencies of the spill’s impact on the area's aquatic ecosystem.
But it doesn’t shed any light on what steps Duke might take to prevent future coal ash spills or to address current groundwater contamination at its other coal facilities in North Carolina. “There’s still the possibility that North Carolinians will be on the hook for the remainder of the cleanup,” Amy Adams, the North Carolina coordinator at Appalachian Voices, told International Business Times.
Duke operates 33 ash dumps at 14 power plants across the state, which, together, contain more than 100 million tons of the byproduct. All of the facilities are located near rivers and lakes that supply towns with drinking water and all of Duke’s unlined waste pits are contaminating groundwater, according to state environmental officials. Coal ash, which looks like a thick gray sludge, contains toxic heavy metals like arsenic, mercury and lead.
The utility said it spent $15 million to contain the Dan River spill and its immediate damages, and it told investors in an SEC filing that it doesn’t expect the remaining cleanup expenses to be large, the Charlotte Business Journal noted. But Duke said it could cost up to $10 billion to change the way it stores and processes coal waste at all of its North Carolina facilities, an expense Duke could pass on to its electricity customers. Regulators are still assessing how coal ash is stored at the 14 plants -- five of which received violation notices this spring for failing to secure storm water permits.
The agreement also leaves questions about where Duke will store all the coal ash it intends to remove from its other facilities, John Runkle, an attorney at NC WARN, a Durham, N.C.-based climate advocacy group, said. “We’re very concerned about any plans for the ultimate storage of that [waste],” he said. “We want to make sure that we’re not just passing the problem on.”
Advocates said they were, however, generally encouraged by Duke’s cleanup agreement, largely because it continues to loop federal agencies like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Environmental Protection Agency into the response efforts. The utility and its state regulator, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), have both come under intense scrutiny after the Dan River spill raised concerns over their allegedly chummy ties. Just weeks after the accident, federal prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into DENR's relationship with Duke regarding its coal ash dumps.
“It gives at least some level of comfort that we’re not just dealing with the same two entities that created this situation,” Adams said. She added that agencies “are going to be looking at more than just the removal of the ash. They’ll be taking a much more holistic approach. [The agreement] is a good move for the health of the river.”

Jeff Brooks, a spokesman for Duke Energy, said the agreement is “a positive step forward that will provide benefits to the Dan River basin.” In response to advocates’ concerns that the agreement leaves questions unanswered, he explained that it was never intended to address them.
“It doesn’t encompass any action that will take place at our other facilities or encompass how the other coal ash basins will be managed,” Brooks said. “It’s tied to assessing any damages along the [Dan] River and developing a cooperative plan for trying to remediate that.”
He added that Duke is taking a “scientific, deliberate approach” to evaluating its next steps for each of its coal ash facilities in North Carolina.
Peter Harrison, a staff attorney at the Waterkeeper Alliance, said that Monday’s agreement “is a good start, but we’ll have to see where it goes. I think there’s still cause for skepticism” given the utility’s recent string of coal ash violations.
He noted that a separate coal ash decision was also reached this week. A federal court ruled that conservation groups represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center could proceed with their lawsuit against Duke, which accuses the utility of violating the Clean Water Act and polluting Sutton Lake, a public fishery near Wilmington, N.C. The law center commissioned a study last year of the lake’s fish that found deformities consistent with elevated levels of selenium, a toxic element in coal ash.

1194,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 10, 2014 02:30PM ET</span>",US Energy Production Met 84% Of Demand In 2013,"By Meagan Clark - The U.S. produced enough energy last year to meet 84 percent of the country’s demand, supported largely by natural gas production, according to a recent monthly report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).
Natural gas, coal, oil and other fossil fuels accounted for 82 percent of the energy consumed nationally, with natural gas the largest domestic energy resource produced and consumed for the third year in a row, according to the report.
Renewable energy met 10 percent of energy needs, and nuclear power accounted for 8 percent. Late last year, President Obama called on his administration to use renewable energy to supply 20 percent of its needs by 2020.

The portion of energy consumption supplied by domestic production has been increasing since 2005, when it hit a low of 65 percent, according to the report. Since then, technological advances that help drillers produce from hard-to-reach resources have increased production of energy resources domestically, especially natural gas and crude oil. Over the same time period, reduced road travel, improved vehicle mileage and competition among fuels for electricity generation, have limited consumption of coal and oil.
The last time the ratio of domestic production to consumption increased significantly was from 1978 to 1982, when oil consumption declined in response to higher prices and changing policies and production of oil in Alaska and coal nationally increased.

1197,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 10, 2014 11:00AM ET</span>","Gas Boom Will Spread To China, Report Says","By Meagan Clark - The Golden Age of natural gas that North America is experiencing will expand to include China over the next five years as Chinese gas demand is expected to nearly double by 2019, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in an annual report on Tuesday.
The energy watchdog predicts that Chinese gas demand will compensate for a slight slowdown in growth in many other areas of the world, and it expects global gas demand to rise by 2.2 percent a year by the end of 2019, a decline of .2 percent compared with the 2.4 percent growth forecast in last year’s report.
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) will meet much of the demand, particularly through private operators in Australia, Canada and the U.S. The IEA expected the LNG trade to grow by 40 percent through 2019 to reach 450 billion cubic meters (about 15.8 trillion cubic feet), with half of all new LNG exports coming from Australia and 8 percent of the global LNG trade coming from North America.
""While demand growth is driven by the Asia-Pacific region and especially China, supply growth for the international gas trade is dominated by private investments in LNG in Australia and North America,” IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven said in a statement.
China’s power, industrial and transport sectors will lift gas demand to 315 billion cubic meters (about 11.1 trillion cubic feet) in 2019, an increase of 90 percent over the period, the IEA’s report said. Chinese production is expected to grow by 65 percent to 193 billion cubic meters (about 6.8 trillion cubic feet) through 2019 from 2013.
Air quality concerns in China have prompted the government to adopt tough plans to reduce pollution, and natural gas, which emits less carbon than coal, is emerging as part of the solution.

A potential problem for LNG is that high prices could dampen demand and encourage increased coal use, van der Hoeven said.
""Looking ahead, unless we see timely investment in new production and LNG facilities and the reversal of the recent cost inflation of LNG, only a very strong climate policy commitment could redirect Asia’s coal investment wave to gas,” she said.
The IEA also predicts that Europe won’t diversify its gas supplies significantly, and that European gas consumption won’t recover from a 2010 peak over the next five years because power demand is weak and government support for renewable energy is strong.

1209,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 09, 2014 03:15PM ET</span>",North American Shale Oil Boom Key Challenge At OPEC Meeting,"By Meagan Clark - With the North American crude oil production boom likely to be a major topic of discussion for OPEC ministers when they meet this week in Vienna, the cartel is not expected to raise production, especially because prices remain generally stable.
If prices rise from the current $100 to $110 a barrel, falling demand would be a concern. On the other hand, falling prices would approach OPEC members’ marginal cost of production. The crude oil production oil cartel, which controls about 40 percent of global oil supplies, has imposed a 30 million barrel-per-day production ceiling for all 12 members’ output for the last two years.

“In our view, the tone will be more worrisome than the December meeting,” Chad Mabry, analyst at MLV & Co., said. “OPEC members are quite comfortable with current oil prices. Not only have prices remained elevated, but there has been very little volatility… this is a sweet spot.”
Though surging production from the U.S. shale boom was one of OPEC’s concerns six months ago, global demand for oil is also rising, leaving some demand for OPEC to fill with its supply.
Estimates of North American oil supply have increased to 18.5 million barrels a day from 18.2 million six months ago, driven by U.S. production at 11.4 million barrels a day, Mabry said.
In mid-May the International Energy Agency (IEA), an energy watchdog for the world’s most industrialized nations, forecast global oil demand for this year at 92.8 million barrels a day, up 1.3 million barrels a day from its April report and 2.2 million barrels a day from its May 2013 report.
IEA estimated global supplies in May were at 92.1 million barrels a day, leaving a window of about 700,000 barrels a day that OPEC could fill. It’s about the amount of oil Libya produced last year and only half the country’s capacity.
Strikes, protests and conflicts between factions in Libya are disrupting production, lowering OPEC’s overall production and pressuring OPEC’s largest exporter Saudi Arabia to produce more.
Meanwhile, if Western nations lift oil sanctions against Iran imposed for its nuclear program, Iran would likely boost production and try to outpace Iraq, currently OPEC’s No. 2 producer behind Saudi Arabia.
According to a May Platts survey of OPEC and oil industry officials and analysts, OPEC members plan to stick with their 30 million barrel-a-day quota, leaving North American production to meet higher global demand.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas for delivery in July hit a session high of $4.736 per million British thermal units, the most since May 8, before trimming gains to settle at $4.710 by close of trade, up 0.19%, or 0.9 cents.

Nymex natural gas prices rallied 3.56%, or 16.0 cents on the week, the second consecutive weekly advance.
Updated weather-forecasting models called for above-normal temperatures to settle in across most parts of the lower 48 U.S. states during the next 11-to-15 days.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
Prices received additional support amid expectations that a U.S. government proposal to cut greenhouse emissions will boost demand for the fuel.
The Environmental Protection Agency said it was preparing measures that would weigh heavily on U.S. coal-fired generating plants, which would make the U.S. grow increasingly dependent on natural gas to make up the difference.

1224,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 06, 2014 01:56PM ET</span>",Brazil Scrambling For Natural Gas As Drought Threatens Power Output ,"By Greg Morcroft - Brazil’s drought has caused problems for coffee growers and folks charged with keeping up the nation’s hydroelectric plants, but it has been good for the sellers of natural gas and the commodity’s price in Brazil has jumped sharply ahead of the World Cup as the country builds supplies to make up for lost output from dams.

Brazil’s preparations for the World Cup, which starts next week, have come under criticism for failure to complete an adequate infrastructure concerning everything form airports to sports stadiums.
Even the nation’s electric grid has come in for criticism, but that may not be entirely the country’s fault.

According to Platt Energy Economist, a publication of the energy news provider Platt’s:
“Brazil has been hit by severe drought and has been scrambling to find additional supplies of gas to compensate for the lack of hydropower. Imports of LNG to Brazil reached a record in March at 692,051 mt, up 75 percent from the previous 12-month moving average. The country has also signed a short-term deal to increase pipeline supplies from Bolivia.”

To get that gas, Brazil has had to buy in the market that has traditionally fueled Asian markets and that’s driving up the price around the world.
Again, according to Platt’s:
“To secure spot cargoes, Brazil’s Petrobras must offer prices sufficient to attract them away from the Asia-Pacific market, where spot prices in February for March delivery breached $20/MMBtu. It would be an exaggeration to attribute price moves in Asia-Pacific spot LNG markets solely to South American purchases; spot sales are only a small proportion of total LNG sales. But South American importers relying on spot markets rather than long-term contracts can have a disproportionate impact on spot prices when forced to enter the market.”

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas for delivery in July shed 0.59%, or 2.8 cents, to trade at $4.613 per million British thermal units during U.S. morning hours. Futures traded at $4.663 prior to the release of the supply data.

Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.

In its weekly report on domestic oil supplies, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles fell 3.4 million barrels in the week ended May 30, a nominally bullish figure given expectations and reports of a much smaller decline.
Analysts expected stockpiles to fall for the week, and the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group that conducts its own survey of crude inventories, reported late Tuesday that inventories declined by 1.4 million barrels.
But the decline was largely due to a reduction in imports, and the report also contained bearish news for refined products, with demand falling and inventories rising for gasoline and distillates, which include heating oil and diesel. Falling gasoline demand was bearish since summer driving season is underway.

1243,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 04, 2014 12:30PM ET</span>",Brazilian Drought Means Fewer Beans For Global Coffee Producers ,"By Kathleen Caulderwood - Ipanema Coffees, supplier to Starbucks Corp. (NASDAQ:SBUX), said it expects a 40 percent drop in crop yields after an historic drought in Brazil.
Brazil is the world’s largest coffee producer, responsible for about a third of the global supply. But a three-month drought has left farmers scrambling to recover supplies, and bean prices rising. Brazilian officials say that the weather problems are over, but not everyone is as optimistic.
On Monday, Brazil’s Agriculture Minister Neri Geller said that farmers should expect a better harvest next year, following the worst dry spell in 50 years.
“It’s a mistake to suppose that coming rains will solve the problems we’ve had,” Washington Rodrigues, CEO of Brazil-based Ipanema, said last week, according to Bloomberg. “Once vegetative growth is lose, you don’t recover it.""
Typically, farmers are able to harvest about 110 pounds of green beans from 220 pounds of cherries picked from a tree. But the recent lack of water means farmers were only getting about 66 pounds from the same amount of cherries, according to the BBC.
Coffee prices have surged 54 percent this year, and analysts expect that demand will be 11.3 million bags above actual output this year.
But the price of a Starbucks latte isn’t at risk. The company typically plans coffee purchases months out, and has already locked in prices for the rest of the year and a large portion for 2015, according to its most recent quarterly report.
But other companies are feeling the pinch. J.M. Smucker Co. (NYSE:SJM), which makes Folgers and Dunkin’ Donuts coffee, said earlier this week its bean prices increased by an average of nine percent. In April, Nestle SA (VTX:NESN) predicted a 1 percent increase in costs as well.
“There is a lot of risk being bearish about Brazil at the moment,” one leading trader told the Financial Times.

1249,By International Business Times,"<span>Jun 03, 2014 10:45AM ET</span>",Uganda To Award Oil Exploration Licenses in 2015,"By Meagan Clark - Uganda plans to award new oil and gas exploration licenses next year, ending an eight-year halt in licensing, the Petroleum Exploration and Production Department said Tuesday.
The Ugandan government plans to license more than a dozen oil blocks, including at least four big discoveries, in an open bidding process, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Seventy-six of 88 oil exploration and appraisal wells drilled in the country have hit oil, bringing estimated reserves to at least 3.5 billion barrels of crude from 500 million barrels in 2007 and attracting international oil companies to Uganda. The new licensing round planned in the second half of 2015, is expected to attract major international oil companies.

Uganda stopped issuing oil exploration licenses in 2007 in an effort to give the country time to develop regulations to ensure that Ugandans would benefit , according to government officials. Shortly after the licensing ban, oil exploration companies discovered commercial oil reserves.
Less than 40 percent of the country's oil region has been explored, analysts estimate, wih corruption and political interference hampering development. Despite receiving 10 applications in the past two years, Uganda has only issued one oil production license, for $2 billion, to China's state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp.Uganda's lawmakers have passed two oil bills and are finishing a final bill to regulate their oil industry.
According to a report issued Tuesday by the International Energy Agency (IEA), meeting the world’s growing need for energy will require more than $48 trillion in investment from now through 2035, and this will require countries to maintain credible policy frameworks.
“Policy makers face increasingly complex choices as they try to achieve progress towards energy security, competitiveness and environmental goals,” IEA Chief Economist Fatih Birol said in a statement. “These goals won’t be achieved without mobilizing private investors and capital, but if governments change the rules of the game in unpredictable ways, it becomes very difficult for investors to play.”
Western donors and investors have redirected about $118 million from Uganda since the country's president Yoweri Museveni signed a law in February toughening rules against homosexuality. According to the Ugandan finance minister in May, the country's foreign direct investment in 2012-2013 totaled $1.5 billion, double that of 2008-2009.
Analysts forecast that current discoveries in Uganda can produce a peak of 200,000 barrels-a-day over a 30-year period, roughly the amount of oil stolen daily in Nigeria.

  The Journal said a draft rule is expected to be released Monday by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, beginning a process that is to be completed in a year. States, each of which will have different reduction targets, will have until next June to submit compliance plans.
  The EPA, which has the power to regulate emissions under the Clean Air Act, plans to require a national average reduction of 25 percent by 2020 and 30 percent by 2030, sources told the Journal.

  Coal-fired power plants are expected to be hit hardest by the rule.
  The rule is the result of congressional failure to adopt a comprehensive climate-change policy, the Washington Post noted. Current rules all but prohibit construction of new coal-fired power stations and the new EPA rule is expected to force existing plants to install new technologies to reduce emissions.
  Daniel J. Weiss of the Center for American Progress told USA Today the rule could ""achieve the biggest carbon pollution reductions ever undertaken by the United States. No president has ever proposed a climate pollution cleanup this big.""

1329,By International Business Times,"<span>May 23, 2014 03:00PM ET</span>","Slightly Lower Gas Prices Not Likely To Cause Driving Boom Over Memorial Weekend, Experts Say","By Meagan Clark - Memorial Day is the traditional kickoff to the nation's summer driving season, and travelers will be happy to know that gasoline prices this year are actually a bit lower from last year. Still, experts say that the relatively low gas prices compared to recent years aren't likely to drive a surge in road trips, though U.S. highways are seeing slightly more traffic.
“We went through about 60 years in which driving increased steadily and rapidly,” he said. “Since 2004, that has not been happening.”
That means American driving habits changed years before the economic recession, though economic factors like fewer people joining the labor force, which largely drives, have also played a role.
“For whatever reason, Americans seem to be less enamoured of driving,” Phineas Baxandall, senior policy analyst for U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), said. “I don’t see anything that’s really turning back the clock to the old driving boom. Where [the number of miles driven] will land will depend on how high gas prices will be in the summer.”
It’s the ninth year in a row for such decreases in miles driven, “unprecedented” in modern U.S. history, according to Tony Dutzik, senior policy analyst at the environmental think tank Frontier Group.
The U.S. average price for regular gasoline is $3.67 heading into Memorial Day weekend, a fraction lower than this time last year and 4 cents below late April's high for the year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).
The average gas price is a nickel per gallon less than the traditional start of summer driving season in 2012 and 21 cents per gallon less than in 2011, according to AAA's fuel gauge report.
Gas prices increased 42 cents per gallon from early February to late April but have fallen modestly in recent weeks as more refinery crude oil was processed and more imports added supplies to the market.
According to a March survey by AAA, high gas prices may no longer be fueling a decline in driving. Only about half of U.S. adults are basing their driving behavior on gas prices, 15 percent less than the same time last year, the survey found.
The trend of falling car mileage is the strongest among young people. The average 16 to 34-year old drove 23 percent fewer miles in 2009 than the average person in the same age group in 2001, according to a study authored in part by Dutzik and Baxandall. They found that young Americans are also increasingly foregoing a driver’s license. From 2000 to 2010, the portion of 14 to 34-year-olds without a driver’s license increased from 21 percent to 26 percent.
Instead, young people are riding public rail and buses. Between 2001 and 2009, 16 to 34-year-olds travelled 40 percent more miles on public transit, according to PIRG and Frontier.
“What we expect to happen is that driving may increase or decrease on a year to year level, but the average driving we expect to either level out or decline over time,” Dutzik said.
A similar study published last summer by Michael Sivak of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute backed the conclusions of Frontier and PIRG.
“Recent studies have shown that—per person, per driver, and per household—we now have fewer light-duty vehicles, we drive each of them less, and we consume less fuel than in the past,” Sivak wrote in a January 2014 update to his research. “These trends suggest that motorization in the U.S. might have reached a peak several years ago.”
Prices are the highest in California, averaging $4.16 per gallon on Monday, and lowest on the Gulf Coast, averaging $3.44 per gallon on Monday. Strict regulations on gasoline in California push prices higher there, and the Gulf Coast’s relatively small demand coupled with its huge refining capacity, about half the country’s total, keeps prices lower in that region.

The national average is expected to remain below last year’s peak price of $3.79 per gallon in late February, though prices may increase a bit from a rise in demand outpacing supply increases and reported increases in retail demand due to the warmer weather.
Last week, drivers in 35 states saw a modest discount at gas pumps. Iowa led with a 6-cent drop, followed by California (4 cents), and Nebraska, Florida, Maine and Alabama (3 cents). That trend didn’t hit Alaska, Idaho and Utah, where prices increased by 14 cents, 22 cents and 26 cents, respectively.
Drivers in 30 states are paying significantly less per gallon compared to a year ago, especially those in the Midwest. Minnesotans saw a 78-cent decrease in prices from a year ago, followed by North Dakota (64-cent drop), Nebraska and Iowa (55-cent drop) and Oklahoma (50-cent drop). Refinery issues in the region last year caused price spikes.
The remaining 20 states and Washington, D.C. saw price increases, with the largest in Pennsylvania (29 cents), South Carolina and Alabama (22 cents) and North Carolina (20 cents).
In May, the EIA forecasted retail gas prices would average $3.61 per gallon over the April to September period, 3 cents higher than last year, but falling to $3.51 per gallon in September.
Gasoline demand increased 1.1 percent in 2013, the largest annual increase since 2006, according to EIA. In 2013, Americans drove about 0.6 percent more miles on U.S. highways compared to 2012, according to the Federal Highway Administration.
Mileage increases in the West and Southeast countered decreases in the Northeast and middle of the country.The growth is a bit slower than the 0.7 percent rate of population growth in the U.S. over the same time period, indicating Americans still are driving fewer miles per person.

1334,By International Business Times,"<span>May 23, 2014 07:00AM ET</span>",India's Gold Imports To Rise With Newly Relaxed Norms,"By Sneha Shankar - India’s gold imports are most likely to increase after the Reserve Bank of India, or RBI, on Wednesday relaxed norms for importing gold for select trading companies.
Inbound shipments are expected to increase by 10 metric tons to 15 metric tons a month, after the central bank allowed some major trading companies to import gold under what is called the 20:80 rule, and allowed banks to issue metal loans to jewelers. An import duty of 10 percent will continue to be levied by the RBI, which will require the companies to pass on 20 percent of the imported bullion to jewelers for exports. Last year, the RBI had imposed restrictions on gold imports to rein in the country’s current account deficit.

“Supply will increase, bringing down the prices and premiums in the local markets and we will see demand improving,” Bachhraj Bamalwa, a director with the All India Gems & Jewellery Trade Federation, said according to Bloomberg, adding that, in the next 15 days, the fees that jewelers currently pay to banks and dealers will fall to between $40 to $50 an ounce over the London cash price from the current $90.
Although importers sell off 80 percent of the imported gold in the domestic market, the companies have to export 20 percent of the imports before they can submit another import order.
“The jewelry companies will benefit as their working capital will be better, interest costs will be reduced, and their liquidity levels will improve,” Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at JRG Wealth Management, told Bloomberg, adding: “Slowly people will return to gold as a form of investment as we see further easing in curbs.”
The World Gold Council expects demand for gold from India to increase to nearly 1,000 tons in 2014 compared to 974.8 tons last year, according to Bloomberg, even as shipments in the first quarter of the year fell to 129 tons while demand fell 26 percent over the same period last year.

1342,By Investing.com,"<span>May 22, 2014 10:52AM ET</span>",Natural gas futures extend losses after bearish storage data,"Investing.com - Natural gas futures extended losses on Thursday, after data showed that U.S. natural gas supplies rose more than expected last week.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas for delivery in June tumbled 2.05%, or 9.1 cents to trade at $4.382 per million British thermal units during U.S. morning hours. Futures traded at $4.450 prior to the release of the supply data.
Prices fell to a session low of $4.372 per million British thermal units earlier, the weakest since May 15. Natural gas ended Wednesday’s session down 1.74%, or 7.9 cents to settle at $4.473.
Futures were likely to find support at $4.289 per million British thermal units, the low from May 15 and resistance at $4.575, the high from May 21.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended May 16 rose by 106 billion cubic feet, above forecasts for an increase of 102 billion cubic feet.
The five-year average change for the week is a build of 90 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.266 trillion cubic feet. Stocks were 774 billion cubic feet less than last year at this time and 943 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 2.209 trillion cubic feet for this time of year.
The report showed that in the East Region, stocks were 449 billion cubic feet below the five-year average, following net injections of 65 billion cubic feet.
Stocks in the Producing Region were 379 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 892 billion cubic feet after a net injection of 29 billion cubic feet.
Producers would need to add 2.6 trillion to 2.9 trillion cubic feet to storage by November 1 to meet typical winter demand, analysts said.
Meanwhile, updated weather forecasting models called for mild springtime temperatures over much of the Midwest and Northeast, which was likely to lower heating demand.
Spring and fall see the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.

1352,By International Business Times,"<span>May 21, 2014 09:00PM ET</span>",Ukraine Crisis Makes Europe Turn To Mexican Gas,"By Patricia Rey Mallén - MEXICO CITY -- The crisis in Ukraine may create an opportunity for Mexico.
Because the European Union depends on Russia for almost a quarter of the gas it needs, the instability is fueling Europe’s desire to find other possible suppliers.
Mexico, with an estimated 540 trillion cubic feet reserve of shale gas, can be the solution.
Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel García-Margallo, visiting Mexico City this week, said Spain could act as a bridge between Latin America and the rest of the EU.
Spanish companies, which can process up to 100 billion cubic feet a year, could take part in the explorations and transport the gas to Europe, García-Margallo said. “Spain only uses 31 billion cubic feet a year. That extra capacity could be used to bring Mexican gas to Europe.”
His proposal coincides with Mexico’s energy reform, an attempt to open the country’s resources to private and foreign investment. Mexico’s rumored gas reserves are offshore -- and unreachable because state-owned oil company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) has outdated equipment and $60 billion in debt. Partnerships with private and foreign companies would provide the funds needed to access those reserves.
The reform, approved by the Mexican Senate in April, will open the way for Mexico to become a world exporter of gas -- and it would allow for the country to stop importing a resource that it already has. Mexico imported 1.6 billion cubic feet from the U.S. in 2012, up 24 percent from the previous year.
“It is ironic that Mexico, having the resources it has, has to import gas from the U.S.,” said President Enrique Peña Nieto in the presentation of the energy reform. The first partnership between Pemex and foreign companies is expected to be signed later this year.

The EU uses 16.1 trillion cubic feet of gas a year, according to numbers from non-profit Eurogas. Including non-EU nations like Norway, Turkey, Switzerland, Serbia and Bosnia, consumption goes up to 18.3 trillion cubic feet.
As much as 16 percent of the total amount of gas consumed in Europe passed through Ukraine’s pipeline network, based on data reported by Gazprom and Eastern Bloc Energy.
The crisis in Crimea has not compromised this gas gateway -- so far -- but it has raised concerns in Europe over the reliability of its energy suppliers.
“This is a key geostrategic moment,” said García-Margallo.

1355,By International Business Times,"<span>May 21, 2014 03:15PM ET</span>",Your Caffeine Addiction Is Killing Central America's Economy,"By Patricia Rey Mallén - MEXICO CITY -- It starts with a tiny yellow spot, but it quickly turns a field of coffee crops into a mess of dead leaves. Known as ""coffee rust,"" the plague that has slashed production in Central America to its lowest level in half a decade, will not only jolt the price of a cup of coffee but is also likely to devastate the workforce of the region and increase migration of undocumented workers into the U.S.
Since 2012, when the fungus called roya in Spanish was first observed, it has spread to half of the coffee plantations from Guatemala to Panama. Total production has dropped 20 percent since 2011, and losses total more than $1 billion. The plague is threatening more than 500,000 jobs in a region where coffee represents 13.5 percent of exports and provides a livelihood, directly and indirectly, to 5 million people -- 10 percent of the region's population.

The U.S. government has provided $14 million in aid to help combat the fungus, partnering with Texas researchers to find a solution.
“If the problem persists, employment and stability in the region could be compromised,” Mark Feierstein, administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which is distributing the aid, said. “It could affect migration patterns and prompt an increase of immigration to the U.S.”
Between 2011 and 2013, an estimated 255,000 people have lost their jobs. USAID predicts that coffee production could fall between 15 and 40 percent in the next two years.
The rust has ruined crops from Mexico to Peru, but it has hit the hardest in the following Central American countries.

Gold rose on safe-haven demand from investors avoiding equities as investors jumped to the sidelines to digest comments from U.S. monetary authorities.
Charles Plosser, the head of the Federal Reserve's Bank of Philadelphia, said earlier that the Fed should consider winding down its monthly bond-purchasing program quicker than its current pace to ensure than inflationary pressures remain in comfort zones, while rate hikes should follow soon afterwards.
""My own view is that, as we continue to move closer to our 2 percent inflation goal and the labor market improves, we must be prepared to adjust policy appropriately. That may well require us to begin raising interest rates sooner rather than later,"" Plosser said in prepared remarks of a speech he delivered in Washington earlier.
Separately, William Dudley, head of the New York Fed, said rates will raise after the Fed winds down stimulus programs though hikes will come gradually.
""My current thinking is that the pace of tightening will probably be relatively slow. This depends, however, in large part, not only on the economy’s performance, but also on how financial conditions respond to tightening,"" Dudley said in prepared remarks of a speech he delivered before the New York Association for Business Economics earlier.
""If the response of financial conditions to tightening is very mild—say similar to how the bond and equity markets have responded to the tapering of asset purchases since last December—this might encourage a somewhat faster pace. In contrast, if bond yields were to move sharply higher, as was the case last spring, then a more cautious approach might be warranted.""
Gains were limited, as consensus exists that Fed stimulus tools that have supported gold for years are on their way out, with the timing of rate hikes serving as the main uncertainty.

Prosecutors and inspectors probing the incident have reportedly obtained data from the mine, indicating that sensors registered high toxic-gas levels inside the mine two days before the May 13 accident, which is believed to be the worst mining disaster in Turkey's history, local media reports said, adding that company officials did not keep a record of toxicity inside the mine, which is now a crime scene.
According to prosecutors, two more people have been arrested for the deadly incident in the western town of Soma, raising the total number of arrests to five. The arrested officials, including executives and supervisors at mine owner Soma Komur Isletmeleri A.S., will face charges of negligent death in relation to the accident, Associated Press, or AP, reported, citing Turkish news reports Tuesday.

Authorities initially detained 25 people as part of the probe, but several were released without charges filed against them while eight were released but could be summoned in the future for further interrogations. Many others, including Can Gurkan, the company's CEO, are still being questioned by authorities, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported.
Miners who survived the disaster also told AP that the company’s supervisors ignored rising gas levels and failed to take adequate measures, but government and mining officials have said that negligence could not be a factor in the fire as the mine was inspected regularly and that safety standards were high.

1387,By International Business Times,"<span>May 19, 2014 10:15AM ET</span>","As EU Looks For Alternatives To Russian Gas, Turkey Vacillates Between East And West","By Victor Kotsev ISTANBUL -- As European leaders cast a wary eye at Russia, fretting that Moscow may soon squeeze the flows of energy heading their way as a tactic in its conflict with Ukraine, Turkey is increasingly seen as a vital alternative source.
A simple look at the map makes the point. A southern land-bridge straddling Europe and Asia, Turkey sits directly between the vast oil fields of the Middle East and the voracious industrial energy markets of Germany, France and Italy.
Yet just as Europe eyes Turkey as a potential means of reducing its dependence on Russian energy, fresh geopolitical developments have Turkey reevaluating its relationships with Europe and Russia. Though Turkey has sought entrance into the European Union, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has cracked down on dissenters opposing his rule and revealed an affinity with Russian President Vladimir Putin, himself a skilled practitioner in the dark arts of maintaining rule through force. The latter could make Turkey more circumspect about its relationship with the West, and more likely to side with Russia than Europe in evolving hostilities.
“Turkey would like to see itself as a bridge between Russia and the West,” said Talip Kucukcan, the director of foreign policy research at the Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research in Istanbul. “Turkish decision-makers are no longer 100 percent following Western principles or principles that have been put forward by other countries. Turkey would like to see its own policy.”
Critics in Turkey claim that Erdogan admires Russian President Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian and socially conservative style and seeks to replicate it both at home and abroad. “There are similarities between Putin and Erdogan which have resulted in good personal relations between them,” said Dimitar Bechev, a senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. “While it is extreme to say that Erdogan is a copy of Putin, as some people do, the fact is that they have good personal rapport.”
Erdogan is also cognizant that his energy assets are more strategically valuable than ever -- a realization he has parlayed into lucrative deal-making with Russia.
Though Turkey imports some 90 percent of the oil and gas it uses, it holds potential as an export source due to the possible disruption of Russian natural gas deliveries to several European Union members, which could take place as early as next month. Moscow has threatened to tighten deliveries to Ukraine starting in June if Kiev doesn’t start paying its $3.5 billion gas bill, and, “It seems unlikely that the arrears will be paid in full by the end of May,” said Laurent Ruseckas, a senior Eurasian oil and gas expert at London-based IHS, a global information company. “If Russia stops deliveries to Ukraine, it is likely that the Ukrainians would take out some gas from deliveries to the West anyway, and that would mean a reduction of flows.”

Like Europe, Turkey would be directly affected by such a crisis, because it imports some of its gas through Ukraine, though it is in a far better position than its European neighbors, having cultivated both alternative routes from Russia and alternative sources including Azerbaijan, Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan. As a result, Turkey could increase its exports to the EU despite the fact that it imports the majority of its own oil and gas.
Turkey and Russia have recently signed several important energy deals, including for expanding the capacity of the Blue Stream gas pipeline under the Black Sea, and Turkey has even suggested that it would allow Russia to build the proposed South Stream, a controversial pipeline designed to bypass Ukraine, on its own territory if the European Union blocks the project.
Still, Russia is sanguine about Turkey’s potential for influencing its energy leverage over Europe.
Experts say the Kremlin is particularly concerned about the so-called Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline (TANAP), which is scheduled to start carrying gas from Azerbaijan to Turkey in 2018 — and, soon afterward, via extensions, onward to Europe. “Russia is very worried by the TANAP pipeline,” said Victor Mizin, the vice president of the Center for Strategic Assessments in Moscow. “They see it as an anti-Russian ploy that is in competition with South Stream.”

As currently planned, TANAP is a fairly modest venture, designed to carry about a quarter of the gas that South Stream would, and much of that would stay in Turkey. But the rivalry could intensify if abundant sources such as Iran’s become available to join the project, said William Hale, a professor emeritus of Turkish and Middle Eastern politics at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London who lives in Istanbul.
“While Azerbaijan doesn’t have the amounts of gas that Europe needs, Iran has the world’s second biggest natural gas reserves after Russia,” Hale said. “The Europeans could replace Russian gas with Iranian gas — or maybe even a combination of Iranian gas and Iraqi gas.”
That alternative would require a settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue and the lifting of sanctions on the country (as well as international investments in the underdeveloped Iranian gas fields), which is where Russia could easily interfere. “The Russians have got every interest in supporting the hardliners in Iran to prevent the deal over the nuclear program,” Hale said.
Ruseckas estimated the nuclear deal is “more likely than not” to go through but said the distances involved would make Iranian gas expensive and unattractive to Europe.

Known as roya in Spanish, it is a yellow and orange leaf rust that has hit fields from Mexico to Peru over the past two years. If the fungus continues to infect coffee plants, it could reduce production and continue to raise prices of Latin American coffee beans, threatening the livelihoods of about 500,000 farmers in the coffee industry, the U.S. Agency for International Development said in a statement on Sunday.
""The current coffee rust outbreak is the worst in Latin America's history,"" the agency said. “It is estimated that production will fall by as much as 15-40 percent in the coming years.”
Central America’s arabica coffee plants that produce high-quality beans used in espressos and specialty blends have been especially affected.
Besides roya, a drought in Brazil is cutting arabica production, which in turn has boosted prices.

Struggling coffee workers could turn to the illegal drug trade and associated violence in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, USAID spokesman Matthew Herrick said.
On Monday, USAID will launch a $5 million partnership with Texas A&M University’s World Coffee Research center in a bid to wipe out the troublesome fungus.
The program is part of the Obama administration’s Feed the Future initiative, a global antipoverty effort that USAID says has reached 7 million small farmers and 12.5 million children. The new program will bring the agency’s total investment in the fight against coffee rust to $14 million.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier that Ukraine was “as close to civil war as you can get” and urged all sides to find a solution, which sent gold prices higher on fears skirmishes in the country will escalate.
The dollar often weakens as the Ukraine crisis heats up on concerns that Washington will slap more and tougher sanctions on Russia, which could slow recovery, as many U.S. businesses depend on Europe for growth.
Gold and the dollar tend to trade inversely with one another.
Elsewhere, a rebounding euro took the steam out of the dollar, which also supported gold.
Expectations for the European Central Bank to loosen policy next month have largely been priced into trading, which gave the euro room to rise and the dollar to stand down, often a recipe for higher gold prices.
Reuters reported earlier that the ECB is preparing a “package of measures” including cuts to all interest rates, with negative rates on bank deposits to encourage lending to small and medium-sized businesses to spur recovery.
A day earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported the German central bank Bundesbank would back monetary easing measures, including a negative rate on bank deposits and purchases of packaged bank loans, if such tools were needed to keep persistently low levels of inflation from becoming entrenched in the euro zone.

1419,By International Business Times,"<span>May 14, 2014 03:30PM ET</span>",Poor Working Conditions Continue To Plague Coal-Producing Developing Countries ,"By Meagan Clark - Coal miners around the globe are facing increasing pressure to feed emerging markets’ energy demands, and combined with widely diverging regulations internationally and the low cost of compensating accident victims in poor countries, disasters are taking place like this week’s Turkish mine explosion that’s killed more than 200 miners.
The death toll in Turkey is still rising, with hundreds believed to be trapped underground, and will likely be the country’s deadliest mining disaster, despite safety ""measures taken as part of the highest and most sustained inspection process,” the mine’s owner said in a statement.
Several nations are making efforts to tighten controls and reduce the unavoidably dangerous industry, but they are still struggling with the lingering issues related to former practices and modern efforts to cut costs and boost production.
“Successful efforts are mostly concentrated in more developed countries, such as those in Europe. As such, it would take some time for these ideas and initiatives to take root in developing Asian countries and for these initiatives to accommodate to the varying circumstances specific to Asia,” according to a report from the Center for Non-Traditional Security Studies.
Poor working conditions in coal-producing countries like China, Turkey, South Africa, Indonesia and Colombia have made coal mining responsible for more deaths than any other industrial sector.
Even in the U.S., slack safety issues are a recurring problem. The mine that collapsed in West Virginia had “chronic compliance issues” and several citations from inspectors.
Though it’s dangerous to mine and is a major polluter, coal supports 40 percent of the world’s electricity, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). In the developing world, coal production is increasing, as coal-fired power plants are relatively cheap to build.
Utilities in Japan and Germany, which have cut back coal production, are now returning to it in part to replace nuclear generation deemed too dangerous following Japan’s Fukushima plant disaster.
In the U.S, coal production has increased 62 percent since 1970, while deaths have decreased by 92 percent, according to the National Mining Association, a trade group. Since 2011, coal production in the U.S. has been decreasing slightly, due to the availability of cheap and cleaner-burning natural gas and federal pollution-control regulations.
“I do not believe that U.S. miners are systematically cutting corners on safety” because the “downside is too great,” Lucas Pipes, managing director of equity research for Brean Capital, said.
Jerald Fletcher, director of the National Resource Analysis Center (NRAC), agrees. “It doesn’t matter which companies you go to, every one of their meetings start with safety,” he said. “That’s partly because of shareholder pressure but partly because of economics-- it’s very expensive to have people get hurt,"" he said.
That sentiment is reflected in a recent study from Ventyx showing that international mining executives are focusing on the problem. According to that poll, worker safety is a higher priority than maximizing production.
""Our research shows the mining industry remains cautious about the strength of global economic recovery. In response, many mining organizations have begun looking inward, especially in regard to the labor market. In doing so, they have shifted their focus from finding qualified workers anywhere, at any cost, to ensuring the workforce they currently have is efficient, well-informed and safe,"" Bas Mutsaers, senior vice president of Mining Industry Solutions at Ventyx, wrote in the report completed in 2012.
In the developing world, China has greatly improved its mining safety in recent years, Fletcher said.
Still, accidents happen, particularly in developing countries, where the cheap source of energy can spur economic development and is growing in demand.
Turkish mines were responsible for 164 deaths from 1994 to 2003, according to the Oxford Journal for Occupational Medicine. In 1992, 263 miners died in a gas explosion in Zonguldak.

Energy demand in Turkey is poised to grow the fastest among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. IEA forecasts that Turkey’s energy use will double over the next decade.
Delays in new legislation in less developed countries also has a direct impact on mine safety.
According to the Center for Nontraditional Security Studies, miners themselves resisted the closure of several mines in China in the late 1990s because there were no legal ways for the miners to seek damages for death or injuries and no way to be sure of finding other employment.
“For instance, in China, the compensation for injury and death at the workplace which was set in 1996 is too low to support affected miners and their families. In Indonesia, statutes and regulations which have been codified are not implemented effectively,with a significant time lag between when laws are made at the national level and when they are translated into action at the provincial and local levels,” the Center’s report said.
Weak national authority also plagues the mining industry in many parts of the developing world. and corrupt local authorities often maintain the lion’s share of real power and negate central governments’ attempts to protect workers.
“The irony is that while the process of decentralisation in Indonesia since 2001 provided a means of forcing mining companies to engage directly with local communities through consultations with and through local governments, it would not be surprising to see local governments not taking account of the communities’ interests (Cesare and Maxwell, 2003:49). Instances of corruption are still rampant, as observed in Kalimantan,where a recent report by JATAM (an Indonesian network of workers’ rights advocacy groups) identified local government officials who are said to be corrupt,” the Center for Non-Traditional Security Studies report concluded.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in June traded at $4.386 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, down 1.09%. The commodity hit session high of $4.547 and a low of $4.468.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.222 per million British thermal units, the low from April 2, and resistance at $4.825, last Wednesday's high.
Updated weather forecasting models continued to for seasonably mild weather over much of the Midwest and Northeast for the next two weeks, which was likely to lower heating demand.
Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
Mild springtime temperatures weren't forecast to rise high enough to hike demand for air conditioning, which would require power generators to burn more natural gas to meet demand.
Elsewhere, investors braced for bearish supply data.
Last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ending May 2 rose by 74 billion cubic feet, above forecasts for an increase of 71 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.055 trillion cubic feet, an 11-year low.
Early injection estimates for this week’s storage data range from 80 billion cubic feet to 100 billion cubic feet. The five-year average change for the week is a build of 82 billion cubic feet.
Producers would need to add 2.6 trillion to 2.9 trillion cubic feet to storage by November 1 to meet typical winter demand, analysts said.

Updated weather forecasting models called for seasonably mild weather over much of the Midwest and Northeast through May 21, which was likely to lower heating demand.
Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
Mild springtime temperatures weren't forecast to rise high enough to hike demand for air conditioning, which would require power generators to burn more natural gas to meet demand.
Elsewhere, investors braced for repeat bearish supply data.
Last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ending May 2 rose by 74 billion cubic feet, above forecasts for an increase of 71 billion cubic feet.
The numbers sent prices falling, as investors were betting that a recent cool snap would have hiked demand on expectations for demand for heating to rise.
The five-year average change for the week is a build of 58 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 1.055 trillion cubic feet. Stocks were 797 billion cubic feet less than last year at this time and 982 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 2.037 trillion cubic feet for this time of year.

The five-year average change for the week is a build of 72 billion cubic feet.
The government report showed a bigger-than-expected storage build for the third week in a row, helping to ease worries about tight inventories.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at an 11-year low of 1.055 trillion cubic feet as of last week. Stocks were 797 billion cubic feet less than last year at this time and 982 billion cubic feet below the five-year average of 2.037 trillion cubic feet for this time of year.
Producers would need to add 2.6 trillion to 2.9 trillion cubic feet to storage by November 1 to meet typical winter demand, analysts said.
Meanwhile, updated weather forecasting models called for warmer-than-average weather over much of the Midwest and Northeast, as well as the South, which was likely to lower heating demand.
Spring and fall see the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.

1465,By International Business Times,"<span>May 09, 2014 04:50PM ET</span>",Natural Gas Boom Attracting Manufacturing To US From Overseas,"By Meagan Clark - In the wake of the American shale gas boom and the cheaper power that has resulted from that boom, U.S. manufacturers have been moving their work back home from overseas, and now foreign manufacturers, especially from Europe, are moving their facilities to the U.S.
While prices in the U.S. power market have fallen due to cheap natural gas, prices in Europe’s power market are much higher, lifted by subsidies for renewable wind and solar power projects. European utilities have been decommissioning thousands of gigawatts from turbines in an effort to minimize losses.

One of the latest examples of a European company moving manufacturing to the U.S. is Germany’s Siemens AG (XETRA:SIEGn), which supplies equipment to companies that extract and ship natural gas, converts the fuel into power and uses electricity on a large scale for manufacturing.
""Even though we have already missed a few opportunities, especially in unconventional oil-and-gas exploration, we still have excellent market-entry opportunities, especially in North America,"" Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser said at a news conference on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, Kaeser named former Royal Dutch Shell PLC (LON:RDSB) strategy head and American Lisa Davis as the new chief of the power business for Siemens. She will work from the U.S, a first for Munich-based Siemens, the Wall Street Journal reported. Siemens competes with Conneticut-based General Electric Company (NYSE:GE).
Germany’s BASF SE (XETRA:BASFN), the world’s largest chemical company, announced this month it was considering building a $1.4 billion plant in the U.S. to convert natural gas into propylene, used in many petrochemicals.
Austria-based steelmaker Voestalpine AG (VIE:VOES) announced plans last year to invest more than $760 million in a Texas plant, motivated by inexpensive shale gas.
While a decade ago, American manufacturing jobs were flowing to China, this year, more than 50 percent of $1 billion-plus U.S. companies with operations in China are considering moving all or part of their production back home, according to Boston Consulting Group. For example, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) plans to move about $50 billion in manufacturing to the U.S.
According to the National Association of Manufacturers, the exodus is due to high Chinese energy prices compared to America’s, escalating wages in China, lack of protection for intellectual property, air pollution and land prices.

The European Central Bank this week left interest rates unchanged at 0.25%, though the euro dropped after ECB President Mario Draghi said the bank's governing council is comfortable with acting at its next meeting after the bank publishes fresh inflation and growth forecasts.
Draghi attributed weak inflation rates to food and energy prices, but added that the strong euro and weak domestic demand are also pushing down inflation.
He reiterated that the ECB does not have a target for the euro exchange rate but stressed that the bank would closely monitor exchange-rate developments.
Market talk that fresh easing measures or rate cuts softened the euro and boosted the dollar, which capped gold's gains because the precious metal tends to trade inversely with the greenback.

The company said in a regulatory filing that the SEC's Fort Worth regional office advised the company last month that it had concluded its investigation and did not intend to recommend enforcement action. (r.reuters.com/guk29v)
The SEC began its investigation in May 2012.
McClendon, who co-founded Chesapeake in 1989, left the company in April last year after clashing over spending with the company's board and a series of Reuters investigations led to civil and criminal probes on the company.
The company's shares touched their highest since October 2011 after it posted better-than-expected quarterly profit and hiked its production forecast earlier on Wednesday.
Since leaving Chesapeake, McClendon has raised nearly $4 billion in cash and financing to invest in North American shale formations.
He has also filed to raise up to $2 billion to buy and drill oil and gas properties within the United States through a partnership called American Energy Capital Partners LP.

1489,By International Business Times,"<span>May 07, 2014 07:15PM ET</span>","Libyan Rebels Reject Talks With PM, Keep Oil Ports Shut","By Reuters BENGHAZI/TRIPOLI, Libya - Rebels occupying major oil ports in eastern Libya said on Wednesday they would boycott Prime Minister Ahmed Maiteeq and keep two major export terminals shut for now, a blow to efforts to restore vital oil exports.              
The rebels even warned they would take action if Tripoli did not fulfill its part of a recent agreement to reopen the oil ports, a veiled threat to close the terminals again.              
""Nothing has been implemented,"" said Abd-Rabbo al-Barassi, self-declared prime minister of the rebel movement.              
He accused the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists in parliament of undermining the agreement and trying to take over the ports. The struggle over energy wealth is part of growing turmoil in the North African country three years after the overthrow of dictator Muammar Gaddafi.              
Maiteeq's predecessor, Abdullah al-Thinni, reached an agreement with the rebels to reopen four of the ports, although only the smaller facilities, Hariga and Zueitina, have been handed over to government forces.
Both sides agreed to hold further talks over the larger Ras Lanuf and Es Sider exports terminals.              
Barassi said the rebels would not deal with Maiteeq, claiming he had not come to power legally. The businessman was sworn in on Sunday after a chaotic election in parliament that was disputed by many deputies.
Mr. Abdullah al-Thinni needs to explain or appoint someone to say why there is this delay and why the agreement has not been implemented,"" Barassi told a rebel television station.              
If the government did implement the deal, then the rebels might take unspecific ""measures."" Barassi did not elaborate, but rebel spokesman Ali al-Hasi said this would mean asking tribal elders whether the reopened ports should be closed again.              
Barassi said more talks about ""new conditions"" were needed to reopen the Ras Lanuf and Es Sider ports. He did not say what these conditions would entail, but top leader Ibrahim Jathran said the group wanted a federal system sharing power and oil wealth between the regions, an impossible demand on the weak central government.              
There was no immediate comment from Tripoli, which has struggled to assert authority over a country awash in arms and rival militias, some of which have seized oil ports and fields to make political and financial demands.              
DEFICIT              
Their actions have cut oil output to 250,000 barrels a day from 1.4 million bpd last summer, eroding public finances that are almost entirely dependent on crude exports.              
Parliament has failed to approve a budget for this year.              
Libya will post a budget deficit of 10 billion Libyan dinars ($8 billion) because oil revenues will reach only 34.7 billion dinars, said Mohammed Ali Abdullah, head of the parliamentary budget committee.              
However, the deficit might be much higher because the draft, which comes to a vote on Sunday, assumes annual oil production of 800,000 bpd and an oil price of $100 a barrel, an unlikely goal if the Ras Lanuf or Es Sider ports remain shut.              
Total expenditures will be 59 billion dinars, mainly for public salaries and subsidies, Abdullah said.              
He did not say how the deficit would be funded. The central bank had foreign reserves worth $115 billion at the end of February. Oil exports are also the only source of funding for annual imports of $30 billion. In another sign of turmoil, most air traffic at Benghazi airport came to a halt for hours after a fight among ground staff.              
The two main local carriers, Libyan and Afriqiyah Airlines, suspended operations after a member of the ground staff tried to smuggle two Chadians without travel documents onto a flight, airport officials said. 
The employee scuffled with a colleague who tried to stop him, a source at ground handling firm al-Shorooq said.              
And in Tripoli, gunmen beat up the chairman of one of the biggest state cellphone operators to demand that the company open an office in their town, a company source said. Staff plan to strike on Thursday, he added.

1492,By International Business Times,"<span>May 07, 2014 01:00PM ET</span>","Turkey Has Coal, China Has Cash","By Sophie Song - Soon, it may be easier to ask where China has not gone in search of energy than where it has gone. The world’s second-largest economy is in talks to invest $10 billion to $12 billion in a Turkish coalfield.
The potential deal involves the Afsin-Elbistan region, which holds up to 45 percent of Turkey’s so-called brown coal reserves, also known as lignite, in southern Turkey, the South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday.
""This is a big project,"" Taner Yildiz, Turkey's energy minister, said. ""We have to set up the Afsin-Elbistan field project correctly. We have a big store of information. We are working with China on this.""
The project also includes the construction of an 8,000-megawatt coal-fired power plant.
A deal with Abu Dhabi National Energy on the same project was signed in January 2013, but Turkey has begun talks with other companies due to investment delays.
Turkey is interested in making the most of its coal resources to cut natural gas imports and is likely to bolster the importance of brown coal in power generation as demand grows with the country’s expanding economy.
Yildiz said it’s not possible to say when any deal with China will be concluded, according to the South China Morning Post.
China has gone to the North Pole and back lately in its search for energy. On a recent trip to Central Asia, President Xi Jinping committed to several multibillion-dollar oil and gas projects in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.

Most recently, there were reports of Chinese buyers being interested in a Norwegian fjord that has gone on sale, which would give China access to as much as 20 million tons of coal reserve, in addition to a launching pad for future Arctic explorations.
The world’s second-largest economy has also agreed to invest $27 billion in a liquid natural gas project with Novatek, Russia’s second largest natural gas producer.

1521,By International Business Times,"<span>May 05, 2014 02:49AM ET</span>",12 Dead In Colombia Gold Mine Collapse ,"By Jeff Perlah - More bodies have been pulled from a collapsed illegal gold mine in southwestern Colombia, bringing the number of confirmed deaths to 12, the Associated Press reported. Four miners are still missing but presumed dead.
Rescue workers on Sunday dug through about 65 feet (about 20 meters) of heavy debris to reach victims of the rock fall that occurred Wednesday night in Santander de Quilichao, a rural town in southwestern Cauca province, according to reports.
""The search continues with dogs and the rescue personnel to find the site where could be more victims,"" said Captain Victor Claros, commander of the Santander de Quilichao's fire and rescue brigade, Reuters reported on Saturday.
Attempts to close the mine had failed due to angry reactions from workers and those who control the site, the news agency added.
In Colombia, mining accidents are common, especially at illegal mines where conditions are precarious, like the one that collapsed Wednesday, according to the AP.
After efforts to shut down the mine were unsuccessful, Mayor Eduardo Grijalba asked Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos to help put an end to illegal mining, the AP reported.            
Much of Colombia's gold output comes from illegal mines, many of which are controlled by leftist guerrillas who have been fighting the government for five decades and are located in areas where criminal gangs thrive.
Colombia's Mines and Energy Ministry said there had been 30 fatalities linked to illegal mining activity this year, Reuters noted.
Wednesday's tragedy follows an accident a week ago in which four people died after inhaling toxic gases at an artisanal mine in the western province of Antioquia, the news agency added.

1522,By International Business Times,"<span>May 05, 2014 02:49AM ET</span>","After Oil Train Accidents, Increased Scrutiny","By Meagan Clark - When an oil train derailed and caught fire in Lynchburg, Virginia, on Wednesday afternoon, City Manager Kimball Payne was as surprised as any of the town’s 77,000 residents; he had no idea that crude oil was being moved through town on a regular basis.
The accident, in which three tank cars tumbled into the James River, spilling 20,000 to 25,000 gallons of crude, was just the latest in a series of fiery oil train accidents around the country, which have sparked debate about the safety of freight rail and raised concerns among residents often unaware of the oil, gas and chemicals being transported through their communities.
As crude-by-rail has increased across the country in recent years, increasing 443 percent nationwide between 2005 and 2012, accidents have been on the rise. In the past year, eight explosive accidents, some fatal, have rocked communities from Alabama to North Dakota. Last year, an accident in Quebec caused 47 deaths and the evacuation of more than 2,000 people.
Those accidents are prompting federal regulators to propose, as soon as next week, standards for rail tank cars carrying oil, announced Department of Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.
Community right-to-know laws dating from 1986 require facilities to disclose what hazardous chemicals are stored and used in a town, but the laws don’t extend to trains. By federal law, railroad and oil companies don’t have to disclose their exact freight contents or when and how much of their freight will pass through localities.
“Our community has a right to know what's going on,” Bart Mihailovich, director of the Riverkeepers program at the nonprofit Center for Justice in Spokane, Washington, said. “What trains are traveling through Spokane and the inland northwest, what's in them, and how dangerous are they? We have a right to know about emergency response plans and the risks we're assuming by living, working and playing in this area.”

Payne, Lynchburg’s city manager, has lived in the area for 13 years and said he didn’t know trains were carrying oil through the bustling downtown district until the derailment this week.
“But I don’t know what’s on the tractor trucks going through the city every day either,” Payne said. “What would we do if we did know?”
“If anything’s going to be changed, it’s going to have to be changed at the federal level or maybe the state level. I know I have no authority over those railroads.”
The mayor of Casselton, North Dakota, where an oil train crash on Dec. 30 spilled 400,000 gallons of crude and forced the evacuation of residents, estimates that seven or eight trains a day, most carrying oil, pass through the rural town everyday. Edward McConnell remembers the city council had concerns over chlorine riding the rails several years ago. While training the fire department, the town spoke with the state and federal transportation departments about the contents and amounts of freight passing through.
“Their basic answer was when we have an accident, you’ll know what’s in the cars by the placard,” he said. Red diamond-shaped placards with the numbers 1267 designate crude, though not what type of crude, which could indicate how flammable or explosive it is.
“It would be nice to know [more details of the cars’ contents], but I don’t think it’s something that’s going to get much traction,” McConnell said. “Railroads have a lot of friends in Congress, and they’re not going to let too many bills through that [the railroads] don’t want. I’ve been dealing with railroads a lot of years -- you can go up against them but at the end of the day they pretty much get what they want.”
Activist Matt Landon has decided the only way to know what’s passing through his neighborhood in Vancouver, Washington, is to track it himself. In April, he organized a group of seven volunteers to count how many oil trains are passing by Vancouver Bluff and, with infrared cameras, to monitor hydrocarbon gas venting out of the tank cars, a phenomenon called burping or off gassing. He hopes his efforts over time will force the government to increase regulation on the rail and oil industries.
“We have to protect our community,” he said. “It’s even hard for first responders to have access to this information. The U.S. government is deciding not to protect our communities so we have to stand up.”

1523,By International Business Times,"<span>May 05, 2014 02:49AM ET</span>",Why China Wants To Buy Part Of Norway,"By Sophie Song - After a decade of looking westward to Central Asia to secure access to energy supplies, China is shifting its gaze to the north, where it may buy a piece of land from Norway to gain access to the region’s rich resources and convenient shipping lanes.
China may not be the only entity interested in purchasing the land, a fjord that's roughly three times the size of Hong Kong, in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, which was recently put up for sale by the Norwegian government, the South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday. The privately owned fjord, still undeveloped, could potentially have 20 million tons of coal reserves.
“Arctic hydrocarbons constitute the final frontier of oil and gas development,” Emily Stromquist, an energy expert with the Eurasia Group, a political and economic risk consultancy, told International Business Times. “China’s rapidly growing energy demand, coupled with interests in more efficient Arctic shipping routes, have driven Chinese companies to seek new Arctic energy projects.”
But more important than potential coal reserves, simply owning the Svalbard property could give China, or any non-Arctic state, a platform for launching long-term Arctic exploration operations, as well as a permanent foothold in the region, said Willy Østreng, vice-president of the Norwegian Academy of Polar Research and a former director of the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, according to the South China Morning Post.
China's bid, if it it occurs, would not be unprecedented. In 2011, A Chinese property tycoon, Huang Nubo, tried to buy an even larger plot of land in Iceland in 2011, but his $200 million bid was blocked over Iceland's concerns that too much of the island would be in foreign hands. The China National Offshore Oil Corporation, a major state-owned enterprise, has also partnered with Iceland’s Eykon Energy firm to explore for energy resources off Iceland’s southeast coast, according to the Diplomat.
China is not alone in its drive to enter the resource-rich region, which contains more than 20 percent of the undiscovered global hydrocarbon reserves. Among the eight member-states of the Arctic Council, Russia is a key stakeholder in the region, as the Russian Arctic has been responsible for about 10 to 15 percent of Russia's gross domestic product, or GDP, and 25 percent of its foreign exports. The European Union nations, where 25 percent of all Arctic oil and gas is destined, and the U.S., have also emerged as major players in the region, according to a paper from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.

China has expanded its operations in all directions around the globe in recent years to secure the energy supplies needed to fuel its rapid industrialization and growth. Chinese companies have invested heavily in foreign energy projects, including Sinopec’s investments in Canada and the North Sea, CNOOC’s acquisition of Nexen, and a Chinese-backed pipeline from Myanmar.
“Chinese state-owned companies have loomed large in auction processes for a number of years, particularly in the energy sector, and their success has resulted in considerable international expansion,” Darren Spalding, the energy partner at the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani, told IBTimes.
In recent years, many of China's energy and resource investments were made in Central Asia. On a recent tour of the region, President Xi Jinping signed a number of significant energy deals, including one that will increase China's gas supply from Turkmenistan by 25 billion cubic meters annually. Another investment in the region gave China an 8.33 percent stake, which amounts to $30 billion, in an oil project in Kazakhstan, and another one secured nearly $15 billion worth of oil, gas and uranium projects from Uzbekistan, according to the Huffington Post.

Capping gains, however, were ongoing anticipations for Libya to increase exports.
Libyan government officials and rebels reached an agreement to re-open oil ports in recent weeks, and expectations for crude to begin flowing sent investors bracing for increased global supply.

1570,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 29, 2014 08:00AM ET</span>",New Proposed Tank Car Rules For Railroads Headed To White House For Review ,"By Meagan Clark - Energy companies and the firms that make thre rail cars carrying the flow of crude oil and other products from America's shale boom are separated by a mere 1/8 of an inch.
That's the added thickness in the walls of the steel railcars that the manufactures say is need to bring them up to modern standards. The oil and gas indudtry argues that the current 7/16 of anch trhickness is adequate.
The debate is important because the U.S. is currently hammering out guidelines that will eventually set the new national standards for transpoting hazardous cargo by rail.
The standards for tank cars have made national headlines after several fiery derailments of trains carrying crude, some near homes.
After several congressional hearings  the Department of Transportation (DOT) is expected to propose a new set of rules this week for White House review, including “options for enhancing tank car standards,” Anthony Foxx, transportation secretary, blogged on Thursday.
The current regulation DOT-111 has been the federal standard for oil-by-rail shipping for more than a decade, and nearly all parties involved in the trade agree it needs updating  Some officials claim the crude from the Bakken Shale formation in Wyoming and North Dakota is more volatile and dangerous than other domestic crude oil.
Rail operators, oil producers and tank car manufacturers have argued without resolve for months on what the best dimensions would be to transport crude.

Industry representative The American Petroleum Institute claims that the current a 7/16th inch thick steel frame is adequate for crude shipments, while the Association of American Railroads (AAR), lead representative of the rail industry, proposes a thicker 9/16th inch frame.
The thicker tank not only would cost the companies to buy but also holds less crude which adds to shipping costs.
A 7/16th inch model called the CPC-1232 has been a voluntary industry standard since 2011, and factories have sold many of the tank cars in recent years to transport crude. AAR introduced the standard after several DOT-111 derailments, but now recommends phasing out or retrofitting the older models for a minimum 9/16th inch-thick tank.
AAR estimates its proposal would phase out or retrofit about 92,000 cars built since 2011 that meet the current standard. Retrofitting the whole existing fleet of current-stanrd cars carrying flammable liquids would more than $3 billion, according to the rail group.
The White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs will review the DOT’s proposal. The turnaround usually takes about three months, but could take longer since the regulation in dispute is controversial and costly.
Once the rules are final, rail companies will have to decide whether to upgrade their existing fleet or wait for tanks to be built to the new standard.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in June traded at $4.776 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, up 0.37%. The commodity hit session high of $4.802 and a low of $4. 746.
The June contract settled up 0.91% on Tuesday to end at $4.758 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.696 per million British thermal units, Tuesday's low, and resistance at $5.207, the high from Feb. 24.
Portions of the Midwest and eastern regions of the U.S. should see cool temperatures run through the end of April, which should hike demand for heating.
The forecasts also raised ongoing concerns over whether natural gas producers will be able to refill inventories before the next heating season.
U.S. natural gas stockpiles are near 11-year lows after due to a rough winter, and the first two storage increases of the season have been far smaller than expected. Producers typically replenish inventories between April and October, when demand is lower.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
Last week the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that natural gas stockpiles in the week ended April 11 stood at 850 billion cubic feet. Analysts have estimated that inventories will need to rise to approximately 3.1 trillion cubic feet by November 1.

1619,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 23, 2014 02:00PM ET</span>",Fair Trade Gold Q&A – An Ethical And Political Niche,"By Nat Rudarakanchana - Canada’s Fair Trade Jewellery Company produced the above internal infographic in late 2013. It illustrates gold’s route from informal artisanal miners in South America to the company’s small North American clientele.     
Fairtrade gold now comes from certified mining groups in Bolivia, Colombia and Peru, bearing a black logo certifying origin. Fairtrade International plans to expand its sourcing to marginalized miners in Africa, including some in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, potentially by the end of 2015.

We spoke to Fair Trade Jewellery Company CEO Robin Ghambir over the phone on the niche market for fair trade gold. His Toronto firm isn’t affiliated with the UK-based Fairtrade gold scheme, but became the first North American jeweller to enlist under that global scheme in 2011.
Q: Has emphasizing ethical gold boosted your sales? What’s the market like now?
A: Not quite. You might think that being one of the first, you’d be taking wheelbarrows of cash to a bank. But what you need to make this a success is more people carrying fair trade gold. Jewelry is local, and people don’t want to buy it online. Very few are actually willing to make the long travels from the U.S. to Toronto.
This will work and be successful when there’s at least one store in every market that carries fair trade certified products. We are trying to start that by wholesaling our line to other jewelers…Fairtrade gold isn’t really available in the U.S. We’re starting to look at selling to other retailers there. There’s nothing for them right now. They have customers coming in, but they don’t have sustainable products. They don’t have an answer to that question.
We are basically pioneering this product in the market. But I think this is an urban coastal market. So, mostly West Coast and East Coast. In the middle of the U.S. and outside of urban centers in Canada, I don’t think there’s a market for this.
Q: Who are the U.S. retailers interested in fair trade gold? Why isn’t such gold widely available in the U.S.?
A: They’d be independent retailers, not the larger jewelry companies or chains. The biggest challenge in this area is training staff. To work with our clients, I have to know how ore is mined, if it’s alluvial or hard rock mining. I have to know the difference. I have to know how the ore is processed, with cyanide versus mercury…I’m pretty sure that some chains cannot sell this product, because they wouldn’t invest in the necessary training.
For a commodity to be Fairtrade certified, the local Fairtrade body has to adopt it. When Fairtrade gold launched in 2011 [in the UK], the Fairtrade office in the USA did not opt to carry gold. Consequently, such gold just wasn’t available. Fair Trade USA later left the international Fairtrade system, so now they’re doing it on their own, not under the unified international body or the logo everybody recognizes.
Fair Trade USA still hasn’t done gold, and gold is a complicated product. They’re used to doing coca, coffee, bananas. With gold, the process is quite different. With leaving the Fairtrade system, they probably have enough to do right now, aside from gold.
Q: Who are your customers?
A: People seeking out this product are called ‘deep green’. They already know the issues and they ask tough questions about origins. If you can’t answer those tough questions, you are not real to them. They see it as “greenwashing” [deceptive marketing about the environmental friendliness of products].
There are essentially “deep greens” versus “light greens”. Light greens are people who look for certifications and want the stuff, but are not necessarily political. They just want to feel good about their purchase.
But some people [i.e. deep greens] want to feel political about it, too. That’s fine because we’re a value-based company…For example, some people who like the recycled gold we offer are against mining. They do not like mining; they don’t like extractive processes. Other people just want Fairtrade.
Right now the demand is coming from women. I’ve heard from guys who’ve been told, based on their girlfriend’s values: “I don’t care what you get me, but you have to get fair trade jewellery.” …Guys, basically and wisely, do what they’re told. So that’s kind of interesting.
Men who want this product are generally involved in some way in fair trade. Or they’re professionals in the jewellery environment…We do really well with engineers – there’s this very tight relationship between engineers and fair trade.
Q: Does anyone ever complain about the little black Fairtrade stamp on the gold?
A: Oh no, not at all. That’s a positive feature. I spoke to somebody who does estate and historical jewellery. She told me that this jewellery, bearing such a stamp, will later have historical value.
We are the first jeweller in North America, still only one of two, that has [official] Fairtrade gold. These are what are called signed pieces. They come from a recognized house with provenance. It’s the first time that metals have had documented provenance. Combine those with [ethical] Canadian diamonds and it’s the most ethical product you can buy.
Q: Fair trade gold creates more jobs per kilo of gold, according to your infographic, even though the supply chain is much shorter. How does that work?
A: It’s because they don’t use the same heavy machinery for extraction. There’s a lot more hand labor in fair trade gold, and so it provides more employment. You could look at it in two ways – look at it as less efficient, or as supporting communities, employing more people to extract the same amount of gold.
Q: Isn’t fair trade gold a mere fraction of the wider gold market?
A: Absolutely. These are early days for fair trade metals. It’s very early days in this industry…Notably, there is fair trade platinum, but there’s very little of it, and we don’t have any demand for it.
We are much, much smaller than the companies we compete against, like Tiffany & Co. NYSE:TIF, Cartier SA, or Birks Group Inc (AMEX:BGI). That’s the level of the industry that we operate against, since we only work in 18-carat gold and platinum.
[…]
Awareness within the industry is very low right now. We don’t want to put this product in somebody’s stores if they don’t know how to sell it. You can’t just shove it in the showcase.
You need somebody who’s passionate about the issues, who can explain it. They don’t have to be political about the issues, but have to understand them at an intellectual level.
We’re still struggling for trying to find something that explains the complexities in a easy to understand way…We want to put this product out there, and we are willing to make no money on some products in order to build the business.

UPDATED: Greg Valerio, a UK activist who manages the Fairtrade gold scheme, told International Business Times that some of the 11 African pilot mines could be ready for certification by mid-2015. African artisanal miners will meet with major U.S. and European jewellery retailers in Tanzania next week, he added.
“We’re starting the process of international commercial integration, and that’s very significant,” Valerio told IBTimes. Little direct interaction between jewellery companies and small-scale miners made easy exports a problem during Fairtrade gold’s 2011 launch from South American miners, he said.
A reasonable starting figure for Fairtrade gold in the U.S., which isn’t now officially available, could be 50 kilos, according to Valerio. Gold traded at $1284 per ounce in New York on Wednesday, so 50 kilos amounts to $2.06 million of Fairtrade gold at that price.
“The American market will be the single biggest market for fair trade gold in the world,” said Valerio. “On that, I have no doubt. The American consumer is the biggest consumer of retail jewellery in the world by a long way, of finished jewellery products, gold and diamonds.”

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in June traded at $4.738 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, up 0.49%. The commodity hit session high of $4.760 and a low of $4.696.

Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.487 per million British thermal units, Thursday's low, and resistance at $4.798, Monday's high.
Portions of the Midwest and eastern regions of the U.S. should see cool temperatures run through the end of April, which should hike demand for heating.
The forecasts also raised ongoing concerns over whether natural gas producers will be able to refill inventories before the next heating season.
U.S. natural gas stockpiles are near 11-year lows after due to a rough winter, and the first two storage increases of the season have been far smaller than expected. Producers typically replenish inventories between April and October, when demand is lower.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
Last week the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that natural gas stockpiles in the week ended April 11 stood at 850 billion cubic feet. Analysts have estimated that inventories will need to rise to approximately 3.1 trillion cubic feet by November 1.

1638,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 21, 2014 09:30AM ET</span>",Ukrainian Gas Middlemen May Play A Smaller Role In Pricing Dispute,"By Meagan Clark - Billionaire Ukrainian businessman Dmytro Firtash was unheard of by most Americans until the conflict between Russia and Ukraine erupted, highlighting the two counties’ important natural gas trade and the shadowy characters that keep its pipelines flowing. But as he and other middlemen have come under more public scrutiny in recent months, they may lost the political capital to negotiate deals.
Firtash, one of the first of a growing group of Ukrainian and Russian businessmen to face western sanctions triggered by the conflict, has made a fortune and a career as a middleman in the trade between Russian energy monopoly Gazprom and Ukrainian state energy company Naftogaz and other Ukrainian clients, according to New York Times reports. According to the Times, Firtash has made billions of dollars in recent years by buying fuel at reduced prices from Gazprom and reselling it with price markups. In 2006, when Gazprom and Ukraine’s post-Orange Revolution government disputed fuel prices, they agreed to trade through an anonymous middleman, Firtash. Gazprom did not release his name for months after signing the contract.

“The middleman was there for one purpose, to grab some money and grease the operation of this political-industrial machine,” Ken McCallion, a lawyer representing former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko against Firtash, told the Times. 
Tymoshenko’s suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleges that Firtash used profits from the Gazprom deal to prop up pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. It also charges that Firtash used Manhattan real estate deals to launder those profits and provided money to an American political adviser to former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.  Firtash’s New York real estate fund was established with the help of Paul J. Manafort, a Republican who advised Yanukovych on his 2010 campaign in Ukraine. In 2008, Firtash’s fund agreed to buy the former Drake Hotel on Park Avenue for $885 million, the Times reported.
In a separate criminal case, federal prosecutors in Chicago have accused Firtash of bribing government officials in India after transferring money through American banks.
Gas middlemen who negotiate deals between suppliers and buyers are common in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and essential to the region’s politics, experts say. However, with the tension rising in Russia’s conflict with Ukraine and a shooting war a real possibility, these shadowy figures may find it harder to operate.
For example, one 27-year-old billionaire gas trader in Ukraine was unknown until the Ukrainian edition of Forbes Magazine wrote about him, the New York Times reported.  Serhiy Kurchenko bought Ukrainian Forbes last summer and hired a new editor. He’s now wanted in Ukraine for evading customs duties and seems to have mysteriously disappeared.
Another former gas middleman and the prime minister of Ukraine in the mid-1990s, Pavlo Lazarenko, bought the actor Eddie Murphy’s Southern Californian home for $6 million before serving time in a U.S. prison for money laundering.

Gold slipped after Asian equities markets pushed higher overnight, as dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen supported gains on Wall Street. Rising stock prices could weigh on gold, which is often seen as an alternative investment.
In a speech in New York, Ms. Yellen said monetary policy will need to remain accommodative for some time, citing slackness in the labor market and low inflation.
She added that the central bank expects the U.S. unemployment rate to fall back between 5.2% and 5.6% by the end of 2016. The U.S. unemployment rate currently stands at 6.7%.

The Federal Reserve will keep benchmark interest rates low even as the economy improves to ensure sustained recovery, with ideal conditions not seen for another two years, Yellen said earlier.
Monetary authorities hope to see the unemployment rate at the end of 2016 reaching 5.2-5.6% and inflation at 1.7-2%, Yellen said.
""If this forecast was to become reality, the economy would be approaching what my colleagues and I view as maximum employment and price stability for the first time in nearly a decade. I find this baseline outlook quite plausible,"" Yellen said in prepared remarks in a speech she delivered at the Economic Club of New York.
Loose monetary policies tend to weaken the dollar, making gold an attractive hedge.
In the meantime, markets should pay close attention to inflation and unemployment rates, as hiccups can serve as weather vanes when it comes to monetary policy and how long interest rates remain low.
""The larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from their respective objectives, and the slower the projected progress toward those objectives, the longer the current target range for the federal funds rate is likely to be maintained,"" Yellen said.

1653,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 16, 2014 06:00PM ET</span>",Angola Moves Into Oil's Big Leagues,"By Meagan Clark - After decades of sporadic growth and political turmoil, Angola is on the verge of catapulting to the top ranks of the world’s energy economy following major deep-water production investments by several top global oil companies.
On Monday, France’s Total NYSE:TOT announced that it planned to proceed with a $16 billion ultra-deep-water project 160 miles off Angola’s northern coast to begin production in 2013. About 185 pipelines located 6,200 feet beneath the ocean will connect 59 wells in six oil fields. Advances in drilling technology have enabled primarily large oil companies to produce oil and gas from reserves 4,000 to 5,000 feet underwater, an impossible task a mere generation ago.
Better known for its four decades-long civil war during the last century,  the former Portuguese colony and now third-largest African economy, just behind Nigeria and South Africa, is touting optimistic production forecasts of 2 million barrels per day, or roughly 3 percent of world crude production in coming years.
That could drive the south-western African country from its 2012 ranking as the world’s 15th largest oil producer all the way to No. 3,  ahead of Algeria, which produced 1.9 million barrels per day in that year. Angola pumped 1.8 million barrels a day in 2012, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer, ranked 11th in the world and produced 2.5 million barrels per day in 2012, while the world’s top oil producers Russia, Saudi Arabia and the U.S., produced more than 10 million barrels per day.
“With plans for frequent licensing rounds, including onshore and deep water rounds for 2014 and 2015, we expect Angola to retain its position as major destination for investment within the industry,” according to a December MarketResearch.com report. “That said, regulatory changes and political risks remain trends given their potential to slow the busy pace of activity offshore.”
Total accounted for 600,000 barrels a day production in 2013, a third of the country’s production that year, according to the company, and has a 30 percent stake in Kaombo. Angolan national oil company Sonangol has 30 percent, Chinese-Angolan joint venture Sonangol Sinopec International holds 20 percent, Esso Exploration & Production Angola Ltd. and Portuguese company Galp Energia (GALP.LS) round out the partnership with 15 percent and 5 percent stakes, respectively. Angola exports 46 percent of its crude to China, according to EIA.
Total has 60 years of operating experience in Angola, which has 9.06 billion barrels in crude oil reserves according to OPEC, and Africa is already Total’s highest -producing region. The country was Total’s fifth-largest producer last year, behind Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates, Norway and Russia. It expects Kaombo will eventually produce a 230,000 barrel per day mix of light and heavy crudes, or about 13 percent of Angolan output.
U.S. oil giants ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX), as well as the UK’s BP (NYSE: BP) and Angolan Sonangol operate other offshore oil projects in the country while Peru’s PlusPetrol and private Angolan-owned Somoil operate two different onshore projects. The American firm Marathon Oil (NYSE: MRO), Italy’s Eni (NYSE: ENI) and Brazilian firm Petrobras (NYSE: PBR) each own various stakes in projects there as well.
Chevron, which drilled its first well in Angola more than 50 years ago, told investors last week to expect lower first-quarter earnings this year compared to the fourth quarter due to foreign exchange losses and struggling assets, but Angola’s LNG production, which began exporting to Brazil last year and is majority owned by Chevron (36.4 percent), helped offset the losses. Sonangol owns a 22.8 percent share, followed by Total (13.6 percent) and Eni (13.6 percent).
Total, Eni, Chevron and BP are planning to operate a combined nine new projects, not including Kaombo, beginning this y
ear. Combined peak production would total nearly a million barrels per day, according to EIA data, beginning with Total’s Cravo-Lirio-Orquidea-Voleta (CLOV) deep-water project to start production the second half of this year.
Angola’s rise to the big leagues as the continent’s No. 2 oil producer has not been without challenges.
Dependence on crude production leaves the country vulnerable to global oil prices. Despite an IMF-supported Sovereign Wealth Fund and positive outlook for the next few years, governance problems and a lack of other sector development will continue to challenge development and has some observers dubious.
“Virtually their entire export base is oil, and that’s generally the concern with Angola, and there tend to be significant delays to when these projects actually start pumping oil,” said Shilan Shah, Africa economist at Capital Economics. That's no small caveat because, “There isn’t another country that’s as reliant on one industry as Angola,” he said.
Natural resources account for 95 percent of Angolan exports and more than 60 percent of Angola’s $114 billion gross domestic product.

Though Nigeria exports more oil, the country is less dependent on the commodity thanks to a more diversified economy.  When Nigerian officials rebased their GDP calculations earlier this year, the oil sector fell from 32.4 percent to just 14.4 percent of their economy, which is now dominated by the service sector.
The recent deal with Total represents a positive swing for now, but a few years away the heavy focus on oil could be a problem.
“Especially with these projects, there is going to be huge amounts of foreign direct investment into the country, but over the medium-term there’s reason to be concerned,” Shah said.
Angola’s seen its economic promise stymied before. Between 2009 and 2011, GDP growth stagnated as global oil prices declined along with domestic production.
“The resulting drop in oil revenues impacted the non-oil economy through diminished private consumption, cuts to public spending and the accumulation of substantial arrears to domestic firms, particularly in the construction sector,” according to the latest International Monetary Fund Angola Economic Update.
“Despite its favorable near-term outlook, Angola’s reliance on oil revenues and imports leaves the economy highly vulnerable to economic shocks,” the IMF report said.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in May traded at $4.541 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, down 0.58%. The commodity hit session high of $4.604 and a low of $4.536.
The May contract settled up 0.15% on Tuesday to end at $4.567 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.513 per million British thermal units, Tuesday's low, and resistance at $4.702, Thursday's high.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its storage report for the week ending April 11 on Thursday, with many analysts expecting the report to show the first significant build in inventories since November.
Severely cold weather over this past winter saw natural gas stockpiles fall to 11-year lows, sparking concerns that producers may not be able to refill inventories before the next heating season.
Producers typically replenish inventories between April and October, when demand is lower.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
Last week’s government supply data showed that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 4 billion cubic feet, the first storage injection this year, while total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 826 billion cubic feet.
Supporting natural gas prices, however, were weather forecasts were calling for colder temperatures in the central and eastern U.S. before seasonably mild temperatures return later in the week.
Mild temperatures tend to suppress demand for heating or air conditioning, which cuts into demand for natural gas.

1656,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 16, 2014 01:55PM ET</span>","Gold gains on Yellen rates comments, mixed U.S. data","Investing.com - Gold prices rose on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said ideal employment and inflation conditions are over two years away, while a mixed bag of U.S. data also bolstered gold's appeal as a hedge to loose monetary policies.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for June delivery traded at $1,302.50 a troy ounce during U.S. trading, up 0.17%, up from a session low of $1,293.80 and off a high of $1,307.00.
The June contract settled down 2.05% at $1,300.30 on Tuesday.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,289.60 a troy ounce, Tuesday's low , and resistance at $1,331.30, Monday's high.
The Federal Reserve will keep benchmark interest rates low even as the economy improves to ensure sustained recovery, with ideal conditions not seen for another two years, Yellen said earlier.
Monetary authorities hope to see the unemployment rate at the end of 2016 reaching 5.2-5.6% and inflation at 1.7-2%, Yellen said.
""If this forecast was to become reality, the economy would be approaching what my colleagues and I view as maximum employment and price stability for the first time in nearly a decade. I find this baseline outlook quite plausible,"" Yellen said in prepared remarks in a speech she delivered at the Economic Club of New York.
Loose monetary policies tend to weaken the dollar, making gold an attractive hedge.
In the meantime, markets should pay close attention to inflation and unemployment rates, as hiccups can serve as weather vanes when it comes to monetary policy and how long interest rates remain low.
""The larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from their respective objectives, and the slower the projected progress toward those objectives, the longer the current target range for the federal funds rate is likely to be maintained,"" Yellen said.
Hit-or-miss data softened the dollar and bolstered gold as well.
U.S. industrial production rose 0.7% in March from February, beating expectations for a 0.5% reading, which supported the dollar earlier, though soft U.S. housing data watered down the greenback.
The Commerce Department reported earlier that housing starts rose 2.8% in March to 946,000, missing analyst forecasts for a 6.4% increase to 973,000 units.
Separately, building permits, an indicator of future demand for housing, fell 2.4% in March to 990,000, defying market expectations for a 0.6% increase.

1659,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 16, 2014 06:00AM ET</span>","The Reason Chinese 'Grannies' Aren't Buying Gold Anymore, Even At Lower Prices","By Sophie Song - China’s gold-loving grannies bought enough gold last year to see them through this year, and perhaps longer. Despite prices lower than this time a year ago, when the gold rush in the world’s second-largest economy began, demand is likely to remain level this year, the first time it has not increased since 2002.
“We expect 2014 to be a year of consolidation,” a report from the World Gold Council, the trade group, said Tuesday. “The sudden price drop in 2013 meant some Chinese consumers brought forward jewelry and bar purchases, which may limit growth in demand in 2014.”
Gold prices around the globe dropped suddenly last April. In China, it plunged more than 14 percent between April 9 and April 16, to around $1,321.50 per ounce, accelerating a decline that had been underway since Oct. 4, 2012, when the metal closed at $1804.60 per ounce.
The price drop prompted a buying frenzy in China, which the media quickly dubbed the Chinese “Granny Effect,” with photos of middle-aged and older Chinese women surrounding display cases of gold and gold jewelry. In April alone, Chinese consumers bought 300 tons of gold, one tenth the world's annual gold production, worth more than 100 billion yuan ($16.24 billion).
According to the World Gold Council’s data, the private sector in China consumed 1,132 tonnes (1,247.82 tons) of gold last year, which makes China the world’s biggest gold consumer, bumping India to second place.
But a year after the rush, the grannies’ gold-buying fer
vor has cooled. Gold prices this year are even lower, and Chinese consumers are wondering whether they should have bought so much last year, according to ChinaIRN.com, a market research site run by Zero Power Intelligence, a consulting and industry research firm based in the southern city of Shenzhen.

“I bought 50,000 yuan worth of gold last year,” a Chinese woman identified by her last name of Ye told ChinaIRN.com. “But gold is cheaper this year. I got a bad deal!”
“It’s not realistic to expect to make money from gold,” Ye added. “It only makes sense if you want to hold onto the gold.”

A plume of cold air moving across the central and eastern U.S. sent natural gas prices rising on Tuesday, though profit-taking wiped out gains, as the cool snap should be short lived, though trading was choppy at times.
Updated weather-forecasting models called for seasonably mild temperatures to hover over much of the lower 48 contiguous U.S. states towards the end of April.
Spring and fall see the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
Supplies remained in focus as well.
Last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ending April 4 rose by 4 billion cubic feet after a drop of 74 billion cubic feet in the previous week.
Analysts had expected a build of 13 billion cubic feet, and the lower-than-expected figure sparked a rally.

1667,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 15, 2014 11:45AM ET</span>",Libya To Export First Oil Since Rebel Deal,"By Reuters - A tanker is due to load 1 million barrels of crude on Tuesday from Libya's reopened Hariga port, its first export shipment since a deal to end months of closures at its main oil terminals, the National Oil Corp. (NOC) said.
The outages have raised supply concerns on global markets and helped support the price of Brent crude futures. Brent fell toward under $109 a barrel on Tuesday on the developments in Libya.
The tanker, Aegean Dignity, is due to take its load to Italy, NOC quoted an oil official as saying in a statement on its website. Reuters AIS Live ship tracking showed the Aegean Dignity moving close to the Libyan coast.
NOC lifted force majeure on Hariga port in the far east of the country last week following a deal between the Libyan government and federalist rebels who have blockaded the country's central and eastern terminals for eight months, depriving the state of the oil revenues on which it relies.
Production at the oilfields feeding the Hariga port was about 30,000 barrels per day (bpd), a senior NOC official said on Tuesday. About 20,000 bpd was being produced at the Mesla field to feed to the 20,000 bpd Tobruk refinery and another 5,000-10,000 bpd from Sarir to keep the pipeline operational.
The fields are operated by NOC subsidiary Arabian Gulf Oil Co, which can produce close to 400,000 bpd.
The NOC official added that the fields could not ramp up any further until they emptied some crude from storage at the terminal.
Libya's pre-2011 export capacity was close to 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) but the blockade has taken some 700,000 bpd offline and separate protests in the west of the country have also caused sporadic disruptions.
Under the long-awaited deal, the federalist rebels agreed to reopen Hariga and Zueitina ports while negotiations continued over the rest of the OPEC exporter's oil terminals.
Zueitina was still not under government control one week after the agreement, an NOC spokesman said on Monday.
Rebels are still in control of Libya's two largest terminals - Es Sider and Ras Lanuf - and their fate depends on further talks involving thorny issues including the rebels' demands for greater autonomy in the eastern region of Cyrenaica.
Nearly three years after dictator Muammar Gaddafi's fall, the standoff reflects the government's struggle to impose its authority on rival brigades of former rebels that are pushing for more power in the new Libya.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, natural gas futures for delivery in May traded at $4.556 per million British thermal units during U.S. trading, down 1.40%. The commodity hit session high of $4.646 and a low of $4.540.
The May contract settled down 0.75% on Friday to end at $4.620 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.222 per million British thermal units, the low from April 2, and resistance at $4.702, Thursday's high.
Updated weather-forecasting models called for seasonably mild temperatures to hover over much of the lower 48 contiguous U.S. states towards the end of April, which sent natural gas prices falling.
Spring and fall see the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
Forecasts for above-normal temperatures for pockets of the country cushioned losses though slightly.
Higher temperatures hike demand for air conditioning and prompt thermal generators to burn more of the commodity, though forecasts for overall weather patterns to bring mild springtime mercury reading to the U.S. pushed prices down.
Spring and fall see the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.
Supplies remained in focus as well.
Last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ending April 4 rose by 4 billion cubic feet after a drop of 74 billion cubic feet in the previous week.
Analysts had expected a build of 13 billion cubic feet, and the lower-than-expected figure sparked a rally.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 826 billion cubic feet, the lowest for this time of year since 2003.
Severely cold weather over this past winter saw natural gas stockpiles fall to 11-year lows, sparking concerns that producers may not be able to refill inventories before the next heating season. Producers typically replenish inventories between April and October, when demand is lower.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.

The Russian deputy premier, Arkady Dvorkovich, also said China is interested in alternative energy projects on the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, annexed by Russia from Ukraine in March.
Moscow and Beijing have been involved in painstaking talks about possible Russian gas supplies to China, with price being the main obstacle to a deal.
""The gas talks are wrapping up. There is a common intention to complete this work before the Russian president's visit to China in May this year,"" Interfax news agency quoted Dvorkovich as saying in a meeting with Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.
Last week, Dvorkovich went to China as part of a Russian delegation to discuss cooperation in the energy sector.
Putin has urged Russian companies to expand their exposure to Asia as Europe's economy falters and countries there seek less dependence on energy supplies from their former Cold War foe. Europe is the key buyer of oil and gas from Russia.
Russia's top natural gas producer Gazprom plans to start supplying China with 38 billion cubic meters of gas per year - around a quarter of Russia's exports to Europe - in 2018.
Dvorkovich also said Russia and China plan to boost cooperation in oil and oil products, as well as in coal and power supplies.
Russia's top oil company Rosneft aims to triple oil supplies to China from the more than 300,000 barrels per day it sent last year.
""The key decisions have been taken, but both the Chinese partners and we have a desire to boost cooperation,"" Dvorkovich said, according to Interfax.
He also said China is interested in developing Crimea.
""The Chinese colleagues who are involved in alternative energy projects, are looking with interest at participating in similar projects in the Crimean republic,"" Dvorkovich was quoted as saying.

The May contract settled up 1.50% on Thursday to end at $4.655 per million British thermal units.
Natural gas futures were likely to find support at $4.222 per million British thermal units, the low from April 2, and resistance at $4.702, Thursday's high.
While a weak cool front pushes through the northern U.S., most of country will see mild temperatures that should cut into the need for heating, though cooler temperatures could return later next week for parts of the central and eastern U.S., Natgasweather.com reported, which cushioned losses.
Profit taking also sent prices edging lower, as investors locked in gains from Thursday's rather bullish supply report and sold the commodity for profits.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. in the week ended April 4 rose by 4 billion cubic feet after a drop of 74 billion cubic feet in the previous week.
Analysts had expected a build of 13 billion cubic feet, and the lower-than-expected figure sparked a rally.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 826 billion cubic feet, the lowest for this time of year since 2003.
Severely cold weather over this past winter saw natural gas stockpiles fall to 11-year lows, sparking concerns that producers may not be able to refill inventories before the next heating season. Producers typically replenish inventories between April and October, when demand is lower.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption. Approximately 52% of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.
Spring and fall see the weakest demand for natural gas in the U.S, as the absence of extreme temperatures curbs demand for heating and air conditioning.

1692,By International Business Times,"<span>Apr 10, 2014 01:30PM ET</span>",China Importers Default On Soy Cargoes,"By Reuters - Chinese importers have defaulted on at least 500,000 tons of U.S. and Brazilian soybean cargoes worth around $300 million, the biggest in a decade, as buyers struggle to get credit amid losses in processing beans.
Three companies in the eastern province of Shandong had defaulted on payments for shipments as they were unable to open letters of credit with banks, trade sources said on Thursday.
A string of defaults on loans, bonds and shadow banking products in recent weeks has highlighted rising credit risks in China, partly fuelled by signs the economy is slowing.

Commodity firms, along with semiconductor and software companies, are among the most at risk of credit defaults, a Reuters analysis of more than 2,600 Chinese companies showed.
Up against the cooling economy and signs that authorities will not step in every time a loan goes bad, Chinese banks are becoming more hard-nosed and selective about whom they lend to.
""There are five to six (panamax) cargoes which are unable to be unloaded at ports because buyers cannot open LCs (letters of credit) and there are no LCs for an additional 5-6 cargoes floating on the sea,"" one Beijing-based source said. Each panamax cargo is for 50,000 to 60,000 tonnes.
Defaults by buyers in China, which imports 60 percent of the soybeans traded in the world, would likely cap a rally in global prices as they coincide with bumper supplies from Braziland Argentina hitting the market.
Chicago Board of Trade front-month soybeans edged lower on Thursday after climbing to their highest since July in the last session when the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its forecast for stocks remaining at the end of the crop year.
""The reality is that the world is reliant on Chinese imports of soybeans to maintain this price strength,"" said Luke Mathews, commodities strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.
""It is putting a question mark on the sustainability of these prices.""
The default on 500,000 tonnes of soybeans is the biggest since 2004, when buyers walked away from an estimated 30 contracts, resulting in a loss of close to $700 million, traders said.
Industry sources said some of the companies defaulting have been using soybean imports to secure cheap financing, with interest rates on letters of credit as low as 2 percent and allowing delayed payment of several months.
Having imported large amounts, some of them even sell the oilseed at a loss, as a way to liquidate their stocks and plough cash into more profitable businesses.
Fearing a wave of defaults as China's economy cools after decades of rapid growth, regulators in the past two years told banks to cut off financing to sectors plagued by excess capacity such as steel and cement.
Exporters, in a bid to gain a foothold in the lucrative Chinese market, sometimes ship cargoes when importers do not have confirmed letters of credit, trusting buyers will honor their commitment. The practice was briefly abandoned after the wave of defaults in 2004 but slowly resumed.
