15,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 11, 2013 06:51AM ET</span>","Gold futures slide lower, focus on U.S. debt ","Investing.com - Gold futures slid lower during European early afternoon trading hours on Friday, hovering below the key USD1,300-level as markets remained focused on ongoing U.S. budget negotiations amid fears of a potential sovereign default. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for December delivery traded at USD1,284.60 a troy ounce during European afternoon hours, down 0.95%. The December contract ended 0.79% lower on Thursday to settle at USD1,296.90 a troy ounce.  Gold futures were likely to find support at USD1,278.20, the low from October 2 and resistance at USD1,311.80, Thursday's high.  No deal emerged after a 90-minute meeting between President Barack Obama and Republican leaders on Thursday, but talks continued into the night in an effort to reopen the government and avoid a possible U.S. debt default.  Republicans offered to extend the government's borrowing authority for several weeks, temporarily putting off a default, while Obama was pushing to also reopen government operations that have been closed since October 1.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew reiterated Thursday that the U.S. will reach its debt ceiling on October 17 and warned that the political crisis is starting to hurt the economy. The comments came during testimony to the Senate finance committee.  Traders were also eyeing the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting at the end of the month. Minutes of the Fed's September meeting published on Wednesday showed that most policymakers were still in favor of scaling back its stimulus program this year.The central bank's decision not to begin tapering its USD85-billion-a-month bond-buying program was a ""close call,"" fuelling expectations that the bank will begin to roll back bond purchases in the next few months.Elsewhere on the Comex, silver for December delivery tumbled 1.74% to trade at USD21.515 a troy ounce, while copper for December delivery rose 0.26% to trade at USD3.257 a pound."

210,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 19, 2013 09:28PM ET</span>",Gold falls on post-Fed profit-taking,"Investing.com - Gold futures traded lower during Friday’s Asian session on what appears to be a bout of post-Federal Reserve profit-taking. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for December delivery fell 0.54% to USD1,362.00 per troy ounce in Asian trading Friday. On Thursday, the December contract settled up by 4.73% at USD1,369.40 per ounce. Gold futures were likely to find support at USD1,291.70 a troy ounce, Wednesday's low, and resistance at USD1,393.80, the high from Sept. 8.The Federal Reserve on Wednesday concluded a two-day monetary policy meeting and made no changes to its USD85 billion bond-buying program, much to the surprise of most traders. The no tapering verbiage ignited a rally in gold, sending bullion to its best one-day gain in several years. Leading up to the Fed meeting, most market participants expected a tapering announcement to be delivered and that the result would be USD10 billion to USD15 billion trimmed from the Fed’s monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Following the Fed announcement Wednesday, stocks surged, but U.S. equities retreated Thursday, indicating some of the euphoria had worn off. Still, traders largely glossed over some decent U.S. economic data. In U.S. economic news out Thursday, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes rose 1.7% to 5.48 million units last month. That is good for the best reading since early 2007. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its Philly Fed manufacturing survey climbed to 22.3 in September, the highest since March 2011, from 9.3 in August. Economists expected a September reading of 10. Readings above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. The survey covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. The new orders index surged to 21.2 from 5.3, also a 2½-year high, while employment hit a 17-month high of 10.3 from 3.5. The Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.7% last month following a 0.5% increase in July. The Labor Department said initial claims for jobless benefits rose by 15,000 to 309,000 last week. Economists expected reading of 330,000 claims. The less volatile four-week moving average fell to 314,750, the lowest since October 2007. Elsewhere, Comex silver for December delivery slipped 1.23% to USD23.005 per ounce while copper for December delivery fell 0.09% to USD3.344 per ounce."

216,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 18, 2013 09:11PM ET</span>",Oil keeps climbing after Fed passes on tapering ,"Investing.com - Oil futures continued higher during Thursday’s Asian session after the Federal Reserve shocked markets by saying it will not taper its quantitative easing program. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for November delivery jumped 0.41% to USD107.72 per barrel in Asian trading Thursday. The November contract settled higher by 2.35% at USD107.28 per barrel on Wednesday. Many investors felt the Fed would announce plans to trim the amount of bonds it buys each month to spur recovery, a stimulus tool known as quantitative easing that drives down long-term interest rates and weakens the dollar to spur recovery, a recipe for rising gold prices. However, the Fed surprised markets by saying tapering of its easing efforts is tied to economic data and not the calendar. While that could be viewed as a sign that the U.S. economy is not as deep into recovery as the Fed would like to see, data points suggest oil demand is picking up. The Energy Information Administration reported earlier that U.S. crude oil stockpiles dropped by 4.37 million barrels in the week ending Sept. 13, well beyond expectations for a decline of 1.39 million barrels and far past a decline of 219,000 barrels in the previous week. In U.S. economic news out Wednesday, the Commerce Department said single-family housing starts jumped 7% last month to an annual rate of 628,000 units, the highest level in six months. New construction for apartments and condominiums fell 11.1%. Permits for single-family homes rose 3% to the highest level since May 2008. Oil futures could continue to rise on the expectation that with QE remaining in place for the foreseeable future, the U.S. dollar will weaken. Oil is denominated in dollars. Elsewhere, Brent futures for November delivery rose 0.26% to USD110.86 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."
217,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 18, 2013 08:59PM ET</span>",Gold jumps after Fed says no to tapering,"Investing.com - Gold futures surged in the early part of Thursday’s Asian session as the Federal Reserve surprised markets by opting not to alter its USD85 billion-per-month bond-buying program known as quantitative easing. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for December delivery soared 4.28% to USD1,363.60 per troy ounce in Asian trading Thursday. The December contract settled lower by 0.14% at USD1,307.60 per ounce on Wednesday. Gold futures were likely to find support at USD1,334.60, the high from Sept. 15 and resistance at USD1,375. Many investors felt the Fed would announce plans to trim the amount of bonds it buys each month to spur recovery, a stimulus tool known as quantitative easing that drives down long-term interest rates and weakens the dollar to spur recovery, a recipe for rising gold prices. However, the Fed surprised markets by saying tapering of its easing efforts is tied to economic data and not the calendar. That could be taken as a sign that the central bank does not yet feel the U.S. economy, the world’s largest, is far enough along in the recovery cycle to withdraw stimulus measures. The Fed also appears to be betting that by keeping easing in place, the U.S. economy will be able to continue adding jobs and with the specter of tapering gone, mortgage rates will fall and stimulate housing demand, an integral part of U.S. GDP. In U.S. economic news out Wednesday, the Commerce Department said single-family housing starts jumped 7% last month to an annual rate of 628,000 units, the highest level in six months. New construction for apartments and condominiums fell 11.1%. Permits for single-family homes rose 3% to the highest level since May 2008. Elsewhere, Comex silver for December delivery surged 6.46% to USD22.958 per ounce while copper for December delivery rose 0.16% to USD3.322 an ounce."

Gold prices added 1.5% on the week, the third consecutive weekly advance. The precious metal has rebounded nearly 16% since hitting a 34-month low of USD1,180.15 a troy ounce on June 28.  In U.S. economic news out last Friday, the Commerce Department said new home sales dropped 13.4% last month to an annual rate of 394,000 units. That is the lowest reading in nine months. In July, the median price for a new home sale rose to $257,200, up from $237,400 in the same month of 2012, according to Reuters. That data point along with a few others out earlier in the week stoked speculation that the Federal Reserve may not immediately move to taper its USD85 billion-per-month bond-buying program. Minutes from the Fed’s July policy meeting published last week showed most members agree with tapering at some point this year. However, the problem is there appears to be little agreement regarding exactly when the central bank should begin reducing its asset buying. The ensuing uncertainty could put gold and other dollar-denominated commodities in a near-term holding pattern. Elsewhere, Comex silver for December delivery jumped 1.29% to USD24.087 an ounce while copper for December delivery added 1% to USD3.390 per ounce."

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for September delivery rose 0.30% to USD107.17 per barrel in Asian trading Thursday. The September contract inched up 0.02% to USD106.85 per barrel Wednesday. In U.S. economic news out Wednesday, the Labor Department said producer prices were flat last month, indicating little in the way of inflationary pressures in the world’s largest economy. Core prices increased 0.1% last month, below the 0.2% increase analysts expected. Year-over-year, the produce price index was up 1.2%. A weak producer price index suggest inflationary pressures remain soft and an economy still in need of monetary support.The numbers dampened expectations that U.S. recovery is strong enough for the Federal Reserve to begin tapering its USD85 billion-a-month asset-purchasing program, which has supported gold since its inception. Also on Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that U.S. crude oil inventories fell by 2.8 million barrels in the week ended August 9, surpassing expectations for a decline of 1.5 million barrels. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 360.5 million barrels as of last week. The report also showed that total motor gasoline inventories decreased by 1.2 million barrels, beating expectations for a decline of 822,000 barrels. The EIA added that the U.S. is not increasing its consumption of liquid fuels and that China is poised to pass the U.S. as the world’s largest oil importer. The U.S. and China are the world’s two largest oi l consumers. Elsewhere, Brent for October deliver rose 0.22% to USD109.18 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."

Upside for the yellow metal could be limited as risk appetite appears to be increasing, which could be a problematic for gold and its safe-have appeal. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for September delivery inched up 0.05% to USD1,321.90 per troy ounce in Asian trading Wednesday. The September contract settled down 1.02% at USD1,321.30 per ounce on Tuesday. Gold futures were likely to find support at USD1,272.10 a troy ounce, Thursday's low, and resistance at USD1,347.85, the high from July 23. In U.S. economic news out Tuesday, the Commerce Department said U.S. retail sales rose 0.2% last month, missing the expected increase of 0.3%. Excluding sales of cars, gasoline and building materials, U.S. retail sales advanced 0.5%. The U.S. consumer accounts for about 70% of GDP in the world’s largest economy. The retail sales data prompted investors to trade on expectations that the Fed will begin tapering its USD85 billion monthly bond-buying program either in September or in December and wrap up the program in 2014, which ended a four-day winning streak for gold. In other gold-related news, India, the world’s largest consumer of the yellow metal, again boosted import taxes on gold in an effort to stem its widening current account deficit. India, Asia’s third-largest economy, is trying to hold onto its investment grade credit rate and a widening account deficit is seen as a threat to that effort. Elsewhere, Comex silver for September delivery rose 0.23% to USD21.392 per ounce while copper for September delivery fell 0.16% to USD3.309 per ounce."

576,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 11, 2013 08:42PM ET</span>",Oil down slightly following weekly loss,"Investing.com - Oil futures traded modestly lower in the early part of Monday’s Asian session following a weekly loss last week. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for September delivery fell 0.17% to USD105.79 per barrel in Asian trading Monday. The September contract settled higher by 2.49% at 105.97 per barrel last Friday, but that was not enough to prevent West Texas Intermediate from posting a small weekly loss. Hedge funds and other speculators reduced their net long exposure to crude by 2.5% to 310,827 contracts for the week ending August 6, the second straight week of long exposure reduction, according to data from the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Last week, the International Energy Agency lowered its 2014 global oil demand-growth estimate by 100,000 barrels per day due to slowing economic growth in China, the world’s second-largest oil-consuming nation behind the U.S. Last week, industrial production in China rose 9.7% last month, beating expectations for a 9.0% increase and picking up from a gain of 8.9% in June.In another report, the National Bureau of Statistics said CPI remained unchanged at 2.7% last month. Analysts expected a July reading of 2.8%. On Friday, Goldman Sachs reiterated its 2013 forecast of Brent crude at USD105 per barrel, but added tighter OPEC supplies and a rise in Chinese net crude oil imports would push prices up in the near term, Reuters reported. OPEC member Libya has recently seen its output decline to its lowest levels in nearly two years amid ongoing violence near some of the country’s oil assets. Libya is home to Africa’s largest oil reserves. Elsewhere, Brent crude for October delivery fell 0.36% to USD106.49 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."

587,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 08, 2013 08:48PM ET</span>",Oil rises amid bargain-hunting ,"Investing.com - Oil futures rose modestly in the early part of Friday’s Asian session as some traders stepped into buy crude after the commodity took a tumble during Thursday’s U.S. session. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for September delivery rose 0.13% to USD103.94 per barrel in Asian trading Friday. The September contract settled 0.42% at USD103.81 per barrel on Thursday. Tepid U.S. jobs data was one culprit behind oil’s Thursday decline. In U.S. economic news out Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department said initial claims for jobless benefits rose by 5,000 last week to 333,000. The less volatile four-week moving average dropped to 335,500, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2007. The U.S. is the world’s largest oil consumer. Also on Thursday, China said its overall exports rose 5.1% in July, swinging from June’s 3.1% fall. China is the world’s second-largest oil consumer. Elsewhere, ConocoPhillips, the largest U.S. independent oil company, said it will sell a stake in its Canadian oil sands operation to Exxon Mobil and Canada’s Imperial Oil for USD720 million. Conoco has been selling assets for several years to bolster its balance sheet. Texas-based Conoco has sold international assets totaling USD13.5 billion since the start of last year. The Canada deal is reportedly all cash. Traders will now turn their attention to new monthly forecasts from the International Energy Agency and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries due out later Friday. Meanwhile, Brent futures for September delivery rose 0.18% to USD106.94 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange. "
588,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 08, 2013 08:37PM ET</span>",Gold inches higher after U.S. surge,"Investing.com - Gold futures traded slightly higher in the early part of Friday’s Asian session following an impressive showing in U.S. trade Thursday that was aided by a weaker U.S. dollar. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for September delivery inched up 0.07% to USD1,312,80 per troy ounce in Asian trading Friday. The September contract settled up 2.17% at USD1,311.90 per troy ounce in U.S. trading Thursday. Gold futures were likely to find support at USD1,272.10 a troy ounce, Tuesday's low, and resistance at USD1,319.85, Monday's high. Gold’s Thursday ascent was also aided by some decent economic news out of the U.S. and the euro zone. In U.S. economic news out Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department said initial claims for jobless benefits rose by 5,000 last week to 333,000. The less volatile four-week moving average dropped to 335,500, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2007. In Europe, Germany reported that June exports were up 0.6% from the previous month, better than expected. Germany is the euro zone’s largest economy.The numbers sparked for demand for the euro that came at the dollar's expense, which was bullish for gold, as the yellow metal and the greenback tend to trade inversely with one another. Riskier assets and dollar-denominated commodities have been pressured in recent days due to a raft of comments from various Federal Reserve officials indicating that they could not rule out making a decision to taper stimulus measures at the bank’s September meeting, though lackluster economic indicators out of the U.S. have some market participants betting that such a decision will come in December. Elsewhere, Comex silver for September delivery rose 0.23% to USD20.240 per ounce while copper for September delivery added 0.18% to USD3.267 an ounce."

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for September delivery rose 0.18% to USD105.49 per barrel in Asian trading Wednesday after settling down 1.18% at USD105.30 per barrel during Tuesday’s Asian session. Data from the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. oil inventories fell 3.7 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 2. Analysts expected a decline of 2 million barrels. Distillate stocks increased by 1.5 million barrels, while gasoline stocks fell by 971,000 barrels. Analysts had expected a drop by 1 million barrels for distillates and gasoline. The more widely followed inventories data from the U.S. Energy Department is due out later Wednesday. Oil and other riskier assets languished Tuesday after Federal Reserve member Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, said investors have become too dependent on the Fed backstopping riskier assets. In comments made in Oregon, Fisher said, ""Financial markets may have become too accustomed to what some have depicted as a Fed ‘put,’” or the idea that the central bank will loosen credit after a market decline."" Elsewhere, Libyan Oil Minister Abdelbari al-Arusi said output in the North African country has rebounded to 700,000 barrels per day following civil unrest that hampered production there. Libya is an OPEC member and home to Africa’s largest oil reserves. Fellow OPEC member Iraq is expected to pare oil shipments by 400,000 to 500,000 barrels per day next month due to pipeline damage. Meanwhile, Brent futures for September delivery inched down 0.04% to USD108.11 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for September delivery fell 0.15% to USD106.40 per barrel in Asian trading Tuesday. The September contract inched down 0.07% to settle at USD106.86 a barrel during U.S. trading Monday.  In U.S. economic news out Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said its services index climbed to 56 in July from 52.2 in June. Economists expected a July reading of 53. The new orders index rose to 57.7 from 50.8, but the employment index fell to 53.2 from 54.7. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. With the U.S. being the world’s largest oil consumer, accounting for 22% of global demand, the ISM should have been a bigger boost to oil bulls, but that was not the case. Political volatility in Libya, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has some traders believing oil could rise in the near-term. Combine that with lingering violence in Egypt, home of the Suez Canal, a major transport zone for oil, and oil could be ripe for a spike. However, any ebbing of tensions in the Middle East could prompt traders to take profits in oil and exit the trade. Libya is home to Africa’s largest oil reserves. Three terminals, which ship 1 million barrels per day, are still not operative in the North African nation. West Texas Intermediate futures are up over 27% in just the past nine months, but traders are seen reducing net long exposure to crude. Elsewhere, Brent futures for September delivery inched down 0.05% to USD108.58 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."

736,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 22, 2013 08:12PM ET</span>",Oil rises slightly as traders buy dip ,"Investing.com - Oil futures rose modestly in the early part of Tuesday’s Asian session as traders bought a dip crude following a glum performance at the hands of some disappointing economic news out during Monday’s U.S. session. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude futures for September delivery rose 0.07% to USD107.02 per barrel in Asian trading Tuesday after settling down 0.67% at USD107.15 a barrel on Monday in the U.S. In U.S. economic news out Monday, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales fell 1.2% to an annual rate of 5.08 million last month. The May number was revised down to 5.14 million. The median home price jumped 13.5% from June 2012, to $214,200. That is the 16th straight month of higher prices. The housing sector pushed the U.S. economy into its worst downturn since the Great Depression several years ago and has continued to dampen its recovery. The U.S. is the world’s largest oil consumer. Elsewhere, Halliburton, the second-largest oilfield services provider in the world, said its second-quarter profit fell to $679 million, or 73 cents per share, from $737 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 1% to $7.32 billion. Analysts expected EPS of 72 cents. Revenue also beat expectations. Protests at a Libyan port halted shipments there for a sixth straight day. Zueitina Oil Company pumps between 60,000 and 70,000 barrels at the port, according to Reuters. Libya, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is home to Africa’s largest oil reserves. Elsewhere, Brent crude futures for September delivery rose 0.14% to USD108.25 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."

892,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 04, 2013 08:21PM ET</span>","Gold falls following BoE, ECB meetings","Investing.com - Gold futures traded lower in the early part of Friday’s Asian session as bullion was weighed down in the aftermath of Thursday’s Bank of England and European Central Bank meetings. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for August delivery fell 0.43% to USD1,246.55 per troy ounce in Asian trading Friday after trading at USD1,246.25 a troy ounce during U.S. morning hours, down 0.7% on the day. U.S. markets were closed Thursday in observance of the Independence Day holiday. Gold futures were likely to find support at USD1,180.35 a troy ounce, Friday’s low and a 34-month low and near-term resistance at USD1,276.05, the high from June 26. Earlier Thursday, European Central Bank President Mario said that the central bank’s monetary policy will “remain accommodative as long as needed”.He added that rates will stay low for an “extended period of time.” Draghi’s comments came after the ECB held its benchmark interest rate at a record low 0.50% in July, in line with expectations.  Goldman Sachs said the ECB ""is more likely than not to ease further from here."" The bank added that ""more unconventional easing"" is likely from the Bank of England. Research house Capital Economics said it believes both BoE and the ECB will engage in further easing activities later this year. The BoE left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% on Thursday and said economic data over the past few months was consistent with the recovery set out by the bank in its May inflation report, but warned that the ""significant upward movement"" in bond yields would weigh on the outlook for growth. “In the Committee’s view, the implied rise in the expected future path of Bank Rate was not warranted by the recent developments in the domestic economy”, the BoE said.The bank took the step of publishing a rate statement following its first meeting under the leadership of new Governor Mark Carney. Elsewhere, Comex silver for September delivery dropped 1.12% to USD19.480 per ounce while copper for September delivery fell 0.14% to USD3.147 per ounce."

1009,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 23, 2013 08:41PM ET</span>",Oil slightly higher after touching 3-week low,"Investing.com - Oil futures nudged higher in the early part of Monday’s Asian session after crude touched a three-week low last week. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for August delivery inched up 0.05% to USD93.74 per barrel in Asian trading Monday after settling down 1.3% last Friday to close the week at USD93.89 a barrel. Oil prices plunged 3% on Thursday after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank could begin slowing asset purchases by the end of 2013 and wind them down completely by the middle of 2014 if the economy picks up as the central bank expects. The central forecast 2013 U.S. economic growth of 2.3% to 2.6% while adding it expects the unemployment rate to drop to between 6.5% and 6.8% by the end of 2014. Since the U.S. is the world’s largest oil consumer, those numbers are pivotal to oil demand, but the forecasts may not be robust enough for some traders to send oil higher. China, the world’s second-largest oil consumer, is perhaps even more of a concern. Last week, China’s HSBC preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 48.3 in June from 49.2 in May as new orders declined, indicating that the slowdown in manufacturing is worsening. Elsewhere, Iraq said it exported 76.9 million barrels of oil last month, or 2.48 million barrels per day, a 5% drop from April’s numbers. Iraq, an OPEC member cited poor weather and pipeline sabotage as reasons for the output decline. China’s Sinopec, that country’s second-largest oil producer, will reportedly pay USD1.52 billion for Marathon Oil’s Angolan offshore oil and gas field. Marathon is based in Texa. Meanwhile, Brent futures for August deliver fell 0.27% to USD100.66 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for July delivery inched up 0.08% to USD95.85 per barrel in Asian trading Tuesday after settling down 0.24% at USD95.80 a barrel on Monday in the U.S. Oil came under slight pressure Monday after a raft of data points revealed some weakness in the Chinese economy, the world’s second-largest. Over the weekend, China reported that its industrial output expanded by 9.2% in May compared with 9.3% in April, missing market calls for a gain of 9.3%.Elsewhere, government data revealed that China’s imports of crude oil fell 6% in May from a year earlier, to 23.95 million tons. China imported 23.08 million tons of crude in April.A separate report from China’s customs administration showed that China imported 116,000 million tons of crude in the first five months of this year, down 2% from the same period in 2012. China is the world’s second-largest oil consumer behind the U.S. Traders will now turn their attention to demand reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the U.S. Department of Energy. Both reports are slated to be released later Tuesday. The U.S. Energy Department has pared its demand forecast in each of its last three reports. Elsewhere, Brazil is looking to raise USD4.6 billion to develop the Libra offshore field, which is believed to be home to 12 billion recoverable barrels of crude. Brazil is South America’s second-largest oil producer behind OPEC member Venezuela. Meanwhile, Brent futures for July delivery inched up 0.01% to USD103.73 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."

1138,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 09, 2013 08:51PM ET</span>",Oil inches up despite slack Chinese data,"Investing.com - Oil futures traded slightly higher during Monday’s Asian session despite data from China released over the weekend that could ignite fresh fears that the world’s second-largest is not growing as briskly as some investors have been hoping for. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for July delivery rose 0.14% to USD96.17 per barrel in Asian trading Monday after settling up 1.54% at USD96.22 a barrel on Friday in the U.S. A strong May jobs report lifted crude at the end of last week. In U.S. economic news delivered last Friday, the U.S. Labor Department said the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in May, but added the unemployment rate rose to 7.6% from 7.5%. The April reading was revised lower to 149,000 from 165,000 while the March reading was revised down to 138,000 from 142,000. However, traders appear a bit more reserved about oil futures Monday after China, the world’s second-largest economy behind the U.S., delivered a raft of disappointing data. After a crackdown by Chinese officials on manipulators that use currency conversions to boost export data, Chinese exports showed an increase of just 1% last month. Exports to the U.S. and European Union, China’s two largest export markets, declined for a third consecutive month. Imports fell 0.3%, well below the expected 6% increase. China's consumer inflation dropped to 2.1%, below the expected reading of 2.5%, while producer prices fell 2.9%. Analysts expected PPI to drop 2.5%. Retail sales rose 12.9%, which met expectations. Fixed-asset investment and industrial production also met analysts’ expectations with year-over-year gains of 20.4% and 9.2%. China’s M2 money supply rose 15.8%, but that was below the expected 15.9% increase. New loans totaled 667.4 million yuan, but that missed expectations of 850 billion yuan and down from April's 792.9 billion yuan. The U.S. and China are the world’s two largest oil consumers.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for August delivery inched down 0.02% to USD1,391.55 per troy ounce in Asian trading Thursday after closing up 0.61% at USD1,388.15 a troy ounce in U.S. trading on Wednesday. Gold futures were likely to test support USD1,373.25 a troy ounce, Tuesday's low, and resistance at USD1,401.05, Tuesday's high. A decent U.S. data point helped suppress the dollar while boosting gold a bit on Wednesday. In U.S. economic news, mortgage applications fell 9% last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The market composite index was down 8.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis for the week while the refinancing index dropped 12%. The World Gold Council said Wednesday that second-quarter demand for bullion in Asia will reach a record as consumers take advantage of fresh supply that has come to market as investors have dumped shares of numerous gold-backed exchange traded funds. The WGC said that even if U.S. investors continue to liquidate holdings of ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Shares, that gold will be consumed by buyers in China, India and the Middle East. Indian imports of gold are expected to be 350-400 tons this quarter, up from 256 tons in the first quarter. The WGC added its expects Indian imports to be at the upper end of its 2013 forecast of 865-965 tons. China imported 160-170 tons of gold last month, according to the WGC. Elsewhere, Comex silver for July deliver fell 0.09% to USD22.433 per ounce while copper for July delivery dropped 0.30% to USD3.288 per ounce."

1252,By Investing.com,"<span>May 27, 2013 08:37PM ET</span>",Oil falls following Abdullah reports,"Investing.com - Oil futures traded lower in the early part of Tuesday’s Asian session amid conflicting reports regarding the health of Saudi Arabian King Abdullah. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for July delivery 0.52% to USD93.66 per barrel in Asian trading. Trade was light as markets in the U.S. and U.K. were closed Monday for holidays.  On Monday, one media report said Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz may be clinically dead, because the king has not been seen in public recently. Citing a source, the media outlet said the king may have been clinically dead dating back to last Wednesday and that the king’s vital organs, including his heart, kidneys and lungs, have stopped working. Indicating those reports were inaccurate, King Abdullah chaired a cabinet meeting Monday. Still, reports have surfaced over the past few years about the King’s health. Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC meets Friday in Vienna and increased U.S. oil production is expected to be a hot topic. The U.S. is producing more oil than at any time in the previous several decades, helping lower its dependence on foreign crude. African oil producers have been most affected by increased U.S. output. For example, Nigeria and Angola, the continent’s two largest producers, are home to oil that is similar in quality to what is found in the U.S. The 12 OPEC member states account for about 40% of global oil exports. Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange, Brent oil futures for June delivery shed 0.10% to trade at USD102.54 a barrel, with the spread between the Brent and crude contracts standing at about USD9 a barrel.The gap between the contracts narrowed to the lowest level since January 2011 earlier in the month, amid an improving production outlook in the North Sea and indications of declining stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for Nymex oil futures."
1253,By Investing.com,"<span>May 27, 2013 08:17PM ET</span>",Gold gains amid light trading ,"Investing.com - Gold futures traded higher during the early part of Tuesday’s session, but activity was far from volatile because U.S. and U.K. markets were closed for public holidays on Monday. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for August delivery rose 0.50% to USD1,394.45 per troy ounce in Asian trading Tuesday. Speculation that some central banks are buying bullion lifted futures. Gold futures were likely to find support at USD1,337.85 a troy ounce, the low from May 20 and resistance at USD1,413.05, the high from May 22. Gold got a lift after data from the International Monetary Fund showed that Russia and Kazakhstan added to their gold reserves for a seventh straight month in April.Russian holdings rose 8.4 metric tons to 990 tons, while Kazakhstan’s central bank purchased 2.6 tons to take its total holdings to 125.5 tons. In India, one of the world’s largest gold consumers, the Reserve Bank of India said Monday banks there would not be allowed to give loans against gold-back ETFs and mutual funds. RBI added that on-bank financial companies should not give loans for the purchase of gold in any form, including coins, bars, jewelry and ETFs. Meanwhile, at least one media report showed physical demand for gold in India slumped 15% last week after surging in April and the earlier part of May. Elsewhere, Comex silver for July delivery rose 0.55% to USD22.620 per ounce while copper for July delivery rose 0.20% to USD3.302 per ounce."

In U.S. economic news, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales rose 0.6% last month to an annual rate of 4.97 million units, the highest level since November 2009. However, that data point went largely ignored by oil traders after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that U.S. crude oil inventories fell by 338,000 barrels in the week ended May 17, compared to expectations for a decline of 778,000 barrels. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 394.6 million barrels as of last week.The report also showed that total motor gasoline inventories increased by 3.02 million barrels, well above expectations for an increase of 22,000 barrels, which sent crude prices falling on fears less Americans may be traveling this summer. Also on Wednesday, Bernanke said the Fed’s USD85 billion per month bond-buying program, also known as the third version of quantitative easing, will stay in place for now. That is what financial markets wanted to hear, but the Fed chairman threw a curve ball by saying QE could taper off if conditions in the world’s largest economy improve. In prepared testimony in Congress earlier, Bernanke said ultra-loose monetary policy was providing ""significant benefits"" to the economic recovery and reiterated that the bank’s asset-purchasing program will remain in place for now.Bernanke added withdrawing monetary stimulus could prompt interest rates to rise temporarily but could threaten the country's economic recovery as well as price stability down the road.""A premature tightening of monetary policy could lead interest rates to rise temporarily but would also carry a substantial risk of slowing or ending the economic recovery and causing inflation to fall further,"" Bernanke said in prepared remarks of his testimony. Elsewhere, Brent futures for July delivery fell 0.15% to USD102.29 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."

1366,By Investing.com,"<span>May 13, 2013 08:46PM ET</span>",Oil slightly higher despite China demand disappointment,"Investing.com - Oil futures traded modestly higher in the early part of Tuesday’s Asian session despite news of slowing demand in China last month. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures rose 0.28% to USD95.44 per barrel in Asian trading Tuesday after settling down 0.69% at USD95.38 a barrel on Monday in the U.S. Traders slipped out of oil despite some decent economic news out of the U.S., the world’s largest oil-consuming nation. In U.S. economic news, U.S retail sales rose 0.1% in April following a decline in March. The increase was helped by 1% rise in auto sales. Excluding auto sales, U.S. retail sales fell 0.1% in April. That data was published by the U.S. Commerce Department. April’s retail sales report prompted speculation that the Federal Reserve may be closer to scaling back stimulus programs, especially its USD85 billion monthly bond-buying program, which weaken the dollar to spur recovery. In China, data showed that refinery output there slumped 3% last month while demand rose 3.2% from April 2012 to an average of 9.6 million barrels per day, an eight-month low. China is the world’s second-largest oil consumer. Later Tuesday, the International Energy Agency is slated to release its monthly and medium-term supply and demand outlook. In Brazil an auction for lease rights to some offshore exploration areas attracted bidders such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two largest U.S. oil companies. China’s Cnooc, that country’s largest offshore exploration and production firm, also participated in the Brazilian auction. Meanwhile, Brent futures for June delivery rose 0.25% to USD102.73 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."
1367,By Investing.com,"<span>May 13, 2013 08:20PM ET</span>",Gold slightly lower as ETF outflows continue,"Investing.com - Gold futures traded modestly lower in the early part of Tuesday’s Asian session as traders speculated that physical demand for bullion may be waning. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for June delivery inched lower by 0.04% to USD1,433.75 per troy ounce in Asian trading Tuesday after settling down 0.21% at USD1,433.65 a troy ounce in U.S. trading on Monday. Gold futures were likely to test support USD1,418.65 a troy ounce, Friday's low, and resistance at USD1,475.55, Wednesday's high. Despite a lethargic day for U.S. equities, gold came under pressure following a decent April retail sales report. In U.S. economic news, U.S retail sales rose 0.1% in April following a decline in March. The increase was helped by 1% rise in auto sales. Excluding auto sales, U.S. retail sales fell 0.1% in April. That data was published by the U.S. Commerce Department. April’s retail sales report prompted speculation that the Federal Reserve may be closer to scaling back stimulus programs, especially its USD85 billion monthly bond-buying program, which weaken the dollar to spur recovery. Meanwhile, holdings of physical gold at the world’s major gold exchange traded funds fell 0.3% after rising on Friday for the first time in nearly two months. The SPDR Gold Shares, the world’s largest ETF backed by physical gold, was home to 1,051.65 tons of gold on Friday, a four-year low for the ETF. Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission indicate hedge funds and other market participants have scaled back their long bets on gold due in part to the ETF outflows. Elsewhere, Comex silver for July delivery fell 0.26% to USD23.635 per ounce while copper for July delivery rose 0.26% to USD3.365 per ounce."

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for June delivery inched lower by 0.03% to USD96.59 per barrel in Asian trading Thursday after up 0.74% at USD96.33 a barrel on Wednesday. Oil and other commodities were propped up by some decent data out of Germany and the U.S. Germany's industrial output, which includes manufacturing, mining, electricity and gas concerns, shot up 1.2% in March, the largest increase in a year and defying expectations for a 0.1% decline. February’s figure was revised up 0.6% from 0.5%. Official data released on Tuesday revealed that German factory orders climbed 2.2% in March, defying expectations for a 0.5% decline. Germany is the euro zone’s largest economy. In U.S. economic news, the Mortgage Bankers Association said the number of mortgage applications filed in the U.S. last week rose 7% while the refinancing index increased 8%. During Wednesday’s Asian session, data showed China’s oil imports rose 3.5% in April and have increased 3.7% on a year-over-year basis. The world’s second-largest oil consumer imported an average of 5.62 million barrels per day last month. Elsewhere, Alberta's Energy Resources Conservation Board said the region in Western Canada could double its output to 3.8 million barrels per day by 2022. Canada’s oil sands region is believed to be home to the world’s third-largest reserves behind OPEC members Saudia Arabia and Venezuela. Meanwhile, Brent crude futures for June delivery rose 0.31% to USD104.53 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."

1547,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 23, 2013 08:15PM ET</span>",Gold futures rebound in Asia after U.S. drop ,"Investing.com - Gold prices rebounded in the early party of Wednesday’s Asian session after falling during Tuesday’s U.S. amid some concerning economic data points. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for June delivery rose 0.51% to USD1,416.05 per troy ounce in Asian trading Wednesday after settling down 0.64% at USD1,412.05 a troy ounce in U.S. trading on Tuesday. Gold futures were likely to test support USD1,403.55 a troy ounce, Monday's low, and resistance at USD1,438.35, Monday's high. Gold and other commodities were hit after an HSBC Holdings/Markit Economics purchasing managers index for China came in at a preliminary 50.5 for April, below analysts' calls for a 51.4 reading. Also on Tuesday, data earlier by Markit Economics revealed that Germany’s April manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 47.9 from 49.0 in March, well below the 50 level that separates contraction from expansion. Analysts were hoping for the production barometer to remain unchanged.Germany’s service-sector PMI, meanwhile, came in at 49.2, down from 50.9 in March and below market calls for a 51.0 reading. In U.S. the Commerce Department said new home sales rose 1.5% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 417,000 units following a 7.6% drop in February. Analysts expected the March reading to rise to 420,000 units. Still, there are signs physical demand for gold remains robust. The U.S. Mint ran out of the smallest gold coin it sells and was forced to suspend sales as a result. That coin weighs one tenth of an ounce while the most popular gold coin sold by the U.S. mint weighs a full ounce. Elsewhere, Comex silver for May deliver rose 0.50% to USD22.930 per ounce while copper for May delivery added 0.30% to 3.098 per ounce."
