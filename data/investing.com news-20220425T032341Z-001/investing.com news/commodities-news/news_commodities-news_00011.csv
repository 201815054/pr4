1,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 05, 2017 09:22AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Prices Remain Higher as Optimism Dominates,"Investing.com - Crude oil prices remained higher on Thursday, as optimism dominated markets following news of a far larger-than-expected decline in U.S. stockpiles and the potential extension of output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude November contract was up 15 cents or about 0.30% at $50.13 a barrel by 9:20 a.m. ET (13:20 GMT), off a two-week low of $49.85 hit overnight.
Prices remained supported after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Wednesday that crude oil inventories fell by 6.023 million barrels in the week ended September 29, compared to expectations for a decline of around 756,000 barrels.
However, traders were disappointed to learn that U.S. crude oil exports jumped to 1.98 million bpd last week, surpassing the 1.5 million bpd record set the previous week.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for November delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up 39 cents or about 0.70% at $56.19 a barrel, off the previous session's two-week lows of $55.39.
The commodity benefitted from comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday saying that a pledge by OPEC and other producers, including Russia, to cut oil output to boost prices could be extended to the end of 2018, instead of expiring in March 2018.
In addition, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Thursday that deals between his country and Russia have helped stabilize crude prices and that global energy markets wille be able handle supplies of U.S. shale oil next year thanks to an increase in demand.
Oil prices have been well supported in recent weeks amid growing optimism that the crude market was well on its way towards rebalancing as data showed strong compliance from major producers with their supply cut agreement.
In May, OPEC and non-OPEC members led by Russia agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.

 Comex gold futures were up $2.98, or about 0.24%, at $1,279.87 a troy ounce by 09:00 a.m. ET (13:00 GMT), still within close distance of Tuesday's eight-week low of $1,271.00.
The greenback found support after the U.S. Department of Labor said initial jobless claims fell more than expected to 260,000 last week.
Another report showed that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed in August and that exports climbed to a two-and-a-half year high.
Separately, speaking at a conference in Austin, Texas, Philadelphia Fed Bank President Patrick Harker on Thursday said he is still planning on one more rate hike this year and three next year.
""I still have three rate hikes in for next year, but again we will have to see how the dynamics play out,"" Harker said.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.27% at 93.56, not far from Tuesday's one-and-a-half month high of 93.78.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for November delivery dipped 0.18% to $49.89 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent was flat at $55.77 a barrel.
Novak said in a television interview that Russia wants to continue to monitor supply and demand working with OPEC, adding that while compliance has been more than 100% for output curbs, with Saudi Arabia and Russia pulling extra weight, there has been some slippage that was being addressed.
Overnight, crude oil prices settled lower on Wednesday as data showing U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell for the second straight week was offset by a sharp uptick in exports which could dampen Opec's efforts to reduce supply.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 6m barrels in the week ended Sept. 29, handily beating expectations of a draw of 756,000 barrels.
Gasoline inventories, one of the products that crude is refined into, rose by roughly 1.6 barrels, missing expectations of a draw of 1.1m barrels while distillate stockpiles fell by 2.6 barrels, topping expectations of a decline of 1.8m barrels.
The draw to crude stockpiles comes against a backdrop of surge in U.S. crude oil exports to 1.98m barrels a day as the wide spread between Brent and crude oil prices continued to drive demand for U.S. crude oil.Some analysts, however, suggested that the surge in U.S. crude exports could undermine Opec and other major oil producers' efforts to curb output.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2017 09:13PM ET</span>",Special Report: The bankrupt utility behind Puerto Rico’s power crisis,"By Nick Brown, Robin Respaut and Jessica Resnick-Ault
SALINAS, Puerto Rico/NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the rural village of Salinas in southern Puerto Rico, frayed electric lines hanging from a utility pole blew in the breeze last week near the town square.
But the damage didn’t come from Hurricane Maria.
“Those wires were actually there before,” said Fermin Seda, 68, a Salinas resident who said he has grown accustomed to downed lines and power outages.
Two weeks after the storm plunged the island into a blackout, less than 10 percent of Puerto Rico’s 3.4 million people have seen power restored - and many will wait months.
Restoring the grid after the worst storm to hit here in nine decades would be a monumental task even for a well-run utility. It will be much harder for the chronically underfunded Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which went bankrupt in July amid mounting maintenance problems, years-long battles with creditors, a shrinking workforce and frequent management turnover.
Interviews with more than two dozen officials and consultants who work for or with the U.S. territory's government, PREPA or its creditors reveal a utility that was unprepared for a major storm despite the ever-present risk to this Caribbean island. When Maria hit, PREPA was trying to simultaneously finance an operational overhaul and dig out from about $8 billion in debt.
Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, in an interview with Reuters on Saturday, said none of the utility's storm response plans could account for years of poor maintenance of the dilapidated electric network.
“The emergency plan was as follows: There is no way to fix the nature of the grid,” Rossello said. 
He added that the network was so feeble it would have collapsed even in a much weaker storm than the one that hit Puerto Rico at Category 4 wind strength - the second highest level in the five-tier U.S. storm gauge. 
“If you have an old grid susceptible to collapse, there is no way - until you change it completely - that it can sustain the winds of a Category 4, or even really a Category 2,” the governor said.
CHRONIC WEAKNESSES
A host of chronic problems at PREPA left the island’s electric grid vulnerable to collapse in a major storm, Reuters found. They include:
Ricardo Ramos, who took over as the utility's chief executive in March, told Reuters that the number of employee departures over the past five years is actually closer to 4,000 - with the vast majority being key operational workers such as linemen, power plant operators and mechanics.
They were exactly the kind of workers the utility couldn't afford to lose.
""PREPA did not invest in new power plants or new generation, so our power plants are very, very old; our distribution system is very, very old,"" Ramos said in an interview on Monday.
One pivotal question now is whether the United States will work merely to patch the existing network or allocate billions of dollars in federal funds to overhaul it. The government is open to spending money on modernization, Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert said at a briefing last week.
The White House did not respond to Reuters’ inquiries seeking comment on the short- and long-term U.S. roles in restoring power to this U.S. territory. 
'THE LONG HAUL'
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) told Reuters that the agency is “in this for the long haul” but offered no details on the level of funding it could commit to the island’s power grid. 
Citizens of Puerto Rico do not receive services equal to U.S. states but also do not pay federal income tax.
The collapse of the grid isn’t the only cause of the island’s suffering. The U.S. relief effort so far has been unable to supply Puerto Rico with all the fuel it requires, for instance, leaving motorists waiting in long gasoline-station lines and depriving many backup electricity generators of diesel. 
The lengthy electrical outages are a bitter pill for storm victims, who before Maria had already endured frequent service interruptions and rates higher than any U.S. state except Hawaii, according to PREPA and the U.S. Energy Department.
The impacts go well beyond temporary discomfort. The lack of power has been a key factor in a humanitarian crisis as residents with no refrigeration for food and medicine scrambled to find open stores and waited in endless lines.
In Salinas, 54-year-old Maria Sanchez wept as she threw out all of the food inside her mother's fridge. By Saturday, she and six family members were surviving on crackers after eating all the other non-perishable food in the house.
""We are not rich - to throw away food like that. We're running out of food - like fast,"" she said, sitting on the porch, where a mild sea breeze offered little reprieve from the oppressive heat. 
Diabetic Nancy Rivera lost more than food.
""All of my insulin is ruined,"" said Rivera, 59, of Santurce, a district in San Juan, who stopped taking her spoiled medicine four days after the storm.
'TRIAGE' OF GRID REPAIRS
Winds of up to 155 mph (250 km/hr) during Maria knocked out about 80 percent of PREPA's distribution network, said Ramos, the utility’s chief executive. Since the storm, power has been limited to key locales such as hospitals and hotels using generators fueled with a scarce supply of diesel.
Damage assessment for the grid, usually completed within 48 hours of a hurricane in the mainland United States, took a week-and-a-half, Ramos said. The assessment went as fast as possible given the widespread damage, he said, and the utility had three working helicopters to survey the network.
FEMA last week put the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - often tasked with infrastructure projects - in charge of short-term power restoration, in coordination with the Energy Department, the American Public Power Association and the New York Power Authority.
Gil Quiniones, CEO of NYPA, said the Army Corps had asked his utility for experts in power systems - which isn’t a Corps specialty - who can “think strategically on how to triage the situation and how to prioritize the work."" 
The task is made more daunting by the island's ill-maintained infrastructure. And PREPA's strapped finances mean it cannot keep large standing orders for full-scale repair operations to swarm in after disasters, as utility repairman did last month in Florida after Hurricane Irma.
Ramos said PREPA has about 30 days worth of existing supplies for repairs following a storm; more is being ordered, to arrive in the next few weeks, he said.
'THEY CAN'T TELL ME HOW LONG'
On the south side of Puerto Rico, near most of the island's power plants, broken wires and blackouts were common before Maria.
“They tell me that right now, they’re evaluating damage to the power grid in our region,” Salinas Mayor Karilyn Bonilla said on Friday. ""And they can’t tell me how long that will take.” 
Bonilla said she has seen workers remove a few transformers since Maria hit but no one fixing downed power lines.
The amount of time power plants were down due to unplanned outages, measured in megawatt hours, more than doubled between mid-2015 and mid-2016, according to Synapse, the consultant firm.
By summer 2016, residents were experiencing four to five times the number of outages as the average U.S. customer, the consultants wrote.
The system's deficiencies were laid bare in September 2016, when a transformer fire knocked out half of the island's power, which wasn't fully restored for nearly a week, forcing the governor to declare a state of emergency.
""Basically it was what you can call an unfortunate set of events, but really it is what I have said since I began at PREPA: lack of maintenance,"" Ramos said.
One of the biggest factors in the outages: a constantly shrinking staff, driven away by costly medical benefits and unsafe conditions. The utility's April report notes PREPA had a greater-than-average number of safety incidents for U.S. utilities, with more than 14,000 accidents and 15 fatalities in a 10-year period.
Many workers left for better opportunities, Ramos said. Because Puerto Ricans are American citizens, they face no legal barriers in leaving the island for the mainland.
“The truth of the matter is they make a lot more money in the U.S.,"" said Ramos.
FIGHT FOR CONTROL 
U.S. utilities are regulated by the states in which they operate, and by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission if they operate across state lines. U.S. federal oversight of PREPA is limited to environmental and safety standards and does not cover the transmission network.
Unlike utilities in U.S. states, PREPA had no regulator for decades and essentially governed itself. In 2014, the Puerto Rico Energy Commission was created by the island's legislature, which sought greater oversight in response to perceived neglect by PREPA's leadership at the time, which resisted the intervention.
Weeks after the act passed, PREPA became insolvent.
Today, the political squabbling over control of PREPA - and blame for its problems - continues even as utility officials respond to a historic crisis.
Ramon Luis Nieves - former head of Puerto Rico's senate energy committee and a champion of the 2014 legislation - blasted former utility officials for poor oversight in an interview last week.
""Using their powers of self-regulation, PREPA itself was judge and jury,"" he said as he waited in a five-hour gasoline line.
Energy Commissioner Angel Rivera said former PREPA officials gave the new regulator nothing in the way of disaster plans.
“If PREPA did any sort of analysis like this when they were creating the system, we would not know,"" said Rivera, who was appointed in November 2014. 
PREPA also fought the commission's requirements to integrate renewable energy, said Nieves, the former senator. The commission rejected the utility's first long-term plan to create a more reliable, cost-effective grid as inadequate, according to commission records.
Attempts by Reuters to reach PREPA's previous chief executive, Javier Quintana, were unsuccessful.
Ramos - Quintana’s successor and a former engineer and PREPA employee - said he agreed with the need for an oversight commission when it was formed. But he now believes the commission wields too much power, citing its pushback on the utility’s capital spending.
""I basically have no power,"" he said. ""Basically, they wanted to run PREPA except during a hurricane, because now they are nowhere to be found.""
Jose Roman, interim chairman of the energy commission, disputed the notion that the commission wanted to run the utility, saying it only aimed to protect customers.
YEARS OF REBUILDING AHEAD
What remains unclear is the level of commitment from FEMA, the Army Corps and U.S. utilities for longer-term upgrades to buttress the system against future storms.
Bossert, the U.S. Homeland security advisor, said on Sept. 28 that the power grid would have to be rebuilt, ""so we're going to put federal money into this.""
The costs will be steep: The $4 billion estimate for modernization from PREPA does not include additional damage from Maria.
The task will be complicated by PREPA’s battles with creditors, who are led by hedge funds and mutual funds. The parties had been in debt restructuring talks for three years before the agency filed for bankruptcy in July.
A group of PREPA's largest creditors, which include Franklin Advisers, Oppenheimer Funds and BlueMountain Capital, offered a loan of $1 billion after the hurricane. The island's fiscal oversight committee rejected the offer, calling it a ""publicity stunt"" and criticizing the repayment and interest terms as unfavorable. 
A spokesperson for the creditors declined to comment on that statement but the investment firms’ advisor, investment bank Houlihan Lokey, earlier expressed disappointment that the proposed loan had been rejected without negotiation.
The utility had considered but not yet implemented a wide variety of infrastructure improvements when senior leadership turned over after Rossello became governor at the beginning of the year. The governor typically appoints PREPA's board and executive director.
Now new honchos are starting over in assessing PREPA’s needs, a repeat of past leadership transitions.
In the summer of 2016, PREPA held its 2017 public budgeting proceeding - the first led by the island’s utility commission rather than the utility itself. 
Amid the deep financial problems of the island's government and the utility, the commission allocated about $400 million for PREPA to address maintenance and repairs for the year, Commissioner Rivera said. Overall capital improvement plans for 20 years come to $2 billion, according to commission consultant Synapse. 
Even the long-term plan represents just a fraction of what will be needed, suggesting the grid overhaul will require a serious commitment from the United States. Discussions about that reality are starting now.
""There’s diverging sentiments on the role of U.S. funding,"" said a private sector energy executive who is working with PREPA to fix the networks and has been involved in strategy discussions with officials from FEMA and Puerto Rico.
""That’s where things start to get stuck,"" he said. ""No one argues about a generator in a hospital, but that doesn’t get the lights in the houses turned back on. Nobody knows where the money is going to come from.""

10,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2017 03:56PM ET</span>",Oil slips after surprising increase in U.S. crude exports,"By David Gaffen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday after a surprising jump in U.S. crude exports to a record 2 million barrels per day fanned worries about global oversupply. 
U.S. crude stockpiles fell sharply last week, but crude exports rose to 1.98 million bpd, the Energy Information Administration said. [EIA/S]
U.S. exports have became more attractive to buyers because the price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) futures has been trading at a steep discount to Brent. 
Rising U.S. crude production has held down WTI prices, while Brent's price has been heavily influenced by policy directions over output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
WTI (CLc1) settled down 44 cents to $49.98 a barrel while Brent (LCOc1) fell 20 cents to $55.80 a barrel. 
The spread between the two benchmark's December contracts , which had narrowed earlier in the day, widened again, to $5.54 a barrel from $5.31 before the data. 
The concern among traders is that the heavy increase in U.S. exports - while shale production continues to rise - will undermine the OPEC-led efforts to reduce supply.
""The U.S. oil-production profile has forced OPEC and some non-OPEC countries participating in the ongoing output-cap agreement to re-evaluate their strategy,"" said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.
U.S. crude inventories  fell 6 million barrels in the week to Sept. 29, a much bigger decline than the decrease of 756,000 barrels analysts had expected. Gulf Coast refineries have been using more crude as they resumed operations after weeks of shutdowns following Hurricane Harvey. 
Strategists viewed Brent as pricey after a third-quarter rally lifted it to mid-2015 highs by late September. A resumption in output at Libya's Sharara oilfield, which had been closed by armed brigades Sunday, fed the concerns. 
""Fundamentals may not yet be strong enough to support a continued rally, especially in growth-dependent commodities such as oil,"" Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark's Saxo Bank, said in a quarterly outlook to investors.
Observers said a market rebalancing was well underway as a result of strong consumption and the OPEC-led output cuts.
On Wednesday, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said he was confident his organisation could restore sustainable stability to markets. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he did not exclude an extension of output cuts until the end of 2018. Russia is part of the supply agreement.
Rising oil production in the United States, which is not involved in the deal, has limited price gains. U.S. output  hit 9.56 million bpd at the end of September, highest since July 2015, and drillers added six oil rigs in the week to Sept. 29, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 21 cents, or around 0.4%, to $50.62 a barrel by 10:35 a.m. ET (14:35GMT). Prices were at around $50.27 prior to the release of the inventory data.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., rose 12 cents, or about 0.2%, to $56.10 a barrel, after hitting a two-week low of $55.39 earlier in the session.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 6.023 million barrels in the week ended September 29.
Market analysts' expected a crude-stock decline of around 756,000 barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday reported a supply drop of 4.0 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, increased by 1.5 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
However, the report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 1.644 million barrels, compared to expectations for a 1.088 million barrel rise. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a fall of 2.606 million barrels.
Oil prices were under pressure in recent sessions as a rise in U.S. drilling and higher OPEC output put the brakes on a rally that helped prices notch their biggest third-quarter gain in 13 years.
In May, OPEC and non-OPEC members led by Russia agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
However, prices have pulled back around 5% so far this month amid concern that U.S. producers will increase output and possibly ramp up even more quickly to take advantage of recently higher prices."

Comex gold futures were little changed at $1,278.63 a troy ounce by 09:00 a.m. ET (13:00 GMT), off session highs of $1,284.93 and still close to the previous session's eight-week low of $1,271.00.
Payrolls processor ADP reported on Wednesday that the U.S. private sector added 135,000 jobs last month.
But sentiment on the greenback remained fragile amid speculation the next Fed head could be less hawkish than expected continued to weigh.
Fed Governor Jerome Powell and former governor Kevin Warsh were both interviewed at the White House last week to replace current Fed Chair Janet Yellen next February.
While the two men are seen as serious candidates, Powell is considered as more dovish than Warsh, who has criticised the Fed's bond-buying programme in the past.
The dollar strengthened earlier in the week on speculation that Warsh might be the leading candidate to replace Yellen.
The greenback has also been supported recently by hopes for U.S. tax reform after the Trump administration outlined plans for a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code last week.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.24% at 93.20, just off a one-and-a-half month highs of 93.78 hit on Tuesday.
Gold is sensitive to moves in the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency.
Fresh comments from Janet Yellen were at the top the agenda for global financial markets on Wednesday, as they look for further hints on the timing of the next rate hike.
Yellen is due to deliver a speech at a community banking conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis at 3:15 p.m. ET (19:15GMT).

OSLO (Reuters) - Demand for offshore rig rental globally is starting to recover from its worst ever downturn, led by oil firms' growing demand for harsh-environment exploration and triggering multi-billion dollar tie-ups among drillers hoping to profit, executives said.
While the 2014-2016 oil price crash caused firms to cut exploration budgets, ending a boom in rig demand and bankrupting many owners, energy companies are now seeking to replenish their hydrocarbon reserves.
The nascent demand for harsh-environment rigs, particularly for North Sea drilling, could lead to increased rates for these units as soon as 2018, and other categories may follow in 2019 or 2020, companies and analysts say.
 Transocean  (S:RIGN) Chief Executive Jeremy Thighpen told UBS analysts he would not be surprised to see next fixtures for such rigs to rise to $300,000 from current levels of around $200,000.
Oslo-based Pareto Securities also said it expected day rates for modern harsh-environment rigs to rise to $250,000-$300,000 in contracts awarded in 2018, with other segments rising later.
Nordea bank said it saw the rig market in the North Sea tightening in 2018, particularly for high-end rigs, with Odfjell Drilling (OL:ODLL) signing in August a nine-month contract with Aker BP (OL:AKERBP) at a day rate of $250,000.
Analysts mostly have ""Buy"" or ""Strong Buy"" ratings for  Borr Drilling  (OL:BDRILL), Odfjell Drilling, Transocean and Northern Drilling , according to Thomson Reuters data, as they have the most exposure to harsh-environment rigs, the newest fleets and the lowest debts in the sector. 
However, Simen Lieungh, chief executive of Odfjell Drilling, told Reuters he did not expect day rates rising significantly to $350,000-400,000 until late 2019.
Historically, the percentage of the global fleet that has being utilized had to rise to 85 percent or more for day rates to increase significantly. Today they are around 60-70 percent, depending on the rig segment.
""I think we can see utilization moving into the 80s during the next 12 months,"" Borr's Chief Executive Simon Johnson told Reuters, referring to jack-up rigs, used in shallow waters.
Some, however, pointing to a large supply overhang in the jack-up market, with total supply counting more than 500 units, while current demand is around 300. Nordea says some 100-200 jack-up rigs may need to be scrapped before day rates improve.
M&A
Eying a market upturn, some executives are now busy seeking mergers and acquisitions.
London-based Ensco's (N:ESV) shareholders will vote on Thursday on whether to approve the board's proposal to buy smaller rival Atwood Oceanics.
Some shareholders have questioned the timing and the value of the deal, but the management has defended it.
""We believe the offshore drilling sector is entering a recovery phase following an extended downturn ...,"" Ensco's Chief Executive Carl Trowell told investors on Sept. 22.
""... now is the time to make counter-cyclical investments in the highest-specification assets...,"" he added.
Other recent deals include Transocean (N:RIG) buying Norway's Songa Offshore (OL:SONG) and Borr Drilling acquiring 15 jack-up rigs from Transocean in March.
 Seadrill  (OL:SDRL), controlled by Norwegian-born billionaire John Fredriksen, expects the recovery to help it to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings next August.
""We have decided to restructure our finances so we can build a bridge to the upturn in the industry when fleet utilization and day rates return to more normal levels,"" Seadrill said.
Danish conglomerate A.P. Moller-Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) is seeking buyers for its unlisted Maersk Drilling unit, industry and investor sources said.

""After the worst downturn in history, we have entered the recovery phase,"" said Gunnar Eliassen, director at Northern Drilling, a new rig company set up with Fredriksen.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka has blocked a proposal by Chinese firms bidding to build the island's biggest oil refinery to sell fuel locally, fearing a threat to domestic firms that dominate the small but growing market.
The veto is the latest in a tussle over Chinese investments in Hambantota, a southern town near an important shipping route, where China controls the sea port and plans an industrial zone for Chinese firms and a $3 billion refinery with annual output of around 5 million tonnes.
China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corp, a subsidiary of state-owned China National Petroleum Corp, and private refiner Shandong Dongming Petrochemical Group have jointly bid for the refinery located near the port.
Government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said the Chinese companies had asked to sell refined products on to the local market, but had been told just to export.
""The Chinese companies asked permission (to supply local markets), but we did not give them permission. We asked them to participate in tenders of local suppliers, if they want to sell locally,"" he told Reuters.
 Another government official, who didn't want to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media, said Sri Lanka did not want to cede control of the local fuel market to Chinese firms.
Sri Lanka's $6 billion market is controlled by state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corp and  Lanka IOC  (CM:LIOC), a subsidiary of Indian Oil Corp (NS:IOC).
""We have asked the Chinese firms to go for partnership with existing players if they want to sell their products in the local market,"" the official said. ""We don't want both our companies to suffer by letting another player in.""
The two Chinese companies seeking local market access did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Hambantota is part of China's vast Belt and Road initiative to build trade and transport links across Asia and into Europe, but Beijing's widening footprint has raised concerns in India, the United States and even Europe.
New Delhi sees the massive investment in the port town as another sign of the threat of China's growing influence in the region. Even in Sri Lanka, the plan has been criticised for the loss of land and, more broadly, the tiny nation's sovereignty.
This year, Sri Lanka revised the terms of its deal with China Merchants Port Holdings (HK:0144), which has a 99-year lease on the Hambantota port, to give greater influence to a local state-run partner.
A Chinese source in Colombo briefed on the refinery discussions said the two Chinese firms had made an informal request for the refinery's products to be sold locally, but had been told by the Sri Lankan authorities that such a move could spark demonstrations by local trade unions.
For the moment, the Chinese source said, the refinery deal was going forward.
The two Chinese firms began exploring the possibility of building the refinery 18 months ago, and private refiner Dongming is looking to take a controlling stake, officials from the companies said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's soybean imports from the United States are likely to be delayed by at least two weeks as suppliers struggle to find high-quality beans following crop damage from hurricanes, two trade sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Shipment delays could result in tight supplies at the end of October and early November, they warned, driving up soymeal and soyoil prices in the world's biggest importer of soybeans.
""Exporters are asking Chinese buyers to lower the quality specification, but they are not agreeing,"" said one Singapore-based trader at an international trading company with oilseed processing facilities in China. The trader declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media.
China, which buys about 65 percent of soybeans traded worldwide, has been snapping up U.S. soybean cargoes in recent weeks, taking advantage of a nearly 10 percent decline in prices since mid-July.
But early harvested soybeans, produced near the Mississippi Delta, suffered damage from hurricanes last month, making it difficult for exporters to meet quality specifications agreed with Chinese buyers, the trade sources said.
GRAPHIC: China soybean imports delayed by U.S. quality concerns: http://reut.rs/2yn8WJt 
The poor bean quality is causing delays at U.S. Gulf terminals, with waiting times for ships rising to 10-12 days from the usual five days at this time of the year, the traders said. 
Low water levels in the Mississippi river due to dry weather could add to delays in shipping crops as the harvest gathers momentum. 
Back-ups at aging locks have slowed navigation on the Mississippi and its tributaries and driven the cost of hauling Midwestern crops to Gulf Coast terminals to near-record highs.
This has left U.S. farmers struggling to find room to store their just-harvested corn and soybeans while grain storage on the river's banks is filling up.
""Some Chinese buyers are trying to book cargoes from U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) ports,"" said a trader at a state-owned trading company in China, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""We think this will be a temporary issue - some tightness in supplies toward the end of October and early November. It will support meal and oil values.""
The Pacific Northwest is typically an export hub for wheat, not soybeans. 
The trader said China was amply supplied with beans as of now, following record purchases from Brazil in the past few months.
China imported 8.45 million tonnes of soybeans in August, according to customs data, a record for the month, as improving processing margins boosted demand. 
GRAPHIC: China soybean imports by month: http://reut.rs/2j958og 

The August import figure was up 10.2 percent from last year's 7.67 million tonnes, but down 16.2 percent from 10.08 million tonnes in July, according to figures from the General Administration of Customs of China.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report at 10:30AM ET (1430GMT).
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories declined by 4.0 million barrels in the week ended September 29 as refiners raised output.
However, the API report also showed a gain of 4.9 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks fell by 584,000 barrels.
There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dipped 30 cents, or around 0.6%, to $50.12 a barrel by 3:15AM ET (0715GMT). It reached its lowest since Sept. 19 at $49.91 earlier in the session.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., shed 31 cents to $55.69 a barrel.
Crude prices settled at a two-week low on Tuesday to notch their second-losing session in a row as a rise in U.S. drilling and higher OPEC output put the brakes on a rally that helped prices notch their biggest third-quarter gain in 13 years.
Prices have rallied in recent weeks after data showed strong compliance from major producers with their supply cut agreement and a plethora of energy agencies suggested global demand is increasing.

Her comments will be monitored closely for any new insight on policy. Last week, Yellen said that the central bank plans to continue gradual rate hikes despite broad uncertainty about the path of inflation.
Investors viewed her remarks as hawkish, which suggested that the Fed would raise rates in December, with further increases to follow in 2018.
The U.S. central bank has already raised rates twice this year.
Besides Yellen, market participants will also keep an eye out on a few U.S. economic reports to gauge how it will impact the Fed's view on monetary policy in the coming months.
Wednesday's calendar features the ADP private sector nonfarm payrolls report at 8:15AM ET (1215GMT), which is often seen as a warmup act for the big Friday government jobs report, as well as the ISM non-manufacturing survey due at 10AM ET (14:00GMT).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Tuesday as speculators took profits for a second day after big third-quarter gains and on concerns that higher prices might spur increased U.S. shale production.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) closed down 12 cents or 0.2 percent to $56.00 a barrel, having lost almost 2.5 percent on Monday. U.S. crude (CLc1) futures fell 16 cents or 0.3 percent to $50.42.
Brent notched up a third-quarter gain of about 20 percent, the biggest increase for that quarter since 2004, and traded as high as $59.49 last week, but has since fallen about 6 percent.
Money managers pushed bullish bets on the Brent crude market to a record high in the last week, encouraged by signs of rebalancing between supply and demand. [O/ICE]
But when positioning becomes too stretched, this can lead to abrupt shifts in the price. 
""You’ve reached a place where the market needs a drumbeat of positive information to sustain a rally,"" said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
""The question is if demand and the supply cut are enough to offset the increase in (U.S.) production that’s coming.""
Oil rose slightly on Tuesday following comments from OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo that compliance with the oil output cut deal between OPEC and non-OPEC nations is extremely high. He added that the global oil cartel was looking forward to strengthening its cooperation with Russia.
Last week prices rose on tension in Iraqi Kurdistan after the region's independence vote, with Turkey threatening to close a pipeline that brings oil from the region in northern Iraq to the Mediterranean. Turkey has not carried out the threat, analysts said.
However, Middle Eastern oil producers are concerned the price rise will stir U.S. shale producers into more drilling and push prices lower again. 
""Any time we get above 50 dollars a barrel drilling starts to ramp up, and that’s going to bring the price of oil back down again,"" said Mark Watkins, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank.
He also noted that the summer driving season has come to an end, pushing down demand as autumn begins.

 The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude November contract was at $50.27 a barrel, down 19 cents or about 0.38% by 9:00 a.m. ET (13:00 GMT), just off the previous session's two-week low of $50.08.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for November delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was down 35 cents or about 0.62% at $55.77 a barrel, not far from Monday's one-week trough of $55.78.
The Energy Information Administration will release its weekly report on Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 0.5 million barrels, which would mark the second weekly decline in a row.
Crude prices remained under pressure after data on Friday showed that U.S. energy companies added oil rigs for the first time in seven weeks last week.
The commodity had been well supported in recent weeks amid growing optimism that the crude market was well on its way towards rebalancing as data showed strong compliance from major producers with their supply cut agreement.
In May, OPEC and non-OPEC members led by Russia agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.

U.S. natural gas  for November delivery was at $2.907 per million British thermal units by 8:35AM ET (1235GMT), down 2.2 cents, or around 0.8%, after tumbling 9.1 cents, or 3%, in the last session.
Natural gas futures sank to a three-week low on Monday amid bearish weather forecasts which should limit demand for the fuel.
Warm high pressure will quickly strengthen and expand east of the Plains this week with widespread highs of upper 60 to near 80°F across the northern U.S. and 80s to locally near 90°F over the southern U.S., according to NatGasWeather.com.
Gas futures often reach a seasonal low in October, when mild weather reduces demand, before recovering in the winter, when heating-fuel use peaks.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.466 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 3.5% lower than levels at this time a year ago and in line with the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 48 and 58 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 29.
That compares with a gain of 58 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 80 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 91 billion cubic feet.

Ahead the American Petroleum Institute (API) will release its estimates of crude and refined product stocks, followed by official data from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.
Crude oil inventories are seen down by 467,000 barrels, while distillates likely declined by 1.1917 million barrels and gasoline stocks rose 967,000 barrels.
Overnight, crude oil prices settled lower on Monday amid signs of an uptick in crude output as data showed Opec oil output rose last month while an increase in U.S. drilling activity pointed to rising domestic production.

A recent Reuters poll revealed that output among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries rose by 50,000 barrels a day in September as the cartel’s overall compliance with its production-cut agreement fell to 86%. The dip in compliance comes after both Nigeria and Libya – two countries exempt from the production-cut agreement – ramped up output.

Nigeria agreed in July to support OPEC's production cap but only after its crude output reaches 1.8 million barrels per day.
The rise in Opec production dampened recent optimism on oil prices which followed after Opec revealed at a meeting last month that its members’ compliance with the global accord to curb output hit record highs in August.

37,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 02, 2017 09:30PM ET</span>","China Energy Firm Head Riffs on Rosneft in 12,000 Character Note","(Bloomberg) -- While there’s a risk of crude sliding below $30 as demand is displaced by alternative energy, it’ll still be needed for making petrochemicals, said the head of the enigmatic Chinese company that last month bought a $9 billion stake in Rosneft Oil Co.
In a note running longer than 12,000 Chinese characters posted on CEFC China Energy Co.’s WeChat account, Founder and Chairman Ye Jianming justified purchasing a chunk of the Russian firm from  Glencore  Plc an (LON:GLEN)d Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund -- a deal that’s thrust the previously little-known firm into the global spotlight. He also riffed on everything from his nation’s history and philosophy to the future of fossil fuels and electric vehicles.
With crude’s slump since 2014 wreaking havoc on Russia’s economy, and Western sanctions adding more pressure, there was an opportunity to take a relatively cheap share in Rosneft and contribute to the long-term supply security of China, the world’s biggest energy user, Ye said. Moreover, privately held CEFC wasn’t under pressure to exit some businesses amid weak oil and gas prices, unlike more traditional players in the industry, he said.
“Won’t the acquisition of these oil and gas resources become a burden? Of course not,” Ye said in the note. He said crude’s use will prove critical in the production of petrochemicals, which are used to make everything from plastics to fabric.
Scarce Chemicals
“Chemical products have been scarce, and oil is the raw material that’s used for chemical processing,” he said. CEFC plans to work with Rosneft and Abu Dhabi to produce petrochemicals for the Chinese market, according to Ye.
In February, CEFC signed a deal with Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. for a share of an onshore venture that includes state-run giant China National Petroleum Corp., as well as international oil majors  BP  Plc and  Total  SA. The company curr (LON:BP)ently has more th (PA:TOTF)an 80 million metric tons of foreign crude oil equity, of which 42 millicrude oils from Rosneft, 13 million tons is from Abu Dhabi and the remaining from Chad and Kazakhstan, Ye said in his note.
Brent crude, the benchmark for moreBrent crudethe world’s oil, was trading at $55.95 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at 8:36 a.m. Singapore time. Prices were at more than $115 a barrel in mid-2014.
The company’s steps toward securing oil supplies has been “very successful,” he said. CEFC is next seeking natural gas, which will be the resource usednatural gasture electricity generation, including for charging environment-friendly cars, as nations seek to curb pollution, according to Ye.
The company plans to boost upstream supplies in Qatar and Africa, according to Ye. He also predicted that aircraft and ships, as well as cars, would be powered by electricity in the future.
Belt And Road
CEFC has followed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s efforts to boost investment and construction across a trade route between China, Asia and Europe, in what is known as the “Belt and Road” initiative, amid his government’s encouragement of private enterprise.
Russia and Central Asia provide the best solutions to China’s oil and gas needs due to the ease of land transportation, enabling fuel to bypass potential supply bottlenecks in the Persian Gulf and Strait of Malacca, Ye said in his note.
Starting as a small trading firm almost two decades ago, CEFC bought assets including storage, terminals and oil fields, as well as financial units. In its statement about the Rosneft purchase, it described itself as China’s largest private oil and gas company, with 50,000 employees and revenue of more than $40 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil fell more than $1 a barrel on Monday as a rise in U.S. drilling and higher OPEC output put the brakes on a rally that helped prices notch their biggest third-quarter gain in 13 years.
Iraq announced its exports rose slightly in September while a Reuters survey showed OPEC overall boosted output. [OPEC/M]
U.S. drillers added six oil rigs in the week to Sept. 29, bringing the total count to 750, data from  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm showed on Friday. 
""We’ve seen them add rigs for the first time in seven weeks, so that changes sentiment as well,"" said John Tjornehoj, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging.
Brent crude, the global benchmark, settled down 67 cents or 1.2 percent to $56.12 a barrel. It had notched a third-quarter gain of about 20 percent, the biggest increase for that quarter since 2004, and traded as high as $59.49 last week. 
U.S. crude closed down $1.09 or 2.1 percent to $50.58. The U.S. benchmark posted its strongest quarterly gain since the second quarter of 2016.
Oil prices climbed last week on tension in Iraqi Kurdistan after the region's independence vote.
""The big short-term risk is obviously the pipeline,"" said James Williams, president of energy consultant WTRG Economics. ""So far Turkey hasn't closed the Kurdish pipeline.""
The rally had also been driven by signs that a three-year crude glut is easing, helped by a production cut deal among global producers led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
But a Reuters survey on Friday found OPEC oil output rose last month, mostly because of higher production in Iraq and also Libya, an OPEC member exempt from cutting output.
However, Libya's National Oil Company in a letter on Monday declared force majeure on deliveries from Sharara, the country's largest oilfield.
Middle Eastern oil producers are concerned the price rise will stir U.S. shale producers into more drilling and push prices lower again. Key OPEC producers consider a price above $60 as encouraging too much shale output.​
Hedge funds have accumulated a record bullish position in middle distillates such as diesel, heating oil and gasoil, anticipating stocks will be relatively tight this winter.

""We've seen a run up in heating oil futures, and I think that particular product has supported the rise of WTI,"" said Tjornehoj, while noting that distillate prices fell on Monday. ""As we reverse here lower we see the recent strong correlation continuing.""

Since the Russian president went on a geopolitical offensive in Ukraine in 2014, the haven asset had its first annual gain in four years in 2016 and is on track for another in 2017. A beneficiary of economic and political perils from North Korea to Brexit, it’s among the top-performing commodities this year.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Russia has more than doubled the pace of gold purchases, bringing the share of bullion in its international reserves to the highest of Putin’s 17 years in power, according to World Gold Council data. In the second quarter alone, it accounted for 38 percent of all gold purchased by central banks.
The gold rush is allowing the Bank of Russia to continue growing its reserves while abstaining from purchases of foreign currency for more than two years. It’s one of a handful of central banks to keep the faith as global demand for the precious metal fell to a two-year low in the second quarter. But what may matter most is that gold is as geopolitics-proof an investment as any in the age of sanctions and a deepening rift with the U.S.
“Gold is an asset that is independent of any government and, in effect, given what is usually held in reserves, any western government,” said Matthew Turner, metals analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in London. “This might appeal given Russia has faced financial sanctions.”
Besides being the largest official buyer of gold, Russia is also among the world’s three biggest producers, with the central bank purchasing from domestic miners through commercial banks and not in the open market.
Since starting to accelerate bullion purchases in 2007, Russia’s holdings have more than quadrupled to 1,716 tons at the end of June, just behind China and more than Turkey, India and Mexico combined, according to the World Gold Council. That brought its share in Russia’s $427 billion reserves to near 17 percent.
High Tempo
If Russia’s buying continues at a similar pace, the World Gold Council said the full-year increase in 2017 “could closely match” the 200 tons purchased annually in 2015 and 2016.
The Bank of Russia declined to comment. Governor Elvira Nabiullina said in an interview last year that a portion of reserves is held in gold to ensure their diversification. Its gold holdings are all stored inside Russia, and the management of investments in precious metals is conducted separately from foreign-currency assets, according to the central bank’s website.
Although gold is still up over 11 percent in 2017, prices in September touched the lowest since August and suffered their biggest monthly loss this year. Plans by the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy are sapping the appeal of the non-interest-bearing metal as the dollar rebounds. Bullion for immediate delivery was down 0.3 percent to $1,275.51 at 2:03 p.m. in London.
The high share of gold in Russia’s reserves doesn’t worry Fitch Ratings, the only major credit assessor that ranks the country above junk.
“In the end, reserves have to be liquid,” said Erich Arispe, director at Fitch’s sovereigns and supranationals group. Similar to other commodities, gold “can be liquid as well. So at this point, we don’t detect any concern about reserves.”

Comex gold futures were down $8.03 or about 0.63% at $1,276.79 a troy ounce by 08:30 a.m. ET (12:30 GMT), their lowest since August 16.
The dollar remained supported after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen indicated last week that the central bank was sticking to plans for a third rate hike this year.
The dollar received an additional boost from fresh hopes for U.S. tax reform after the Trump administration outlined plans for a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code last Wednesday.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.61% at a 93.48, the highest since August 23.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
But investors were cautious after a gunman opened fire at a country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip late Sunday, killing at least 50 people and wounding more than 200 others before the suspect was killed by police.
The death toll would make the attack the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures slid 0.33% to $16.62 a troy ounce."

Iraqi security forces were using bulldozers to control the fires started by the militants in the early hours of Saturday to slow the advance of U.S.-backed Iraqi forces and Shi'ite militia groups toward Hawija town, military officials said.
The Allas oilfield, 35 km (20 miles) south of Hawija, was one of the main sources of revenue for Islamic State, which in 2014 declared a caliphate in parts of Syria and Iraq.
""Terrorists are trying to use the rising smoke to avert air strikes while retreating from the area toward Hawija,"" said army Colonel Mohammed al-Jabouri.
Military officials said the fire had been brought under control at one of the wells, while the other two were still burning. They said it would take about three days to put out the fires.
Oil officials from the state-run North Oil Company said it was still too risky to send its crews in to assess damage at the wells as militants may have left bombs and landmines.
Iraq launched an offensive on Sept. 21 to dislodge Islamic State from Hawija.
Islamic State, the ultra-hardline Sunni Muslim group, has lost control of all the oilfields it once controlled in the north of Iraq.

55,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 01, 2017 07:09AM ET</span>","It'll Take Oil Above $50 for Shale Boom, Oil Sands to Pay Off","(Bloomberg) -- Shale drillers and oil sands producers have posted some healthy profits so far this year, but it’ll take oil consistently above $50 a barrel for their investments to pay off in the long run.
That’s the conclusion of a Moody’s Investors Service study of 37 exploration and production companies in the U.S. and Canada released Thursday. It’s also why legendary hedge fund manager Jim Chanos, who’s shorting shale driller Continental Resources Inc., says independent explorers have been a bad deal for shareholders.
Shale oil producers “are creatures of the capital markets,” Chanos told Bloomberg TV’s Julia Chatterley, Joe Weisenthal and Scarlet Fu. “Because the wells deplete so quickly, they constantly need to raise money to replace the assets.”
Producers in the U.S. and Canada have made dramatic efforts to cut costs since the collapse of oil prices three years ago, with many delivering higher dividends to investors this year. But with limited wiggle room to reduce costs further, any improvement in their ability to sustain healthy returns will have to come from commodity prices, Moody’s analysts Sreedhar Kona and Steven Wood said in the report.
The two analysts used a measure of how efficiently cash is generated to cover the costs of leasing drilling rights and boring wells, and still have enough left over to invest in future projects.
“Companies will be able to demonstrate meaningful capital efficiency, measured by the leveraged full cycle ratio, only if the West Texas Intermediate oil price is above $50 per barrel and the Henry Hub natural gas price is at lnatural gasper million British thermal units,” they said.
With a few notable exceptions like Appalachian explorers Antero Resources Corp. and  Range Resources Corp  ., as well as Canadian shal (NYSE:RRC)e gas producer Seven Generations Energy Ltd., the ratio for the vast majority was way below a level Moody’s considers healthy.
Interestingly, the three best performers are focused on liquids-rich gas plays -- the Marcellus and Utica formations in the northeastern U.S. and the Montney shale in Alberta. Antero and Seven Generations have seen their cash flow from operations surge over the past few years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Producers’ leveraged full cycle ratio needs to be significantly above 1 for explorers to earn a meaningful return on their investment, the Moody’s analysts said. The average for the 37 explorers was 0.59 last year, according to the study. The ratios for the top three performers were above 1.5. Antero’s 2.19 ratio tops the list.
Among the lowest ranking were  Apache Corp  . and  Devon Energy  Corp., with ratio (NYSE:APA)s below 0.05, according (NYSE:DVN) to the report.

Seeking to control the oil income from the autonomous Kurdish region is central to Abadi's strategy after the Kurdish referendum on independence held on Monday.
The Kurdistan Regional Government said it plans to use the vote, which delivered an overwhelming yes for independence, as a mandate to seek the peaceful secession of the Kurdish region through talks with Abadi's government.
Abadi, who rejects any talks with the Kurds on independence, wrote in a tweet: ""Federal government control of oil revenues is in order to pay KR (Kurdistan Region) employee salaries in full.""
No other statement was forthcoming from the government. It was not clear whether Baghdad had had any success in taking control of oil income from the Kurdish region in the north of Iraq, which for years has kept oil revenue and paid Kurdish civil servants.
Abadi on Thursday said Turkey had told Iraq it would deal
only with the Iraqi government on crude oil exports. Iraqi Kurdish crude oil is exported to world markets through a pipeline to Turkey's Mediterranean coast. 
Baghdad imposed a ban on direct international flights to the Kurdish region on Friday.

WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hurricane Maria destroyed Puerto Rico's antiquated and bankrupt electrical system, leaving millions in the dark and utility crews scrambling to help.
Now some politicians and renewable energy investors see a golden opportunity in the crisis to use federal funds to re-invent the U.S. territory's grid as a storm-resistant network that relies less on costly coal and oil imports and more on local wind, solar, and batteries.
If it happens, it could ease power bills on an island that struggles with the second-costliest electricity in the United States, behind Hawaii, as well as infrastructure prone to failing in the region's frequent hurricanes.
""We cannot waste the opportunity of this crisis and federal aid package,"" said Ramon Luis Nieves, a Puerto Rican politician in the Popular Democratic Party, who headed the island's senate energy committee until his term expired in January.
""We need to focus on not only getting the grid back up, but improving it so it can tolerate more renewable energy.""
A set of bills introduced this week by U.S. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon would call on the Department of Energy to make the U.S. electric grid hardier against natural disasters, and would offer grants for small scale, grid connected solar and other projects.
A Wyden aide said Puerto Rico's utility, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), could apply for such grants to modernize the grid, or get funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to rebuild and then apply for the grants to help pay for upgrades.
Efforts to reach a PREPA official were not successful.
That government support would be crucial. PREPA was $9 billion in debt before declaring bankruptcy in July. Its equipment was already ""degraded and unsafe,"" according to a draft fiscal report the company filed in April.
Around half of Puerto Rico's electricity is generated from imported fuel oil, with another third coming from natural gas, and much of the rest from coal, according to the Department of Energy. 
Renewables supply about 2.4 percent, though the island has set a goal to obtain 20 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2035. 
FUTURE GRID
The prospect of a new grid in Puerto Rico has some renewable energy companies and investors interested. Jeff Ciachurski, CEO of Greenbriar Capital, a renewable energy investor in Puerto Rico, California and Arizona, said government support could open up new opportunities for the sector to take over market share.
""The federal government is in the driver's seat,"" he said.
Sunnova, a residential solar installer with 10,000 customers in Puerto Rico, said it was working with the governor to try to restore power off-grid in the short-term, but said the destruction also creates an opportunity to create a new, renewable-friendly grid. 
""Everybody can agree that what the future and the new power industry and system look like is not what was there before,"" John Berger, Sunnova CEO, told Reuters.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, is sending hundreds of batteries that can store power generated by solar panels to Puerto Rico to provide emergency help in the wake of Maria. A company spokesperson did not say what Tesla's future plans were.
On Friday, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said his team is looking at alternative ways to bring power back on the island, including by using microgrids, small power networks that can work independently of the main grid.
Judith Enck, a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator for Puerto Rico, said solar-powered microgrids, as well as buried power lines, could allow for a more rapid recovery after storms. 
Hurricane Maria left the entire island and its 3.4 million residents without power and destroyed 80 percent of its transmission and distribution infrastructure, according to the Department of Energy.

The Army Corps of Engineers has been placed in charge of restoring power as quickly as possible, a key step to restoring other basic services like water, fuel, and food.

58,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2017 05:00PM ET</span>","U.S. energy head seeks help for coal, nuclear power plants","By Timothy Gardner
(Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry has asked federal regulators to attempt to keep the nation's struggling coal and nuclear power plants open by rewarding them for contributing to the resilience of the electric grid, the Department of Energy said on Friday.
The move drew praise from the coal and nuclear power industries. But it raised alarm bells among renewable energy groups and environmentalists concerned that such incentives were unfair and could lead to an increase in emissions from coal plants linked to global warming and more toxic waste from nuclear plants before a permanent repository is built for the country. 
""The continued closure of traditional baseload power plants calls for a comprehensive strategy for long-term reliability and resilience,"" Perry said in a Sept. 28 letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). 
""States and regions are accepting increased risks that could affect the future reliability and resilience of electricity delivery,"" he wrote. 
Perry asked FERC to issue a rule within 60 days to allow certain baseload plants that maintain at least 90 days of fuel supply on site to recover their full costs through regulated pricing.
A FERC official did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Trump administration has previously said the retirement of hundreds of coal-fired power plants and some nuclear reactors in recent years had undermined the ability of the grid to stand up to peak-demand periods, including during severe cold winter weather. It has also criticized wind and solar power, both expanding rapidly, as being too heavily dependent on weather.
Perry commissioned a study in April to evaluate whether ""regulatory burdens"" imposed by past administrations, including that of former President Barack Obama, had hurt the grid by forcing shutdowns of baseload plants. 
That report, released last month, urged that incentives be used to boost coal-fired and nuclear plants, and blamed recent closures on competition with cheaper natural gas and growth of solar and wind power.
Maria Korsnick, head of the Nuclear Energy Institute, praised Perry's request. ""In the wake of the incredible disruptions caused by extreme weather events in recent years, including multiple hurricanes and polar vortices, the urgency to act in support of the resiliency of the electric grid has never been clearer,"" she said.
But powerful natural gas and renewable power interests warned the proposal may go too far. The American Wind Energy Association blasted the effort, saying it would ""upend competitive markets.""
""The best way to guarantee a resilient and reliable electric grid is through market-based compensation for performance, not guaranteed payments for some, based on a government-prescribed definition,"" AWEA spokeswoman Amy Farrell said.
Marty Durbin, the executive vice president and chief strategy officer at the American Petroleum Institute, which counts natural gas drillers among its members, said Perry's proposal appears to suggest that more regulation is the answer, when markets have already made the grid stronger.
""We need to be careful that government doesn't put its thumb on the scale,"" Durbin said. ""It’s better to let markets choose, which is what the United States is seeing with the growth of natural gas as the United States' leading energy source for electricity in 2016.”
The proposal was blasted by New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman as a ""head-in-the-sand approach"" that would undermine grid resiliency while promoting climate change.

The Trump administration is expected to soon take additional steps to help struggling coal plants. As soon as next week, the Environmental Protection Agency is expected to release a revised Clean Power Plan that would be softer on emissions from coal.

A victory for Iraqi Kurdish voters on independence from Iraq earlier this week has fuelled fears of a possible supply disruption in the region as the vote has angered Iraq’s central government and neighboring countries including Turkey. 
Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Monday warned his country could “close the valves” on the pipeline that carries 500,000-600,000 barrels of crude per day from northern Iraq to the Turkish port of Ceyhan. 
Investors weighed the possibility of a supply disruption in the oil-rich region against expectations that rising crude prices will attract a boom in US shale oil output. 
“A tug-of-war is developing again, this time between the threat to supply in northern Iraq and growing output from U.S. shale,” said Enrico Chiorando, an analyst at energy consultancy Love Energy. “Shale production has been increasing and will continue to weigh on prices, following Brent’s longest weekly bull run since June 2016 and its fifth-consecutive weekly gain.”
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said Friday its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the United States rose by 6 to 750.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand."

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $2.61, or 0.20%, to $1,290.40 a troy ounce.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edged up 0.1% last month. The commerce department said Friday.
Inflation, however remained subdued, as the core personal consumption expenditures price index slowed to 1.3% in August from 1.4% in July. The core PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and has a 2 percent target.
The duo of reports failed to diminish expectations that the Fed will hike rates later this year, as expectations for a December remained unchanged at 71% compared to last week.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
The precious metal is expected to come under pressure in the coming months amid growing rate hike expectations and renewed investor hopes for tax reform.
“A more hawkish shift in Fed policy expectations, good economic data, and optimism about tax reform are support the reflation argument, which is bad for gold prices in the months ahead,” said Tyler Richey, co-editor of the Sevens Report.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Oil edged higher on Friday as tensions around Iraqi Kurdistan threatened the region's crude supplies, helping Brent prices to their strongest third-quarter performance since 2004.
Global benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 17 cents at $57.58 a barrel at 1225 GMT, notching up a third-quarter gain of around 20 percent.
The contract had reached its highest in more than two years earlier in the week, resulting in a fifth consecutive weekly gain. This performance is Brent's longest weekly bull run since June 2016.
U.S. crude (CLc1) traded up 9 cents at $51.65 a barrel, on track for its strongest third quarter in 10 years and its longest streak of weekly gains since January.
""Oil prices remain firm with the backdrop of tensions between Iraq/Turkey/Iran and Kurdistan still threatening to halt up to 600,000 barrels per day of production from the semi-autonomous region,"" said Jamie Campbell, head of natural resources at Panmure Gordon.
Iraq's Kurds endorsed secession by nine to one in a referendum on Monday that has angered Turkey, the central government in Baghdad, and other powers, who fear the vote could lead to renewed conflict in the oil-rich region.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called the vote illegitimate and has threatened to break with past practice and deal only with the Baghdad government over oil exports from Iraq.
Iran has banned transportation of oil products by Iranian companies to and from Iraq's Kurdistan region, the semi-official Tasnim news agency said on Friday.
""No rapid solution to the crisis can be expected, which should continue to lend support to the oil price,"" analysts at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) wrote.
Most oil that flows through a pipeline from Iraq to Turkey comes from Kurdish sources and a cut-off would severely damage the Kurdish Regional Government, which relies on sales of crude for almost all its hard currency revenues.
So far, oil flows through the pipeline have been normal.
Oil price gains have also been supported this month by anticipated renewed demand from U.S. refiners that were resuming operations after shutdowns due to Hurricane Harvey.
Even more bullish views have already started to appear in the oil options market that has seen a spike in activity at $100 a barrel, indicating some oil bulls are betting the price could trade around that level by this time next year.
Analysts polled by Reuters on a monthly basis also slightly lifted their 2017 price forecasts on Friday but were more skeptical of further gains in 2018. 

However, Middle Eastern oil producers are concerned the recent price rise will incentivize more U.S. shale production and push prices lower again.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sales of gasoline-powered cars have overtaken diesel in the first half of this year for the first time since 2009, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) said this week. 
The shift, following revelations that most diesel cars emit more pollutants on the road than laboratory tests suggested, saw gasoline car sales rise by nearly 10 percent from the first half of 2016, compared with an approximate 4 percent drop in diesel car sales in the same period, the group said. 
Sales of ""alternative"" vehicles - hybrid, electric, LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and natural gas-powered ones - also rose by more than 35 percent to account for 5.2 percent of total car sales. 
The mayors of Paris and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel-engine cars in city centers by 2025 in the wake of the emissions scandal, while France is also making plans to reverse favorable tax treatments for diesel. Some expect other European governments to follow suit.
Even car manufacturing centers Stuttgart and Munich have mulled diesel engine bans.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 to cheating emissions tests.
ACEA, however, cautioned the shift to gasoline engines could make it tougher for Europe to meet CO2 reduction targets.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union countries are struggling to agree on how much beef they should in future let in from South American bloc Mercosur, threatening to derail trade talks that the two aim to conclude by the end of this year.
The talks between the two blocs, which started in 1999, have ground to a halt before but both sides have committed to reach an initial deal in 2017, with steady progress since discussions resumed last year. 
The European Commission, which negotiates on behalf of the 28 EU nations, had proposed including beef and ethanol in an offer to Mercosur in 2016, including a tariff-free 78,000-ton annual allotment of beef. 
However, both were removed because they were deemed too sensitive for beef-producing EU countries such as France and Ireland.
The Mercosur countries of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay have said an offer without beef in particular cannot lead to a deal. The expectation was quotas would be added in for beef and ethanol in a new offer presented at talks in Brazil next week.
A meeting of EU trade representatives to discuss the new offer was set for Monday, but pushed back until Thursday. They did not reach an agreement, with talks to resume on Friday, EU sources said.
The EU recently completed trade agreements with Canada and Japan, and hopes for a deal with Mexico as well as Mercosur. It has argued such deals boost economic growth for both sides.
However, the prospect of allowing tariff-free quotas for some of the world's largest producers of beef and sugar, which is turned into ethanol, has rattled some EU members.
A group of countries led by France and Ireland have proposed postponing the offer, saying they were particularly vulnerable to imports of beef, ethanol, sugar and poultry.
""I'm very much in favor of a trade deal with Mercosur, but I would like to see standards protected and our beef farmers protected as well,"" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told reporters at a summit of EU leaders in Estonia on Friday.
Gaining access to public contracts in the Mercosur bloc, a market worth some 150 billion euros ($177 billion) in Brazil alone, is seen as an unmissable prize by others.
Germany, Italy, Spain and five other countries wrote to the European Commission urging it to make a good offer to Mercosur, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
""Any positive gesture from the EU could prove decisive for encouraging Mercosur to put together a more generous offer,"" the countries said.

A deal would allow the EU to ""reap economic benefits in areas such as services, investment, public procurement and intellectual property"", the letter added.

 The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude November contract was at $51.64 a barrel, up 8 cents or about 14% by 06:35 a.m. ET (10:35 GMT), just off the previous session's five-month high of $52.86.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for November delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was steady at $57.16 a barrel, not far from a more than two-month peak of $58.88 reached on Tuesday.
Prices was boosted after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Wednesday an unexpected decline in crude oil inventories, athough domestic crude production edged up to the highest level since July 2015.
The commodity has been well supported in recent weeks amid growing optimism that the crude market was well on its way towards rebalancing as data showed strong compliance from major producers with their supply cut agreement.
In May, OPEC and non-OPEC members led by Russia agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.

(Reuters) - Oil prices are unlikely to rise much beyond this month's two-year highs this year, as concern among analysts persists that growing U.S. shale output will hamper the rebalancing between global crude supply and demand, a Reuters poll showed.
Brent crude is expected to average $52.60 a barrel in 2017, a touch higher than last month's forecast of $52.53. For 2018, the North Sea crude was seen averaging $54.40 a barrel versus the previous month's forecast of $54.48.
The monthly poll of 36 analysts and economists projected Brent to average over $60 a barrel by 2020.
This week, Brent hit its highest since July 2015, driven by demand for refined products and views of a quickly balancing oil market following production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
OPEC and 11 rival producers, including Russia, have committed to output cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018 to help global supply align with demand.
Meanwhile, U.S. shale production is set to rise for the 10th month in a row in October to a record 6.1 million bpd.
""We expect higher output from shale oil, Libya and Nigeria will remain the main threat to OPEC efforts to limit global supply,"" said Daniela Corsini, commodity market economist at  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) in Milan.
""Given its sensitivity to (U.S. futures) prices, shale oil will represent the most effective tool of the rebalancing process and will contribute to keep crude prices in a relatively narrow range,"" Corsini added. 
Brent, which has averaged $52.48 so far in 2017, is on track for a more than 20 percent gain in the third quarter of this year, its largest rise in the July-September period since 2004. 
""With high adherence by OPEC members to the output cut decision in recent months, the market is seen tightening ... With the rise in prices, we expect the U.S. to continue pumping higher output, thus impacting market rebalancing,"" said Rahul Prithiani, director at CRISIL Research.
The premium of Brent to U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude has grown to its widest since August 2015, at around $7 a barrel.
Analysts see this spread narrowing to trade steadily around $2.72 a barrel for 2017 and $2.79 in 2018.
WTI futures are forecast to average $49.88 a barrel in 2017 and $51.61 in 2018, versus last month's forecasts of $50.01 and $51.92 respectively for the same period.
The discount of WTI to Brent mostly stemmed from the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which temporarily knocked out nearly 25 percent of U.S. refining capacity on the Gulf Coast last month, denting crude demand.
""The impact of major hurricanes like Harvey and Irma will be short term and will dissipate as refineries in the U.S. resume full operations over the coming weeks,"" said Abhishek Kumar, a senior analyst at Interfax Energy in London.
OCBC had the highest 2017 Brent forecast at $57 per barrel, while Julius Baer had the lowest at $48.80.

ERBIL, Iraq/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey threatened potentially crippling restrictions on oil trading with Iraqi Kurds on Thursday after they backed independence from Baghdad in a referendum that has alarmed Ankara as it faces a separatist insurgency from its own Kurdish minority.
Iraq's Kurds endorsed secession by nine to one in a vote on Monday that has angered Turkey, the central government in Baghdad, and other regional and world powers, who fear the referendum could lead to renewed conflict in the region.
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's office said he had been told by Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim in a call that Turkey would break with past practice and deal only with the Baghdad government over oil exports from Iraq. 
Most oil that flows through a pipeline from Iraq to Turkey comes from Kurdish sources and a cut-off would severely damage the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), which relies on sales of crude for almost all its hard currency revenues.
So far the pipeline is operating normally despite Turkish threats to impose economic sanctions on the Kurdish autonomous region in Iraq. Turkish officials, however, ramped up pressure on the Kurds on Thursday.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said after talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin the Kurdish government ""made a big mistake by holding the referendum"" and must be prevented from ""bigger mistakes."" He said Turkey and Russia agreed the territorial integrity of Iraq and Syria must be preserved.
Yildirim said separately that Turkey would respond harshly to any security threat on its border after the referendum, although that was not its first choice.
Yildirim also said he agreed with Abadi to coordinate economic and trade relations with the central government in Baghdad. He said Turkey, Iran and Iraq may meet to discuss the referendum.
Turkish government spokesman Bekir Bozdag said Turkish armed forces would stop training Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga forces, which protected oil fields from capture by the Islamic State.
With the region's largest Kurdish population, Turkey has been battling a three-decade insurgency in its largely Kurdish southeast and fears the referendum will inflame separatist tensions at home.
The United Nations offered on Thursday to help solve the problem between the KRG and Baghdad, the Iraqi foreign ministry said following a meeting between Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jafari and Jan Kubis, the top U.N. envoy in Iraq.
The United States was willing, if asked, to help facilitate talks to try to ease tensions between the two sides, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
ECONOMIC BLOCKADE
Kurdish officials say they can withstand an economic blockade because they are self-sufficient in terms of power generation and fuel supply and have fertile agricultural land.
They also say that three quarters of the trucks that cross the Turkish border are heading to territory controlled by Baghdad rather than to the Kurdish region, so the Turkish and Iraqi economies would suffer from any blockade.
But travel to the Kurdish region will become harder if airports in Erbil and Sulaimaniya are closed to international flights.
Their autonomous region in Iraq is the closest the Kurds have come in modern times to a state. It has flourished amid Iraq's civil war but may struggle to maintain investment if it is blockaded economically.
Kurdish officials say that Abadi's tough response to the referendum vindicates Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani's decision to hold the referendum because they believe Baghdad will not cooperate under any circumstances.
The officials feel that if Baghdad, Turkey, Iran, the United States and the world line up against them, and the Kurds cannot see an end to their hardship, Barzani could come under pressure at home to declare independence.
A diplomatic drive to forestall Monday's referendum failed to persuade Kurdish leaders, some of the United States' closest Middle Eastern allies, former U.S. officials and experts said.
There were expectations that the United States, which said it would not recognize the vote, could use its ties to the Iraqi Kurds to persuade Barzani to cancel the referendum in exchange for a guarantee of talks with Baghdad. 
The U.S. bid to stop the referendum failed, experts said, in part because the aging Barzani sees fulfilling aspirations for an independent Kurdish state as his legacy.
The United States, major European countries and nearby Turkey and Iran all opposed the referendum as destabilizing at a time when all sides are still fighting Islamic State.
A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition said there had been a loss of focus in the fight against Islamic State since the referendum.
Baghdad has heaped pressure on the Kurds, demanding they cancel their referendum, while parliament urged the Iraqi government to send troops to take control of oilfields held by Kurdish forces.
Baghdad also demanded that foreign governments close their diplomatic missions in the Kurdish capital Erbil.
Foreign airlines have begun cancelling flights to Kurdish airports after Iraq said international flights to Erbil and Sulaimaniya would be suspended from Friday. Turkey told its citizens to leave northern Iraq before the ban came into force.
Kurdish authorities have rejected Baghdad's demands that they should annul the referendum and hand over control of their international airports, instead offering to hold talks with Baghdad in an attempt to defuse the airports crisis.
CONCERN OVER BORDERS 
Erdogan and Putin met in Ankara on Thursday. Russia's interest in the region is growing. Oil major Rosneft (MM:ROSN) is increasing investment in Kurdistan and the Kurds have been developing strong ties with Moscow.
""Russia is one of the biggest investors in the economy of Iraqi Kurdistan at this moment,"" said Kirill Vertyayev, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow.
""There is a certain conflict of interest because neither Baghdad nor Ankara are happy about Russia's economic expansion in Iraqi Kurdistan ... that's why Russia is acting carefully,"" he said.
The Kurds consider Monday's referendum to be an historic step in a generations-old quest for a state of their own, while Iraq considers the vote unconstitutional.
Barzani, who is KRG president, has said the vote is not binding, but meant to provide a mandate for negotiations with Baghdad and neighboring countries over the peaceful secession of the region from Iraq. Baghdad has rejected talks.
The Kurds were left without a state of their own when the Ottoman Empire collapsed a century ago. Around 30 million live in Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Iran.

The Kurds say the referendum acknowledges their contribution in confronting Islamic State after it overwhelmed the Iraqi army.

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's plans to float state oil titan Aramco are prompting the country to think the unthinkable. 
Late last year, Saudi Arabia tried to get fellow oil producers around the world to agree to reduce production. Before an OPEC meeting in Vienna in November, Saudi officials were armed with an unprecedented bargaining chip: if there was no deal, the kingdom would quit the exporter group altogether.
The strategy was approved at the highest level of the Saudi government, said sources familiar with the matter. 
It was not only aimed at ensuring the smooth workings of the world's energy supply. It was also driven by a desire to push up oil prices to maximize the valuation of Saudi Aramco ahead of the listing, said the sources who declined to be named as the information is confidential. 
In the end, the world's biggest oil exporter did not have to enact that option. OPEC members along with non-OPEC producers including Russia agreed a deal in December to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day. 
But the fact such a move was considered shows how Aramco's initial public offering (IPO) - expected to be the biggest in history - is forcing the kingdom to rethink its OPEC policies.
Riyadh's stance represented a shift, OPEC sources said, from its decades-old role of advocating restraint and seeking to convince fellow members like Algeria, Venezuela and Iran that prices rising too fast benefited alternative energy providers. 
""Saudi Arabia is now the main price hawk,"" said a high-level OPEC source. He added he was surprised how quickly the kingdom shifted from its policy of prioritizing market share, by pumping oil at full tilt, to supporting production cuts following its decision to list Aramco. 
The Saudi energy ministry and OPEC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The IPO also raises questions over Saudi Arabia's future role in OPEC, as the kingdom would become the only member with a national oil firm listed abroad. That in turn raises questions over the future of OPEC itself given the kingdom has been the group's driving force since its inception almost 60 years ago.
Until now, Aramco - which oversees Saudi Arabia's vast reserves - has always been a tool in the country's OPEC policies, to reduce or increase production. 
Once a stake in Aramco is floated, however, the company will have to take into account the interests of outside investors, according to industry sources.
Listing rules and anti-trust legislation, particularly in the United States, also preclude price-fixing, which Aramco could be accused of if it continued to follow Saudi Arabia's OPEC policy of adjusting output to manage prices, the sources said.
""Aramco is the instrument used to manage the market even though its not involved in making the policy,"" said Fareed Mohamedi, chief economist at U.S.-based Rapidan Group.
Saudi Aramco declined to comment on the potential risks of investors suing it post-IPO if it followed Saudi OPEC policies.
NORWEGIAN PATH
Saudi authorities aim to list around 5 percent of Aramco by the end of 2018 on both the Riyadh stock exchange and one or more international markets, with London, New York and Hong Kong in the running.
The IPO is the centerpiece of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil which is championed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.
The prince has said he expects the IPO to value Aramco at a minimum of $2 trillion, and Saudi officials and investors say the valuation will be directly impacted by oil prices.
Saudi officials have said they want to see $60 per barrel this year, with banking sources suggesting the IPO might be timed to happen with crude trading at $60-$70 per barrel. Prices have been around $50 for most of this year and were above $58 this week.
Listing its national oil firm represents unknown territory for Saudi Arabia and OPEC. But Norway, which has listed its state oil company  Statoil  (OL:STL), might offer some guide to the path ahead. 
The Nordic nation, which still owns 67 percent of the oil firm, has refrained from joining any international steps in regulating oil output since 2002, months after listing in New York and Oslo in 2001.
Over the past year, Saudi officials have met officials from Norway and Statoil to discuss how best to restructure Aramco's business operations ahead of the IPO, according to several industry sources familiar with the meetings. 
The sources cited U.S. anti-trust laws as the main reason why Norway does not join accords on production, such as the deal agreed in December. 
A Statoil spokesman said the company had not advised Saudi officials on the IPO in any official capacity. Its CEO Eldar Saetre also told Reuters in February that it was not officially advising Aramco, but said it was ""sharing"" its experience.
Statoil referred queries about Norway's position regarding international output accords to the ministry of energy. The ministry said there was no link between Norway not joining OPEC cuts and the fact that Statoil is a U.S. listed company. 
LOSING MARKET SHARE
While Prince Mohammad, the likely future ruler of Saudi Arabia, is determined to proceed with the IPO, there are still concerns inside the government and Aramco about the wisdom of the move, according to Saudi and industry sources. Some conservatives oppose the idea of Riyadh relinquishing any control over its oil's crown jewel.
Saudi officials have said that production decisions are a sovereign matter that will remain with the government - which will still own the bulk of Aramco post-IPO - but did not explain how this policy would be compatible with a listed company.
One Saudi-based industry source said Aramco would have to act like other listed oil company such as  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) or ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). If it wanted to cut production, it would have to demonstrate to the investors that they would financially benefit from the move. 
Inside Aramco, some executives do not believe that Saudi Arabia's OPEC policies in preparation for the IPO will benefit the company in the long term, according to several sources.
They point to the fact that OPEC's output cuts have eaten into Aramco's market share in Asia, the world's biggest oil-consuming region. 
Since January, Riyadh has cut production by more than it was required to help OPEC achieve a full compliance with cuts and boost prices as other members were slow to reduce output.

The kingdom, previously China's biggest crude supplier, has been overtaken by Russia while Iraq has eclipsed it as India's number one source.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $2.61, or 0.20%, to $1,290.40 a troy ounce.
Gold futures attempted to halt the recent slump, which has seen the precious metal dip below $1,300, supported by a dip in the dollar which followed a pair of mixed economic reports.
Gross domestic product increased at a 3.1% annual rate in the April-June period, the Commerce Department said in its third estimate on Thursday, beating a previous estimate of 3%.
Fresh on the heels of the upbeat economic growth data, a labor market report showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 272,000 for the week ended Sept. 23, missing forecasts of a 10,000 increase.
A jump in investor expectations for a December rate, however, is expected to weigh on upside momentum in gold prices.
“We suspect that gold will likely remain on the defensive for a little while longer, as the market currently is in the throes of a higher dollar/higher rates backdrop,” said Edward Meir, independent commodity consultant at INTL FCStone.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures rose 0.23% to $16.87 a troy ounce while platinum futures lost 0.14% to $924.20.

U.S. natural gas for November delivery was at $3.070 per million British thermal units by 10:43AM ET (1443GMT), up 0.9 cents, or around 0.3%. Futures were at around $3.035 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 58 billion cubic feet in the week ended Sept. 22, below forecasts for a build of 66 billion.
That compared with a gain of 97 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 49 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 84 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.466 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 3.5% lower than levels at this time a year ago and mostly in line with the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas futures ended around 2% higher on Wednesday, boosted by bullish weather forecasts.
Warm high pressure will dominate the Great Lakes and east-central U.S. through early next week with highs of 80s and 90s, followed by cooling, as a fresh weather system arrives with showers and thunderstorms.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude November contract was at a five-month high of $52.61 a barrel, up 48 cents or about 0.86% by 09:00 a.m. ET (13:00 GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for November delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up 44 cents or about 0.76% at $58.00 a barrel, its highest since July 2015.
Prices found support after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Wednesday that crude oil inventories fell by 1.8 million barrels, after posting hefty increases in each of the last three weeks, as refiners raised output following Hurricane Harvey last month.
However, gasoline stockpiles were up 1.1 million barrels for the week, rising for the first time in four weeks.
The report also showed that domestic crude production edged up by 0.4% to 9.55 million last week, the highest level since July 2015.
Prices have been well supported in recent weeks amid growing optimism that the crude market was well on its way towards rebalancing as data showed strong compliance from major producers with their supply cut agreement.
In May, OPEC and non-OPEC members led by Russia agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.

Data on Thursday showed that U.S. economic growth in the second quarter was revised up more than expected.
Separately, the U.S. Department of Labor said initial jobless claims increased more than expected last week.
The greenback had strengthened broadly following reports on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump proposed the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday, spurred by rising tension around northern Iraq following the Kurdistan region's vote in favor of independence in a referendum.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 40 cents at $58.30 a barrel by 1200 GMT. It hit a more than two-year high of $59.49 on Tuesday after Monday's referendum vote prompted Turkey to threaten to close the region's oil pipeline.
U.S. light crude (CLc1) was 40 cents higher at $52.54 after reaching a five-month intra-day high of $52.86.
""Kurdistan and Northern Iraq now export 500,000-550,000 barrels per day (bpd). That would be a big loss to the market,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
Iraqi Kurdistan voted overwhelmingly on Monday in favor of independence, prompting Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to say he could use force to prevent the formation of an independent Kurdish state and might close the oil ""tap"".
Turkey promised on Thursday to deal only with the Iraqi government on crude, ""restricting oil export"" operations to Baghdad, the office of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said.
Torbjorn Soltvedt, principal analyst for the Middle East at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said there was about a 20 percent chance that pipeline northern Iraq and Ceyhan in Turkey would be shut.
""It's not inconceivable that Turkey would sacrifice trade and oil flows for domestic political issues,"" he told Reuters Global Oil Forum. ""If things keep escalating after this then (oil) supply could become a real concern.""
U.S. crude also found some strength from a surprise fall in U.S. stocks. U.S. crude inventories  fell 1.8 million barrels last week, the U.S. Energy Department said, versus forecasts for a 3.4 million-barrel build. 
The outlook for oil demand has strengthened, analysts say.
The International Energy Agency earlier this month raised its 2017 global oil demand growth estimate to 1.6 million bpd from 1.5 million bpd, citing stronger than expected demand growth in the United States and Europe.
Still, U.S. crude production rose to 9.55 million bpd last week, higher than before Harvey hit the Gulf Coast.
With Brent futures commanding their highest premium over U.S. crude  in more than two years, U.S. crude has become increasingly competitive in foreign markets and exports hit a record 1.5 million bpd last week.

That complicates efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers to push oil higher through output curbs, as every rise in price encourages more U.S. production.

Overnight, crude oil prices settled higher on Wednesday, as traders cheered data showing an unexpected draw in U.S. crude supplies pointing to a recovery in refinery activity and exports following disruptions due to Hurricane Harvey in August.
Crude prices initially struggled to capitalise on a report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showing crude stockpiles unexpectedly fell last week as investors weighed the dip in crude stockpiles against a rise in gasoline inventories for the first time in four weeks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent prices fell on Wednesday while U.S. crude rallied, after crude stockpiles in the world's top oil consumer unexpectedly drew down with refiners coming back online following Hurricane Harvey last month.
Brent (LCOc1) slipped from 26-month highs to settle down 54 cents, or nearly 1 percent, at $57.90 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) (CLc1) ended 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, higher at $52.14 but stayed below five-month highs. 
U.S. crude inventories  fell 1.8 million barrels last week, the U.S. Energy Department said, versus forecasts for a 3.4 million-barrel build. [EIA/S] 
The crude draw supported oil prices, but gasoline stocks surprisingly rose and stocks of distillates were down by less than anticipated.
""Gains in WTI oil prices will be capped because of recovering oil production in the U.S.,"" said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.
Refinery utilization rates  jumped 5.4 percentage points to 88.6 percent of total capacity, the highest rate since Harvey hit on Aug. 25, government data showed, as most facilities have come back online.
The effects of that storm, as well as Hurricane Irma, which struck Florida earlier this month, may dampen demand for some time, potentially increasing gasoline inventories while crude stocks are drawn down thanks to renewed refining activity.
Oil prices have been supported by output curbs by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major producers, although U.S. crude has lagged behind Brent amid concerns that U.S. production-growth could stoke oversupply.
U.S. crude production rose to 9.55 million barrels per day last week, higher than levels before Harvey hit the Gulf Coast, data showed.
With Brent futures commanding their highest premium over WTI  in more than two years, U.S. crude has become increasingly competitive in foreign markets and exports hit a record of 1.5 million bpd last week, according to data. 
""Seeing exports of U.S. produced crude that large would pose a threat to the level that the Brent-WTI premium can go,"" said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.

Diesel exports were also rising, in part because lower U.S. crude prices boosts margins for U.S. refiners compared with those in Europe.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil inventories fell unexpectedly last week as refineries hiked output due to restarts following Hurricane Harvey and exports soared, while gasoline stockpiles posted a surprise build, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.
Crude inventories  fell 1.8 million barrels in the week to Sept. 22, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 3.4 million barrels.
""The highlight from today's EIA report isn't the larger-than-expected draw to stocks, but the reported cause of this draw,"" said Troy Vincent, oil analyst with Clipper Data. ""The EIA showed both refinery runs and exports surging higher last week."" 
Refinery crude runs  increased by 1 million barrels per day as utilization rates  rose by 5.4 percentage points to 88.6 percent of total capacity, its highest rate since Harvey hit on Aug. 25, EIA data showed. 
U.S. crude exports rose 563,000 bpd to a new record of 1.49 million bpd in the week. Crude imports  fell by 504,000 barrels per day. 
Vincent expects exports to continue to rise in the coming weeks, so long as U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) remains at a discount to global benchmark Brent (LCOc1). 
With WTI's discount to Brent at about its widest in two years , U.S. crude has become increasingly competitive in foreign markets.
The data's impact was bearish on the markets with Brent futures trading down 54 cents a barrel at $57.90 by 11:03 a.m. EDT (1503 GMT). U.S. crude was down 7 cents a barrel at $51.81.Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for WTI futures  rose by 1.2 million barrels, EIA said.
Gasoline stocks  rose 1.1 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 921,000-barrel drop.
Distillate stockpiles , which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 814,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 2.2 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.
""Further drawdowns in U.S. crude stocks are expected over the coming weeks as the country’s gasoline and distillate inventories are replenished,"" said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.
""Nevertheless, gains in WTI oil prices will be capped because of recovering oil production in the U.S.” 

U.S. crude production for the week rose to 9.55 million bpd, up from 9.51 million bpd the previous week and higher than levels before Harvey hit the Gulf Coast.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures tacked on 25 cents, or around 0.5%, to $52.13 a barrel by 10:35AM ET (1435GMT). Prices were at around $52.05 prior to the release of the inventory data.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., shed 26 cents, or about 0.5%, to $57.66 a barrel. It reached a 26-month peak of $58.88 a day earlier.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 1.8 million barrels in the week ended September 22.
Market analysts' expected a crude-stock gain of around 3.4 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a surprise supply-drop of 761,000 barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, increased by 1.1 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 471.0 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be at the upper half of the average range for this time of year.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories rose by 1.1 million barrels, disappointing expectations for a decline of 921,000 barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a fall of 814,000 barrels.
According to the data, domestic production rose 0.4% to reach the highest level since July 2015.
Oil futures finished lower Tuesday for the first time in three sessions, but losses were capped amid growing optimism that the crude market was well on its way towards rebalancing.
Prices have gained roughly 20% from their June lows, meeting the definition of a bull market, as data showed strong compliance from major producers with their supply cut agreement and as talk grows of a likely extension of the deal.
In May, OPEC and non-OPEC members led by Russia agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.

 Comex gold futures were down $13.24 or about 1.04% at $1,288.58 a troy ounce by 08:45 a.m. ET (12:45 GMT), their lowest since August 25.
The greenback found support after the Commerce Department said durable goods orders rose more than forecast in August, recovering from a slump in the prior month and bolstering optimism over the U.S. economy.
In a speech on Tuesday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that the Federal Reserve needs to continue gradual interest rate hikes despite uncertainty about the path of inflation.
It would be ""would be imprudent to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2%,"" she said.
The U.S. dollar was also boosted ahead of a highly-anticipated U.S. tax plan, set to be unveiled on Wednesday. The plan has been developed over several months by six White House and congressional Republicans, with no input from Democrats.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, wasup 0.51% at a one-month peak of 93.28.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
However, geopolitical concerns had not completely disappeared. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that a military option for North Korea isn't the preferred choice but if this were to be the case, it would be ""devastating"" for Pyongyang.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures declined 0.56% to $17.79 a troy ounce."

104,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2017 08:08AM ET</span>",Special Report: Drowning in grain - How Big Ag sowed seeds of a profit-slashing glut,"By Rod Nickel
CARMAN, Manitoba (Reuters) - On Canada's fertile Prairies, dominated by the yellows and golds of canola and wheat, summers are too short to grow corn on a major scale.
But  Monsanto  Co (N:MON) is working to develop what it hopes will be North America's fastest-maturing corn, allowing farmers to grow more in Western Canada and other inhospitable climates, such as Ukraine.
The seed and chemical giant projects that western Canadian corn plantings could multiply 20 times to 10 million acres by 2025 - adding some 1.1 billion bushels, or nearly 3 percent to current global production.
The question, amid historically high supplies and low grain prices, is whether the world really needs more corn.
A global grains glut is now in its fourth year, with supplies bloated by favorable weather, increasingly high-tech farm practices and tougher plant breeds.
The bin-busting harvests of cheap corn, wheat and soybeans are undermining the business models of the world’s largest agriculture firms and the farmers who use their products and services. Some analysts say the firms have effectively innovated their way into a stubbornly oversupplied market.
Never has the world produced so much more food than can be consumed in one season. World ending stocks of total grains - the leftover supplies before a new harvest - have climbed for four straight years and are poised to reach a record 638 million tonnes in 2016/17, according to USDA data.
Farmers and agriculture firms could once count on periodic bouts of crop-destroying weather to tame gluts and drive up prices. But genetically modified crops that repel plant-chewing insects, withstand lethal chemicals and mature faster have made the trend toward oversupply more resistant to traditional boom-and-bust agrarian cycles, experts say.
Another key factor: China - the world's second-biggest corn grower - adopted stockpiling policies a decade ago when crop supplies ran thin, resulting in greater production than the world needs.
""I think the norm is where we are now,"" said Bryan Agbabian, director of agriculture equities at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors.
Allianz investors seem to agree: The value of two agriculture equity funds that Agbabian manages fell to $300 million this year from $800 million in 2011 as crop prices slid, he said.
Abundant supplies have helped lower food prices across the world, but the benefit to consumers and impoverished nations is muted by several factors, including problems with corruption and distribution of food in developing regions, said Sylvain Charlebois, professor of food distribution and policy at Canada's Dalhousie University.
The bumper harvests may actually harm poor communities more than they benefit their residents in food savings because lower prices depress farm incomes in the same areas, said John Baffes, a senior economist at the World Bank.
Even as farmers reap bountiful harvests, U.S. net farm incomes this year will total $63.4 billion - about half of their earnings in 2013, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast.
Lower incomes mean farmers cannot spend as much on seed, fertilizer and machinery, extending their pain to firms across the agriculture sector.
 Potash Corp of Saskatchewan  (TO:POT), the world's biggest fertilizer company by capacity, closed its newest potash mine last year, eliminating more than 400 jobs, and has seen its U.S.-listed shares fall by nearly half since the beginning of 2015. The drop erased $14 billion in value, and left Potash seeking to merge with rival  Agrium  Inc (TO:AGU). 
With profits under pressure, seed and chemical companies are scrambling to consolidate.
Monsanto's annual profit in 2016 was its smallest in six years. It agreed last year to combine with  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn), which would create the world's largest integrated pesticide and seed company if the deal closes next year. 
Grain handler  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG) said this summer it would cut costs, and left the door open to selling itself after posting a 34 percent drop in quarterly earnings. 
Bunge CEO Soren Schroder sought to reassure investors in May by saying all that was needed to trim supplies was one bad stretch of weather in the U.S. Midwest. 
But the glut pervades many major farming regions, making it unlikely that drought or floods in one region could wipe out the mounting global surplus. Even with dry conditions in North America, Europe and Australia, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts that this year will bring the second-biggest global corn, wheat and soybean harvests ever. 
Bunge's Schroder made his comment about bad weather less than three weeks before confirming an informal merger approach from commodities giant  Glencore  Plc (L:GLEN).
""When prices tanked, farmers were no longer willing to pay more"" for seed and chemicals, said Jonas Oxgaard, analyst at investment management firm Bernstein. ""The mergers are absolutely driven by oversupply because their growth is gone.""
Monsanto spokeswoman Trish Jordan said the company believes demand growth still justifies corn expansion, and she disputed the notion that crop science advances are backfiring on agricultural technology firms.
Monsanto rival DowDuPont Inc (N:DWDP) is making the same bet and currently sells the shortest-season field corn in North America, maturing in 70 days, spokesman Ali Aziz said.
Success in the lab and the field, however, has contributed to oversupply and may continue to sustain it, said Oxgaard, the Bernstein analyst.
""It's somewhat the seed companies' fault - they keep breeding better and better seeds every year,"" he said.

DARWIN, SEX AND CORN
Charles Darwin helped plant the seeds of the grain glut. The biologist and evolution theorist showed in the late 1800s that cross-fertilization of plants - in which sex cells are fused between crop varieties of the same species - creates a more vigorous breed than those that are self-fertilized. 
His work and others' influenced successive generations of crop scientists and led to the development of hybrid corn, said Stephen Moose, a professor specializing in crop genetics at University of Illinois.
U.S. farmers started planting the first significant acres of hybrid corn in the 1930s, and by 1950 it made up nearly all the corn seeded in the United States.
Yields exploded. Farmers who reaped 20.5 bushels of corn per acre in 1930 harvested an average of 38.2 bushels in 1950, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Further hybrid breeding breakthroughs generated corn with leaves that grow more erect, allowing farmers to sow it more densely without starving plants of sunlight. Yields first topped 100 bushels per acre in 1978.
After conventional breeding breakthroughs became harder to find, corn gained new vigor through the 1990s with genetic modification.
In 1996, U.S. regulators approved corn that was genetically engineered to produce bug-killing proteins, accomplished by inserting a bacterium hostile to the corn borer insect into the plant genome.
Before the end of the 1990s, corn able to resist weed-killing chemical glufosinate or Monsanto's glyphosate hit the market.
Those modified varieties and others that followed proved pivotal in generating the abundant corn crops that have since become commonplace, Moose said. 
""In the seed industry, it stimulated a whole other round of investment,"" Moose said. 
In the 20 years since GMO corn reached U.S. farms, yields jumped another 37 percent to a record 174.6 bushels per acre last year.
Some experts believe the expansion of corn yields may soon hit a ceiling. The crop may be nearing the natural limit of its production potential, and crop yields will likely plateau in the next decade, based on how plants convert light to food and their ability to recover from heat, said Ken Cassman, agronomy professor at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
Technology has also provided better defenses against pests.
 Syngenta  AG's (S:SYNN) Viptera and Duracade traits, used to control worms and beetles, launched in 2010 and 2013. SmartStax corn seed, introduced by Monsanto and Dow in 2009, brought twin benefits of insect protection and herbicide tolerance, said Paul Bertels, vice-president of production and sustainability at U.S.-based National Corn Growers Association.
The breakthroughs in seed and pesticide technologies have not come without problems. Monsanto is now embroiled in a controversy over dicamba, a big-selling chemical designed to kill weeds that harm Monsanto’s genetically modified crops. 
Many U.S. farmers say dicamba has drifted from its intended fields, damaging plants that are not resistant to the chemical. Monsanto believes the main causes of drifting are errors by farmers and applicators in deploying the herbicide, company spokeswoman Charla Lord said.
GROWING CORN IN ALASKA
As it grew stronger, corn grew faster. Corn that required 120 days to mature in the U.S. Corn Belt during the 1960s now needs only 105 to 115 days.
Farmers in northern North Dakota plant and harvest corn in 80 days, and have doubled the state's production in five years.
Fast corn is now stirring even the imaginations of researchers in the far north. 
University of Alaska Fairbanks horticulture professor Meriam Karlsson grew hundreds of corn plants in the Arctic state in 2015. 
The plants, germinated in a greenhouse before they were transplanted outside, grew from a short-season garden corn variety that matured in less than 60 days. Corn rose only four to five feet, allowing plants to spend maximum energy on growing ears, rather than leaves and stalks. 
Karlsson had expected few corn plants to survive in Fairbanks - less than 120 miles (190 kilometers) from the Arctic Circle.
“It’s much more adaptable than I expected,"" she said. ""Amazing what breeding can do. It was kind of exciting that you could do it.” 
The lure of technology comes down to money for farmers.
Even with Chicago corn futures down more than 50 percent from their 2012 record high, the high-yielding crop offers one of the strongest returns to Canadian farmers, generating profits per acre four times that of canola, based on average prices and costs, said National Bank analyst Greg Colman. 
As corn spreads across the Canadian Prairies, those robust yields are winning farmers over, said Dan Wright, Monsanto Canada's lead for corn and soybeans.
""Once you harvest corn at 140 or 180 bushels, it's something you want to do again,"" he said. 
While corn compares nicely to some crops, it offers U.S. farmers marginal returns at current prices, Bernstein's Oxgaard said. Switching to other crops is not easy in areas like the U.S. Midwest, where farmers traditionally swing between corn and soybeans, and have invested in costly equipment to grow them. 
GLUT TRACES ROOTS TO SHORTAGE
The problems of plenty were on nobody's mind less than a decade ago. In 2008, a dramatic food price run-up stirred riots from Haiti to Egypt.
Four years later, the U.S. Midwest, the engine of the global corn and soybean growing machine, suffered its worst drought in decades, opening gaping cracks in the soil and withering crops.
Chicago corn and soybean futures (Cv1)  hit record highs as U.S. production fell to multi-year lows.
But high prices proved the cure for high prices.
Farmers in traditionally less productive corn-growing countries such as Russia, Argentina and Brazil expanded corn output to seize bigger profits. 
U.S. farming quickly rebounded, reaping record corn harvests in three of the next four years. 
New corn varieties have made global production more balanced than ever, with 12 countries producing at least 10 million tonnes of corn annually, up from 10 before the drought.
Even if U.S. or Brazilian corn crops suffered major weather damage, the world would still have the expanding Black Sea corn region to tap, not to mention China's enormous supplies, said Bertels, of the U.S. corn growers association.
China's stockpiling policies, enacted in 2007 when corn supplies were tight, also stimulated oversupply. Aiming for self-sufficiency in grains, Beijing bought virtually the entire domestic crop each year and paid farmers as much as 60 percent more than global prices.
The program stuffed Chinese warehouses with some 250 million tonnes of corn by the time Beijing scrapped it last year. China is now boosting incentives for farmers to switch to soybeans from corn.
""The world's corn is mainly in China,"" said Li Qiang, chief consultant at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co Ltd. 
He said it will take three to four years for stocks to reach a ""normal"" level of around 40-50 million tonnes.
The Black Sea region, made up of Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, has become a disruptive force with rapidly expanding exports. Moscow aims to drive grain production to 150 million tonnes by 2030 from 117 million in 2016 after increasing storage and export capacity in ports in the last couple of years.
Glut conditions are expected to ease modestly this year, amid dry conditions in China and the United States, but supplies are still so large that prices remain weak. 
OVERSUPPLY OF EVERYTHING
In northern North Dakota, an expanding frontier for corn and soybeans, Paul Thomas started dabbling in both crops about a decade ago on his farm near Minot, seeking higher returns than wheat.
Both are now among his biggest crops, including short-season Monsanto corn varieties that have only been available for a couple of years. 
Profits may be tougher for Thomas to eke out this year due to dry weather and soft prices, but he shrugs off the struggle. 
""We're very capable of producing a large amount of bushels given an economic incentive,” he said. “If we end up over-producing, then we shift to one that's more in need. That's just the way agriculture works.""
Thomas acknowledged, however, that the traditional dynamic may be changing in this current glut.
""I don't know any single crop that isn't in oversupply,"" he said.
Seeding equipment is becoming more precise, and increasingly cost-conscious farmers are applying fertilizer and chemicals more intelligently, said Al Mussell, head of research at Canadian think tank Agri-Food Economic Systems. 
Monsanto projects that corn will become by the mid-2020s one of the biggest crops produced in Canada, which is an agriculture-exporting powerhouse in canola, wheat, oats and pork.
Soybeans are also spreading across Canada. Farmers seeded a record high 7.3 million acres in 2017, up 75 percent in five years.
On Monsanto's research farm in Carman, Manitoba, the next target is marketing a corn variety that matures in 70 days within the next two years. After that: an even quicker plant to snatch DowDuPont's claim to North America's fastest corn.
It is ambitious but realistic, said Kelly Boddy, manager of Monsanto's research farm.

""Wind the clock back a few years,"" he said, ""and breeders wouldn't have thought it possible.""

The Maritime Safety Administration (MSA) said in a statement last week that it may bring in restrictions from Oct. 11 until Oct. 28, but had not yet made a formal decision.
The agency said it had issued an internal document, but gave no further details. Traders said the document outlined possible curbs on the loading and unloading of some potentially hazardous or inflammable chemicals at ports along China's longest river.
The MSA referred queries to the Ministry of Transport, which did not respond to a request for comment.
Traders said they had been informed of the safety crackdown by their logistics suppliers, who had read the internal document as formal instructions for the Congress, which occurs once every five years and will start in Beijing on Oct. 18.
Chinese authorities often crack down on safety ahead of and during the Congress in an effort to prevent incidents that might distract attention from the political gathering.
Ports that could be affected include the world's biggest liquid chemical port, Zhangjiagang, about 100 km (60 miles) from Shanghai, as well as major ports in Jiangyin, Taicang and Changzhou which serve petrochemical companies, said Wood Mackenzie analyst Salmon Lee.
""This has led to ... a spike in spot prices for some products as players rush to bring forward loading/unloading dates, or buy more spot material to cover any possible shortfall,"" he said in a note.
The rush to deliver cargos may have been exaggerated by the week-long National Day Golden Week holiday from Oct. 1 to Oct. 7 when shipping will slow.
Many buyers have requested suppliers to ship between the end of September and early October, rather than later in October, said Lee.
Spot prices of monoethylene glycol (MEG), used to make polyester and antifreeze, jumped to $950 per tonne this week on a CFR China basis, from $910 to $920 a week ago, Wood Mackenzie said. Benzene prices rose to $835 per tonne on an FOB basis this week, from $800 a week ago, it said.

Overnight, gold prices fell on Tuesday as December rate-hike expectations jumped after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said that central bank should be “wary of moving too gradually” on interest rates to avoid the economy overheating.
In a speech titled “Inflation, Uncertainty, and Monetary Policy” at the National Association for Business Economics’ annual meeting on Tuesday, Fed chair Janet Yellen reaffirmed the central bank’s view that raising rates gradually was the most appropriate policy amid uncertainty over inflation.
“It would be imprudent to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent,” Yellen said Tuesday in the text of remarks prepared for delivery in Cleveland.

According to investing.com's fed rate monitor tool, nearly 80% of traders expect a December rate hike, compared to about 60% a week ago.
Yellen’s comments came a day after gold prices rallied sharply, following escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula after North Korea said U.S. President Donald Trump had “declared war” and that it would “shoot down U.S. bombers flying near the peninsula.""

The potential supply disruption, however, was weighed against expectations of an uptick in U.S. output, as disruptions to U.S. refinery activity due to storm Harvey continues to pressure demand for crude oil, adding to excess supplies.
“… we’re starting to see a correction in price as investors start to take profits at the highs,” said Adrienne Murphy, chief market analyst at AvaTrade. And “the efforts of OPEC and its allies may be futile, given the robust growth of the U.S. shale industry.”

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $12.50, or 0.95%, to $1,298.89 a troy ounce.
In a speech titled “Inflation, Uncertainty, and Monetary Policy” at the National Association for Business Economics’ annual meeting on Tuesday, Fed chair Janet Yellen reaffirmed the central bank’s view that raising rates gradually was the most appropriate policy amid uncertainty over inflation.
“It would be imprudent to keep monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent,” Yellen said Tuesday in the text of remarks prepared for delivery in Cleveland.
According to investing.com's fed rate monitor tool, nearly 80% of traders expect a December rate hike, compared to about 60% a week ago.
Yellen’s comments came a day after gold prices rallied sharply, following escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula after North Korea said U.S. President Donald Trump had “declared war” and that it would “shoot down U.S. bombers flying near the peninsula”.
""Since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not inside the airspace border of our country,"" North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong said.
Analysts were quick to downplay expectations of a prolonged slump in gold prices suggesting that safe-haven demand could return as geopolitical uncertainty remained “front and center”.
""Geopolitics haven't come off the table. They are still front and center but after a rally you tend to get a tiny bit of a pullback,"" said ETF Securities commodity strategist Nitesh Shah.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent oil prices fell 1 percent on Tuesday after investors took profit following a rally to 26-month highs spurred largely by threats from Turkey to cut crude exports from Iraq’s Kurdistan region.
Brent (LCOc1) fell 61 cents to $58.35 a barrel by 12:05 p.m. (1405 GMT), after hitting $59.49, the highest since July 2015 and more than 34 percent above their 2017 low.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) slid 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $51.96 a barrel, after hitting a five-month high of $52.43.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan repeated a threat to cut off the pipeline that carries 500,000-600,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from northern Iraq to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, intensifying pressure on the Kurdish autonomous region over its independence referendum.
This potential loss, combined with 1.8 million bpd of output reductions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers, raised concerns of tighter supply. 
The Iraqi government said it will not hold talks with the Kurdistan Regional Government about the results of the referendum, which is expected to show a comfortable majority in favor of independence after the results are announced later this week.
""Although there was plenty of price-bullish news making headlines yesterday, undoubtedly the biggest factor was the referendum in the Kurdistan region of Iraq,"" analysts at Vienna-based JBC Energy said in a note.
The rally over the past two days led to profit-taking. 
""The market was approaching if not in overbought territory,"" Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Americas.
""We prefer to take a pause at $60.00 a barrel (for) Brent,"" Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob wrote in a note. 
Top oil executives gathered at the S&P Global Platts APPEC conference in Singapore said strong oil demand this year was accelerating market rebalancing and helping inventory drawdowns. 
However, other analysts were skeptical about further price gains due to higher oil output from the United States.
U.S. crude stocks likely rose 2.3 million barrels last week, analysts polled estimated ahead of weekly inventory reports from the industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) and the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA), respectively released on Tuesday and Wednesday.
U.S. crude supplies have been rising as imports and production recover in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, while refineries have been slower to restart.
The EIA said last week that U.S. crude stocks jumped 4.6 million barrels as imports increased by 734,000 bpd and production rose 157,000 bpd to 9.51 million bpd, close to levels before Harvey hit Texas on Aug. 25.

""The all-time record [for domestic production] is 9.61 million June 2015, last week's report was 100,000 barrels off of that,"" said Yawger, ""With that in mind no one wants to ride that long position into the EIA report.""

117,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2017 12:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Construction firm chases oil taxes, royalties in $1 billion Congo debt row","By Joe Bavier
ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Construction firm Commisimpex has gone to a French court in its fight with the Congo Republic over what it says are more than $1 billion in unpaid bills, the latest step in a decades-old saga that has weighed on the nation's economy.
Commisimpex, which worked on construction and public works projects from the early 1980s until a Congolese court ordered it into liquidation in 2012, wants  Total  (PA:TOTF), Eni (MI:ENI) and other energy firms to pay taxes and royalties to the company instead of paying the state.
Commisimpex, which has pursued Congo in courts in Europe and the United States for nearly two decades, launched its latest legal challenge in October 2016 at the commercial tribunal in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, documents seen by Reuters showed.
Details of the case have not been publicized by any parties involved until now, a sensitive time for the government as it starts another round of talks with the International Monetary Fund on support for an economy battered by weak oil prices.
The legal saga has weighed on Congo's sovereign rating and forced a temporary default on a Eurobond this year.
Commisimpex has won several other court cases abroad, but Congo has not paid. In 2012, Congo said the firm owed 1.3 billion euros ($1.54 billion) in social security payments built up over 30 years. A Congolese court then ordered the firm into liquidation.
The construction firm filed its latest petition to the French commercial tribunal and served a summons to the Congolese unit of France's Total and other firms informing them of its action.
A Commisimpex spokeswoman said the firm was pursuing $1.25 billion in unpaid bills and interest.
Commisimpex is seeking to activate a guarantee on oil field revenues it says it secured in 1986 as collateral against debt, the summons sent to Total showed.
Commisimpex said Congo used ""as security all revenues, and notably all moneys owed, royalties, taxes rights, etc. whether present, future or eventual originating directly or indirectly from ... hydrocarbon deposits.""
It applies to the Likouala, Loango, Tchibouela, Emeraude, Yanga, Sendji and Sendji Compl. oil fields, which were then operated by Elf Aquitaine SA, Elf Congo, Agip and Agip Congo.
Elf was later absorbed into French giant Total, while Italy's Eni took over Agip. 
Commisimpex's petition lists Elf Aquitaine, Total E&P Congo, Eni and Eni Congo as defendants.
A lawyer for Elf Aquitaine said it would not comment on the case. Eni declined to comment. A spokesperson for Total did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Five smaller firms - Congorep, SNPC, Kontinent Congo, AOGC and Petro Congo - which acquired stakes in the fields at a later date are also listed.
Petro Congo said it was not aware of the case. The other companies did not respond to telephone calls and emails.
Congolese government spokesman Thierry Moungalla said: ""The Congolese state will, of course, defend its position which is that these taxes cannot be subject to seizure.""
He described references to a guarantee in the Commisimpex documents as ""allegations"" and said it was up to the company to present proof to the court.
Oil accounts for about three-quarters of Congo's revenues, and weak global crude prices have hit the country hard. Losing taxes or royalty payments would add to the economic pain.
Congo has opened talks with the IMF to support its economy. But Congo's debt load has come under scrutiny by the IMF, which last month said Brazzaville had not fully disclosed its debt situation during a visit by IMF officials in March.
An IMF delegation began another week-long visit on Tuesday during which it said it would finalize its debt assessment.
Rating agency Standard & Poor's said last week it would consider raising Congo's foreign currency ratings if the government reached a settlement with Commisimpex.
Earlier this year, Commisimpex briefly secured the freezing of a $21 million coupon payment Congo made to holders of its $363 million Eurobond. But its effort to secure the funds was unsuccessful, a U.S. court ordered them to be released, but the move temporarily pushed the bond into default.

 The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude October contract was at $51.83 a barrel, down 40 cents or about 0.73% by 09:00 a.m. ET (13:00 GMT), after hitting a fove-month peak of $52.43 earlier in the day.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for November delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was down 81 cents or about 1.39% at $57.62 a barrel, off an eight-month high of 58.88 reached overnight.
Prices have been supported this week as data showed strong compliance from major producers with their supply cut agreement and as talk grows of a likely extension of the deal.
OPEC and non-OPEC compliance with the deal to curb output rose to 116% in August, a strong increase from the 94% compliance achieved a month ago.
In May, OPEC and non-OPEC members led by Russia agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
Russia’s energy minister suggested that January is the earliest date that an extension to the global accord can be considered, although other ministers suggested such a decision could be taken before the end of this year.
The committee’s next meeting is set for November 29 in Vienna, just a day ahead of OPEC’s regularly scheduled meeting.
Turkey's threat to cut off a major pipeline that carries oil from from Iraq's Kurdistan region to the outside world provided further support. The pipeline to Turkey's port of Ceyhan usually pumps between 500,000-600,000 barrels per day.
Investors now looked ahead to weekly data from the U.S. on stockpiles of crude and refined products to weigh what the impact of recent storm activity was on supply and demand.

 Comex gold futures were down $8.92 or about 0.69% at $1,302.60 a troy ounce by 08:45 a.m. ET (12:45 GMT).
Chair Janet Yellen was due to deliver a speech titled ""Inflation, Uncertainty, and Monetary Policy"" at the National Association for Business Economics' Annual Meeting in Cleveland at 12:45PM ET (16:45GMT) on Tuesday.
Her comments will be monitored closely for any new insight on policy. Last week, the U.S. central bank announced it would begin trimming down its $4.5 trillion in assets and signaled it will likely raise rates again this year.
The greenback had strengthened after New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley on Monday said the Fed is on track to gradually raise interest rates given factors depressing inflation are ""fading"" and the U.S. economy's fundamentals are sound.
“I expect inflation will rise and stabilize around the (Fed's) 2% objective over the medium term,"" he said before adding that ""in response, the Federal Reserve will likely continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually.""
However, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said shortly after that the U.S. central bank should wait until there are clear signs that income and prices are rising before raising interest rates again, warning that moving too fast would be a policy “misstep.”
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, wasup 0.45% at 92.87,the highest since August 31.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
But the precious metal's losses were capped by fresh geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and North Korea.
North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said on Monday that President Donald Trump had declared war on the country and that Pyongyang reserved the right to shoot down U.S. bombers, even if they are not in its air space.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures declined 0.76% to $17.01 a troy ounce."

Until mid-November, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission will hear from groups including landowners, aboriginals and environmentalists, many of whom fiercely oppose the project, while the energy industry supports it.
The commission is not due to make its final decision until next April for Enbridge's project of replacing its aging pipeline.
The Line 3 replacement project from Hardisty, Alberta, to Superior, Wisconsin, doubles the capacity of the existing line, - which was built in the 1960s and has been running below capacity - to its original 760,000 barrels per day.
The bulk of the line's U.S. portion passes through Minnesota, the last jurisdiction to review it. A decision to not grant permission would bar work for construction in state, although the company can appeal, and the current line remains operational.
Enbridge spokesman Michael Barnes said: ""We are eager for the hearings to get under way and the facts to be presented. This will be a detailed process, which will show the need for the replacement project.""
In a surprise move this month, Minnesota's Department of Commerce opposed the upgrade, saying refineries in the state and the upper Midwest ""are not short of physical supplies of crude oil, and that they have little room to increase total crude runs.""
Producers in Canada's oil heartland of Alberta, whose landlocked crude trades at a discount to the U.S. West Texas Intermediate benchmark (CLc1), say they need additional export capacity to attain higher prices.
Aboriginal groups and environmentalist say they are concerned about the potential for leaks and what they say are the project's contributions to climate change. Further they say, parts of the project involve rerouting, making it akin to a new pipeline than the replacement of an old one.
Enbridge has already begun Line 3 construction in Canada and the state of Wisconsin, where it has obtained all approvals.
Enbridge said last month the Line 3 replacement project will cost 9 percent more than its previous forecast, citing in part regulatory delays

Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the U.S. declined by 5 to 744, marking the third weekly decline in a row.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.

Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other major producers met in Vienna on Friday, and pledged to revisit the idea of extending the output-cut agreement beyond the March 2018 deadline in the coming months.
\""I believe that January is the earliest date when we can actually, credibly speak about the state of the market,\"" Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said.
Other ministers, however, expressed an eagerness to reach a decision this year, fuelling expectations that an extension to the global accord to curb production beyond the March 2018 will be agreed sooner rather later.
“It’s [the rally in oil prices] all driven by the idea that the production cut is starting to work and the rebalance is underway,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in New York.
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8m barrels per day for a period of nine months until March 2018.
Some analysts, however, were quick to downplay the prospect of a prolonged rally, highlighting that rising oil prices may encourage oil exporters to pump above agreed-upon levels, lowering the rate of compliance with the global accord to curb output.
\""Even at these prices levels, they\'re still bleeding cash. So they want more money and I think the incentive to stay together starts to decrease,\"" said Francisco Blanch, head of global commodities and derivatives research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $14.07, or 1.08%, to $1,311.54 a troy ounce.
“The whole world should clearly remember it was the US who first declared war on our country."" North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong said in reference to President Donald Trump’s tweet that “North Korea won’t be around much longer”.
""Since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not inside the airspace border of our country,"" Ri said.
The strong start to the week for gold comes after the precious metal slipped to a second-straight weekly loss last week as traders unwound some of their bullish bets on the gold.
Net bullish bets on gold fell to 236,100, according to a report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday.
Demand for the precious metal, however, could come under pressure during the week as a flurry of Federal Reserve speakers are slated to deliver speeches including the central bank’s chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday.
Following the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting last week, the Federal Reserve signalled that a year-end rate hike remained appropriate.
In a rising interest rate environment, investor appetite for gold weakens as the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal increases relative to other interest-bearing assets such as bonds.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures gained 1.01% to $17.16 a troy ounce while platinum futures added 0.62% to $942.00.

 Comex gold futures were down $1.78 or about 0.14% at $1,295.82 a troy ounce by 09:00 a.m. ET (13:00 GMT).
The greenback was boosted after Dudley said the Fed is on track to gradually raise interest rates given factors depressing inflation are ""fading"" and the U.S. economy's fundamentals are sound.
“I expect inflation will rise and stabilize around the (Fed's) 2% objective over the medium term,"" he said before adding that ""in response, the Federal Reserve will likely continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually.""
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.41% at 92.33, the highest since September 21.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

Market participants were also looking ahead to a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen titled ""Inflation, Uncertainty, and Monetary Policy"" at the National Association for Business Economics' Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
Elsewhere, investors were still digesting the weekend's election results in Germany, which showed growing support for a far-right party.

Warm high pressure will dominate the Great Lakes and east-central U.S. through mid-week with highs of 80s and 90s, followed by cooling late in the week as a fresh weather system arrives with showers and thunderstorms.
The West will warm back into the 80s and 90s as the week progresses with the return of high pressure.
Natural gas for November delivery was at $3.038 per million British thermal units by 8:55AM ET (1255GMT), up 1.7 cents, or around 0.6%.
Futures lost about 2.2% last week after hitting their worst level since Sept. 12 at $2.995 on Friday, as traders reacted to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity was coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn having started on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.408 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 3.8% lower than levels at this time a year ago and in line with the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 61 and 71 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 22.
That compares with a gain of 97 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 49 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 84 billion cubic feet.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures tacked on 45 cents, or around 0.9%, to $51.11 a barrel by 8:05AM ET (1205GMT), after reaching their highest level since May 25 at $51.19.
U.S. oil prices gained about 1.5% last week, their third-straight weekly climb.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., rallied 75 cents, or about 1.3%, to $57.17 a barrel. It traded as high as $57.26 intraday, a level last seen since Jan. 3.
The global benchmark closed last week with a gain of 2.2%, its fourth-consecutive weekly climb.
Major oil producers convening in Vienna for an OPEC-led committee meeting on Friday boasted record compliance with their production-cut agreement, but, as expected, decided to wait a bit longer to see if any further action was needed.
OPEC and non-OPEC compliance with the deal to curb output rose to 116% in August, the committee said, a strong increase from the 94% compliance achieved a month ago.
In May, OPEC and non-OPEC members led by Russia agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
But so far rising production from the U.S., Nigeria and Libya has undermined the cartel’s efforts to curb excess supply.
Russia’s energy minister suggested that January is the earliest date that an extension to the global accord can be considered, although other ministers suggested such a decision could be taken before the end of this year.
The committee’s next meeting is set for November 29 in Vienna, just a day ahead of OPEC’s regularly scheduled meeting.
Elsewhere, in the U.S., market participants mulled over data showing the number of oil rigs continued to decline, suggesting a possible tightening in domestic production.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the U.S. declined by 5 to 744, marking the third weekly decline in a row.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to further weigh what the impact of recent storm activity was on supply and demand.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Crude oil exports from the United States will increase to meet 5 percent of global demand by 2022, as refiners seek more low-sulfur crude to meet stricter rules for cleaner fuels, an executive from Enterprise Partners LP said on Monday.
U.S. oil exports may rise to about 4 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2022, a four-fold jump from this year, said Brent Secrest, a senior vice president at Enterprise Products. During that same period, global oil demand, excluding the U.S., may rise to as much as 73 million bpd, up from 65 million bpd currently, he said.
Demand for light, low-sulfur, or sweet, crude is set to rise as countries push refiners to produce cleaner fuels, as highlighted by the Internationals Maritime Organization's (IMO) new rules to cut the sulfur content in the fuel used in large container ships, or bunker fuel, by 2020.
""The (crude oil) barrels have to clear across the water ... To the demand in Asia, to the demand in Europe,"" he told an industry event in Singapore.
U.S. crude oil production has spiked following the higher output of low-sulfur crude from shale formations since the late-2000s, causing a glut in domestic crude supplies. U.S. refiners, however, are geared toward processing denser oil with a higher sulfur content.
Enterprise currently exports around 100,000 bpd of crude oil from the U.S. Gulf Coast, Secrest said.
To ramp up exports, the company plans to increase the loading rates at the Enterprise Houston Midland terminal by the first quarter of 2018 and is looking at stabilizing the quality of Domestic Sweet crude (DSW) exports from its Seaway terminal, he said.
More U.S. oil exports are also expected as U.S. refiners will not change their configurations to accommodate domestic light, sweet crude oil, Secrest added.
The change in the bunker fuel specifications will also boost the U.S. export demand, he said.
The IMO tightened the sulfur requirement for bunker fuels in October to a maximum of 0.5 percent from the current maximum of 3.5 percent.
Refiners and the shipping sector have not decided how to meet the stricter standards amid a myriad of solutions that include switching to gasoil or installing scrubbers to remove sulfur emissions from ships.
""(The) solution is light sweet crude oil that we have to offer, Secrest said.

""We will be investing roughly $4 billion, next year, of capital in the Permian Basin, and we plan to grow production over the next several years to well in excess of 400,000 bpd,"" he said.
Chevron expects crude oil output from all producers operating in Permian to rise by 1.4 million bpd in 2020, from 2.4 million bpd at present.

""The Permian is the powerhouse (of U.S. crude output growth),"" Krogmeier added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices came under pressure from a strong dollar, but kept most of their gains from the previous session as major producers meeting in Vienna said the market was well on its way towards rebalancing.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and several other producers have cut production by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) since the start of 2017, helping lift oil prices by about 15 percent in the past three months.
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq, who chaired Friday's meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, said output curbs were helping cut global crude inventories to their five-year average, OPEC's stated target.
London Brent crude for November delivery was down 8 cents at $56.78 a barrel by 0614 GMT, near the highest since March. U.S. crude for November delivery was down 15 cents at $50.51, but not far off recent four-month highs.
The dollar index was up 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies. The euro slipped after Germany's election showed surging support for a far-right party that left Chancellor Angela Merkel scrambling to form a governing coalition. 
Russia's energy minister said no decision on extending output curbs beyond the end of March was expected before January, although other ministers suggested such a decision could be taken before the end of this year.
Iran expects to maintain overall crude and condensate exports at around 2.6 million bpd for the rest of 2017, a senior official in the nation's state oil company said, while the UAE's energy minister said its compliance to supply cuts was 100 percent.
Nigeria is pumping below its agreed output cap, its oil minister said.
""Oil is relatively underpriced compared with other markets, but any steep rise would be offset by rising shale oil production,"" said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting in Tokyo.
Production curbs have faced rising U.S. shale oil output. U.S. energy firms cut the number of oil rigs operating for a third week as a 14-month drilling recovery stalled.
Markets were also eyeing developments in North Korea. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday said President Donald Trump wants to avoid nuclear war with North Korea and ""will do everything we can"" to avoid conflict.

The remarks added to concerns that the escalating rhetoric could lead to one side misinterpreting the other, with dangerous consequences. Many investors favor gold during times of geopolitical uncertainty.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures tacked on 11 cents, or around 0.2%, to end at $50.66 a barrel by close of trade, not far from its highest level since May 25 at $51.11 reached on Wednesday.
For the week, U.S. oil prices gained about 1.5%, their third-straight weekly climb.
Meanwhile, Brent crude futures, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S., rose 43 cents, or roughly 0.8%, to settle at $56.86 a barrel after touching a more than six-month peak of $56.91 earlier in the session.
The global benchmark closed the week with a gain of 2.2%, its fourth-consecutive weekly climb.
Major oil producers convening in Vienna for an OPEC-led committee meeting on Friday boasted record compliance with their production-cut agreement, but, as expected, decided to wait a bit longer to see if any further action was needed.
OPEC and non-OPEC compliance with the deal to curb output rose to 116% in August, the committee said, a strong increase from the 94% compliance achieved a month ago.
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq, who chaired the meeting, said the market ""is evidently well on its way towards rebalancing.""
In May, OPEC and non-OPEC members led by Russia agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day for a period of nine months until March 2018 in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.
But so far rising production from the U.S., Nigeria and Libya has undermined the cartel’s efforts to curb excess supply.
Russia’s energy minister suggested that January is the earliest date that an extension to the global accord can be considered, although other ministers suggested such a decision could be taken before the end of this year.
The committee’s next meeting is set for November 29 in Vienna, just a day ahead of OPEC’s regularly scheduled meeting.
Elsewhere, in the U.S., market participants mulled over data showing the number of oil rigs continued to decline, suggesting a possible tightening in domestic production.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the U.S. declined by 5 to 744, marking the third weekly decline in a row.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Meanwhile, gasoline futures inched up 1.9 cents, or 1.2%, to end at $1.626 on Friday. It closed around 0.4% higher for the week.
Heating oil finished flat at $1.808 a gallon, but still ending roughly 1% higher for the week.
Natural gas futures added 1.4 cents, or 0.5%, to settle at $3.021 per million British thermal units. It saw a weekly loss of nearly 2.2%.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to further weigh what the impact of recent storm activity was on supply and demand.

JARKUDUK, Uzbekistan (Reuters) - Lukoil (MM:LKOH) plans to keep pumping 100 million tonnes of oil per year between 2018 and 2027 with projects outside Russia and will keep annual investment at $8 billion-$8.5 billion, the chief executive said on Saturday.
Lukoil, Russia's No.2 oil producer which has suffered from sluggish output from its Western Siberia fields, has kept production steady by focusing on growth in new regions, such as the Caspian Sea and Iraq. It is also looking at Iran and Mexico.
Lukoil Chief Executive Vagit Alekperov announced details of company's 2018-2027 strategy to reporters at the launch of the firm's gas facilities in Uzbekistan. He said details would be discussed by the board in December.
Under the new strategy, Lukoil planned to add 1.1 billion-1.2 billion tonnes of hydrocarbon to reserves while its gas output would reach to 35-40 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year by 2027, he said.
The 2018-2010 budget would be based on an oil price of $50 per barrel and a rouble rate of 62-64 rubles to the dollar, said Alekperov, who is also a major Lukoil shareholder.
Lukoil, a big oil products importer on the European market, would continue working on European projects and would keep its retail net in Turkey, the CEO said, despite new U.S. sanctions imposed on Moscow this year.
Regarding other projects, Alekperov said he would meet Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh in Moscow on Oct. 3.
Tehran has said earlier it expected to sign deals in the next five to six months with Russian firms, such as Lukoil, on developing of Iranian oil and gas resources.
Lukoil has been in talks with the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) on taking part in development of the Abe Timur and Mansuri fields in central-western Iran.
""We are very close, we have some disagreements which are not crucial, regarding output volumes and the pace of coming to any given levels,"" Alekperov said, adding he was confident the differences could be resolved.
He also said the firm was also talking to Italy's  ENI  (MI:ENI) on joint projects in Mexico.
In Uzbekistan, Alekperov said Lukoil would invest $3 billion in gas projects by 2021-2022.
Uzbekistan aimed to add output of 1.5 bcm in 2017 to the 2016 level of 55 bcm, Uzbekneftegaz head Alisher Sultanov said, adding that the country consumed up to 30 bcm per year.
Sultanov said Tashkent had contracts for exporting up to 6 bcm to Russia and up to 10 bcm to China.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $5.95, or 0.46%, to $1,300.75 a troy ounce.
U.S. – North Korea relations further strained on Friday, fueling demand for safe-haven gold after North Korea said it might test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean.
The prospect of North Korea carrying out yet another act of provocation comes amid Kim Jong Un’s brazen pledge to make a ""mentally deranged"" Trump pay dearly for an earlier threat to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened America or its allies.
The uptick in safe-haven demand, however, is unlikely to rescue the pressure metal from a second-straight weekly loss, following a surge in expectations for a year-end Federal Reserve rate hike.
The Federal Reserve indicated that its members’ rate-hike outlook saw rates rising to between 1.25% and 1.5% by the end of the 2017. With rates steady at 1-1.25%, that points to one further rate hike this year.
According to investing.com’s fed rate monitor tool more than 70% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to hike rates in December.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for November delivery rose 11 cents to settle at $50.66 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 27 cents to trade at $56.70 a barrel.
As was widely expected, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other major producers failed to reach a decision to extend output cuts beyond March 2018.
Russia’s energy minister suggested that January is the earliest date that an extension to the global accord can be considered, as it allows ample time to assess the state of the market.
""I believe that January is the earliest date when we can actually, credibly speak about the state of the market,"" Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said. Other ministers suggested a decision could come this year.

The panel on tariff rate quotas (TRQs) for agricultural products was automatically established as it was the second request by the United States at the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, after China blocked the first attempt on Aug. 31.
The row was initiated under the Obama administration which sought consultations on Dec. 15, but the Trump administration moved ahead with the case saying that the quotas hurt U.S. farm exports.
China's delegation told the WTO's meeting on Friday that it was disappointed at U.S. moves against its ""legitimate measures with regard to vital agricultural staples"", the trade official said. China was seriously fulfilling its WTO commitments, it said.
The U.S. delegation said that when China joined the trade watchdog it pledged to remove import restrictions and operate its tariff-rate quotas in a transparent, predictable and fair manner. ""But the reality appears very different,"" it said.
The U.S. Trade Representative has said global prices for the three commodities were lower than China's domestic prices, yet China did not maximize its use of TRQs, which offer lower duties on a certain volume of imported grains every year.
The USTR said that limited market access for shipments from the United States, the world's largest grain exporter, and other countries.
Some 14 countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, and Thailand - as well as the European Union (EU) - have joined the dispute as third parties.

Natural gas for delivery in October on the New York Mercantile Exchange lost 10.9 cents, or about 3.5%, to trade at $2.985 per million British thermal units by 10:32AM ET (14:32GMT).
Futures had been falling 6.6 cents, or around 2.1%, at $3.029 prior to the release of the supply data.
That compared with a build of 91 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the preceding week and represented a decline of 136 billion from a year earlier but was 67 bcf above the five-year average.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.3408 trillion cubic feet, 3.8% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 2.0% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas prices look set to remain on the back foot in the weeks ahead as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Thursday, giving up some recent gains before a meeting of oil producers that could extend production limits aimed at clearing a glut in supplies that has depressed the market for more than three years.
Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers meet in Vienna on Friday and are due to consider extending output cuts that began in January.
OPEC and its allies have agreed to reduce output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018 in an attempt to empty inventories. Many analysts now expect them to extend the deal, possibly to the end of next year.
""The bull run in the oil market is running out of steam as unease builds ahead of tomorrow’s OPEC/non-OPEC meeting,"" said Stephen Brennock, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
""The (oil futures) contracts have performed well in recent sessions but are struggling for traction,"" Brennock added.
Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was down 40 cents at $55.89 a barrel by 1115 GMT. U.S. light crude was 50 cents lower at $50.19.
Both contracts have risen more than 15 percent over the last three months as global oil supply has tightened.
OPEC's efforts have been hampered by higher production in some other parts of the world, including the United States, where shale oil production is reaching record highs.
Recent hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have also pushed up crude oil inventories in some parts of the United States as U.S. refineries have been shut by flooding.
U.S. commercial crude oil stocks  rose for a third straight week, building by 4.6 million barrels in the week ending Sept. 15 to 472.83 million barrels. [EIA/S]
U.S. oil production has reached 9.51 million bpd, up from 8.78 million bpd directly after Hurricane Harvey hit the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
U.S. crude received some support from a strong draw in gasoline stocks by 2.1 million barrels to 216.19 million barrels, traders said. 
The structure of oil futures prices suggests OPEC production cuts are beginning to have an impact, analysts say.
Front-month Brent futures have risen sharply in recent months, much more than forward prices. This has changed the Brent price curve <0#LCO:>, moving it into what traders call ""backwardation"", when prices for immediate delivery are higher than prices for later barrels.

The shift is seen as an indicator of a tightening market as it encourages the immediate sale of oil rather than holding it in storage.

 Elsewhere, Brent oil for November delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up 19 cents or about 0.34% at $56.10 a barrel, after hitting a fresh five-month high of $56.30 overnight.
Market participants initially shrugged off Wednesday's report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration showing that crude stockpiles rose more than expected last week.
It was the third consecutive week crude inventories increased in the U.S., as heavy flooding due to storm Harvey knocked out nearly quarter of the nation's refining capacity in August, pressuring demand for crude oil, the primary input at refineries.
Prices climbed to multi-month highs late last week and had remained supported until recently by bullish demand forecasts from OPEC and the International Energy Agency.
The commodity got an additional boost on Wednesday, when Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi said that his country and other OPEC members are considering options to its production-cut agreement, including an extension beyond March and a deeper output cut.
Traders were now looking ahead to a meeting scheduled in Vienna on Friday between OPEC and other producers regarding a possible extension of production caps.

As expected, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.
However, the central bank indicated that one more interest rate hike is likely this year, even though it reduced its outlook for inflation this year from 1.7% to 1.5%, and from 2% to 1.9% in 2018.
The Fed also said it will begin to unwind its $4.5 trillion balance sheet in October. Most assets consist of the Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities the bank acquired under its quantitative easing program.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for November delivery rose 0.02% to $50.70 a barrel, while on London\'s Intercontinental Exchange, Brent eased 0.07% to $56.15 a barrel.
Overnight, oil prices settled higher on Wednesday, as bearish data showing U.S. supplies of crude oil rose more than expected was overshadowed by growing expectations that Opec will decide to extend its agreement to cut oil output.
A report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showing crude stockpiles rose more than expected last week briefly pared earlier gains amid growing investor optimism on a possible extension to the Opec-led agreement to cut oil output.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by roughly 4.6m barrels in the week ended Sept. 15, confounding expectations of a rise of about only 3.4m barrels. It was the third weekly build in crude stockpiles.
Gasoline inventories, one of the products that crude is refined into, fell by roughly 2.13m barrels, missing expectations of a draw of 2.14m barrels while distillate stockpiles fell by 5.7m barrels, topping expectations of a decline of 1.6m barrels.

167,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2017 07:50PM ET</span>",Oil up 2 percent despite U.S. crude build; set for best third quarter since 2004,"By Julia Simon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled up 2 percent on Wednesday despite a rise in U.S. crude inventories, with the market heading for its largest third-quarter gain in 13 years after the Iraqi oil minister said OPEC and its partners were considering extending or deepening output cuts.
Brent crude futures rose $1.06, or 1.9 percent, to $56.20 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 93 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $50.41.
Crude prices were on course for a nearly 16 percent rise this quarter, which would make this year's performance the strongest for the third quarter since 2004. 
U.S. crude oil stockpiles jumped last week as imports and production increased, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said, as operations resumed from the impact of Hurricane Harvey 
which hit the Gulf Coast on Aug. 25.
Crude inventories rose for a third straight week, building by 4.6 million barrels, about a million more barrels than forecast. 
""The impact of Hurricane Harvey can still be seen in today's larger-than-expected build in the U.S. commercial crude stockpile,"" said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy's Global Gas Analytics in London. ""However, this has had limited impact in dissipating the bullish sentiment prevailing in the market.""
However, U.S. crude remains rangebound around $50. 
The Brent/WTI spread WTCLc1-LCOc1 widened 36 cents to settle at negative $5.60. Because of the depressed price of U.S. crude compared to Brent, the spread is now the widest in more than two years.
""The hurricane widened it out,"" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, pointing out that U.S. inventories and global inventories have different narratives because of Harvey.
""If I look at this week's EIA data, post hurricane ... the refined products drawdown implies that refineries are not yet back to normal,"" he said. ""They're not replacing inventories for current demand.""
Gasoline stocks fell 2.1 million barrels, the EIA said Wednesday, in line with analysts' expectations, while distillate stocks inventories fell 5.7 million barrels, the biggest weekly draw since November 2011.
The October front-month futures CLc1 contract expires on Wednesday.
On Friday the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers will meet in Vienna to discuss the progress of their deal to limit output.
The group is considering a range of options, including an extension of cuts, but it would be premature to decide on what to do beyond the agreement's expiry in March, Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi told an energy conference on Tuesday.
OPEC and non-OPEC producers including Russia have agreed to reduce output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March to reduce global oil inventories and support prices.
Some producers think the pact should be extended for three or four months, others want it to run until the end of 2018, while some, including Ecuador and Iraq, think there should be another round of supply cuts, al-Luaibi said.

""The market will be monitoring [the meeting] closely, to see if they're including Nigeria and Libya,"" said Tony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging. ""Cuts have been relatively well implemented recently and early thoughts are that they're going to maintain those cuts.""

168,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2017 04:20PM ET</span>",Energy contract lawsuits expected to jump in Harvey's wake,"By Bryan Sims
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Lawyers expect a spate of force majeure contract lawsuits after Hurricane Harvey tore through Southeast Texas and parts of Louisiana last month, paralyzing a fifth of U.S. fuel output and pushing some oil production offline. 
Hurricanes and other natural disasters can affect the energy industry's ability to honor contracts related to oil and natural gas production, transport and oilfield services. 
Force majeure is a legal declaration that means the operator cannot fulfill a contract due to circumstances outside its control.
Damage in Texas wrought by Harvey is estimated at around $180 billion, according to Texas Governor Greg Abbott, with some of that in the oil-rich Eagle Ford shale region southwest of Houston.
While the full extent of Harvey's effect on the Gulf Coast energy industry is still being tabulated, damage from hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 shut in more than 8 billion cubic feet of gas production and 1.5 million barrels per day of oil production. 
Hurricane Ike, which came less than a month after Hurricane Gustav in 2008, had a similar effect on oil and gas production and disrupted the chemical industry, leading some companies to declare force majeure of certain products and supplies. 
Many chemical and refinery plants along the U.S. Gulf Coast have already restarted operations or are beginning to ramp up after damage by Harvey. Once they do, customers may insist on reviewing contractual terms with their energy industry suppliers for the product they did not receive while plants were shuttered.
Force majeure issues typically arise in both contract lawsuits and tort suits, which allege negligence, said Jessica Crutcher, an attorney for Houston law firm Meyer Brown. 
""Every force majeure clause is different, especially when you're dealing with heavily negotiated contracts in the energy sector,"" she said on Tuesday during a force majeure webinar sponsored by the law firm.
In tort disputes, defendants can best defend themselves if they took every reasonable effort to protect their property from storm damage or other factors, according to Crutcher. 
Force majeure notices should clearly outline a connection between Harvey and the reason for making the notice. 
""Failure of a notice is fatal to a defense,"" she said.
But not every consequence of a force majeure declaration should be viewed as being automatically tied to Harvey, attorney Mike Lennon said.

""Disclose any latent issues in the force majeure declaration and connect it to the Harvey event,"" he said.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $6.62, or 0.50%, to $1,317.14 a troy ounce.
Gold prices edged higher as investors widely expect the Federal Reserve to signal that it will start to reduce its $4.5tn balance sheet and leave its benchmark rate unchanged.
The Fed’s outlook on future monetary policy tightening is less clear, however, amid growing expectations that the trend of slowing inflation could force the U.S. central bank to scale back its plan to hike rates at least once more this year.
“The FOMC will announce its plans about trimming down the size of its mammoth balance sheet and the market has priced that in,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets. “What is not priced in the gold price is the hawkish tone by the Fed and that could trigger a selloff.”
At the FOMC June meeting, the ""dot plot,"" part of the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections, indicated that the central bank saw rates rising to between 1.25% and 1.5% by the end of the 2017.
The dot plot shows where each participant in the meeting thinks the Fed funds rate should be at the end of the year, for the next few years, and in the longer run.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

171,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2017 11:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: From Russia with fuel - North Korean ships may be undermining sanctions,"By Polina Nikolskaya
MOSCOW (Reuters) - At least eight North Korean ships that left Russia with a cargo of fuel this year headed for their homeland despite declaring other destinations, a ploy that U.S. officials say is often used to undermine sanctions.
Reuters has no evidence of wrongdoing by the vessels, whose movements were recorded in Reuters ship-tracking data. Changing a ship's destination once underway is not forbidden and it is unclear whether any of the ships unloaded fuel in North Korea. 
But U.S. officials say that changing destination mid-voyage is a hallmark of North Korean state tactics to circumvent the international trade sanctions imposed over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.
Changing course and the complex chain of different firms --many offshore -- involved in shipments can complicate efforts to check how much fuel is supplied to North Korea and monitor compliance with a cap on fuel imports under U.N. sanctions. 
""As part of North Korea's efforts to acquire revenue, the regime uses shipping networks to import and export goods,"" U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Marshall S. Billingslea told the congressional Foreign Affairs Committee this month.
""North Korea employs deceptive practices to conceal the true origins of these goods. Pyongyang has been found to routinely falsify a vessel's identity and documentation."" 
VOYAGE OF THE MA DU SAN
The eight vessels identified in the tracking data set sail from the Far Eastern Russian port of Vladivostok or nearby Nakhodka and registered China or South Korea as their destination with the Information System for State Port Control.
After leaving Russia, they were next recorded off the North Korean ports of Kimchaek, Chongjin, Hungnam or Najin. None went on to China and most went back to Russia.  
All had a cargo of diesel, a source at the company that services vessels in Vladivostok said. Their cargo capacity ranged from 500 tonnes to 2,000 tonnes. 
One of the vessels was the Ma Du San, owned by North Korea's Korea Kyongun Shipping Co. It took on a cargo of 545 tonnes of marine fuel at Vladivostok's Pervaya Rechka terminal, owned by Russia's Independent Petroleum company (IPC). 
Reuters obtained a bill of lading -- a receipt for goods issued when a ship loads up -- dated May 19 showing the Ma Du San's cargo came from Khabarovskiy NPZ, a refinery owned by IPC.
The ship set sail on May 20. Documents filed with Russia's Information System for State Port Control stated its next destination as the Chinese port of Zhanjiang and the bill of lading showed it as Busan in South Korea.
The Ma Du San's next recorded location after Vladivostok was inside the perimeter of the port of Kimchaek -- all the other ships were tracked only in the vicinity of ports. North Korean ships intermittently turn off their transponders, and satellites cannot track them at such times, U.S. officials say.
Allegations outlined in two U.S. Treasury Department sanctions orders and a legal complaint filed by the U.S. government match the information Reuters obtained on the Ma Du San though the U.S. documents do not name the vessel involved. 
    
SANCTIONS BLACKLIST 
On June 1, the U.S. Treasury Department included IPC on its sanctions blacklist, saying it provided oil to North Korea and may have been involved in circumventing sanctions.
On Aug. 22, the U.S. government sanctioned two more companies, both registered in Singapore -- Transatlantic Partners and Velmur Management Pte. Ltd.
The legal complaint, also filed on Aug. 22, accused the two firms of money laundering on behalf of sanctioned North Korean banks seeking to buy petroleum products, citing a bill of lading for May 19 for a cargo of diesel sold by IPC to Velmur and loaded in Vladivostok -- the same date as the bill of lading for the Ma Du San.
Andrey Serbin, who represents Transatlantic Partners, said the firm had not received payments from a sanctions-hit bank and that ownership of the fuel changed after it was loaded.
""We sold the fuel to a Chinese company,"" Serbin, who has been blacklisted by the U.S. government for ""operating in the energy industry in the North Korean economy"" and working to purchase fuel for delivery to North Korea, said of several shipments where the company acted as middleman. 
""There's no way we can control them (the goods),"" he said.
Serbin did not identify the vessels Transatlantic Partners loaded fuel on to, but a source in a company that services ships in Vladivostok said the Ma Du San was among them. 
The bill of lading named the recipient of the Ma Du San's cargo as a company called LLC Sky Shipping Limited. Reuters was unable to find any record of such a firm.
Velmur said it could not have known where the cargo would end up and did not knowingly help anyone dodge sanctions. 
IPC did not respond to a request for comment. Its parent company, Bermuda-registered Alliance Oil Company Ltd., denied having any contractual relations with North Korean companies when U.S. sanctions were imposed on IPC.
The U.S. Treasury and State departments declined to answer questions about Reuters' findings.
Russia's foreign ministry did not respond to questions about fuel exports to North Korea but has said Russia complies with the sanctions. Russia's customs service said it could not provide information about movement of goods across borders.
Since the U.S. sanctions were imposed on IPC, all North Korean-flagged vessels that had been in Vladivostok port have left, according to the tracking data. 
They departed with no cargo, an employee with a shipping agent in Vladivostok said. This is confirmed by documents seen by Reuters.
Russian supplies of oil and oil products to North Korea are much smaller than volumes shipped by China, Pyongyang's only major ally. Beijing has acted to reduce the flows, but Russia's trade in all goods with North Korea more than doubled in the first quarter of 2017 to $31.4 million.
Moscow's trade with Pyongyang is under closer scrutiny following a series of missile launches by North Korea and a test involving what it said was a hydrogen bomb.

180,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2017 10:20AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco could disclose accounts early 2018: sources,"By Alex Lawler and Rania El Gamal
LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco will be able to release its audited financial accounts in early 2018 if the government decides on a venue for listing the oil giant's IPO and finalizes several reforms this year, three sources said.
It will be the first public earnings disclosure for Aramco and one of the most important internal milestones in preparing for the initial public offering (IPO), which is expected to raise as much as $100 billion.
The Saudi government has said it wants the sale of five percent of Aramco to take place before the end of 2018. A Saudi government source said the share sale was on track.
Releasing the 2015-2017 accounts in the first quarter would be a major step toward sticking to the 2018 goal although the IPO's timing depends on several external factors, the sources said.
""Aramco will have its 2017 results by the first quarter, the audited accounts will be available then, so the IPO could happen after that,"" one of the sources said.
The sources said internal accountants would send the 2017 accounts to external auditors when they have finished work on them at the beginning of next year. The auditors - named by Aramco as PwC, EY and BCG - have already audited the 2015 and 2016 accounts. They have never been released.
The auditors and Aramco would first prepare a report on the accounts for all three years that it could share with a group of prospective large investors. They would then prepare a full prospectus which would be available to all investors.
The accounts for 2017 would be done to reflect Saudi's new taxation system while the two previous years would be done on a pro-forma accounting basis.
However, it would make sense to release the accounts only after the government has decided where the listing will take place as different venues use different accounting standards, the sources said.
For example, a listing in New York would require the accounts to be prepared according to US GAAP standards whereas IFRS standards would be acceptable for a listing in London, Hong Kong or Singapore.
Aramco has so far prepared the accounts according to IFRS standards, but can quickly convert those to U.S. GAAP if the government decides to list in New York, a second source said.
Possible Aramco valuations: http://tmsnrt.rs/2fH0rkr
DECISION-MAKER
The IPO is a centerpiece of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil which is championed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.
He has sweeping powers over defense, energy and the economy and is expected to take the final decision about Aramco's listing venue and the other reforms.
The accounts also cannot be finalized until the government has finished the reform of domestic fuel price subsidies.
These are currently funded by Aramco. Under the planned reform, the government will pay for the subsidies, the sources said.
This would boost Aramco's valuation and make it more attractive to investors ahead of the IPO as it could mean a higher dividend. The government has also yet to decide on Aramco's dividend policy.
A third source said those decisions need to be taken by the fourth quarter of 2017 to keep the IPO on track: ""That would keep the company on track to list by the second half of 2018. Aramco can be ready for next year. The ball is in the government's court now.""
In a statement to Reuters, Aramco said: ""The options review process for the IPO is well underway and on-track. There are no plans to release detailed financial statements in 2017.
""It’s important to emphasize that we have been sharing detailed operational and financial performance data with our current shareholder. We will continue this practice with any future shareholders post listing.""
The company will run its 2017 accounts under tax arrangements which were revised by the Saudi government to make the company more competitive with listed peers.
""Aramco is operating the accounts under the new system internally,"" the first source said.
The government set a new 50 percent tax rate for the firm in March. Previously, Aramco had paid 85 percent tax, plus a 20 percent royalty levied.
The two other sources confirmed the company could be ready to release accounts in early 2018.
""Once the financials are ready they can create a confidential information memorandum which they can then take to anchor investors such as sovereign wealth funds and start the bookbuilding with banks,"" the second source said.
The timing of the IPO will also depend on getting legal and regulatory approval from the jurisdictions it opts to list in.
It could also be influenced by the oil price -- currently below $60 per barrel - a price Saudi officials have identified as a good level.

 Elsewhere, Brent oil for November delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was up 14 cents or about 0.25% at $55.62 a barrel, not far from last Thursday's five-month high of $55.98.
Oil prices remained supported by last week's bullish demand forecasts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the International Energy Agency.
The data also showed that global oil production fell last month for the first time since March, boosting optimism that the market is rebalancing.
Market players were looking ahead to a meeting Friday between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers regarding a possible extension of production caps.
OPEC and its allies are discussing extending by more than three months the oil production cuts that expire in March 2018, potentially prolonging them well into the second half of next year, according to people familiar with the matter.

Comex gold futures were up $1.45 or about 0.11% at $1,312.14 a troy ounce by 08:50 a.m. ET (12:50 GMT), off Monday's three-week trough of $1,308.10.
The Fed was widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Thursday. However the U.S. central bank could give indications on when it plans to begin unwinding its balance sheet, as well as on any future interest rate decisions.
The U.S. Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that the number of housing starts unexpectedly fell in August, while building permits unexpectedly jumped.
Separate reports showed that U.S. import prices posted their biggest gain in seven months in August, while the current account deficit widened more than expected in the second quarter.

Gold is sensitive to moves in the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency.
However, the precious metal's gains were limited as concerns over tensions between the U.S. and North Korea remained subdued, although they were susceptible to pick up at any moment.
U.S. President Donald Trump was set to address the United Nations General Assembly for the first time on Tuesday and Pyongyang was widely expected to be on the agenda.

U.S. natural gas for October delivery was at $3.147 per million British thermal units by 8:45AM ET (1245GMT), little changed on the session. It touched its best level since May 31 at $3.166 a day earlier.
Futures climbed 4%, on Monday, as updated forecasts pointed to unusually warm weather in key gas-consuming regions in the U.S. in the week ahead.
High pressure will dominate the southern and east-central U.S. with highs of 80s and 90s through Sept. 25.
Meanwhile, traders said they were closely eying the path of Hurricane Maria, another top category Atlantic storm that hit the Caribbean islands on Tuesday, to see whether it would knock out production or disrupt shipping to and from the huge U.S. market.
Market participants also looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 82 and 92 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 15.
That compares with a gain of 91 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 52 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 73 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.311 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 5.1% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 1.3% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Despite recent gains, natural gas futures look set to remain on the back foot in the weeks ahead as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.

184,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2017 08:11AM ET</span>",Quiet energy revolution underway in Japan as dozens of towns go off the grid,"By Aaron Sheldrick and Osamu Tsukimori
TOKYO/HIGASHI MATSUSHIMA, JAPAN (Reuters) - A northern Japanese city's efforts to rebuild its electric power system after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami mark a quiet shift away from the country's old utility model toward self-reliant, local generation and transmission. 
After losing three-quarters of its homes and 1,100 people in the March 2011 temblor and tsunami, the city of Higashi Matsushima turned to the Japanese government's ""National Resilience Program,"" with 3.72 trillion yen ($33.32 billion) in funding for this fiscal year, to rebuild. 
The city of 40,000 chose to construct micro-grids and de-centralized renewable power generation to create a self-sustaining system capable of producing an average of 25 percent of its electricity without the need of the region's local power utility. 
The city's steps illustrate a massive yet little known effort to take dozens of Japan's towns and communities off the power grid and make them partly self-sufficient in generating electricity.
""At the time of the Great East Japan earthquake, we couldn't secure power and had to go through incredible hardships,"" said Yusuke Atsumi, a manager at HOPE, the utility Higashi Matsushima created to manage the local generation and grid.
Under a large-scale power system a ""blackout at one area would lead to wide-scale power outages. But the independent distributed micro-grid can sustain power even if the surrounding area is having a blackout.""
The Resilience Program is mainly for building back-up capabilities for Japan's cities and towns in the event of another disaster such as the earthquake and tsunami that caused meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. 
However, the Program has spurred the creation of micro-grids and distributed power generation across Japan that reduces municipalities dependence on large power plants. 
Japan's government ministries are seeking to raise the budget for the Program by another 24 percent for the fiscal year starting in April 2018, the cabinet office said last month.
The money earmarked for this fiscal year is going in part to the creation of smart energy management systems and distributed generation systems in towns across Japan. 
""Since Fukushima, there has been a gradual elaboration of policies to realize that kind of local autonomy, local consumption paradigm,"" said Andrew Dewit, a professor of energy policy at Rikkyo University in Tokyo.
Distributed generation uses small-scale power generation fueled by natural gas or solar and wind power arrays. Smart energy systems use the internet to connect appliances and meters to better direct electric power where and when its needed. 
Higashi Matsushima has built its own independent transmission grid and solar generating panels as well as batteries to store power that can keep the city running for at least three days, according to Atsumi.
Companies in Japan are shifting their focus in response to the changes heralded by cities like Higashi Matsushima. 
Sekisui House (T:1928), Japan's biggest builder of detached homes, constructed Higashi Matsushima's smart micro-grid for 85 housing units in 2016. 
Taisei Corp (T:1801), one of Japan's biggest construction companies, set up an energy strategy division this year to take advantage of the drive for smart energy systems. 
The company is planning to double energy-related orders to around 120 billion yen over the next five years, focusing on renewables, energy efficient buildings and smart communities, a spokesman said. 
Steps taken by cities like Higashi Matsushima were the brainchild of Takao Kashiwagi, a professor at the International Research Centre for Advanced Energy Systems for Sustainability at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.
He designed Japan's first smart town and is the head of the New Energy Promotion Council that has paid out more than 100 billion yen in subsidies from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry for smart energy communities.
""We are moving towards a day when we won't be building large-scale power plants. Instead, we will have distributed power systems, where small power supply systems are in place near the consumption areas,"" he said.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.14% to $1,312.70 a troy ounce.
Overnight, gold prices fell on Monday as fading tensions on the Korean Peninsula suppressed safe-haven demand while a sharp uptick in the dollar curbed sentiment on the precious metal ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting slated for Tuesday.
Fresh on the heels of a two-week losing streak, gold prices started the week on the back foot as investors appeared to unwind some of their long positions in the precious metal following strong gains in both the greenback and treasury yields.
Treasury yields rose sharply, pushing the dollar higher, amid expectations the Federal Reserve will announce that it will begin unwinding its $4.5tn bond portfolio and reaffirm its outlook that an additional rate hike remains appropriate this year, when it concludes its two-day meeting policy meeting on Wednesday.
“What is more, bond yields in the U.S. have increased significantly of late, which makes gold less attractive as an alternative investment,” Commerzbank (DE:DE:CBKG) says. “Presumably this is also why Friday saw the second consecutive daily outflow from gold ETFs [exchange-traded funds].”
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Meanwhile, geopolitical uncertainty eased, reducing demand for safe-haven gold as investors downplayed U.S-North Korea tensions and piled into risker assets such as equities.

Overnight, oil prices settled higher on Monday as investors shrugged off expectations that U.S. crude stockpiles are set to show a build for the third week in a row, following the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
Despite U.S. refineries reporting a much better recovery from the recent hurricanes, investors braced for an uptick in crude supplies as the U.S. ramps up imports at reopened ports to make up for the shortfall in domestic production following the aftermath of storm Harvey.
The expected uptick in crude supplies comes amid a turn in sentiment on oil prices in the wake of bullish reports from both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and International Energy Agency last week.
“It seems that at least part of the recent rally over the last few weeks has been due to stronger demand, all the major agencies revised up their forecasts for demand for this year,” said Tom Pugh, commodities economist at Capital Economics.
Opec is expected to continue talks to extend its production-cut agreement beyond March 2018 in an effort to tackle rising output from Nigeria and Libya – both countries are exempt from production curbs.
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8m barrels per day for a period of nine months until March 2018.

Despite U.S. refineries reporting a much better recovery from the recent hurricanes, investors braced for an uptick in crude supplies as the U.S. ramps up imports at reopened ports to make up for the shortfall in domestic production following the aftermath of storm Harvey. 
The expected uptick in crude supplies comes amid a turn in sentiment on oil prices in the wake of bullish reports from both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and International Energy Agency last week.
“It seems that at least part of the recent rally over the last few weeks has been due to stronger demand, all the major agencies revised up their forecasts for demand for this year,” said Tom Pugh, commodities economist at Capital Economics.
Opec is expected to continue talks to extend its production-cut agreement beyond March 2018 in an effort to tackle rising output from Nigeria and Libya – both countries are exempt from production curbs. 
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8m barrels per day for a period of nine months until March 2018. "

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $13.67, or 1.03%, to $1,311.51 a troy ounce.
Fresh on the heels of a two-week losing streak, gold prices started the week on the back foot as investors appeared to unwind some of their long positions in the precious metal following strong gains in both the greenback and treasury yields.
Treasury yields rose sharply, pushing the dollar higher, amid expectations the Federal Reserve will announce that it will begin unwinding its $4.5tn bond portfolio and reaffirm its outlook that an additional rate hike remains appropriate this year, when it concludes its two-day meeting policy meeting on Wednesday.
“What is more, bond yields in the U.S. have increased significantly of late, which makes gold less attractive as an alternative investment,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) says. “Presumably this is also why Friday saw the second consecutive daily outflow from gold ETFs [exchange-traded funds].”
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Meanwhile, geopolitical uncertainty eased, reducing demand for safe-haven gold as investors downplayed U.S-North Korea tensions and piled into risker assets such as equities.
“Investors have been programmed to more or less ignore stuff with Korea. The last two or three times this kind of thing occurred we went down a little, only to turn back higher. We’ve learned to buy on the dips,” said Terry Morris, senior vice president and senior equity manager for National Penn Investors Trust Company.
The uptick in the greenback weighed on commodities across the board, as silver futures fell 2.93% to $17.18 a troy ounce while platinum futures lost 1.03% to $961.75.
Copper traded at $2.97, up 0.64%, while natural gas rose by 4.33% to $3.155."

A trio of potential hurricanes forming in the Atlantic were also in focus.
U.S. natural gas for October delivery was at $3.117 per million British thermal units by 9:05AM ET (1305GMT), up 9.2 cents, or around 3%, after hitting its best level since May 31 at $3.132 earlier.
Futures climbed 4.6% last week.
High pressure will dominate the southern and east-central U.S. with highs of 80s and 90s in the coming days.
Despite recent gains, prices look set to remain on the back foot in the weeks ahead as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 82 and 92 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 15.
That compares with a gain of 91 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 52 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 73 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.311 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 5.1% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 1.3% above the five-year average for this time of year.

Oil prices remained supported by last week's bullish demand forecasts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the International Energy Agency.
The data also showed that global oil production fell last month for the first time since March, boosting optimism that the market is rebalancing.
In addition, U.S. refineries along the Gulf Coast have been reporting a much better recovery than expected after being shut due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which battered the region over the past three weeks.
U.S. energy firms cut seven oil rigs in the week to Sept. 15, bringing the total to 749, the fewest since June, energy services company Baker Hughes said on Friday.
Oil traders now looked ahead to a meeting Friday between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers regarding a possible extension of production caps.

201,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2017 02:05AM ET</span>",Hurricane Maria seen strengthening into major hurricane in next two days,"By Frank McGurty and Jessica Resnick-Ault
(Reuters) - A second powerful storm in as many weeks was bearing down on a string of battered Caribbean islands, with forecasters saying Maria would strengthen rapidly into a major hurricane as it ripped into the Leeward Islands on Monday night.
Maria's strength was building as it approached the Lesser Antilles, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, estimating its winds near 90 miles per hour (145 kph).
""Maria is expected to become a major hurricane as it moves through the Leeward Islands,"" the forecaster said, marked by ""rapid strengthening"" during the next 48 hours.
Maria is approaching the eastern Caribbean less than two weeks after Irma hammered the region before overrunning Florida.
That storm, one of the most powerful ever recorded in the Atlantic with winds up to 185 miles per hour (298 kph), killed at least 84 people, more than half of them in the Caribbean.
As of 2 a.m. (0600 GMT Monday), the center of the storm was about 90 miles (145 km) north-northeast of Barbados and about 170 miles (270 km) east-southeast of the Leeward island of Dominica, moving to the west-northwest at about 13 mph (20 kph).
Hurricane conditions were expected for Guadalupe, Dominica, Martinique and St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat, and the hurricane center warned Puerto Rico to monitor the storm.
The British Virgin Islands and St. Martin, which was devastated by Hurricane Irma, were under a hurricane watch, as were the U.S. Virgin Islands and Anguilla.
More than 1,700 residents of Barbuda, where Irma damaged nearly every building, braced for Maria on neighboring Antigua, now under a tropical storm watch, said Ronald Sanders, the country's ambassador to the United States.
Puerto Rico has already begun preparations for Maria, which by Tuesday was expected to unleash powerful winds on the U.S. territory, already dealing with a weakened economy and fragile power grid.
Damage to Puerto Rico could also disrupt the disaster relief supply chain to other islands that were hit by Irma. 
""Puerto Rico is our lifeline,"" said Judson Burdon, a permanent resident of Anguilla who has helped coordinate supply shipments to the island. ""We had two volunteer flights cancel because of the weather that is coming."" 
The planned deliveries consisted of plywood, power tools and screws to close up windows and doors that remain open on the island, where 90 percent of structures were damaged.
The hurricane center also issued a tropical storm watch for portions of the U.S. mid-Atlantic and New England coast by Tuesday as a second hurricane, Jose, moved slowly north from its position in the Atlantic Ocean about 315 miles (510 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.
The eye of Jose, with top sustained winds of 90 miles per hour (145 kph), should remain off the U.S. East Coast, the NHS said.
Even so, by Tuesday it could bring tropical storm conditions from Fenwick Island, Delaware, to Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and from East Rockaway Inlet on New York's Long Island to the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. 

Up to five inches (13 cm) of rain could fall over parts of the area, and the storm could bring dangerous surf and rip currents as well.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery was flat at $50.44 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent rose 0.20% to $55.73 a barrel.
Last week, oil prices settled higher racking up their biggest weekly gain since July on Friday amid rising expectations that higher oil demand will reduce excess crude supplies to Opec’s five-year average target.
Opec said production in August fell by 79,000 barrels a day (bpd) to 32.76 million as falling production from Venezuela, Iraq, the UAE and Saudi Arabia offset rising output from Nigeria.
“It is clear the rebalancing process is under way,” Opec’s secretary-general Mohammad Barkindo said, expressing optimism that growing demand in the second of the half of year would continue to dent excess supplies.
That was followed by the International Energy Agency report forecasting a surge in demand growth in 2017 by 100,000 barrels a day (bpd) to 1.6m bpd, or 1.7%. The bullish outlook on oil demand, lifted expectations that the demand and the supply imbalance in oil markets would continue to narrow in the coming months.
The duo of reports overshadowed data showing U.S. crude inventories rose more than expected last week, as the fallout from Hurricane Harvey, which tore through the U.S. oil heartland of Texas in August, forcing refineries to shutdown weighed on crude demand.
The post-Harvey refinery recovery is underway, however, as data earlier in the week from IHS Markit indicated that 13 of 20 affected U.S. refineries were restarting operations.
Crude output is expected to remain subdued as U.S. oil rigs continued to decline, pointing to a slowdown in production which could bolster crude prices.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the United States declined by 7 to 749.The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
“On the U.S. side, steadily declining rig counts of late have raised the possibility of stalled U.S. production gains, with current output still holding below pre-Harvey levels,” said Robbie Fraser, commodity analyst at Schneider Electric (PA:PA:SCHN), in a note.

The long-delayed disbursement of a next tranche of IMF loans also depends on pension reform and the creation of an independent judicial body to tackle endemic graft.
""We believe that the gas price should be determined in accordance with the gas market and in accordance with a formula. The most important thing is for this formula to be fair,"" news agency Interfax Ukraine quoted Groysman as saying at the annual Yalta European Strategy conference.
""At the moment our technical division is working on verifying the formula that determines the gas price,"" he said.
The International Monetary Fund wants gas prices to be set by external market dynamics through an automatic formula to stop tariffs being set unsustainably low as a populist measure.
Ukraine has so far received $8.4 billion from the IMF, helping it recover from a two-year recession following the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 and the outbreak of a Russian-backed insurgency in its industrial east.
On Friday, the IMF's first deputy managing director, David Lipton, said Ukraine risked undoing progress made under the program and urged the authorities to push ahead with reforms needed for the next loan tranche.
Earlier on Saturday Groysman said Ukraine needed to set up an independent anti-graft judicial body quickly - adding that it did not matter if it was a separate court, as envisaged by the IMF, or a chamber to existing courts.
""We need to quickly establish an instrument that would allow 'corruptioneers' to face justice and whether it's called an anti-corruption chamber or court doesn't matter,"" he told the conference.

On Friday President Petro Poroshenko said an anti-graft chamber within the existing court system would be more feasible in the short-term - a proposal that reform activists have said would limit the independence of the body.

205,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2017 09:20PM ET</span>",Old people power: Japan's rural elderly reverse gas station closures,"By Osamu Tsukimori
TOKYO (Reuters) - In Shimukappu, a village on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido and home to a popular skiing resort, residents are to reopen the sole gas station in the area, which closed four years ago as sales declined.
It's a similar story elsewhere in Japan, where oil demand has dropped by nearly a third since 2000 as the country's population dwindles and new car sales are also down by around a third since 1990.
With that waning demand, the number of gas stations, which also supply winter heating fuels, has roughly halved from a 1995 peak to 31,000 nationwide.
That has left many mainly elderly people in remote areas a long way from the nearest pump station to fill up.
About 15 percent of villages, towns and cities in the world's third-largest economy have three or fewer gas stands, and the trade ministry has urged local governments to do more to keep these essential lifelines open.
While most shuttered gas stations are abandoned and chained, some have had a make-over and are now shops, cafes, and launderettes.
Amid a national trend of a declining population, which is accelerating in remoter parts of Japan, local governments have increasingly taken an active role in buying closed facilities and offering subsidies to keep them operational.
But in some rural villages, elderly people power is leading the rescue effort as younger generations move to the cities in search of work.
""The nearest gasoline stands in the next town are around 30 km (19 miles) away,"" said Mitsuhiko Hirakawa, head of Shimukappu city office's Tomamu area that hosts the ski resort. ""The lack of gas stands is very inconvenient.""
A local survey showed residents ranked the lack of a filling station as their second-biggest source of dissatisfaction, prompting the local government to step in and buy the shuttered stand, which is due to reopen next month, Hirakawa said.
The industry ministry says local communities in at least a dozen other villages have taken over abandoned fuel stations, closed due to falling sales, a lack of people to run them, and the cost of replacing ageing underground fuel tanks.
The issue is becoming so acute that the central government is budgeting several tens of millions of dollars a year to support the refurbishment of rural gasoline stands.
Even in the more rural western districts of the capital Tokyo - the world's most populous metropolitan area - some residents have to drive more than 15 km to fill up.
And a shift towards electric cars (EVs) isn't yet helping as vehicles still have a limited mileage per charge, says Yoshikazu Goto, another Shimukappu village official. Japan has just 7,000 quick EV-charging stations, according to the industry ministry.
The head of Japan's oil refiners' association, Yasushi Kimura, said one solution is to combine fuelling services with stores selling other household goods.
""A decline in the number of gas stands is to a certain extent inevitable as long as demand for oil including gasoline continues to decline,"" Kimura said. ""We would need to think about how to make the gas stands survive in the community by making them part of the goods store, for example.""
In Shimanto City, with a population of around 35,000 in the west of the country, local residents chipped in to help buy the area's only gas stand, which now operates as part of a store also offering home-delivery for goods, said Takehiko Okamura, a store clerk.
""This area's elderly people ratio exceeds 50 percent, and the population has decreased by 70 since the store began in 2006,"" he said. ""So the business is getting tougher every year.""
And in Kawakami village, also in western Japan, the aging owner of the last pump stand handed the business for free to the village, and a public cooperative reopened it in April, offering various services for the elderly, including a mobile supermarket.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2017 01:00PM ET</span>",Venezuela publishes oil prices in Chinese currency for first time,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela on Friday published the price of its oil and fuel in Chinese currency for the first time, following President Nicolas Maduro's announcement that the government would ease off the U.S. dollar in response to sanctions by the United States. 
Maduro last week said his government would shun the dollar after Washington blocked Americans from certain financial dealings with Venezuela on charges it is undermining democracy.
""As of the current week, the average price for Venezuelan (oil and fuel) will be listed in Chinese yuan,"" said a footnote to the table of prices published each Friday by the Oil Ministry.
The global oil industry overwhelmingly uses the dollar for pricing of products. 
Venezuela's yuan-based prices appear to be the result of multiplying dollar prices by the dollar/yuan exchange rate.
The price for the week ending Friday was 306.26 yuan, equivalent to $46.76 based on the exchange rate listed in a footnote. That is up from the previous week's price of 300.91 yuan, or $46.15 based on the corresponding exchange rate.
The ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking additional details.
Venezuela's Dicom currency system on Wednesday temporarily suspended the sale of dollars in order to incorporate other currencies.
Late socialist leader Hugo Chavez during his 14-year rule repeatedly vowed to back away from the dollar, which he said was being printed indiscriminately and was destined to lose its place as the world's dominant currency. 
But Venezuela remains dependent on the greenback given that it conducts ample commercial trade with the United States both through exports of oil and imports of U.S. food and consumer products.

Sanctions by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump blocked U.S. citizens from buying new debt from Venezuela or its state oil company, but did not directly interrupt import and export operations.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican negotiators are working on a response to informal U.S. proposals to include protections for fresh produce in the re-negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), two people briefed on the proposals said. 
U.S., Canadian and Mexican delegations finished a second round of talks last week to renegotiate the 23-year-old treaty, which U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to abandon if he could not get a better deal for U.S. workers.
One suggestion U.S. negotiators raised prior to the first round of talks in Washington last month was to protect certain products by making it easier for U.S. seasonal produce growers to launch anti-dumping cases against Mexico, the people said, citing a presentation made by Mexican officials after the Washington talks.
Mexico is looking at creating its own list, that might include pork, in case Washington formally proposes to give seasonal fruit and vegetable farmers added protection, the people briefed on the matter said.
Mexican negotiators are studying the inclusion of pork legs in its counterproposal, including possible limits on the volume of U.S. exports to its southern neighbor, the people said.
The legs account for the bulk of Mexico's pork imports from the United States and are used to make some of the country's most popular dishes, like tacos al pastor and carnitas. 
Some Mexican agricultural leaders have said that dairy and chicken could also be deemed sensitive, though those products were not mentioned by the sources briefed on the proposal.
In its NAFTA negotiating objectives published in July, the Trump administration said it would seek a ""domestic industry provision for perishable and seasonal products"" in trade cases. Since then the issue has not come up in official statements and it was unclear whether the idea was brought up again in the latest round of talks.
However, the possibility of a tit-for-tat response by Mexico to a potential U.S. proposal to limit fresh produce trade highlights the risks of granting exceptions to selected interests. Several U.S. retail, restaurant and agriculture groups flagged such risks last week in letters sent to Trump administration officials.
NAFTA gradually eliminated nearly all tariffs for goods from the three countries. But disputes over certain sectors, such as sugar, have led to negotiated agreements establishing regulated trade in the form of minimum prices and export limits. 
Mexican officials have repeatedly said NAFTA's aim should be to increase, not limit market access. New seasonal produce protections that could more easily curb Mexican fruit and vegetable exports but also invite retaliation, went ""against the interest of free trade,"" said Raul Urteaga, head of international trade for Mexico's agriculture ministry.
Urteaga told Reuters there have been no proposals ""so far"" from Canadian or U.S. negotiators to designate certain sensitive products.
Bosco de la Vega, president of Mexico's National Agricultural Council, an influential private sector chamber representing farmers interests to the government in NAFTA talks, told Reuters that existing Chapter 19 dispute resolution mechanism was sufficient to resolve allegations of illegal dumping or health safety concerns.
U.S. companies with production on both sides of the border said granting special protection to produce growers in the United States' southeast over the rest of the industry would limit U.S. consumers' access to affordable produce.
""The proposal to put temporary tariff barriers to protect one sector will lower vegetable consumption,"" said Carlos Visconti, CEO of Red Sun Farms which has greenhouses in Mexico and the United States, during the NAFTA round in Mexico.
In Mexico, pork farmers have similar grievances to U.S. growers of tomatoes, complaining their U.S. rivals dump into Mexico cheap cuts, such as pig legs, that are less in demand in the United States. 
Apples and potatoes, which are major U.S. exports to Mexico, are also caught up in battles between the two countries, with Mexico using health concerns to slow imports. 
Total U.S. exports of pork legs to Mexico reached some 690,000 tonnes last year, or nearly 80 percent of total U.S. pork shipments to its southern neighbor, according to data from Mexican pork association OPORPA. 
Overall, Mexico relies on imports for about 44 percent of domestic pork consumption, which last year reached about 2.5 million tonnes. Before NAFTA, Mexico produced about 90 percent of the pork it consumed.

""I think if you start negotiating at the edges, or designing at the edges, product by product, some things are protected or carved out as special, then it's not a free trade agreement,"" David MacLennan, chief executive of global commodities trader Cargill, told Reuters.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude October contract was at $49.84 a barrel by 06:30 a.m. ET (10:30 GMT), not far from Thursday's four-month peak of $50.49.
 Elsewhere, Brent oil for November delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London was at $55.48 a barrel, just off the previous sessions's five-month high of $55.98.
Prices were supported as the clean-up after two major hurricanes in the U.S. gathered pace, boosting the outlook for demand.
The commodity was also boosted after the International Energy Agency on Wednesday said global oil supplies fell for the first time in four months in August, while also revising its 2017 oil demand estimate up to 1.6 million barrels a day from its July estimate of 1.5 million.
The data came a day after the latest OPEC report showed that oil production from the cartel fell last month for the first time since March.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said Tuesday that output declined by 79,000 barrels a day to 32.76 million in August, driven mainly by a drop in Libya, Gabon, Venezuela and Iraq.

Demand for safe-haven assets strengthened following news North Korea fired a missile over Japan into the Pacific Ocean late Thursday. It was the peninsula's second missile launch over Japanese territory in just over two weeks.
Japan reacted by saying that Pyongyang has “no bright future” and called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. security council.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called for the international community to take “new measures” against North Korea, singling out Russia and China as the countries best placed to apply pressure on the regime.
Gold prices had briefly weakened on Thursday after the U.S. Commerce Department reported that consumer price inflation rose more than expected in August.
The strong inflation data added was seen as increasing the chances of an additional rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year.
A separate report showed that initial jobless claims unexpectedly declined to 284,000 last week.
Investors were eyeing reports on U.S. retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment, due later Friday for further indications on the strength of the economy.

Gold prices halted a three-day losing streak as the dollar eased despite inflation and jobs data topping expectations pointing to an improving U.S. economy which could influence the Federal Reserve to stick to its plan to hike rates at least once more this year.
The Labor Department said on Thursday its Consumer Price index rose 0.4% last month after edging up 0.1% in July. The uptick in consumer prices in August was the largest monthly gain in seven months and lifted the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 1.9% from 1.7% in July.
In a separate report the U.S. Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims decreased by 14,000 to 284,000 in the week ended Sept. 10, confounding forecasts of a 2,000 increase.

215,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2017 06:54PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Venezuela state oil firm's credit woes spread to U.S. unit Citgo,"By Marianna Parraga and Catherine Ngai
HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Washington's recent sanctions against Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA have started to ensnare its U.S. unit, Citgo Petroleum, making it harder for the refiner to obtain the credit it needs to purchase crude, according to six traders and banking sources. 
Fewer oil providers are willing to sell cargoes to Citgo on open credit, instead requiring prepayment or bank letters of credit to supply its 749,000-barrel-per-day refining network, the sources said. 
Two sources at Canadian suppliers said their companies are no longer allowed to trade with Citgo directly, and have begun selling cargoes through third parties to avoid the credit risk. 
Citgo's three U.S. refineries in Illinois, Texas and Louisiana account for about 4 percent of domestic fuel capacity, and are major suppliers of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. If financial troubles raise the cost of obtaining crude, its profits would be squeezed, making the company less competitive. 
Citgo had remained immune from its parent's straits until this year. But U.S. sanctions levied in recent months against Venezuelan officials, PDVSA executives and the country's debt issuance have deterred banks and suppliers from extending even routine credit, the sources said.
Citgo's main crude supplier is Venezuela, but the company also buys U.S. and foreign oil. It has told some providers they can charge more to reflect the added credit risk.
""We are now more conservative when dealing with PDVSA or any of its units,"" said an executive from a trading firm with a long term business relationship with PDVSA.
""Banks that have refused to provide credit have a very rational thinking, they don't want to be exposed to sanctions. It does not take too much to have banks nervous,"" he added.
The U.S. government did not intend sanctions to affect existing private credit agreements at Citgo or PDVSA. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in August said ""short-term financing for most commercial trade"" between the United States and Venezuela, including the petroleum flow, was exempted.
Citgo declined to comment.
Venezuela's Economy Vice President Ramon Lobo on Thursday said the government is facing ""a series of difficulties"" as result of sanctions, which he considered an attempt to push the country to insolvency with a ""financial blockade.""
RENEGOTIATING SUPPLY DEALS
While Citgo was not directly sanctioned in August, it was barred by name from transferring dividends or distributing profits to PDVSA or the Venezuelan government. Citgo has provided nearly $2.5 billion in dividends to its parent company since 2015, according to Fitch Ratings.
That restriction raised alarms among its longterm banking and trading partners in the United States.
As a result, Citgo is ""trying to renegotiate its supply terms,"" said a trader from a firm that is requiring Citgo to prepay for purchases. The company is worried about a higher debt default risk as well as the sanctions. 
Citgo also has other problems. Its Gulf Coast refineries are being forced to buy more crude on the open market to offset a declining flow of oil from PDVSA.
From June through August, PDVSA supplied only half the volume of Venezuelan crude it was to send Citgo under a 220,000-bpd supply contract, according to Reuters trade flows data. At the same time, Venezuela increased oil deliveries to Russia's Rosneft (MM:ROSN) to pay for loans.
Even Citgo's 167,000-bpd Lemont refinery in Illinois, which largely processes Canadian oil, is having trouble retaining credit arrangements with its traditional providers, according to three traders from crude suppliers that are no longer allowed to sell directly to Citgo. 
In August, Citgo executives traveled to Canada, as they typically do once a year, but this time sought to assure marketers in Calgary that the firm was financially stable. ""I don't think anyone was very convinced,"" a source involved in the talks said.
SAVED BY THE SWISS
Citgo has a long standing agreement to buy oil on preferential terms from Switzerland-based trader Mercuria Energy, without obtaining letters of credit, according to four of the traders. 
But when Mercuria is unable to provide crude to Citgo, the refiner goes to the spot market, where many of its providers demand prepayment or letters of credit to secure payment within 30 days of every cargo discharge.
The sources said traders, refiners and oil firms have been rebuffed in recent weeks after seeking letters of credit from a list of banks suggested by PDVSA and Citgo, which includes Citibank (N:C), JP Morgan (N:JPM),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), ABN Amro (AS:ABNd), and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
""This is not a credit issue, nobody thinks Citgo is unwilling to pay. But banks have to protect themselves from fines, so they typically go beyond what the sanctions require,"" said a banker who has been dealing with Venezuela for years.
The banks declined to comment on specific clients.
Citgo's attempt to address the credit problems has been to suggest suppliers mark up their prices, three traders said. But that ""only transfers the credit risk from the bank to the oil provider,"" one of them said.
A similar tack was used by PDVSA last year before intermediaries began requiring prepayment. In most cases, cargoes that arrive in Venezuelan ports now wait for weeks before a bank transfer is received.
Minister Lobo and traders said PDVSA has started talks to change its preferred currency to euros from dollars for some business relationships, an idea that has failed in previous years. President Nicolas Maduro last week said the OPEC-member could also use China's yuan, India's rupees, Russia's ruble and Japan's yen.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery eased 0.16% to $49.22 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent dipped 0.24% to $55.03 a barrel.
China released fixed asset investment for August that came in up 7.8%, below the 8.2% gain expected on year, industrial production rose 6.0%, compared with a 6.6% increase seen on year, and retail sales increased 10.1%, compared with a 10.5% rise seen on year.
Chinese refineries processed 6.5% more crude oil in August than a year earlier at 47.12 million metric tons as domestic crude oil output fell 3.1% to 15.96 million metric tons, highlighting the role of imported crude oil.
Overnight, oil prices settled higher on Wednesday, as bearish data showing U.S. supplies of crude oil rose more than expected was overshadowed by a report from the International Energy Agency estimating global oil demand this year will climb by the most since 2015.
A report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showing crude stockpiles rose more than expected last week threatened to derail earlier gains, following a bullish report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) on oil demand growth.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by roughly 5.9m barrels in the week ended Sept. 8, confounding expectations of a rise of about only 3.2m barrels. It was the second weekly build in crude stockpiles.
Gasoline inventories, one of the products that crude is refined into, fell by roughly 8.4m barrels, beating expectations of a draw of 2m barrels while distillate stockpiles fell by 3.2m barrels, topping expectations of a decline of 1.5m barrels.
The bigger-than-expected draw in gasoline stockpiles comes after heavy flooding due to storm Harvey knocked out nearly quarter of the U.S. refining capacity in August.
Crude prices recorded their largest one-day gain of the week, following data from the Opec and IEA on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, pointing to an uptick in global oil demand.
The IEA revised upwards its estimate for demand growth in 2017 by 100,000 barrels a day (bpd) to 1.6m bpd, or 1.7%. The bullish outlook for oil demand, lifted expectations that the demand and the supply imbalance in oil markets would continue to narrow in the coming months.
“Demand growth continues to be stronger than expected, particularly in Europe and the U.S.,” the Paris-based agency said in its monthly report.

U.S. crude oil was up 39 cents or 0.89% at $48.63 a barrel at 10.35 ET from around $48.75 ahead of the report.
Global benchmark Brent futures were at $54.38 a barrel, up 11 cents or 0.2% from $54.59 earlier.
Crude oil inventories rose by 5.88 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
That was compared to forecasts for a stockpile build of 3.2 million barrels after a build of 4.58 million barrels in the previous week.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories fell by 8.42 million barrels, compared to expectations for a decline of 2.05 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles dropped by 3.21 million barrels, compared to forecasts for a decrease of 1.53 million.
The report came after industry group the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories increased by 6.2 million barrels last week.
It was the second straight build after Hurricane Harvey shut production in some Gulf of Mexico fields and refineries in Texas as some domestic producers also trimmed output to avoid a larger glut at storage.
Oil prices had been higher earlier after the latest OPEC report that showed oil production from the cartel fell last month for the first time since March.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said Tuesday that output declined by 79,000 barrels a day to 32.76 million in August, driven mainly by a drop in Libya, Gabon, Venezuela and Iraq.
OPEC also slightly raised its outlook for global oil demand in 2017 and 2018. The cartel now believes the world will consume 96.77 million barrels a day this year and 98.12 million barrels a day next year.

229,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 13, 2017 09:06AM ET</span>",U.S. Natural Gas Futures Extend Rally to Hit 2-Week Highs,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures extended this week's rally into a third day on Wednesday, hitting their strongest level in around two weeks as investors looked ahead to weekly data from the U.S. on supplies in storage to weigh what the impact of recent storm activity was on supply and demand.
U.S. natural gas for October delivery was at $3.056 per million British thermal units by 9:05AM ET (1305GMT), up 5.5 cents, or around 1.9%, after hitting its best level since Sept. 1 at $3.064 earlier.
Futures climbed 5.1 cents, or 1.7%, on Tuesday as concerns over the impact of Hurricane Irma faded away.
Natural gas prices have gained around 6% so far this week after Hurricane Irma struck the U.S. southeast with less force than once feared, easing worries over a hit to energy demand.
Despite recent gains, prices look set to remain on the back foot in the weeks ahead as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 72 and 83 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 8.
That compares with a gain of 65 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 62 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 63 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.220 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 6.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago and mostly in line with the five-year average for this time of year.

Comex gold futures was up $4.82 or about 0.36% at $1,337.41 a troy ounce by 08:35 a.m. ET (12:35 GMT).
Market sentiment was mildly supported as Hurricane Irma appeared to have caused less damage than feared and in the absence of any new provocations from North Korea.
Irma, which had hammered the Caribbean late last week andwas one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes, weakened to a tropical depression, easing concerns over the severity of its financial impact.
Market participants seemed to shrug off North Korea’s rejection of sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council.
The Security Council voted unanimously on Monday to step up sanctions on the peninsula, in response to its sixth nuclear test.
However, U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the U.N. sanctions were a ""very small step"" and ""nothing compared to ultimately what will have to happen"" to combat the regime's nuclear program.
The precious metal also benefitted from a weaker U.S. dollar on Wednesday after data showed that U.S. producer price inflation and its core reading increased less than expected in August.

War-torn Syria had sought 1 million tonnes of wheat from trader Zernomir to feed government-held territories and prevent bread shortages.
Wheat exporter Russia supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country's six-year-old war and has helped the government with wheat aid.
But there was scepticism about the ability of Zernomir to deliver on the deal from the start. 
""The deal was canceled due to difficulties in banking operations and execution,"" the government source said. 
A Russian agriculture ministry official had told Reuters the main problem was that the supplier lacked experience and had set the price too low. 
State grain buyer the General Authority for Cereal Processing and Trade (Hoboob) instead signed contracts in February with local traders for around 1.2 million tonnes of Russian wheat. 
""We now have within our hands a lot of the quantities from those contracts and we will also evaluate the situation and see whether we need to go back to the market through tenders,"" the source said. 
Flat bread is a subsidized staple in Syria, where war is estimated to have killed several hundred thousand people and forced millions to flee their homes.
Hoboob has not named the Syrian firms that are helping it buy Russian wheat. 
Russian customs data shows Russia supplied 125,200 tonnes of wheat to Syria in 2016/17, up from 47,000 tonnes in 2015/16.

Syria's strategic wheat reserves stand at six months' worth versus just 17 days of reserves last year, Internal Trade and Consumer Protection Minister Abdullah al-Gharb said last month.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report at 10:30AM ET (1430GMT). Analysts expect crude oil inventories rose by around 3.2 million barrels at the end of last week. If confirmed, it would mark the second weekly gain in a row.
Meanwhile, gasoline supplies are seen decreasing by about 2.0 million barrels and distillates are forecast to fall 1.5 million barrels.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories increased by roughly 6.2 million barrels in the week ended September 8.
It was the second straight build after Hurricane Harvey shut production in some Gulf of Mexico fields and refineries in Texas as some domestic producers also trimmed output to avoid a larger glut at storage.
However, the API report also showed a drop of 7.9 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks fell by 1.8 million barrels, as key refineries in Houston and Corpus Christi were offline.

OPEC and other producers, including Russia, have agreed to reduce output by about 1.8 million barrels per day until next March in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices.

Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

239,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2017 04:50PM ET</span>",EPA chief denies Icahn influence in biofuel regulation,"By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Investor Carl Icahn never wielded excessive influence on U.S. biofuels policy while acting as President Donald Trump's adviser on regulation, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency said in a letter to a Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse.
The letter, dated September 11, was a response to repeated requests by Whitehouse and other Democratic lawmakers for information on Icahn's dual role as an adviser on biofuels regulation and a majority stakeholder in a refining company, CVR Energy, directly affected by those rules.
Icahn ended his adviser role in August after facing criticism his guidance to Trump represented a conflict of interests as it may have benefited CVR. Icahn has denied the allegations. 
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in the letter to Whitehouse, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, that Icahn was ""one of many"" of Trump's advisers that he met during his confirmation process, and he ""made no assurances with regard to the point of obligation or any other substantive issue.""
The ""point of obligation"" refers to a requirement under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard that refiners blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into their gasoline every year. Icahn, his company CVR, and a handful of other refiners wanted to shift that responsibility off refiners in a way that would have saved them hundreds of millions of dollars.
Icahn proposed the reform to the administration in February. The Trump administration has not made a decision on the request, but environmental regulators are preparing to formally reject it, sources have told Reuters.
Icahn, who has an 82 percent stake in CVR, has said his proposal did not constitute self-dealing because it would have benefited some of his competitors too.
Pruitt added in the letter that the EPA's Office of Environmental Information searched the EPA emails of 39 senior leadership employees, and found ""no emails to or from any of those employees and Mr. Icahn or CVR on any subject"" between Feb. 17 and Aug. 18. 
A spokesman for Whitehouse said the senator was reviewing Pruitt's response ""for accuracy and to determine whether additional steps are warranted.""
Icahn's proposal to shift the point of obligation would have lowered prices for renewable fuels credits known as RINs. A Reuters review of CVR filings showed the company was building up a large bet on a decline in RIN prices months before Icahn made his reform proposal.

Investors, meanwhile, have built up a large short position in CVR in the past three months, according to Reuters data.

The relief rally continued for a second straight day, lowering demand for safe-haven gold as investors shrugged off fresh threats from North Korea after the United Nations imposed a fresh round of sanctions, restricting the country’s access to oil imports while limiting textile exports.
North Korea's ambassador to the UN, Han Tae Song, told a conference in Geneva: ""The forthcoming measures by DPRK [the Democratic Republic of Korea] will make the US suffer the greatest pain it has ever experienced in its history.""
Also weighing on gold prices was a sharp rise in U.S. treasury yields ahead of inflation data due Wednesday, which could influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision slated for September 20.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Analysts, however, have been quick to downplay gold’s poor start to the week as data pointing to a surge in buying activity suggests that demand for the yellow metal remains supported.
Net bullish bets on gold rose to 245,300, the highest in nearly twelve-months, according to a report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday.
“Although the appetite for equities may further affect gold prices, investors are likely to remain cautious and hedge against many unknowns,” said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. “That’s why we didn’t see any significant outflows from gold-backed exchange-traded funds.”

Despite gains, prices look set to remain on the back foot in the weeks ahead as traders react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.220 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 6.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago and mostly in line with the five-year average for this time of year.
Early market expectations for this week's storage data due on Thursday is for a build in a range between 72 and 83 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 8.
That compares with a gain of 65 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 62 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 63 billion cubic feet.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices softened on Tuesday as Hurricane Irma's dampening effect on demand offset refinery restarts in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.
International benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) fell by 35 cents to $53.49 per barrel by 0847 GMT from the previous close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) was down 30 cents at $47.77 a barrel. 
While the largest U.S. refinery, Motiva Port Arthur [MOTIV.UL], and a number of others were restarting more than two weeks after Hurricane Harvey ripped through the U.S. Gulf coast, the impact from Irma was less supportive of oil prices.
Irma slammed into Florida on Sunday, leaving more than 7.4 million homes and businesses without power, but has since been downgraded to a tropical storm.
""If the Harvey impact was potentially and possibly short-term bullish for oil prices the same cannot be said about Irma,"" PVM analyst Tamas Varga said in a note. ""There is no refinery capacity in the region therefore the main concern lies in the hit of oil demand.""
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) warned that demand could fall by 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September and 300,000 bpd in October due to the hurricanes. 
Investors were also watching closely for the storms' impact on inventories. Data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) was due later on Tuesday while the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release its figures on Wednesday. 
A poll of six analysts taken ahead of inventory reports forecast that crude stocks likely rose by 2.3 million barrels in the week ended Sept. 8. The poll also forecast that refined product stockpiles probably declined.
Amid persistent glut concerns, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih had talks with his Venezuelan and Kazakh counterparts about the possibility of extending supply cuts beyond March 2018.

Hurricane Irma knocked out power to nearly 5.8 million Florida homes and businesses on Sunday after millions were told to evacuate ahead of the storm. 
Irma hit Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 hurricane. It gradually lost strength and weakened to a tropical storm by Monday morning as it headed towards Georgia.
Harvey struck the U.S. oil hub of Texas two weeks ago, knocking out a quarter of the nation's refineries. 
Now many refineries are restarting, including the largest U.S. refinery. On Monday, Motiva Enterprises restored the 325,000 barrel per day (bpd) VPS-5 crude distillation unit at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery to minimum production levels sources said.

Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] restored the 325,000 barrel per day (bpd) VPS-5 crude distillation unit at its 603,000 bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery to minimum production levels early in the day, the sources said.
After bringing the VPS-5 online, Motiva began restarting the 105,000-bpd Hydrocracking Unit 2, the sources said. The HCU-2 is a lucrative source of motor fuel exports for Motiva. 
Motiva did not immediately reply to requests for comment about operations at the refinery, which has been shut since Aug. 30 due to flooding from Harvey.
Last Thursday, the VPS-5, HCU-2 and the 110,000 bpd coking unit were ready to resume production after being placed on circulation in which the units were at operating temperatures and circulating feedstock, the sources said.
However, Motiva had been waiting for adequate crude supply to be restored to the VPS-5 before restarting production, according to the sources.
Motiva said last week the Port Arthur refinery would resume production at 40 percent capacity by Monday. Motiva did not give a timeline for fully restoring output. 
Sources have said it will take four to eight weeks to return the full refinery's production. 
CDUs do the initial refining of crude oil and provide feedstock for all other units.
Hydrocrackers use hydrogen to produce motor fuels, especially diesel, from gas oil. Cokers produce motor fuel feedstocks and convert residual crude to petroleum coke, a coal substitute.

Irma hit Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, but by afternoon as it barreled up the west coast, it weakened to a Category 2 with maximum sustained winds of 110 miles per hour (177 kph).
It is forecast to weaken to a tropical storm over northern Florida or southern Georgia later Monday.
U.S. natural gas for October delivery was at $2.926 per million British thermal units by 8:45AM ET (1245GMT), up 3.5 cents, or around 1.2%.
It saw a weekly loss of nearly 6% last week as traders began to react to the reality that higher summer demand for the commodity is coming to an end.
Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.220 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 6.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago and mostly in line with the five-year average for this time of year.
Early market expectations for this week's storage data due on Thursday is for a build in a range between 72 and 83 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 8.
That compares with a gain of 65 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 62 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 63 billion cubic feet.

MELBOURNE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has won a price cut on a 20-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) deal with global giant ExxonMobil Corp (N:XOM) in a rare contract renegotiation, a bad sign for producers in a heavily oversupplied global market.
In a trade-off for ExxonMobil, India's  Petronet LNG  (NS:PLNG) will increase its volumes from the Gorgon LNG project in Australia by an extra 1 million tonnes a year to about 2.5 million tonnes a year, but at cheaper rates than initially agreed in 2009.
Long-term contracts are rarely revised in the LNG market, and for a big producer to cave in shows how supply from new plants in Australia and the United States over the past two years has transformed the market, analysts said.
""This trend is overall a negative for sellers, as they are forced to provide more flexibility to buyers' needs to maintain their markets,"" said Saul Kavonic, an analyst with energy consultants Wood Mackenzie.
India has been aggressive in seeking cheaper deals, also renegotiating a contract with Qatar in 2015, but the real pain for producers would come if major Asian buyers in Japan, Korea and China followed suit.
""Happy to share good news that India has, yet again been able to address the long term price issue of LNG from Gorgon to suit Indian market,"" India's oil minister, Dharmendra Pradhan, said on Saturday on social media.
Indian consumers would soon receive LNG at an ""amicable price"", Pradhan said. India started receiving Gorgon supplies from January this year.
Petronet said in a stock exchange announcement on Monday it had reached a ""broad understanding of terms"" with ExxonMobil, without giving further details.
Citing market sources, RBC analyst Ben Wilson estimated ExxonMobil would receive 15 percent less revenue per unit on its sales to Petronet under the new deal.
If ExxonMobil had not agreed to renegotiate, Petronet might have scrapped the agreement, leaving the major to pursue damages and resell the volumes on a weak spot market.
""They've probably taken the lesser of two evils,"" said Wilson, adding that it did not bode well for other LNG producers such as Australia's Woodside Petroleum (AX:WPL) which has targeted India to diversify its heavy exposure to Japan and South Korea.
In a major shift from previous contractual terms, Exxon has agreed to absorb shipping charges, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The original LNG supplies would be priced at less than 14 percent of the Brent oil price, down from about 14.5 percent earlier, while the additional supplies would be priced about 12.5 percent of Brent, the sources said.
ExxonMobil, which controls about a quarter of the 15.6 million tonnes a year Gorgon project, had no immediate comment.
Analysts said the fact India had managed to force ExxonMobil to renegotiate was the latest proof that buyers have the upper hand in a market where LNG spot prices are well below oil-linked contract prices that were signed during the oil boom.
""The risk of price renegotiations will become more acute over the next couple years as spot LNG prices remain depressed, even if oil linked prices rise,"" Wood Mackenzie's Kavonic said.

""The elephant in the room will be how negotiations play out with traditional markets in Japan and Korea, and especially the Chinese national oil companies.""

(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma knocked out power to nearly 4 million homes and businesses in Florida on Sunday, threatening millions more as it crept up the state's west coast, and full restoration of service could take weeks, local electric utilities said.
Irma hit Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, but by afternoon as it barreled up the west coast, it weakened to a Category 2 with maximum sustained winds of 110 miles per hour (177 kph).
So far, the brunt of the storm has affected Florida Power & Light's customers in the states' southern and eastern sections, and its own operations were not immune, either.
""We are not subject to any special treatment from Hurricane Irma. We just experienced a power outage at our command center. We do have backup generation,"" FPL spokesman Rob Gould said on Sunday.
FPL, the biggest power company in Florida, said more than 3.2 million of its customers were without power by 10 p.m. (0200 GMT Monday), mostly in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. More than 200,000 had electricity restored, mostly by automated devices.
The company's system will need to be rebuilt, particularly in the western part of the state, Gould said. ""That restoration process will be measured in weeks, not days.""
FPL is a unit of Florida energy company  NextEra Energy Inc  (N:NEE).
Large utilities that serve other parts of the state, including units of  Duke Energy  Corp (N:DUK),  Southern Co  (N:SO) and Emera Inc (TO:EMA), were seeing their outage figures grow as the storm pushed north.
Duke's outages soared to 390,000 from 60,000 in a span of four hours on Sunday evening, and the company warned its 1.8 million customers in northern and central Florida that outages could ultimately exceed 1 million.
The company updated its website on Sunday evening with a warning to customers that outages may last a week or longer.
Emera's Tampa Electric utility said the storm could affect up to 500,000 of the 730,000 homes and businesses it serves, and over 180,000 had already lost power.
The utilities had thousands of workers, some from as far away as California, ready to help restore power once Irma's high winds pass their service areas. About 17,000 were assisting FPL, nearly 8,000 at Duke and more than 1,300 at Emera.
Tampa Electric told customers on Sunday, however, that response crews were halting work because of the high winds.
FPL said on Friday that Irma could affect about 4.1 million customers, but that was before the storm track shifted away from the eastern side of the state. Its customers are concentrated in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.
NUCLEAR PLANTS SAFE
The utility said its two nuclear plants were safe. It shut only one of the two reactors at its Turkey Point nuclear plant about 30 miles (48 km) south of Miami on Saturday, rather than both, because the storm shifted. It plans to leave both reactors in service at the St. Lucie plant about 120 miles (193 km )north of Miami because hurricane-force winds are no longer expected to hit the sites.
There is also spent nuclear fuel at Duke's Crystal River plant, about 90 miles (145 km) north of Tampa. The plant, on Irma's current forecast track, stopped operating in 2009 and was retired in 2013.
In a worst-case scenario, the spent fuel could release radiation if exposed to the air, but a federal nuclear official said that was extremely unlikely.
""That fuel is so cold, relatively speaking, it would take weeks before there would be any concern,"" said Scott Burnell of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

As the storm has come ashore, gasoline stations have struggled to keep up. In the Atlanta metro area, about 496 stations, or 12.2 percent, were out of gasoline, according to information service Gas Buddy.

Hurricane Irma knocked out power to more than 2.4 million homes and businesses in Florida on Sunday, threatening millions more as it crept up the state's west coast, and full restoration of service will take weeks, local electric utilities said.
But after Hurricane Irma hit Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, it weakened to a Category 2 with maximum sustained winds of 110 miles per hour (177 kph).
The yuan gained to its highest level since May 2016 on Monday, a boon for commodity imports priced in dolalrs that are imported into China such as crude oil.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 0.67% to $47.80 a barrel. Brent crude, the benchmark for oil prices outside the U.S. gained 0.35% to $53.97 a barrel. The global benchmark closed last week with a gain of $1.03, or around 1.9%, after rising to a more than four-month high of $54.87 on Thursday.

Last week, oil prices tumbled on Friday, hit by concern over reduced demand as U.S. refineries saw a slow recovery from flooding due to Hurricane Harvey.
Prices were further weighed as uncertainty gripped the energy market over the potential impact of Hurricane Irma as it approached the U.S.
Two weeks after storm system Harvey knocked out roughly a quarter of U.S. oil refining capacity, refineries along the Gulf coast have been slow to restart, weighing on demand for crude oil, the primary input at refineries.
The dip in demand was reflected in a report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Thursday showing crude stockpiles rose for the first time in ten weeks.
Harvey's impact was also felt in oil production. Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the U.S. declined by 3 to 756.
But the slowdown in refining and output should be temporary.

OPEC and other producers, including Russia, have agreed to reduce output by about 1.8 million barrels per day until next March in a bid to reduce global oil inventories and support oil prices. 
A further extension for at least three more months beyond March is now being discussed before OPEC meets again in November.
The deal to curb output propelled crude prices above $58 a barrel in January but they have since slipped back to a $50 to $54 range as the effort to drain global inventories has taken longer than expected.
""Both countries agreed that the option to extend the voluntary market rebalancing effort, beyond the first quarter of 2018, would be considered in due course as market fundamentals may dictate,"" the ministry said in a statement on Falih's meeting with Kazakh Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev.
Non-OPEC Kazakhstan is aiming for a stand-alone deal with OPEC on restraining its crude production due to a need to crank up output at its Kashagan field, a Kazakh official said last week.
The Central Asian nation increased oil and gas condensate output by 9.9 percent in January-July to 1.724 million bpd, exceeding its quota of 1.7 million bpd under the cut pact.
Kazakhstan has said it needs to adjust the terms of the deal as it expects to boost output later this year thanks to the giant Kashagan field.
The Saudi Energy Ministry said that Bozumbayev, who met with Falih on Sunday, said that despite the gradual ramp up of the Kashagan field this year, ""Kazakhstan was able, through reducing production in other fields in August, to achieve more than full conformity"" with its output cut target. 
""A similar production level is also anticipated for September,"" the Saudi ministry said. 
Both ministers agreed to continue, and expand, their energy cooperation, including in two major projects in Kazakhstan in petrochemicals and renewable energy, the ministry said in the statement without providing details.
Falih, who has held his meetings in Astana, also met Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino and both ministers ""agreed on the importance of leaving all options open"" including the possible extension of the oil output cuts beyond the first quarter of 2018, if needed, according to a separate statement.
Del Pino on Friday said global oil inventories remain too high and urged producers to look at exemptions granted to countries such as Libya and Nigeria and the effect of those exemptions on the market.
Both ministers discussed oil market developments and how the OPEC-led pact ""is improving market stability, contributing to the rebalancing of supply and demand, and drawing down excessive inventories,"" the Saudi ministry said. 

""They both shared an optimistic outlook on market fundamentals in 2018.""

CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The Canadian energy regulator's plan to assess indirect carbon emissions when considering TransCanada's (TO:TRP) Energy East pipeline application sets a harsh precedent for future projects, the Alberta government and supporters of the pipeline said on Friday.
TransCanada said on Thursday it may abandon the proposed 1.1 million barrel per day pipeline - from Alberta to New Brunswick - following a decision by the National Energy Board in August to look at upstream and downstream carbon emissions when deciding whether the project is in the public interest.
Supporters of Energy East said the NEB's plan to consider indirect emissions, or emissions that come from the production and refining of the crude the pipeline will carry, was unreasonable.
""We believe it would be a historic overreach and has potential to impact the future of energy development across Canada,"" Alberta Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd said in a statement. ""This is not an appropriate issue to include in the review.""
The Calgary-based pipeline company asked the regulator to pause the application for 30 days while it gauges the impact on the pipeline's cost, schedule and viability.
It is the latest blow to a project that Canada's oil industry says is needed to get oil sands crude to overseas markets and avoid deep discounts on Canadian barrels that eat into revenue for producers already struggling with low prices.
McCuaig-Boyd compared deciding the merits of a pipeline based on downstream emission to judging transmission lines based on how its electricity will be used.
The Canadian government released transitional rules for energy reviews in January 2016 that said upstream emissions from crude producers should be assessed, but the NEB's plan goes further by including the greenhouse gas impact of how the crude is used once it is off the pipeline.
""This sets a dangerous precedent for other projects as the things that could qualify as greenhouse gas emissions would start to just burgeon,"" said Rafi Tahmazian, an energy portfolio manager at Canoe Financial in Calgary. ""It's almost impossible to calculate.""
The NEB has not released any clarification on the process it would use to consider the measurement of upstream and downstream emissions, spokeswoman Sarah Kiley said.
New Brunswick Premier Brian Gallant said in a statement he spoke to TransCanada Chief Executive Russ Girling on Thursday evening and the company is considering other options, making it possible the pipeline will not be built.
TransCanada declined to comment beyond its statement on Thursday and the office of Canadian Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said it would comment later on Friday.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery fell more than 3% to settle at $47.48 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent lost 1.34% to trade at $53.76 a barrel.
Two weeks after Storm Harvey made landfall on the Texas coast, knocking out a quarter of U.S. oil refining capacity, oil prices continued to come under pressure as refineries have been slow to restart, weighing on demand for crude oil, the primary input at refineries.
Analysts said, however, that the slowdown in refining and output should be temporary.
""Most refineries are restarting and we expect a near-full recovery by month-end,"" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.
Falling crude prices have weighed on U.S. drilling activity over recent weeks, as data showed the number of U.S. oil rigs fell from the prior week.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the United States declined by 3 to 756.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
The dip in crude demand was reflected in a report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Thursday showing crude stockpiles rose for the first time in ten weeks.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by roughly 4.6m barrels in the week ended Sept. 1, missing expectations  of a rise of about only 4m barrels.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $1.98, or 0.15%, to $1,352.36 a troy ounce.
The dollar drifted to a thirty-two-month low, boosting demand for the precious metal in the wake of William Dudley’s comments on monetary policy tightening.
""It's too soon to judge exactly the timing of when the next rate hike might occur, but the path is still clear that short term rates are going to move higher,\"" said Dudley, one of the central bank's key decision-makers.
Dudley’s remarks were viewed as less hawkish, pointing to a potential dip in sentiment among Fed members on additional rate hikes this year, as it was only a month ago that the New York Fed president said that he expected rates to raise once more this year.
Gold is sensitive to moves lower in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A lower dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency while a dip in U.S. rates, reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Friday after almost a week of sharp rises as Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful storms in a century, drove towards Florida after tearing through the Caribbean.
Irma is the second major hurricane to approach the United States in two weeks and has already killed 14, flattening whole islands. Its predecessor, Harvey, shut a quarter of U.S. refineries and 8 percent of U.S. oil production.
""Hurricanes can have a lasting effect on refinery and industry demand,"" said Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt. ""The impact of the forces of nature on U.S. oil production should not be overestimated – nor should their impact on demand be underestimated.""
Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 16 cents at $54.65 a barrel by 1145 GMT, after earlier reaching its highest level since April at $54.80. U.S. light crude oil (CLc1) was 14 cents lower at $48.95 barrel.
Brent found some support from news that Saudi Arabia will cut oil supply allocations to its customers worldwide in October by 350,000 barrels per day (bpd).
U.S. crude prices fell as a result of low refining activity following Harvey, which sharply reduced demand for oil to process, traders said.
Harvey's impact was also felt in oil production. U.S. oil output fell by almost 8 percent, from 9.5 million barrels per day (bpd) to 8.8 million bpd, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). 
But the slowdown in refining and output should be temporary.
""Most refineries are restarting and we expect a near-full recovery by month-end,"" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said.
Port and refinery closures along the Gulf coast and harsh sea conditions in the Caribbean have also affected shipping. 
""Imports (of oil) to the U.S. Gulf Coast fell to levels not seen since the 1990s,"" ANZ bank said.
It will take weeks for the U.S. petroleum industry to return to full capacity, analysts say.
Hurricane Irma hit the Dominican Republic and Haiti on Friday, heading for Cuba and the Bahamas. It was predicted to reach Florida by Sunday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that Irma was a Category 5 hurricane, with wind speeds of 160-185 miles per hours (260-295 km/h).

On Irma's heels, Hurricane Jose is heading for the Caribbean Leeward islands, which have just been devastated by Irma, with wind speeds of 120 mph (195 km/h).

279,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2017 07:20AM ET</span>",New Venezuela prosecutor expects more arrests in oil graft cases,"By Alexandra Ulmer
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's new chief prosecutor Tarek Saab said he expects further arrests in widening oil-sector bribery scandals, after most of state energy company PDVSA's top brass in the western region was detained in a major sweep this week. 
The two other significant oil cases he is investigating are overbilling in equipment sales at Venezuela's main oil-exporting port of Jose, as well as at least $200 million in an overpricing case involving 10 companies in the oil-rich Orinoco Belt. 
""There are going to be arrests there, without a doubt"" Saab said in an interview, adding details about the specific projects or joint ventures involved were confidential but he was interested in recovering capital. 
""This is just getting started."" 
Caracas-based PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] has been tarnished in recent years by international graft investigations. The company is the financial motor of President Nicolas Maduro's leftist government but is suffering crippling operational problems. It has blamed a small group of wrongdoers for the ills and promised a war on graft.
The opposition says PDVSA is a rat's nest of corruption, and a congressional report last year said $11 billion was lost at the company between 2004 and 2014, when Rafael Ramirez was in charge. He denied the allegations.
Saab, who took control of the prosecutor's office last month, has vowed to lead a ""crusade"" against corruption in the nation with the world's biggest crude reserves. 
The lawyer and former human rights ombudsman wants to focus in particular on the oil industry, the source of over 90 percent of crisis-hit Venezuela's export income. 
As evidence of his seriousness, Saab pointed to this week's arrest of eight oil executives in Venezuela's traditional oil-producing region near Colombia. His office accuses them of irregularities including smuggling Venezuela's highly-subsidized oil to Caribbean islands. 
The case was triggered by complaints from oil project Petrozamora, an venture between PDVSA and Russia's Gazprombank. 
""We produced eight arrests and there can be more. We want to get to the bottom of this,"" said Saab in an interview in his office in central Caracas on Thursday afternoon. 
Saab said one person allegedly involved in the Jose case had turned himself in but declined to give details. An internal police message seen by Reuters says Pedro Leon, a powerful executive who led PDVSA's Orinoco Belt development for years before abruptly leaving at the start of the year, had returned to Venezuela this month and handed himself in.
PDVSA has not responded to requests for comment on the cases. 
SAAB SPARS WITH PREDECESSOR 
The son of Lebanese immigrants who was born in the oil-producing state of Anzoategui, Saab trained as a lawyer and has been a state human rights ombudsman and Socialist Party governor. 
In the opposition's eyes, the government ally lacks legitimacy, and his appointment to replace Luisa Ortega, who was removed after she broke with Maduro over human rights, is a sign of Venezuela's swerve into dictatorship.
Opposition politicians say bribery cases are a reflection of turf wars, not a genuine intent by Maduro's unpopular government to root out graft. 
Saab, in turn, accuses his predecessor Ortega, who fled Venezuela on a speedboat last month, of running an extortion ring that allowed culprits to pay in exchange for getting off the hook. She has rejected the claims as politically motivated. 
After being removed in a rare public fissure between Venezuelan officials, Ortega went into hiding and fled on a speedboat to Aruba. Since then, she has been traveling around Latin America denouncing the Maduro government for allegedly persecuting her and engaging in corruption. 
""She has no credibility,"" said Saab in his office decorated with photos of Maduro, works by famous Venezuelan artists and drawings by his daughter. ""She's a person who lies repeatedly.""
Saab said Ortega's file on engineering conglomerate Odebrecht, which is ensnared in Brazil's biggest graft scandal, only had 10 pages. He stressed he was pushing forward with the case. He said he did not rule out traveling to Brasilia to meet the neighboring country's prosecutors. 
Ortega, who says she remains Venezuela's real chief prosecutor and was recently in Brazil herself, contends Saab is an ""imposter"" seeking vengeance. 
""What he's done is spend all his time persecuting me, creating cases to prosecute me and my family,"" Ortega told neighboring Colombia's W Radio this month. 
Saab was also in the limelight this year for family reasons. His son Yibram, a law student, in April stunned Venezuela by publicly coming out against the government, stating he had participated in anti-Maduro protests, and urging his father to ""end the injustice.""
Saab, whose office also features photos of his children, said he respected his son's right to his opinion and loved him just the same.

NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil and petrochemical plants along the U.S. Gulf Coast intend to go ahead with plans for near record spending on expansions next year, despite Hurricane Harvey driving up labor costs and slowing work, experts said. 
Harvey largely spared oil and petrochemical plants along the U.S. Gulf Coast from significant damage but thousands of homes and businesses were not as fortunate. Refiners and recovery projects will complete for the same labor, driving up costs or causing labor shortages.
Industrial investment in the Gulf Coast is expected to hit $51.9 billion next year, near the 2015 peak, requiring an army of pipefitters, ironworkers and other craftsman, said Industrial Information Resources (IIR), which tracks labor supply for refiners and other industrial companies. 
""We had a labor shortage before Harvey, but now it's significantly worse,"" said IIR's Anthony Salemme. ""It's going to spread to soft crafts like painters and insulators.""
Investments have soared in recent years because the shale revolution fed off an existing infrastructure. The region's deep water ports and expanding pipeline and storage networks offer an easy outlet to global markets. It also boasts a welcoming regulatory climate and skilled workforce. 
Since 2010, $85 billion worth of petrochemical projects have started or been completed across the United States, nearly all of them in the Gulf Coast region, according to the American Chemistry Council.
But the concentration along the Gulf of Mexico leaves these facilities and supporting networks exposed to the brutal force of tropical storms and hurricanes, as Harvey laid bare last month. 
The storm shut roughly a quarter of the nation's refinery capacity and more than a dozen petrochemical plants halted operations. Ports were closed and key fuel pipelines serving the Midwest and U.S. Northeast were partially or completely shut, driving up pump prices as fears of fuel shortages took hold.
Preliminary assessments suggest that storm's hit to the region is not deterring companies from going ahead with existing projects. But global commodities buyers such as Ineos Group [INEOSG.UL] and Reliance Industries Ltd that relied on existing facilities shut by the storm may now consider putting some warehouses and stock elsewhere. 
""The robustness of the supply chain is brought a little more under attention,"" said David Witte, a senior vice president at consultants IHS Markit. ""They may be looking at it differently.""
Construction costs also could slow some work. 
INVESTMENT PLANS
There is no sign that major new projects are under threat. Several with plans on the drawing board, including BASF SE (DE:BASFN), DowDuPont Inc and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) are sticking to growth plans. Others said they will repair Harvey's damage before making any decisions on long-term strategy for the region. Exxon earlier this year said it would invest $20 billion to expand Texas refining and petrochemical operations in Beaumont, Corpus Christi and Baytown. All three communities were damaged by Harvey. As part of that expansion, Exxon and Saudi Basic Industries Corp are proposing an about $10 billion chemical plant in Corpus Christi, near where Harvey made landfall. The project is moving forward, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri declined to comment. DowDuPont is also undeterred from an ongoing $4 billion expansion project that includes new capacity in Freeport, Texas, on the coast. ""Hurricane Harvey does not change our perspective on the region being a great location for our investments,"" spokeswoman Rachelle Schikorra said in a statement. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc, which is expanding its operations in the Gulf, also has proposed new investments in western Pennsylvania, near the natural gas-rich Marcellus formation.
The plant will help Shell capture a larger share of the U.S. market for polyethylene, more than half of which is concentrated in northern states. It took Shell years to make the decision to build the plant.
Pennsylvania has started to position itself as a second U.S. refining region, even though new plants are years away from opening. The state lacks the specialized refining workforce and proximity to open water - and the Panama Canal - that make the Gulf Coast area still so appealing.
The U.S. Gulf Coast will remain an attractive investment area, said Shell spokesman Curtis Smith and other energy officials. 

""What this storm has demonstrated is the resilience of the energy system,"" said Torgrim Reitan, who runs  Statoil  (OL:STL) ASA's U.S. operations. ""Even a Harvey can't take out this capacity.""

TransCanada will do a ""careful review"" of the new assessment process to gauge its effect on the costs, schedules and viability of the pipeline to the Atlantic coast, the company said in a statement.
The NEB in August expanded the scope of Energy East's review, saying it will consider the project's indirect greenhouse gas contributions and will provide ""more visibility"" to the evaluation of risks associated with accidents such as oil spills.
The regulator said on Thursday it will consider TransCanada's request to pause its Energy East application and will make a decision ""in a timely fashion.""
Energy East, which would take crude from Canada's oil heartland of Alberta, would attain higher prices for Canadian producers, whose landlocked product trades at a discount to the West Texas Intermediate benchmark.
Assessing indirect emissions had been opposed by TransCanada, which had called it ""completely redundant and unnecessary.""
In a filing to the regulator on Thursday, TransCanada also requested an extension to the deadline for filing Energy East updates to Oct. 27.
Should TransCanada abandon the project, ""the carrying value of its investment ... as well as its ability to recover development costs incurred to date would be negatively impacted,"" the company said.
TransCanada said it will continue to advance its other projects despite pausing Energy East.
Dirk Lever, an energy infrastructure analyst at AltaCorp Capital in Calgary, said: ""What they want to do is halt the clock on it, and I can't say I am surprised.""
Assessing indirect emissions ""is a really tough ask,"" he added.
Royal Bank of Canada analyst Robert Kwan said Energy East is likely immaterial in the market's valuation of TransCanada, although Thursday's announcement could ""drive negative sentiment that could put some downward pressure on the shares.""
Energy East's importance has somewhat diminished for TransCanada since the United States this year approved the company's Keystone XL pipeline, which would run from Alberta to U.S. refineries.

The pipeline was up for its second NEB review, after the first stalled last year amid protests by environmentalists and after revelations that regulatory panel members met privately with a TransCanada consultant.

Brent futures (LCOc1) gained 29 cents, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $54.49 a barrel, its highest close since April 18 for a second day in a row.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1), meanwhile, lost 7 cents, or 0.1 percent, to settle at $49.09 per barrel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Thursday U.S. weekly crude stocks increased 4.6 million barrels last week, topping analysts' forecast for a 4.0-million-barrel build in a Reuters poll.  [EIA/S]
Reflecting the impact of Harvey which hit the Gulf Coast on Aug. 25, the EIA said U.S. oil refinery utilization rates slumped 16.9 percentage points to 79.7 percent last week, the lowest rate since 2010.
U.S. Gulf Coast utilization rates dropped to 63.4 percent, the lowest rates since the EIA began collecting the data in 2010.
""The impact of Hurricane Harvey is clearly visible in the report. The data scrambles the recent trend of declining crude inventories and further rises are likely in the weeks ahead,"" said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York.
He noted the big drop in refinery utilization ""almost assures"" crude stockpiles will continue to rise in coming weeks.
U.S. Gulf Coast facilities were slowly recovering from the devastating effects of Harvey, which hammered Louisiana and Texas almost two weeks ago, shutting key infrastructure in the heart of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry.
As of Wednesday, about 3.8 million barrels of daily refining capacity, or 20 percent of the U.S. total, was shut in, though a number of refineries and petroleum-handling ports were restarting.
U.S. refiner Valero's five refineries located on the Texas Gulf Coast are in the process of ramping back up, Chief Executive officer Joe Gorder said on Thursday.
At the same time, prices were weighed down by fears that Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean could interrupt crude shipments in and out of the United States.
In the week after Harvey hit, U.S. crude exports dropped 749,000 barrels per day to 153,000 bpd.
Irma barreled into Caribbean islands overnight with wind speeds up to 185 miles per hour (295 kph) and was heading for Florida. Fuel shortages were reported in Florida as retailers struggled to keep up with demand from customers, many of whom were evacuating and filling tanks ahead of the storm's landfall expected this weekend.
Another Atlantic storm, Jose, is following on Irma's heels and is expected to gain in strength and intensify into a major hurricane by Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Yet another hurricane, Katia, is in the Gulf of Mexico.
""Demand may continue to be distorted as multiple hurricanes make their way across the Caribbean,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery fell by 7 cents to settle at $49.09 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 24 cents to trade at $54.44 a barrel.
A report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed crude stockpiles rose more than expected last week offsetting recent optimism on oil prices which has seen crude futures settle higher for three-straight days.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by roughly 4.6m barrels in the week ended Sept. 1, missing expectations  of a rise of about only 4m barrels. It was the first weekly build in crude stockpiles for ten weeks.
Gasoline inventories, one of the products that crude is refined into, fell by roughly 3.2m barrels, missing expectations of a draw of 5m barrels while distillate stockpiles fell by 1.4m barrels, below expectations of a decline of 3m barrels.
The build in crude stockpiles comes after heavy flooding due to storm Harvey knocked out nearly quarter of the U.S. refining capacity last week, lowering demand for crude oil, the primary input at refineries.
Crude-oil refinery inputs fell by 3.3 million barrels a day last week, to average 14.5 million barrels a day, while refineries operated at just 79.7% of capacity, the EIA said.
Analysts expect the fallout from storm Harvey will continue to weigh on crude stockpiles as refiners have been slow to restart operations while the end of the summer driving season is traditionally associated with a dip in crude oil demand.
“We do feel we will continue to see crude oil builds in the weeks to come due to the demand destruction and especially since we are past the summer driving season.” Tyler Richey, co-editor of the Sevens Report said."

The report also showed that gasoline inventories decreased by 3.199 million barrels, compared to expectations for a draw of 5.000 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles fell by 1.396 million barrels, compared to forecasts for a decrease of 3.063 million.
The report came out one day later than usual due to Monday’s Labor Day holiday.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for November delivery turned around and gained 7 cents, or 0.13%, to $54.27 by 11:08AM ET (15:08GMT), compared to $54.16 before the release.
Meanwhile, Brent's premium to the WTI crude contract stood at $5.25 a barrel by 11:09AM ET (15:09GMT), compared to a gap of $5.04 by close of trade on Wednesday.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for October delivery fell less than a cent to $1.6721 a gallon, while October heating oil rose 1.7 cents to $1.7769 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for October delivery fell 1.8 cents to $2.982 per million British thermal units.
Markets have been evaluating the impact of Hurricane Harvey on supply and demand as operations in oil refineries, pipelines and shipping channels across Texas and Louisiana returned gradually this week.
Traders are also keeping an eye on Hurricane Irma, ranked as one of the five most powerful Atlantic hurricanes in the last 80 years.
The Category 5 hurricane battered Puerto Rico and devastated a chain of small Caribbean islands late on Wednesday and is expected to hit Florida by Sunday afternoon, a prospect that has roiled orange juice and gasoline futures markets as well as shares of insurance providers.
Two other tropical storms in the Atlantic, Jose and Katia, were declared hurricanes late on Wednesday."

U.S. natural gas for October delivery was at $2.994 per million British thermal units by 10:35AM ET (1435GMT), down 0.6 cents, or 0.2%. Futures were at around $2.995 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 65 billion cubic feet in the week ended Sept. 1, just above forecasts for a build of 64 billion.
That compared with a gain of 30 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 36 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 58 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.220 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 6.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago and mostly in line with the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas futures ended around 1% higher on Wednesday, as traders remained wary of Hurricane Irma, ranked as one of the five most powerful Atlantic hurricanes in the last 80 years.
Adding to concerns, there are two more tropical storms on Irma's heels.
Jose, heading for the Caribbean, strengthened to a hurricane and could become a major Category 3 storm by Friday, while Katia churned in the Gulf of Mexico, threatening to come ashore in Mexico.
The weather threats come after Hurricane Harvey caused flooding and devastation in Texas less than two weeks ago, forcing the closure of several refineries and pipelines.
Energy traders track tropical weather in the event it disrupts production in the Gulf of Mexico.

296,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2017 04:56AM ET</span>","Meth, coke and oil: A drug boom in the Texas shale patch","By Liz Hampton
MIDLAND, Texas (Reuters) - When Joe Forsythe returned to the West Texas oilfields last year after a stint in a drug rehab facility, he figured he had beaten his addiction to methamphetamine.
The 32-year-old rig worker and equipment handler lasted about a year before relapsing.
""It's easy to get back into that mentality,"" said Forsythe, of Midland, Texas, who said he no longer uses drugs after several stints in rehab since 2015. ""I'd work 24 hours ... I was just plagued with fatigue and needed something to improve my work ethic.""
Forsythe's experience and others like it reflect a painful flipside of the nation's shale oil boom - a parallel increase in substance abuse, drug crime and related social ills.
While drug use is a problem among industrial workers nationwide, it raises particular concern in the oil patch as U.S. production surges to record levels in what is already one of the nation's most dangerous sectors - with a fatality rate about three times the average for other industries, according to 2015 federal statistics.
Drug use is a significant factor in workplace injuries and crimes involving oilfield workers, according to drug counselors, hospital and police officials and court records in West Texas, the epicenter of the U.S. shale sector.
As the shale revolution has spawned waves of hiring here since 2010, law enforcement authorities have tracked a boom in drug trafficking and related crime. In Midland and Ector counties, home to many Permian Basin oil workers, state and local police in 2016 seized more than 95 pounds of methamphetamine - up from less than four pounds in 2010.
Meth and cocaine are stimulants of choice in the oil patch to get though long oilfield shifts, but alcohol and pain killers such as opioids are also widely abused - often to soften the crash after taking stimulants, drug addicts and counselors said.
Drug charges in the industry town of Midland more than doubled between 2012 and 2016, to 942 from 491, according to police data. In neighboring Odessa, total drug arrests doubled between 2010 and 2016, to 1291 from 756, according to Odessa Police Department data.
The increase in drug crime stretched through two boom periods in the West Texas oil patch, before and after a crude price crash that hit in 2014.
Oil companies typically drug test job applicants and often conduct additional random tests on employees. For truck drivers and those involved with hazardous materials, tests are also conducted under federal programs run by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
Several oil firms with major operations in the Permian Basin declined to discuss how they handle drugs in the oil patch or did not respond to inquiries.
Schlumberger NV (N:SLB),  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) declined to comment. Exxon referred Reuters to its alcohol and drug policy. 
 Pioneer Natural Resources  Co. (N:PXD) and ConocoPhillips (N:COP) did not respond to requests for comment.
The American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, declined to comment.
LONG HOURS - ON METH
Despite corporate and regulatory efforts to curb drug abuse, many oilfield workers regularly use stimulants on long shifts of grueling work for relatively high pay, said drug counselors, local law enforcement officials and oil field workers recovering from addictions.
More than a third of clients at Midland's Springboard drug rehabilitation center are currently involved in the oil and gas industry, said Executive Director Steve Thomason.
Rising oil prices have brought more admissions for methamphetamine abuse, Thomason said.
""People say they can work on it for 24 hours straight,"" he said.
Long shifts are common in the oil industry because expensive drilling equipment, often leased at high daily rates, runs through the night, and workers often have to commute to wells in remote locations. Most oil producers subcontract oilfield services to smaller companies that are not unionized.
Springboard's admissions of methamphetamine users went up 20 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the last half of 2016, he said. The number of rigs operating in the Permian Basin increased more than 38 percent during the same period, according to data from energy services firm  Baker Hughes  (N:BHGE). 
Corporal Steve LeSueur, a spokesman for the Odessa police, said the influx of drugs in the oil patch is stretching police resources.
""The jail has been full,"" he said. ""A lot of crimes that are committed are drug-related – simple property crimes, forgeries to feed their drug habits.""
METH AND MURDER
Some offenses are more severe.
In 2016, Shawn Pinson, an employee of a well construction company, was convicted of murdering an acquaintance following a drug-related dispute.
The murder occurred around the same time he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine, police records show. The victim tested positive for meth at the time of the murder, according to an autopsy.
At his trial, witnesses close to Pinson testified he had become addicted to methamphetamine while working in the oilfield, according to a prosecutor and a defense attorney involved in the case.
Pinson did not respond to a letter seeking comment and his current attorney, Michele Greene, did not respond to a request for comment. 
When oil jobs are plentiful, companies desperate for labor sometimes will disregard signs of substance abuse, said three recovering drug addicts who worked in the oilfield.
""These oilfield bosses - they party, too,” Forsythe said. “As long as you're getting the job done and not making a scene, they won't drug test you."" 
One recovering addict, who declined to use his name because he still works in the industry, said he was often high during long-haul trips driving trucks transporting oil. 
""I could do a little coke and speed and it would give me the extra stretch,"" he said. ""It ended up running me to the ground.""

Market focus was also being drawn to Hurricane Irma, a record Category 5 storm, which could potentially hit different parts of Florida.
Two other tropical storms in the Atlantic, Jose and Katia, were declared hurricanes late on Wednesday.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude October contract was at $49.05 a barrel by 3:10AM ET (0710GMT), down 11 cents, or around 0.2%. It rose to its best level since Aug. 10 at $49.42 in the prior session.
Meanwhile, Brent oil for November delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 15 cents, or about 0.3%, to $54.05 a barrel. It touched a more than three-month peak of $54.31 a day earlier.
Oil prices ended higher on Wednesday to notch their fourth-winning session in a row as demand picked up after U.S. refineries started to resume operations.
Concerns about a potential hit to production along the Gulf coast from Hurricane Irma provided further support.
Looking ahead, the U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report at 11:00AM ET (1500GMT). Analysts expect crude oil inventories rose by around 4.0 million barrels at the end of last week.
Meanwhile, gasoline supplies are seen decreasing by 5.0 million barrels and distillates are forecast to fall 3.0 million barrels.
After markets closed Wednesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories rose by about 2.8 million barrels in the week ended September 1.
However, the API report also showed a drop of 2.5 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks fell by 600,000 barrels.
The data was published a day later than usual due to Monday’s Labor Day holiday.
There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA.
Meanwhile, gasoline futures shed 0.8 cents, or about 0.5%, to $1.662 a gallon, as fears of a serious supply crunch continued to fade.
Elsewhere, natural gas futures for October delivery tacked on 2.4 cents, or 0.8%, to $3.024 per million British thermal units, as traders looked ahead to weekly storage data due later in the global day.

The European Central Bank's latest interest rate decision is due at 1145GMT (7:45AM ET), with no major policy changes expected. Most of the focus will be on President Mario Draghi's press conference 45 minutes after the announcement, as investors look for more clues on when and how the ECB could start unwinding its massive quantitative easing program.
Announcing new staff forecasts, policymakers will likely upgrade the ECB's growth outlook and reduce inflation projections but only slightly.
Having already expressed concern about the rise of the euro in July, policymakers may also repeat their warning about the currency moving too quick.
Market experts believe the central bank is likely to wait until October before announcing a tapering of its €60 billion of monthly asset purchases.
Comex gold futures were at $1,340.17 a troy ounce by 2:40AM ET (0640GMT), up $1.20, or around 0.1%. Prices remained within sight of their best level since Sept. 8, 2016 at $1,349.70, touched earlier this week.
The yellow metal snapped a three-day win streak to finish lower on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional leaders unexpectedly agreed to raise the government debt limit until December.
If Congress passes the package, which also includes relief funding for Hurricane Harvey, it would prevent a default on the federal debt.
The positive development was seen as eliminating the near-term risk of a government shutdown.
A lack of substantial developments on the Korean Peninsula also likely contributed to an improvement in risk sentiment in markets, dampening the appeal of safe-haven assets.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures were little changed at $17.91 a troy ounce. It rose to a more than four-month peak of $18.09 at the start of this week.
Among other precious metals, platinum shed 0.2% to $1,005.55, while palladium was flat at $935.60 an ounce.

The data was published a day later than usual due to Monday’s Labor Day holiday. The U.S. Department of Energy will release its official data on inventories on Thursday.
Overnight, oil prices settled higher for a third day in a row on Wednesday, as demand for crude returned from restarted Gulf Coasts refineries following disruptions to U.S. refining capacity due to Storm Harvey.
Crude oil settled at a four-week peak as concerns over a big drop in crude demand subsided following an uptick in the number of U.S. refineries restarting operations after Harvey knocked out more than quarter of refining capacity last week.
Meanwhile the development of Storm Irma, which made landfall in the Caribbean earlier on Wednesday, continued to garner investor attention, as the Category 5 storm could knock out other refineries and add to concerns over fuel shortages.
Also supporting the rise in oil prices were suggestions that Russia and Saudi Arabia would be open to extending their output cut agreement.
Russian energy minister, Alexander Novak said Tuesday that that representatives from both Saudi Arabia and Russia had talked about an extension but that no specific decisions had yet been reached.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange edged down 0.01% to $1,338.80 a troy ounce.
Overnight, gold prices fell on Wednesday, as U.S. political uncertainty eased after President Donald Trump agreed to raise the debt ceiling and extend government funding through Dec. 15.
Gold prices retreated from a one-year high pressured by a rebound in the dollar on news that President Donald Trump agreed on Wednesday that Congress should pass an extension of the U.S. debt limit and raise the debt ceiling, which caps how much money the U.S. government can borrow. The deal included working with the Democratic leadership as part of an effort to ensure funds are available to help rebuild after Hurricane Harvey.
Losses in gold, however, remained limited as expectations on additional U.S. rate increases faded, following comments from Federal Reserve officials urging the U.S. central bank to consider shelving its plan to hike rates later this year amid a slowdown in inflation.
Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate hikes may be slowing inflation and inflicting “real harm” on U.S. economic growth.
""Maybe our rate hikes are actually doing real harm to the economy,"" said Kashkari.
Kashhkari comments came after Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard urged the U.S. central bank to delay raising interest rates until the trend of slowing inflation improved.
Gold is sensitive to moves lower in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A lower dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency while a fall in U.S. rates, reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced the trade action in a statement, saying: “The Department will act swiftly, while assuring a full and fair assessment of the facts, to ensure that everyone trades on a level playing field.”
In 2016 imports of stainless steel flanges from China and India were valued at an estimated $16.3 million and $32.1 million, respectively, the statement said.
The probe followed petitions by two privately held companies, Core Pipe Products Inc of Illinois and Maass Flange Corp of Texas.
They alleged dumping margins, or the discount to fair value, on products from China of 99.23 percent to 257.11 percent and from India of 78.49 percent to 145.25 percent. They also estimated that products from both countries were subsidized at undetermined rates, the statement said.
The International Trade Commission is due to make a preliminary decision about whether the imports injure U.S. producers by Oct. 2, which would ensure the Commerce Department continues its investigation, the statement said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on Wednesday as strong global refining margins and the reopening of U.S. Gulf Coast refineries provided a more bullish outlook after sharp drops due to Hurricane Harvey.
But traders remained wary of Hurricane Irma, ranked as one of the five most powerful Atlantic hurricanes in the last 80 years, which was passing over the northernmost Virgin Islands on Wednesday afternoon and headed toward Florida at the weekend, raising concerns that it could knock out a major demand center and cause more fuel shortages.
There is also another tropical storm on Irma's heels. Jose, heading for the Caribbean, strengthened to a hurricane on Wednesday and could become a major Category 3 storm by Friday.
Brent (LCOc1) had gained 82 cents to settle at $54.20 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (Clc1) were up 50 cents at $49.16 a barrel. Prices were little-changed after industry data showed U.S. crude stockpiles increased last the week. 
""Everyone is just grappling with the spate of storms that are populating the Gulf,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital. 
Many refineries, pipelines and ports that were shut due to Harvey 10 days ago are restarting.
On Tuesday, about 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity, or 20 percent of the U.S. total, was shut. This compares with 4.2 million bpd at the height of the storm.
Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) began restarting its Sweeny, Texas refinery on Tuesday, and expects the plant to be at full production by mid-September.
""Refineries coming back online is putting a squeeze on supplies in the Gulf,"" Kilduff said. Crack spreads, a measure of refining profitability, have been constrained as crude prices have risen and gasoline futures have begun to be pared back.
Gulf Coast and Caribbean energy infrastructure began to brace for Irma.  BP  Plc (L:BP) said it would evacuate non-essential personnel from its Thunder Horse platform in the Gulf of Mexico, while Buckeye Partners (N:BPL) has shut its Yabucoa oil terminal in Puerto Rico and was preparing for the storm at two other marine terminals in Florida and the Bahamas.
Oil terminals and distributors in Florida are tracking the storm, which could curtail fuel shipments to the state, which is largely dependent upon waterborne deliveries of gasoline and diesel. 
Around 250,000 bpd of refining capacity in the Dominican Republic and Cuba lies in the immediate path of Irma, Thomson Reuters Eikon data showed.
Weekly storage data was expected to give a better view of the extent of Harvey's impact on U.S. fuel inventories although some analysts say it will take a few weeks more to get a complete picture.
U.S. crude stocks rose last week, while gasoline and distillate inventories drew as refinery utilization rates plunged 11.1 percentage points to 83.9 percent of capacity, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed.[API/S]
Government data on Thursday is expected to confirm that crude stockpiles rose after nine straight weekly drawdowns, with analysts forecasting a build of 4 million barrels. [EIA/S]
Longer-term, the oil industry outlook is for ample supplies and low prices as crude output remains high in the three biggest producing regions: Russia, the Middle East and North America.
Adding to the longer term bearishness, some Libyan production returned. The 280,000 bpd Sharara oilfield, the country's largest, was gradually restarting on Wednesday after the lifting of a pipeline blockade, Libyan oil sources said.

304,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2017 04:31PM ET</span>","Trump administration, states headed for showdown over fuel rules","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration and major U.S. states appear to be headed for a showdown over landmark rules aimed at doubling the fuel efficiency of vehicles sold in the United States.
At an Environmental Protection Agency public hearing on Wednesday on the fuel rules in Washington, California air resources board official Annette Hebert warned that the state could withdraw from a nationwide vehicle emissions program if the EPA weakens the regulations or ignores the technical record. New York state also urged the administration not to weaken the rules.
""Science doesn't change based on election results,"" Hebert said, referring to the November election of Republican President Donald Trump.
In March, Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards from model year 2022 through 2025 established under the Obama administration, and suggested he would reduce regulatory requirements. 
""The assault on the American auto industry is over,"" he told automakers in Michigan.
Automakers want the White House and California to reach agreement on revisions because a legal battle over the rules could result in lengthy uncertainly for the industry. They also want changes in the rules to address lower gas prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles.
Federal law prohibits states from setting their own vehicle emissions rules, except for California, which can seek waivers to federal policy under the Clean Air Act. Other states can choose to adopt California's rules.
Julia Rege of Global Automakers, a group representing automakers including Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), said at the hearing that automakers need national rules, and urged U.S. regulators and California to ""be as actively involved in the process as before, and work to keep the national program intact.""
With just over six months before the 2025 rules must be finalized, there have been no vehicle emission talks between California, automakers and U.S. officials. The White House has held talks with automakers about the review in recent months, Reuters reported last month.
In June, New York state's attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, and 12 other top state law enforcement officials said they would mount a court challenge to any effort to roll back vehicle emission rules.
United Auto Workers legislative director Josh Nassar said at the hearing that the national program should be continued to ""prevent chaos, lawsuits, uncertainty.""
The Obama administration’s rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025.
The Obama administration said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.
A number of environmental advocates and retired military leaders at the hearing urged U.S. regulators not to weaken the standards.
Automakers want changes.
""To keep costs reasonable for buyers and maximize future production levels and fleet turnover, it is vital to clearly focus on consumer preferences and market realities,"" said Chris Nevers, an official with the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co (N:GM), Toyota, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and others.

U.S. regulators disclosed earlier that they may revise fuel efficiency requirements starting with the 2021 model year, a year earlier than Trump announced in March.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - For Texas residents affected by Hurricane Harvey, life in the storm's aftermath involves juggling insurance claims, home repairs and work. But coping with loss is stirring very different feelings.
Staff at the Sugar Land campus of the University of Houston began their first day at work on Tuesday sharing storm experiences and consoling those whose homes were damaged.
""It's very healing for people,"" Kathryn Tart, dean of the university's College of Nursing, said. ""It helps us move on to the really difficult next stage - rebuilding."" 
In an area of West Houston where some 3,000 homes suffered severe flooding and where water releases from two reservoirs continue to swamp neighborhoods, anger surfaced.
""I look out my kitchen window and there is a river that will always be there,"" said Bryant Banes, who is a lawyer. He filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government in federal court claiming damages to his and neighbors' homes and businesses from the reservoir releases. 
The decision to release waters to relieve pressure on the reservoirs amounted to an improper taking of property, the lawsuit claims. ""People have lost their homes and it is their responsibility to compensate residents,"" Banes said.
Harvey hit Corpus Christi in southern Texas on Aug. 25 but took the greatest toll on Houston and areas east of the city. The storm killed as many as 60 people, dumped more than 50 inches (127 cm) of rain and caused damages estimated as high as $180 billion, including to 312,000 homes along the coast.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Some oil traders in Asia are looking to snap up crude cargoes from the United States after Hurricane Harvey closed U.S. refineries, denting local demand and pushing out the price spread between U.S and Atlantic Basin crude benchmarks.
Hurricane Harvey barreled into the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast around 10 days ago, closing nearly a quarter of the nation's refining capacity, although some of that is now coming back online.
The closures pushed the prompt-month spread between West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) and Brent crude (LCOc1) to the widest in two years at nearly $6 a barrel last week, pushing Asian traders to hunt for competitively priced U.S crude. However, some said spot prices would need to ease further before traders fixed cargoes for the journey east.
""One good piece of news is that the WTI-Brent spread has blown out so much that means excess U.S. crude is going to be exported,"" said Tony Nunan, oil risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp in Tokyo.
""It looks like there wasn't much damage to export facilities and they should come back up quicker (than expected).""
Prices for WTI light grades were the weakest and they could head to Asia first, said a Singapore-based trader, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with media.
Still, the market is evolving daily with spot levels for WTI Midland  rebounding on Tuesday after several refineries restarted post-Harvey.
Taiwanese refiner Formosa Petrochemical Corp (TW:6505) could consider buying from the United States.
""We're watching the situation,"" spokesman KY Lin told Reuters.
""U.S. crude's length may worsen and put more downward pressure on prices in the next two weeks.""
Spot premiums for Mars , another grade that's popular with Asian refiners, edged down on Tuesday from more than two-year highs as more tankers were allowed to offload sour grades in the Gulf.
Companies that often ship U.S. crude to Asia include  BP  (L:BP),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX), Trafigura, Mercuria and Occidental in addition to North Asian refiners Unipec, PetroChina, JXTG (T:5020), Cosmo Energy (T:5021), GS Caltex and SK Energy.

Overnight, crude futures settled higher on Tuesday, as Gulf Coast refineries began restarting operations, following the disruptions caused by Hurricane Harvey last week.
Oil prices continued to pare losses sustained last week, after oil refineries, pipelines and transportation routes across Texas and Louisiana began restarting operation, improving U.S. refinery capacity, after flooding due to Hurricane Harvey shut down nearly a quarter of refinery capacity last week.
About 2 million barrels a day, or 11% of U.S. refining capacity, remained offline on Monday, according to Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The largest U.S. refineries at Port Arthur, however, are not expected to return to normal capacity for at least four weeks, according to Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.
Crude oil’s strong start to the week could come under pressure, however, as analysts expect the Energy Information Agency’s report on crude inventories due Thursday to show an uptick in crude supplies following the lower demand from refiners last week.
Meanwhile, another hurricane - Irma - strengthened on Tuesday into a Category 5 hurricane – the most powerful storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale – with sustained winds of over 157 miles (253 km) per hour, fuelling concerns that the storm could veer into U.S. oil and gas platforms in the gulf.

(Reuters) - Fuel distributors and traders in Florida braced for a second supply shock as Hurricane Irma barreled toward the state on the heels of disruptions from Hurricane Harvey in Texas.
Irma, described by forecasters as a potentially catastrophic Category 5 hurricane is forecast to reach southern Florida on Saturday, prompting Governor Rick Scott to declare a state of emergency.
Florida does not have any refineries and its more than 20 million residents rely on refined products delivered by tanker and barge at its ports. 
While locals stocked up on bottled water and plywood, fuel distributors scrambled to fill up on gasoline and diesel supplies before rough seas force port closures.
""We are also working with Homeland (Security) to get ships in before the hurricane,"" said Ned Bowman, executive director at the Florida Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association, which represents 98 percent of fuel sold in Florida.
Bowman added that the ""window is closing fast.""
The threat of Irma looms after Hurricane Harvey killed more than 60 people, dumped over 50 inches (127 cm) of rain and damaged 203,000 homes. About a quarter of U.S. refining capacity was offline as Harvey hammered Louisiana and Texas for several days, shutting key infrastructure in the heart of the U.S. oil and natural gas industry.
Retail gas prices in Florida have already jumped about 36 cents in one week to $2.68 a gallon as of Tuesday, according to motorists advocacy group AAA.
In part because of Florida's tourism industry and heavy passenger and cargo traffic through its international airports, state demand for motor gasoline and jet fuel is among the highest in the United States, according to the EIA.
The emergency issued by the governor also lifts trucking restrictions, allowing drivers to work longer hours and more freely bring in gasoline and fuel from other states if needed.
""We talked to the governor's staff about what the worst case scenario is,"" Bowman said, adding that they were well prepared to address any fuel shortages.
Port Everglades, South Florida's main seaport for receiving petroleum products including gasoline and jet fuel, said in a notice on its website it has gasoline reserves of at least one week stored on site.
There are a variety of cruise, cargo and petroleum ships scheduled to arrive this week and the coming weekend that could be affected by heavy weather, the port said. Currently, three petroleum ships are in port with another two waiting offshore.
Some cargoes destined for Florida could look to the New York Harbor to clear, one trader said. However, strong Florida prices mean most may simply float the cargoes until ports clear for discharge, he said.
There are 12 petroleum companies operating in and around the port that provide fuel to a dozen Florida counties and four international airports.
Southeast Petro, a wholesaler in the Southeast supplying fuel to over 400 gas stations, said it was already anticipating delays on loadings due to refinery closures in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.
""We have been placed on restricted allocations for fuel by the oil companies,"" the company said in a notice on its website.
Hurricanes also often lead to demand being sapped over the short term if the storm floods areas and shuts in people.
Around Florida, southeastern states including South Carolina, Alabama and Georgia have already seen prices at the pump soar amid tighter supplies.
Colonial Pipeline Co, the biggest U.S. fuels system, reopened a portion of its main distillate and gasoline lines after being forced to a shut due to flooding at its supply points and amid dwindling supplies. However, it could take days for flows to the southeast to resume to normal rates, shippers said.
""The southeast hasn't gotten regular supplies for a week to 10 days now due to Colonial Pipeline ... and your window to get cargo in to Port Everglades is the next 48 hours or 72 hours,"" one East Coast trader said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Houston area residents picked up the pace of their recovery from Hurricane Harvey on Tuesday, jamming roads as they returned to offices and schools to help get the nation's fourth largest city and its vital shipping and oil industries back on track.
The region is getting a boost from Mexico, which sent volunteers to shelters and is preparing to send relief supplies in the next few day. Mexican Red Cross workers were staffing shelters in three Texas cities. ""We are more than glad to be helpful,"" said Gustavo Santillan.
Large employers, universities and transit services reopened or began full schedules on Tuesday, with floodwaters receded and the Labor Day weekend behind them. But not all of the Houston-area's 6.6 million residents were in position to go back to work and were dealing with home repairs and waterlogged possessions. 
""It feels surreal to be back at work,"" said Hannah Smith, 31, who spent part of her day putting office furniture moved ahead of the storm back in place ""It is one step in the direction of whatever the new normal is."" 
Harvey tore through Corpus Christi in southern Texas on Aug. 25 before churning up the coast and hitting the Houston area especially hard. The storm killed as many as 60 people, dumped more than 50 inches (127 cm) of rain and caused damages estimated as high as $180 billion, including to 203,000 homes.
Oil refineries, pipelines and shipping channels in the nation's energy center have begun a gradual return to operations.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) on Tuesday said its fuel terminals in the Houston area were supplying gasoline and it continues to work on reopening a shuttered Baytown oil refinery. Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL], operator of the nation's largest refinery, said it is in the process of restarting operations at its Port Arthur, Texas, plant. 
Some industry stalwarts were still out of commission though. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) closed its Houston headquarters through Sept. 11. BP's Houston campus suffered severe flooding and remained closed. Portions may be out of use until December, Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters. About 650 of BP's more than 5,000 Houston area full-time staff reported damage to their homes.
""I’ve got to get work done but I don’t think it’ll be a productive day,” said Daniel Semetko, 60, a Houston energy company worker, citing the number of people who were out of their homes due to storm damage. 
With extensive property damage across the region, local and federal prosecutors formed a task force to investigate reports of home repair fraud and people posing as police to facilitate theft and other crimes, officials said. About 80 investigations into complaints were underway, said David Green, a Department of Homeland Security special agent. 
Houston's school district, the nation's seventh largest, remains closed this week to repair flooded schools. The district has said about 75 of its 275 schools suffered major or extensive flood damage, but other school districts in the area and major universities were open for class.
IRMA AT CATEGORY 5
As Houston picked up the pieces from the devastation of Harvey, a new and even more powerful hurricane was headed for the Caribbean islands, the U.S. East Coast and Florida.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Irma, which it upgraded to a ""potentially catastrophic"" Category 5 storm, was about 130 miles (210 km) east of Antigua on Tuesday afternoon. Hurricane warnings were issued for Puerto Rico, Antigua, Montserrat, St. Eustatius, the British Virgin Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Port operations along the Texas coast that service the area's oil and gas companies returned to work. At the last three of 28 Texas coast ports still closed to ship traffic, the U.S. Coast Guard said it was monitoring water currents for when shipping might resume.

U.S. gasoline prices fell on Tuesday as traders priced in a continued restart of flooded Gulf Coast refineries. Benchmark U.S. gasoline futures were lower by about 4 percent, returning to levels last seen before Harvey made landfall.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Motiva Enterprises began restarting partial production at the nation's largest crude oil refinery on Tuesday, the company said.
Motiva was ready by Tuesday morning to restart the large crude distillation unit, hydrocracker and coker at the 603,000- barrel-per-day Port Arthur, Texas, refinery shut on Aug. 30 by Tropical Storm Harvey, several sources familiar with Motiva's plans said. 
""We expect the refinery to initially return to approximately 40 percent production by the end of this weekend, provided that the final assessments meet our operational standards,"" Motiva spokeswoman Angela Goodwin said in a statement.
The company had been waiting on the restoration of shipping and pipelines to begin the partial restart, the sources said.
The time line for restarting the other units in the refinery had not been determined as charge pumps, compressors and other ground-level equipment that moves oil and other liquid hydrocarbons into production units have been underwater since heavy rains inundated the plant on Aug. 29, the source said.
A layer of oil spread over the water from a ruptured tank, the sources said.
Checking and repairing the pumps and compressors could take a month to complete, the sources said.
The area encompassing the 325,000-bpd VPS-5 crude distillation unit (CDU), 105,000-bpd hydrocracker and 110,000- bpd coker was relatively dry, enabling a quicker restart for those units, the sources said.
Those units were part of a $10 billion expansion completed in 2012 that more than doubled the refinery's crude oil processing capacity.
Water levels in other portions of the refinery were between 3 and 4 feet (0.9 and 1.2 m) deep, the sources said. 
The refinery's production units, like the CDU, hydrocracker and coker, were most likely protected by being elevated and sealed as part of their design, according to the sources.
CDUs do the initial refining of crude oil coming into a refinery and provide feedstock for all other units. 
Hydrocrackers produce motor fuels, primarily diesel, by processing gas oil under high heat and pressure in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst.
A coker converts residual crude oil into feedstock for producing motor fuels or petroleum coke, a coal substitute.

Saudi Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] took sole ownership of Motiva on May 1 after completing the planned breakup with Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) of a joint venture that operated the company for nearly 20 years.

The reputation of PDVSA - short for Petroleos de Venezuela SA - has been tarnished in recent years by graft investigations involving high-profile staff.
The company has blamed the problems on a small group of employees and executives, and promised a war on corruption.
Last year, the opposition-led congress said $11 billion was lost at PDVSA between 2004 and 2014, when Rafael Ramirez was in charge of the company. He denied the allegations.
The Caracas-based company is the financial motor of leftist President Nicolas Maduro's government, but is reeling from low oil prices, mismanagement, and lack of investments.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery rose 2.9% to settle at $48.66 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 1.70% to trade at $53.24 a barrel.
Oil prices continued to pare losses sustained last week, after oil refineries, pipelines and transportation routes across Texas and Louisiana began restarting operation, improving U.S. refinery capacity, after flooding due to Hurricane Harvey shut down nearly a quarter of refinery capacity last week.
About 2 million barrels a day, or 11% of U.S. refining capacity, remained offline on Monday, according to Commerzbank.
The largest U.S. refineries at Port Arthur, however, are not expected to return to normal capacity for at least four weeks, according to Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.
Crude oil’s strong start to the week could come under pressure, however, as analysts expect the Energy Information Agency’s report on crude inventories due Thursday to show an uptick in crude supplies following the lower demand from refiners last week.
Meanwhile, another hurricane - Irma - strengthened on Tuesday into a Category 5 hurricane – the most powerful storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale – with sustained winds of over 157 miles (253 km) per hour, fuelling concerns that the storm could veer into U.S. oil and gas platforms in the gulf.
""The expected path [of Hurricane Irma] has shifted considerably west over the last two days and can still change over the next two,"" said Olivier Jakob, founder of energy consultant Petromatrix GmbH in Zug, Switzerland. “We cannot yet rule out a move further west with a Louisiana risk.”"

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. retail gasoline prices climbed on Tuesday, even as oil refineries rumbled back into service after Hurricane Harvey disrupted operations along the Texas coast.
The average gasoline price was $2.648, 30.2 cents higher than a month ago, according to motorist advocacy group AAA. Gasoline prices normally retreat after the U.S. Labor Day holiday weekend.
Benchmark U.S. gasoline futures fell more than 3 percent, however, as refineries restarted.
Research company IIR said U.S. oil refiners would have an estimated 3.67 million barrels a day of capacity shut during the week to Sept. 8.
""The recovery from Hurricane Harvey has accelerated over the weekend, with prolonged dry weather helping the decline in flood levels,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts led by Damien Courvalin wrote. Half of shut-in refinery capacity should be back online by Thursday, Sept. 7, they said.
Harvey killed more than 60 people, dumped more than 50 inches (127 cm) of rain and damaged 203,000 homes. About a quarter of U.S. refining capacity was shuttered.
The Department of Energy had loaned more than 5 million barrels of oil from the U.S. emergency reserve to four Gulf Coast refining companies.
Motiva Enterprises could restart partial production at the largest U.S. oil refinery as early as this week, sources familiar with the plans said. The timeline for restarting full production remained uncertain, they said.
Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC). restarted a crude unit at its Texas City refinery, energy information service provider Genscape said. Petrobras began to restart its refinery in Pasadena, Texas, outside of Houston.
Late Monday, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc prepared to restart units at its Deer Park, Texas refinery.
Pipelines returned to service. Enterprise Products Partners said it restarted lines Monday; ​Colonial Pipeline Co said it planned to restart the gasoline line between Houston and Hebert, Texas on Tuesday.
Most port operations across the Gulf Coast oil and gas hub resumed, although many restricted vessel draft, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.
The number of U.S. Gulf oil and gas production platforms with evacuated personnel dropped to 14 from 30, a government agency said.
Oil companies began reporting potential earnings impacts of shuttered Eagle Ford shale drilling operations. EOG Resources Inc (NYSE:EOG) said third-quarter ‍crude and condensate volumes would be lower than expected at 320,000 to 330,000 bpd.

Meanwhile, Hurricane Irma strengthened into a highly dangerous Category 5 storm and barreled toward the Caribbean and the southern United States. Irma, which threatened deadly winds, storm surges and flooding, threatens demand recovery more than refining capacity, Goldman Sachs said.

Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
U.S. natural gas for October delivery was at $2.995 per million British thermal units by 8:20AM ET (1220GMT), down 7.5 cents, or around 2.5%. It rose to its best level since July 20 at $3.088 last Friday.

Summer heat has waned and cooler temperatures beckon with the approach of autumn, when gas demand typically slackens and prices fall.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.155 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 7.0% lower than levels at this time a year ago and less than 1.0% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Early market expectations for this week's storage data due on Thursday is for a build in a range between 58 and 67 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 1.

335,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2017 07:46AM ET</span>",Exclusive: EPA eyes limits for agricultural chemical linked to crop damage,"By Tom Polansek and Emily Flitter
(Reuters) - The U.S. environmental agency is considering banning sprayings of the agricultural herbicide dicamba after a set deadline next year, according to state officials advising the agency on its response to crop damage linked to the weed killer.
Setting a cut-off date, possibly sometime in the first half of 2018, would aim to protect plants vulnerable to dicamba, after growers across the U.S. farm belt reported the chemical drifted from where it was sprayed this summer, damaging millions of acres of soybeans and other crops.
A ban could hurt sales by  Monsanto  Co (N:MON) and DuPont (NYSE:DWDP) which sell dicamba weed killers and soybean seeds with Monsanto's dicamba-tolerant Xtend trait. BASF (DE:BASFn) also sells a dicamba herbicide.
It is not yet known how damage attributed to the herbicides, used on Xtend soybeans and cotton, will affect yields of soybeans unable to withstand dicamba because the crops have not been harvested.
    The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) discussed a deadline for next year's sprayings on a call with state officials last month that addressed steps the agency could take to prevent a repeat of the damage, four participants on the call told Reuters.
It was the latest of at least three conference calls the EPA has held with state regulators and experts since late July dedicated to dicamba-related crop damage and the first to focus on how to respond to the problem, participants said.
A cut-off date for usage in spring or early summer could protect vulnerable plants by only allowing farmers to spray fields before soybeans emerge from the ground, according to weed and pesticide specialists.
Monsanto spokeswoman Christi Dixon told Reuters on Aug. 23, the day of the last EPA call, that the agency had not indicated it planned to prohibit sprayings of dicamba herbicides on soybeans that had emerged. That action ""would not be warranted,"" she said.
The EPA had no immediate comment.
    EPA officials on the last call made clear that it would be unacceptable to see the same extent of crop damage again next year, according to Andrew Thostenson, a pesticide specialist for North Dakota State University who participated in the call.
They said ""there needed to be some significant changes for the use rules if we're going to maintain it in 2018,"" he said about dicamba usage.
State regulators and university specialists from Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa and North Dakota are pressuring the EPA to decide soon on rules guiding usage because farmers will make planting decisions for next spring over the next several months. 
Tighter usage limits could discourage cash-strapped growers from buying Monsanto's more expensive dicamba-resistant Xtend soybean seeds. Dicamba-tolerant soybeans cost about $64 a bag, compared with about $28 a bag for Monsanto's Roundup Ready soybeans and about $50 a bag for soybeans resistant to Bayer's Liberty herbicide.
Already, a task force in Arkansas has advised the state to bar dicamba sprayings after April 15 next year, which would prevent most farmers there from using dicamba on Xtend soybeans after they emerge.
Arkansas previously blocked sales of Monsanto's dicamba herbicide, XtendiMax with VaporGrip, in the state.
    ""If the EPA imposed a April 15 cut-off date for dicamba spraying, that would be catastrophic for Xtend - it invalidates the entire point of planting it,"" said Jonas Oxgaard, analyst for investment management firm Bernstein.
Monsanto has projected its Xtend crop system would return a $5 to $10 premium per acre over soybeans with glyphosate resistance alone, creating a $400-$800 million opportunity for the company once the seeds are planted on an expected 80 million acres in the United States, according to Oxgaard.
By 2019, Monsanto predicts U.S. farmers will plant Xtend soybeans on 55 million acres, or more than 60 percent of the total planted this year. 
RISKY DRIFT 
About 3.1 million acres of soybeans vulnerable to dicamba were hurt by sprayings this summer, accounting for 3.5 percent of U.S. plantings, according to the University of Missouri. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2feVSxz)
Chemical companies have blamed the crop damage on farmers misusing the herbicides. 
Specialists, though, say the weed killers are also risky because they have a tendency to vaporize and drift across fields, referred to as volatility. Summer can be a riskier time for sprayings, they said, because high temperatures can increase volatility.
Monsanto previously denied requests by university researchers to study its XtendiMax herbicide for volatility, as previously reported by Reuters. In the end, the EPA gave dicamba weed killers from Monsanto and BASF abridged two-year registrations, less than the five years experts say is more common.
To address the crop damage, the EPA has also asked state officials about enhanced training for dicamba users; tighter restrictions on when and how the herbicides can be sprayed; and the possibility of reclassifying the products so the general public could not buy them, according to participants on the call. 
""Everything is an option,"" said Jason Norsworthy, a University of Arkansas professor who was on the call. 
    Monsanto Chief Technology Officer Robb Fraley said in a statement that the company was communicating with the EPA, which is ""evaluating potential actions to facilitate enhanced training and compliance for 2018.""
DuPont, too, is working with the EPA and state regulators on issues involving its dicamba herbicide, FeXapan, spokeswoman Laura Svec said. 
Rival BASF ""could see some label enhancements"" to its dicamba herbicide, Engenia, if the EPA requires changes, spokeswoman Odessa Hines told Reuters. The company ""will be as flexible as possible"" so farmers can use the product, she said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Texas takes another step toward recovery from Hurricane Harvey on Tuesday when many residents return to work for the first time since the storm devastated the Houston area, killing around 60 people and putting tens of thousands into emergency shelters. Many large Texas employers, universities and transit services are reopening or beginning full service on Tuesday after Labor Day, some for the first time since Harvey struck the state on Aug. 25.
Oil refineries, pipelines and shipping channels in the nation’s energy center have begun a gradual return of operations.  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM), Halliburton (N:HAL) and  Chevron  (N:CVX) are among the scores of Houston businesses reopening their doors to office workers. Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi and the University of Houston also are resuming classes Tuesday. 
The storm first hit Corpus Christi in the south and traveled up the coast, dumping up to 51 inches (129 cm) of rain in places across the region and flooding homes and businesses.
Texas residents who fled to Austin, San Antonio and Dallas ahead of the storm returned to check on their homes as flooded streets drained. 
In Houston, travel north and east of the city eased over the weekend and highways filled as more gasoline stations opened and supplies, while tight, proved adequate. 
Exxon said its Spring, Texas, campus was unaffected by the heavy rains. But employees who need to work remotely are encouraged to do so, spokeswoman Suann Guthrie said. 
Houston Metro, a regional transit provider, said it would open all its parking lots and rush-hour lanes on Tuesday. 
Most roads have reopened but travel in some areas west of the city remains difficult. ConocoPhillips’ (N:COP) headquarters on the west side is closed until Sept. 11 due to flooded roads.
Houston’s school district, the seventh largest in the nation, also remains closed this week to repair flooded schools. The district has said about 75 of its 275 schools suffered major or extensive flood damage.
As Houston picked up the pieces from the devastation of Harvey, a new hurricane threat appeared, this time headed for the Caribbean islands, the U.S. East Coast and Florida.
Hurricane Irma was upgraded to a powerful Category 4 storm on Monday as islands in its path braced for its impact. Hurricane advisories were issued for territories that dot the West Indies, including parts of the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in preparation for the storm.
ENERGY SECTOR
In Texas, shipping channels, oil pipelines and refineries restarted some operations on Monday and authorities lifted an evacuation order for the area around a once-burning chemical plant.
Port operations across the U.S. Gulf Coast oil and gas hub were resuming, although many still had restrictions on vessel draft, according to U.S. Coast Guard updates.
U.S. gasoline prices fell in expectation that the area can get back on its feet after Harvey cut a path of destruction across more than 300 miles (480 km). Benchmark U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) fell by more than 3 percent on Monday.
The Coast Guard allowed some barge traffic to enter Port Arthur, Texas, home of the country's largest oil refinery, and is considering allowing ships to enter on Tuesday, a spokesman said.
Flooding from Harvey caused fires at the  Arkema  SA (PA:AKE) chemical plant in Crosby, some 25 miles (40 km) northeast of Houston. 
But on Monday, the company said the Crosby Fire Department had lifted a 1.5-mile (2.4-km) evacuation zone around the plant, allowing people to return to their homes.
The lifting of the order may help residents like Paul Mincey, a 31-year-old tugboat engineer who has been kept out of the ranch home he shares with his girlfriend, return to normal.
""It could be full of snakes for all we know. We have no idea what's in there,"" Mincey said from aboard a tugboat in the Houston Ship Channel, which he said was polluted by floating railroad ties, trees and trash strewn by the storm.
HOW TO PAY?
The question of how to pay for hurricane recovery became more urgent in Washington after Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Sunday increased his damage estimate to between $150 billion and $180 billion.
Republicans and Democrats returning to Washington on Tuesday after a month-long break will need to put differences aside in order to approve an aid package. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin challenged Congress to raise the government's debt limit in order to free up relief spending.
The U.S. House of Representatives will vote Wednesday on $7.85 billion in emergency relief funds for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Small Business Administration and plans another vote later this month on a separate $6.7 billion sought by President Donald Trump.
The Texas Department of Public Safety on Monday estimated damage to public property at $382.3 million. Some 190,000 homes were damaged and another 13,500 destroyed, the Texas Department of Public Safety said.

(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma, barreling toward the Caribbean and the southern United States, was upgraded to a powerful Category 4 storm on Monday as islands in its path braced for a possible onslaught.
Hurricane advisories were issued for territories that dot the West Indies, including parts of the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, in preparation for the intensifying storm that could pummel the area with life-threatening wind, storm surges and torrential rain by Tuesday evening, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC).
Ahed Daas, owner of the Food Center in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, said traffic at his store on Monday was about 50 percent higher than normal as people stocked up on water, canned products and batteries. Since it is the off-season for tourists, almost all the customers are local and there were few liquor sales.
People began to shop as early as last week as Irma neared and continued through the weekend.
""It’s kind of dwindling down now, everybody’s pretty much stocked up,"" Daas said. ""You make sure you have fuel in your generator and hope it’s not that bad when it does arrive.""
A Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale means sustained winds of 130-156 miles per hour (209-251 kph) with ""catastrophic"" outcomes, including uprooted trees and downed power lines, water and electricity outages, and significant property damage causing uninhabitable conditions, according to the Miami-based hurricane center.
Irma, now packing 140 mph (220 kph) winds, also threatens the U.S. East Coast and Florida, which on Monday evening declared a state of emergency. The hurricane center expects Irma to reach southern Florida on Saturday.
The NHC cautioned that it was too early to forecast the storm's exact path or what effects it might have on the continental United States, but warned of likely effects to hit some areas by later this week.
""There is an increasing chance of seeing some impacts from Irma in the Florida Peninsula and the Florida Keys later this week and this weekend. In addition, rough surf and dangerous marine conditions will begin to affect the southeastern U.S. coast by later this week,"" the center said.
Irma will be the second powerful hurricane to thrash the United States and its territories in as many weeks.
Residents of Texas and Louisiana are still reeling from the catastrophic effects of the deadly Hurricane Harvey, which struck Texas as a Category 4 hurricane on Aug. 25 and dumped several feet of rain, destroying thousands of homes and businesses.
Irma is forecast to strengthen over the next 48 hours and could ""directly affect Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and Cuba as a dangerous major hurricane later this week,"" the NHC said.
In preparation for the storm, the government of economically struggling Puerto Rico on Monday declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard.
""Despite the economic challenges Puerto Rico is facing, the approved budget has $15 million for the emergency fund,"" Governor Ricardo Rosselló said in a statement.
The U.S. island territory, home to about 3.4 million people, has 456 emergency shelters prepared to house up to 62,100 people.
To help residents prepare for the storm, Puerto Rico activated a price freeze on basic necessities, including food and water, medicines, power generators and batteries.
Telemundo TV station WIPR in Puerto Rico showed long lines of shoppers stocking up on bottled water, flashlights, batteries, generators, food and other items.
The executive director of the state power authority, Ricardo Ramos, told the station that the power grid was so vulnerable from lack of investment that parts of the U.S. territory could be without power for three to four months.
""We're preparing for the worst-case scenario,"" he said.

Comex gold futures rose 0.80% to $1,341.04 a troy ounce on the Comex. Speculation has grown that North Korea may test an ICBM on Sept. 9, the annibversary of the founding on the nation.
elsewhere, the China Caixin services PMI jumped to 52.7, well above the 51.8 level expected, the private survey released on Tuesday showed, aiding sentiment of a consumer-led rebound.
Earlier this month, the Caixin manufacturing PMI jumped in August to 51.6, beating a 50.9 level expected, data showed on Friday, showing the fastest pace of new orders in three years.
The figure follows the official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index from China on Thursday came in at 51.7 in August, beating expectations. Analysts polled by Reuters expected China to post official PMI of 51.3 for August, a tick down from 51.4 in July. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below that signals contraction.
Overnight, gold prices hovered at one-year highs on Monday, as fresh threats by North Korea sparked concerns over a potential conflict in the region and boosted demand for safer assets.
Demand for the safe-haven metal was boosted after North Korea said on Sunday that it had conducted a test of a hydrogen bomb intended to be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile.
Pyongyang called the test a complete success, with a greater yield than previous tests and no adverse impact on the environment.
The news prompted U.S. to warn of a ""massive"" military response if it or its allies were threatened.
U.S. President Donald Trump also threatened to cut off trade with any country doing business with North Korea.
Gold prices also benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar after the U.S. Labor Department reported on Friday that the economy added 156,000 jobs in August from the prior month, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%.
Economists had expected 180,000 new jobs and an unemployment rate of 4.3%.
The report indicated that the Fed may be more reluctant to raise interest rates again before the end of the year.
Gold is sensitive to moves in the dollar. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude October contract rose 0.19% to $47.38 a barrel. Elsewhere, Brent oil for October delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London fell 0.10% to $52.17 a barrel.
Overnight, U.S. oil futures moved higher on Monday, as refinery activity slowly resumed on the Gulf Coast, although investors were still trying to assess the long term damage of Hurricane Harvey on the U.S. petroleum industry.
Two key fuel pipelines were set to start up on Monday after certain segments in Texas were shut because of storm system Harvey, helping alleviate concerns about rising retail prices and the domestic distribution of gasoline and distillates.
Affected oil output is down significantly from the peak of around 25%, or 428,568 bpd, on August 26 as evacuated workers returned and activity resumed.
Still, many analysts say it could take months before the U.S. petroleum industry fully recovers from Harvey.
About 5.5% of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico's oil production, or 96,000 barrels of daily output, remained shut on Sunday after Harvey made landfall in Texas more than a week ago.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Texas on Monday edged toward recovery from the devastation of Hurricane Harvey as shipping channels, oil pipelines and refineries restarted some operations and authorities lifted an evacuation order for the area around a once-burning chemical plant.
Port operations across the U.S. Gulf Coast oil and gas hub were resuming, although many still had restrictions on vessel draft, according to U.S. Coast Guard updates.
U.S. gasoline prices fell in expectation that the area can get back on its feet after Harvey cut a path of destruction across more than 300 miles (480 km). The storm's record rains and flooding killed as many as 60 people, according to local officials, and displaced more than 1 million. Benchmark U.S. gasoline futures fell by more than 3 percent on Monday.
The Coast Guard allowed some barge traffic to enter Port Arthur, Texas, home of the country's largest oil refinery, and is considering allowing ships to enter on Tuesday, a spokesman said.
Flooding from Harvey caused fires at the Arkema SA chemical plant in Crosby, some 25 miles (40 km) northeast of Houston. 
But on Monday, the company said the Crosby Fire Department had lifted a 1.5-mile (2.4-km) evacuation zone around the plant, allowing people to return to their homes.
The lifting of the order may help residents like Paul Mincey, a 31-year-old tugboat engineer who has been kept out of the ranch home he shares with his girlfriend, return to normal.
""It could be full of snakes for all we know. We have no idea what's in there,"" Mincey said from aboard a tugboat in the Houston Ship Channel, which he said was polluted by floating railroad ties, trees and trash strewn by the storm.
Like others forced from the evacuation zone, Mincey said he was eager to assess water damage and begin repairs while hoping for financial aid to deal with property damage.

ANOTHER HURRICANE THREATENS
As the recovery from Harvey picked up speed, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard in preparation Irma, a dangerous Category 4 hurricane closing in on a string of Caribbean islands. 
Irma could pummel the U.S. territory on Wednesday and it also poses a threat later in the week to the Dominican Republic, Cuba and Florida, which declared a state of emergency on Monday evening.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center cautioned that it was too early to forecast the storm's exact path or what effect it might have on the U.S. mainland. But some weather models show Irma entering the Gulf of Mexico, where Harvey dealt a major blow to the most important energy hub in the United States, taking up to one-fourth of the country's oil refining capacity offline and driving up fuel prices.
Colonial Pipeline Co on Monday said it restarted one of its fuel lines shut because of Hurricane Harvey, with another line scheduled to restart on Tuesday. 
Colonial is the biggest U.S. fuel system, with pipelines that connect refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast to markets in the Northeast, transporting more than 3 million barrels a day of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. With more pipelines coming on line, concerns about supply should ease.
Most ports in Texas were open on Monday, some with restrictions on traffic and vessel size, said Colonel Lars Zetterstrom, head of the Army Corps of Engineers' regional office in Galveston.

HOW TO PAY?
The question of how to pay for hurricane recovery was consuming Washington after Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Sunday increased his damage estimate to between $150 billion and $180 billion.
Abbott on Monday requested seven additional Texas counties be added to the Federal Disaster Declaration previously granted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). That would bring the total number of counties receiving assistance to 43. 
Some 190,000 homes were damaged and another 13,500 destroyed, the Texas Department of Public Safety said.
At least 33,000 people sought refuge in Texas shelters overnight, with another 1,300 doing so in Louisiana, the American Red Cross said.
Republicans and Democrats returning to Washington after a month-long break will need to put differences aside in order to approve an aid package. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday challenged Congress to raise the government's debt limit in order to free up relief spending.
The U.S. House of Representatives will vote Wednesday on $7.85 billion in emergency relief funds for the FEMA and the Small Business Administration and plans another vote later this month on a separate $6.7 billion sought by President Donald Trump.
In one indication of funding needs, the Texas Department of Public Safety on Monday estimated damage to public property at $382.3 million.

343,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2017 06:10PM ET</span>",Electric cars and renewables not enough to meet Paris climate goal: consultant,"By Karolin Schaps
ARNHEM, The Netherlands (Reuters) - The cost of electric vehicles (EVs) will fall to match those running on combustion engines by 2022, a key trigger that will mean by 2035 half of all passenger vehicles sold globally will be electric, according to the head of a top energy consultancy.
But this expected exponential rise in cleaner vehicles, coupled with booming renewable energy production, will not be enough to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting climate warming, Ditlev Engel, chief executive of DNV GL's energy consulting business, told Reuters in an interview. 
""The trends are very clear that the world is electrifying, renewables are taking up more space, we're moving into a world of EVs, but we have to remember we are racing against the clock. It's not enough,"" said Engel, whose 2,300 staff advise companies and governments on energy issues.
He said, on current projections, the world would not achieve the goal of limiting the earth's warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius by 2050, as pledged in the 2015 Paris Agreement.
""Anything you can substitute today, you've got to accelerate. The speed of implementation must be even faster and this can only happen if the public and private sectors coordinate,"" he said at the company's energy business headquarters in Arnhem, the Netherlands.
On the back of the U.N.-led Paris agreement, governments have started announcing policies aimed at reducing climate-harming carbon emissions, such as Britain pledging a ban on new diesel and petrol car sales by 2040.
DNV GL expects energy demand will peak around 2030 due to more efficient use and slower population and productivity growth, it said in its first report assessing the impact of the transition toward greater electrification.
Growing electricity production will be the main driver for more efficient energy use as consumers move away from low-efficiency fossil fuels, with power output expected to soar by 140 percent by the middle of the century. 
As a result, renewable energy sources will account for 85 percent of global electricity production by 2050, DNV GL forecasts.
Despite the rise in renewable energy, it is gas that will overtake oil as the world's biggest energy source by 2034, the consultancy said, a trend that is reflected in an investment shift at major oil companies toward new gas projects. 

This thinking underpinned, for example, Royal Dutch Shell's $54 billion takeover of BG Group last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline prices fell on Monday as the nation's oil heartland continued to claw its way back from the devastation wrought by Storm Harvey, with shipping channels, pipelines and refineries restarting operations.
Port operations across the U.S. Gulf Coast oil and gas hub were resuming, although many still had restrictions on vessel draft, according to U.S. Coast Guard updates.
Key fuel pipelines planned to restart as more of the oil refineries that feed them ramped up production.
Benchmark U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) fell by more than 3 percent, and retail prices edged up by only 1 cent a gallon on Monday, according to motorists advocacy group AAA, after climbing by more than 20 cents in the wake of Harvey, which was downgraded to a storm after making landfall as a hurricane.
Harvey dumped as much as 50 inches (127 cm) of rain over Texas and Louisiana, forcing officials to close or restrict operations at ports from Corpus Christi, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana. It also forced the closure of nearly a quarter of the nation's oil refining capacity.
The U.S. Coast Guard on Monday allowed some barge traffic to enter Port Arthur, Texas, home of the country's largest oil refinery, and is considering allowing ships to enter on Tuesday, a spokesman said.
Port Arthur was one of three Texas ports that was still closed, along with Beaumont and Port Orange. The state's 25 other ports were operational as of Monday, some with restrictions, according to Colonel Lars Zetterstrom, Galveston District commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
Alberto Hernandez, a watch supervisor at the U.S. Coast Guard, said on Monday that ships were exiting and entering the Houston Ship Channel, which links the Port of Houston, the busiest petrochemical port, to the Gulf of Mexico. 
The channel is open to just past  Exxon Mobil  Corp's (N:XOM) Baytown refinery to vessels up to a 40-foot (12-meter) draft, while salvage efforts continued to remove a sunken drydock in an industrial portion, officials said.
Hernandez said there was no time frame for removing the drydock debris from the main stem of the channel, which is key to moving crude oil to refineries. 
Restarts of pipelines that move fuel from refineries to the rest of the nation also were alleviating worries about shortages.
Colonial Pipeline Co , which transports more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from Gulf Coast refineries to Northeastern markets, said the restart on Monday afternoon of its main distillate line between Houston and Hebert, Texas, would take ""a few hours."" It plans the same restart process for the gasoline line between those points on Tuesday. 
The Explorer Pipeline planned to reopen its 24-inch (61 cm) Oklahoma-to-Midwest fuel pipeline on Monday after reopening its 28-inch (71 cm) Texas-to-Oklahoma line on Sunday.
ExxonMobil said on Monday its pipeline division was initiating supply of gasoline and other fuels to the Houston area after making ""significant progress"" on restarting the lines.
Fuels-producing refineries also were ramping up output.  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO) was restarting multiple units at its 335,000 bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery on Monday, according to regulatory filings, and the company said its 293,000 bpd Corpus Christi and 225,000-bpd Texas City refineries were back to pre-storm levels of production. 
ExxonMobil's 560,500-bpd Baytown, Texas, refinery, the nation's second-largest, began restarting during the weekend, while Phillips 66 (N:PSX) said it was resuming operations at its 247,000-bpd Sweeny refinery. 
Crude oil operations were also edging back to normal. ConocoPhillips (N:COP) said its oil production in the Eagle Ford shale region was expected to reach 80 percent of its pre-storm level of 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by Monday evening, while the number of U.S. Gulf oil and gas production platforms with evacuated personnel after Hurricane Harvey dropped to 14, down from 30, according to the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

Still, the bureau said the total of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production closed increased to roughly 6.94 percent, or 121,484 bpd, up from 5.5 percent on Sunday. It did not give a reason for the increase.

Demand for natural gas tends to rise in the summer months as warmer temperatures increase the need for gas-fired electricity to power air conditioning.
But with autumn due to start on September 22, power burns to feed air conditioning demand have probably peaked for now, market analysts said.
U.S. natural gas for October delivery was at $3.039 per million British thermal units by 8:25AM ET (1225GMT), down 3.1 cents, or around 1%.
It rose about 6.2% last week as energy markets weighed what the impact of storm system Harvey will be on supply and demand.
Trade volumes were expected to remain light on Monday, with many investors in the U.S. away for the Labor Day holiday. Trading in natural gas ends at 1:00PM ET (1700GMT), while U.S. stock markets are closed for trading all day.
Summer heat has waned and cooler temperatures beckon with the approach of autumn, when gas demand typically slackens and prices fall.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.155 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 7.0% lower than levels at this time a year ago and less than 1.0% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Early market expectations for this week's storage data due on Thursday is for a build in a range between 58 and 67 billion cubic feet in the week ended September 1.

Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures climbed 12.3 cents, or around 0.7%, to $17.93 a troy ounce, the strongest level since April 25.
North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test to date on Sunday, which it said was a successful detonation of an advanced hydrogen bomb, in a dramatic escalation of the isolated state's stand-off with the U.S. and its allies.
In response to the nuclear test, U.S. President Donald Trump refused to rule out military action and threatened to cut off trade with any country doing business with the reclusive state. The move, if implemented, would likely affect China, North Korea's most important trading partner.
The United Nations Security Council is poised to hold an emergency meeting later on Monday to discuss its response.
Global markets were shaken last month after President Donald Trump cautioned that North Korea would be met with ""fire and fury"" if it continued to make threats against the U.S.
Pyongyang responded by saying it was considering a strike on Guam, a U.S. territory, although it later somewhat backed down.
The escalating tensions prompted investors to dump assets seen as riskier, such as stocks and high yielding currencies, and flock to traditional safe-haven assets like the yen, Swiss franc and bullion.
Meanwhile, markets continued to digest weaker-than-expected U.S. employment data released on Friday, which kept expectations muted for another interest rate hike this year.
Data showed the U.S. economy added 156,000 jobs in August, below forecasts for 180,000. The unemployment rate edged up to 4.4% and average hourly earnings increased just 0.1%, below the 0.2% rise expected.
Markets remain skeptical the Fed will raise rates a third time this year due to worries over the subdued inflation outlook, but it is widely expected to start the process of reducing its balance sheet sometime this fall.
The dollar index was at 92.60, down 0.3% from late U.S. trade on Friday.
Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Two key fuel pipelines were set to start up on Monday after certain segments in Texas were shut because of Hurricane Harvey, helping alleviate concerns about rising retail prices and the domestic distribution of gasoline and distillates. 
Colonial Pipeline Co, the biggest U.S. fuel system, said on Sunday it planned to reopen the main distillate line between Houston and Hebert, Texas, on Monday, and the gasoline line between those two points on Tuesday. The company had initially aimed to restart both its lines by Sunday.
The company's pipelines connect refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast to markets in the Northeast, transporting more than 3 million barrels a day of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.
Explorer Pipeline said late on Sunday that its Texas-to-Oklahoma 28-inch fuel pipeline started up as expected. Its 24-inch fuel pipeline, which will run from Oklahoma into the U.S. Midwest, will restart on Monday. 
The return of supply eased some concerns after the storm took down nearly a quarter of U.S. oil refining capacity, hit oil and gas platforms along the Gulf and lifted average gasoline prices by more than 20 cents since Aug. 23. 
U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) fell by 3 percent in early trade on Sunday. Futures prices had traded at a two-year high on fears of supply shortages. Gasoline margins  were down 9 percent. 
Colonial is also petitioning the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to allow it to move so-called transitionary gasoline, a grade between summer and winter blend, which would ease the supply crunch.
On Sunday, average retail prices rose again, to $2.621 a gallon, with weekly increases hitting 18 percent in Georgia and 19 percent in South Carolina, according to motorists advocacy group AAA.
The hurricane battered Texas before weakening to a tropical storm and inundated the region with torrential rains and flooding. Several refineries, terminals, drilling platforms and other facilities were working to restart or return to normal operations on Sunday.
About 5.5 percent of the Gulf's oil production and 8.4 percent of the natural gas output remained shut, the federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said, while operators began inspecting facilities and resuming work.
The total lost production in the Gulf since platforms started shutting is about 2.97 million barrels of oil and 6.35 billion cubic feet of gas.
ExxonMobil Corp (N:XOM) said on Sunday that its Hadrian South subsea production system and Galveston 209 platform in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico were back online after shutting because of Harvey. 
The firm had said over the weekend that it began restarting the country's second-largest oil facility, the 560,500-barrel- per-day Baytown, Texas, refinery, while Phillips 66 (N:PSX) said it was working to resume operations at its 247,000-bpd Sweeny refinery.
Pipelines and terminals have also been restarting over the weekend, assuaging worries over the ability of refineries to get the crude oil they need to operate. 

Still, several Texas ports remained closed to large vessels, limiting discharge of imported crude and products.

Last week, gold prices remained close to nine-and-a-half-month highs on Friday, shrugging off a rebound in the dollar, as a weak nonfarm payrolls report fuelled demand for the precious metal.
Gold pared some its gains, following its move to a nine-and-half-month high, as market participants downplayed the impact weak job and wage growth in August could have on the Federal Reserve’s plans to hike rates later this year.
The U.S. economy created 156,000 jobs in August, missing consensus estimates for the creation of 180,000 jobs.
The jobless rate unexpectedly rose in August to 4.4% while average hourly earnings fell short of expectations, slowing to 0.1% from 0.3% in the prior month.
“The headline number was weaker than the consensus, but not weak enough to change the Fed’s stance on rates. Also, August is notorious for statisticians to get it right and numbers are usually revised higher afterward. Investors take it with a grain of salt,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange.
Gold is sensitive to moves lower in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A lower dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency while a fall in U.S. rates, reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Gold prices have spiked higher in recent weeks as ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Korean peninsula continued to fuel safe-haven demand.
Net bullish bets on gold rose to 208,004, the highest in nine-months, according to a report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released last week.

356,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 03, 2017 05:12AM ET</span>",Crude oil futures - weekly outlook: September 4 - 8,"Investing.com - Oil prices ended a bit higher on Friday, but still posted a weekly loss as energy markets continued to weigh what the impact of Harvey will be on crude production and refinery demand in the Gulf of Mexico region.
Gasoline futures, meanwhile, eased back, but posted its strongest weekly gain since the end of February, as refinery output remained crippled in the wake of the storm.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude October contract tacked on 6 cents, or around 0.1%, to end at $47.29 a barrel by close of trade. It fell to its lowest since July 24 at $45.58 on Thursday, before clawing back losses to end the session up about 2.8%.
The rise in oil prices late in the week failed to offset losses sustained earlier, as U.S. crude futures slipped to their fifth-straight weekly loss, ending the week down 58 cents, or nearly 1.2%.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for November delivery slipped 11 cents, or roughly 0.2%, to settle at $52.75 a barrel.
The global benchmark closed the week with a gain of 34 cents, or around 0.6%, after scoring a rise of 4.2% on Thursday.
Meanwhile, U.S. gasoline hit a two-year high above $2 a gallon on Thursday, but eased back on Friday. The September futures contract settled up 25.5 cents, or 13.5%, at $2.139 on the last day of trading in the contract on Thursday.
Gasoline for October opened much lower on Friday, at $1.774 a gallon. It ended the day down 3.1 cents, or about 1.8%, to settle at $1.747.
Despite Friday's decline, gasoline prices closed around 13.4% higher for the week.
Exactly a week after Harvey crossed the Gulf of Mexico off Port O'Connor, Texas, nearly a quarter of U.S. refining capacity has been taken offline, representing roughly 4.4 million barrels per day, weighing on demand for crude oil, the primary input at refineries.
More than 45% of the nation’s petroleum refining capacity is located along the Gulf Coast, according to the Energy Information Administration.
The devastating impact of the storm on oil infrastructure in the heartland of the U.S. energy industry, prompted the government to tap its strategic supplies and release 1 million barrels of crude oil to support refinery activity, as fears over fuel shortages remain front and center.
Falling crude prices have weighed on U.S. drilling activity over recent weeks, as data from oilfield services firm Baker Hughes showed the number of U.S. oil rigs held steady at 759 last week.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Oil prices have been under pressure in recent weeks as concern over rising U.S. shale output canceled out production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, agreed since the start of the year to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018 in order to reduce a global supply glut and rebalance the market.
So far, the deal has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, as well as a relentless increase in U.S. shale output.
Elsewhere, October heating oil edged up around half a cent, or 0.3%, to $1.746 a gallon, ending around 7.7% higher on the week.
Natural gas futures for October delivery advanced 3.0 cents, or 1%, to settle at $3.070 per million British thermal units. It rose about 6.2% for the week.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Wednesday and Thursday to weigh what the impact of Harvey was on supply and demand.
The reports come out one day later than usual due to the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.

358,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2017 09:57PM ET</span>",Texas refineries begin restart after hit from Harvey,"By Ernest Scheyder and Catherine Ngai
HOUSTON (Reuters) - A number of key Texas refineries worked to reopen or resume normal operations on Saturday, a week after Hurricane Harvey knocked out nearly one quarter of the U.S. refining capacity and sent gasoline prices to two-year highs. 
While much of the region's refining infrastructure still remained offline from Harvey, which made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane last week and drenched Texas as a tropical storm, the restarts were a first step in alleviating concerns about U.S. fuel supplies. 
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) said it was restarting its 560,500 barrel per day (bpd) facility in Baytown, Texas, the second-biggest U.S. oil refinery, after it was inundated by flooding. 
Phillips 66 (N:PSX) said it was working to resume operations at its 247,000 bpd Sweeny refinery as well as its Beaumont terminal.
The announcements come after  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO) said late on Friday it was ramping up production at its Corpus Christi, Texas-area refineries, as well as evaluating its 335,000 bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery for damage from Harvey. The refinery was shut on Wednesday. 
Retail gasoline prices have risen more than 17.5 cents since Aug. 23, before Harvey hit, amid worries the storm would trigger supply shortages. 
Pump prices were at $2.59 a gallon on Saturday, according to motorists advocacy group AAA, up 3 percent from Friday and 16.7 percent higher on average than a year ago.
POWER CUTS
In another positive sign for the industry, Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) said it had loaded and shipped the first crude cargo from its Ingleside terminal in Corpus Christi after Hurricane Harvey first made landfall. 
The Port of Corpus Christi, a major energy industry shipping hub, was partially open and hoped to resume normal operations next week, officials said.
But much energy infrastructure remained offline, including the largest U.S. refinery, the 603,000 bpd facility in Port Arthur, Texas, owned by Motiva Enterprises LLC[MOTIV.UL]. Motiva has told customers to prepare for fuel shortages, said a source at convenience store and gas station chain Circle K.
In some Texas cities, including Dallas, there were long lines at gas stations on Friday.
At a QMart filling station west of Houston on Saturday, cars were clogging the pumps soon after a tanker arrived to replenish its pumps. 
""We had a half a tank, but decided to get more, just in case,"" said Maria Linares, a school teacher whose husband was topping their car's tank.
The Phillips 66 brand station has not raised its fuel prices since before Harvey, said Assistant Manager Jalal Sadruddin, by policy of the station owner, Q-Mart.
""Right now, we have about 4,000 gallons, maybe two or three days' worth,"" he said. The station received a tanker load of gasoline on Saturday but was out of diesel, he said. An Exxon brand station across the street was out of fuel. 
""In all this area, no one has it but us,"" Sadruddin said. 
Nearly half of U.S. refining capacity is in the Gulf Coast region, an area with proximity to plentiful supplies from Texas oil fields to Mexican and Venezuelan oil imports. The majority of Texas ports remained closed to large vessels, limiting discharge of imported crude.
The reduced availability of fuel forced the Colonial Pipeline, which provides fuel from refineries near the Gulf of Mexico to the U.S. Northeast, to reduce supplies. 
But some oil pipelines had restarted, easing the constraint. Magellan Midstream Partners (N:MMP) announced late on Friday that it resumed operations on its BridgeTex and Longhorn crude oil pipelines. The two pipelines transport around 675,000 bpd of West Texas crude to East Houston.
The company said its refined products pipeline system originating at East Houston has resumed service and will deliver gasoline and diesel to the Dallas and West Texas area. 

Phillips 66 also said its Pasadena refined products terminal would resume truck loading for gasoline and diesel this weekend.

The company said it began initial restart of the 560,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baytown refinery on Friday night.
Sources familiar with plant operations said the refinery was preparing to resume production but it was unknown when production would resume. 
Exxon spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker said an initial assessment revealed only minor repairs were needed at Baytown.
""We are making good progress on restart activities,"" Huffaker said. ""Timing on when operations can resume to normal will largely depend on the availability of transportation infrastructure.
""We are working with the Port of Houston to expedite vessels through the Houston Ship Channel and we are coordinating with railroads to help facilitate necessary repairs.""

The sources said the closure of the upper Houston Ship Channel has not only cut off waterborne crude shipments from coming in but refined products shipment from going out along the waterway to the Gulf of Mexico.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2017 04:10PM ET</span>",Harvey's wake tempers bullish outlook for U.S. oil output growth,"By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Damage and delays from Tropical Storm Harvey will hold the U.S. oil industry back from achieving a targeted 10 million barrels per day of production anytime soon, according to analysts, a setback in America's fight for global market share with OPEC.
The storm, which flooded refineries, wells and pipelines across Texas, added to a string of problems oil companies already faced, like low crude prices and expensive engineering challenges at new shale wells.
Earlier this year, oil analysts and some company executives had anticipated that the United States could top the 10 million bpd mark by year-end. That would have been a 14 percent increase, taking U.S. output to a level not seen since the 1970s.
But then Harvey knocked out about a quarter of U.S. refining capacity and shuttered transport routes for crude, gasoline, diesel and other products. The storm's impacts sent gasoline prices soaring but also crimped demand for crude.
Bringing all that infrastructure back to normal operations could take weeks or months.
""Harvey is going to have a longer effect on the oil industry than anyone would have imagined,"" said Dan Katzenberg, an oil industry analyst at R.W. Baird & Co. ""It's just a real mess on so many levels.""
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is frustrated that the storm has not pushed global prices higher, with one OPEC delegate telling Reuters, ""It seems no event will move the oil price up much.""
Slipping production after a major storm is not unprecedented: U.S. output slipped after Hurricane Dennis in 1999, Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, forcing a range of industry and government reactions.
On Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said he had authorized the release of 4.5 million barrels from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The move, aimed at helping a handful of Gulf Coast refiners deal with local supply disruptions, will likely depress oil prices further.
FINANCIAL STRAINS 
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) earlier this year had forecast that technological and process improvements would lift U.S. production sharply, leading some analysts and executives to predict 10 million bpd by December.
But in recent months those expectations dimmed. Producers, showing signs of financial strain from the tepid oil prices, pared budgets for the year. 
Companies also face problems with pressure imbalance and high natural gas levels at new shale oil wells in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield.
The EIA on Thursday revised lower its data on U.S. oil production for June, saying it fell nearly 1 percent in the month to about 9.1 million bpd. Analysts called that a bad omen for the rest of the summer. 
Harvey forced  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L:RDSa),  Marathon Oil  Corp (N:MRO),  Statoil  ASA (OL:STL) and other producers in the Eagle Ford shale region of Texas and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to halt production and the drilling and fracking of shale wells.
More than a quarter of Gulf production went offline due to the storm, according to government data. In the Eagle Ford shale, producers on Friday were still assessing damage, but most saw operations slow or grind to a halt.
""At this point, we're really waiting to see what the cumulative effect will be"" from Harvey, said Paul Hesse of the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
Exxon lost nearly 100,000 bpd of production, and Shell has so far lost more than 700,000 bpd.
ConocoPhillips (N:COP), meanwhile, said it does not plan to reopen its headquarters, which abuts a Houston reservoir that nearly breached, until Sept. 11. 

""That 10 million (bpd) level is just not going to happen in the next two years at least,"" said Anas Alhajji, an independent oil analyst and economist. ""The impact of Harvey adds to existing woes.""

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $7.64, or 0.58%, to $1,329.25 a troy ounce.
Gold pared some its gains, following its move to a nine-and-half-month high, as market participants downplayed the impact weak job and wage growth in August could have on the Federal Reserve’s plans to hike rates later this year.
The U.S. economy created 156,000 jobs in August, missing consensus estimates for the creation of 180,000 jobs.
The jobless rate unexpectedly rose in August to 4.4% while average hourly earnings fell short of expectations, slowing to 0.1% from 0.3% in the prior month.
“The headline number was weaker than the consensus, but not weak enough to change the Fed’s stance on rates. Also, August is notorious for statisticians to get it right and numbers are usually revised higher afterward. Investors take it with a grain of salt,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange.
Gold is sensitive to moves lower in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A lower dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency while a fall in U.S. rates, reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Gold prices have spiked higher in recent weeks as ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Korean peninsula continued to fuel safe-haven demand.
Net bullish bets on gold rose to 208,004, the highest in nine-months, according to a report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released last week.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures rose 1.23% to $17.70 an ounce while platinum futures rose 1.11% to $1,009 an ounce.
Copper traded at $3.12, up 0.73% while natural gas futures added 0.69% to $3.06.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery rose 6 cents to settle at $47.29 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent sank 27 cents to trade at $29 a barrel.
Exactly a week after Tropical Storm Harvey crossed the Gulf of Mexico off Port O'Connor, Texas, nearly a quarter of U.S. refining capacity has been taken offline, representing roughly 4.4 million barrels per day, weighing on demand for crude oil, the primary input at refineries.
More than 45% of the nation’s petroleum refining capacity is located along the Gulf Coast, as well as 51% of U.S. natural-gas, processing plant capacity, according to the EIA.
The devastating impact of the storm on oil infrastructure in the heartland of the U.S. energy industry, prompted the government to tap its strategic supplies and release 1 million barrels of crude oil to support refinery activity, as fears over fuel shortages remain front and center.
Fears of a fuel shortage come amid a surge in gasoline prices to two-year highs on Thursday, ahead of the Labor Day weekend, which usually sees an uptick in the number of drivers on the road.
Gasoline prices, however, retreated from two-year highs on Friday as two refineries began to restart, narrowing the ‘crack spread’ – the difference between crude oil and gasoline prices – from recent highs.
Falling crude prices have weighed on U.S. drilling activity over recent weeks, as data showed the number of U.S. oil rigs was unchanged from the prior week.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the United States remained steady at 759, unchanged from a week ago.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Market participant are likely to closely monitor the EIA’s report on crude inventories slated for Sept. 7, to assess whether the recent dip in crude demand will halt the nine-week trend of falling crude supplies.
“Next week’s EIA data should see large draws in products due to refinery outages, prompting large builds in oil inventories,” said John Macaluso, an analyst at Tyche Capital Advisors. About 1.4 million barrels of extra oil that “won’t be refined to fuels will be sent to storage as long as refineries are shut-in.”"

HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Retail U.S. gasoline prices hit two-year highs and global shipping routes were scrambled as the nation's largest refiners remained shut on Friday, even as Storm Harvey lost strength.
Major fuel pipelines feeding the U.S. Northeast and Midwest were either closed or severely curtailed, prompting shortages in some areas and dramatic spikes in wholesale prices. 
The storm, which began as a hurricane a week ago, has roiled global fuel markets, and tankers carrying millions of barrels of fuel have been rerouted to the Americas to avert shortages. European refining margins hit a two-year high amid the surge in exports.
Indeed, the effects of the storm will continue for several weeks, if not months, after Harvey hammered the Gulf Coast for days and brought floods that buried Houston and the surrounding area in several feet of water. It knocked out about 4.4 million barrels of daily refining capacity, slightly more than Japan uses daily, and the signs of restarts were tentative.
The nation's largest refiner, Motiva's Port Arthur facility, which can handle 600,000 barrels of crude daily, will be shut for at least two weeks, according to sources familiar with plant operations. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2xzsKWz)
Other plants in the Beaumont/Port Arthur area are expected to face similar challenges restarting as waters continued to rise, even as flooding receded in Houston, some 85 miles (137 km) west.
In Corpus Christi, where Harvey first made landfall, refiners Citgo Petroleum Corp, Flint Hills Resources and  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO) were moving to restart their plants, along with the nearby Valero Three Rivers refinery, according to sources. 
Benchmark U.S. gasoline prices (RBc1) have surged more than 15 percent since the storm began, but in trading Friday, the contract for October delivery lost 1 percent, the first decline in five days. September's contract had risen by 25 percent, but stopped trading Thursday. 
U.S. crude prices continued to slump along with demand, with the futures contract falling 0.4 percent to $47.02 a barrel.
The national average for a regular gallon of gasoline rose to $2.519 as of Friday morning, according to motorists advocacy group AAA, with even gaudier increases in the U.S. Southeast, which relies heavily on Gulf supplies. South Carolina, for instance, has seen prices rise nearly 30 cents, and prices were up nearly 20 cents in Texas, where fuel shortages were already evident.
SHORTAGE WORRIES
Suppliers in the Chicago area were taking steps to prevent shortages, and banking on hope. 
Dave Luchtman, owner and president of Lucky’s Energy Service Inc., a small distributor in Chicago, has rented two storage trailers that hold 8,000 gallons each, expected to be delivered Friday. 
""So I have a little lifeline,"" Luchtman said. 
    Refineries so far have not given any indication that there are fuel shortages, said Mario Orlandi, an operations manager at Olson Service Co, which supplies diesel and gasoline to the Chicago area. 
""Cross our fingers, keep our tanks full,"" Orlandi said. 
The global impact of the storm was being felt in Venezuela, where financially strapped state-run PDVSA is facing the possibility that scheduled deliveries - tankers floating offshore for weeks due to non-payment - will make their way to other Latin American destinations. 
At least two cargoes scheduled to deliver to Venezuela currently in the port of Curacao are now expected to be delivered to Ecuador. 
Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and other countries want to tap some of the 7 million barrels of fuel sitting in the Caribbean sea, according to three traders and shippers.
European and Asian traders have diverted millions of barrels of fuel to the Americas. That included a rare opportunity for exports of jet fuel from Europe to the United States, reversing the usual flow of shipments.
Supplies from distant markets may not arrive soon enough to avert a crunch after the Colonial Pipeline, the biggest U.S. fuel system, said it would shut part of its main lines to the Northeast. 
""We are going to have outages from Texas to Boston,"" said one East Coast market source. The market is ""way under-appreciating the magnitude of this."" 

Several East Coast refineries have run out of gasoline for immediate delivery as they sent fuel elsewhere, and concerns over shortages ahead of the U.S. Labor Day extended weekend were mounting.

The greenback weakened broadly after the U.S. Labor Department said the economy added 156,000 jobs in August, disappointing expectations for an increase of 179,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% this month from 4.3% in July, confounding expectations for an unchanged reading.
The report also showed that average hourly earnings only rose 0.1% in August, compared to expectations for a 0.2% gain.
The weak data came after a string of mixed U.S. economic reports on Thursday had already dampened optimism over the economy. It was also expected to lower chances of another rate hike by the Federal Reserve in December.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.42% at 92.19, off session highs of 92.80 and at its lowest level since Tuesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, which has killed more than 40 people and brought record flooding to the oil heartland of Texas, paralysing a quarter of the U.S. refining industry.
Harvey, downgraded to a tropical storm and losing steam as it moved inland, shut at least 4.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity.
That sparked fears of a fuel shortage ahead of the Labor Day weekend and cut refinery demand for crude, widening the spread between U.S. gasoline (RBc1) and crude (CLc1).
This gasoline ""crack spread"" hit a high of $27.79 a barrel on Friday, up $10 in a week.
Brent crude (LCOc1) for November was down 50 cents at $52.36 a barrel by 0930 GMT. The Brent contract for October, which expired on Thursday, closed up $1.52 at $52.38.
U.S. crude was last down 50 cents at $46.73 a barrel. The contract rebounded 2.8 percent on Thursday but is heading for a weekly decline of around 2 percent.

373,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2017 02:40AM ET</span>",Asian refiners ramp up output to fill supply gaps left by Harvey,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Refiners across Asia are cranking up output to send fuel to the United States, where fallout from Hurricane Harvey has left around a quarter of the nation's refineries shut down. 
The storm, which hit Texas a week ago as a hurricane and moved on to Louisiana, has caused historic floods and forced the closure of about a quarter of U.S. refining capacity, equal to about 4.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in output. 
The resulting supply crunch has caused prices to spike - in gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other fuels - and not just in the United States. 
Attracted by soaring refining margins, known as crack spreads in the industry, Asian fuel makers from Singapore to South Korea have ramped up operating rates to sell as many cargoes as possible to the United States. 
""With crack spreads blowing out, the U.S. is going to need products ... so Asian and other refiners are going to have to ramp up runs,"" said Tony Nunan, oil risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp (T:8058) in Tokyo. 
Most refiners in Asia have a policy of not commenting on operations, but refinery sources across the region said their plants were maximizing runs to reap profits from higher fuel prices and to sell to the United States. 
""Everybody is looking for cargoes. It's a good money-making opportunity, so we will sell whatever we have after leaving sufficient supplies to meet domestic demand,"" said an official at Taiwan's CPC Corp [CHIP.UL]. 
Singapore refinery margins , a benchmark for Asia, have jumped by around a third since Harvey made landfall last Friday to $10.60 a barrel, the highest since January 2016 and the highest for this time of year in a decade. 
Sources at Singapore Refining Company (SRC) said they were sending spare cargoes to the United States, and a source from a Thai refiner said its plant is maximizing output in response to the jump in refining margins. 
""It's a great opportunity to sell fuel that has sat in storage during the last few years of oversupply,"" one trader with another refinery in Singapore said. 
In China, where the fuel export market is tightly regulated, state oil refiners are seeking extra oil-product export quotas for the fourth quarter to profit from the higher margins and to offload a domestic surplus. 
Analysts say fuel prices will remain elevated for some time as damaged U.S. refineries are repaired and fuel shipments cross from Europe and Asia to the United States. 
U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said this week that many U.S. refineries could take months to repair flood damage and become operational again. 
""The price (for fuels) will continue to be supported until flows are reinstated or imports from Europe and elsewhere pick up,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark's Saxo Bank.
Even refiners without the capacity to send cargoes to the United States are reaping benefits from the supply crunch caused by Harvey.
""We were running at maximum capacity even before the Hurricane, so we don't really have much room to boost our capacity ... but we expect our profitability to improve,"" said a source at  SK Innovation  (KS:096770), parent company of South Korea's top refiner SK Energy [SKENGG.UL]. 

Shares prices for several major Asian refiners, such as SK Innovation and fellow South Korean  S-Oil Corp  (KS:010950), have climbed to six-year highs this week as higher margins boosted profit potential. Thailand's  Thai Oil  (BK:TOP) climbed to its highest in nearly 10 years, while Taiwan's Formosa Petrochemical (TW:6505) also rallied.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude October contract fell 0.55% to $46.97 a barrel. Elsewhere, Brent oil for October delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 0.23% to $52.74 a barrel.
In China, the Caixin manufacturing PMI for August jumped to 51.6, compared with a reading of 50.9 seen for the world's second largest crude oil importer. Elsewhere in the region, The AIG manufacturing index from Australia for August soared to 59.8, compared with the July reading at 56.0 and the Japan manufacturing PMI for August came in at 52.2, a dip below 52.8 expected.
Overnight, oil prices bounced off a five-week low on Thursday, while gasoline futures remained sharply higher, as markets continued to weigh the impact of Tropical Storm Harvey on supply and demand.
Oil prices have been under pressure this week as Tropical Storm Harvey battered the U.S. Gulf Coast, ripping through Texas and Louisiana at the heart of the U.S. petroleum industry.
Texas is home to 5.6 million barrels of refining capacity per day, and Louisiana has 3.3 million barrels. Over 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity were estimated to be offline as a result of the storm.
U.S. commercial crude oil stocks fell by 5.4 million barrels last week, according to data released Wednesday by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, marking the ninth straight weekly decline. However, the data was collected before Hurricane Harvey hit the Gulf Coast.

Gold is sensitive to moves lower in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A lower dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency while a fall in U.S. rates, reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions resurfaced, lifting demand for safe haven gold, following North Korea’s missile launch over Japan earlier this week, as South Korea's air force conducted an exercise with two U.S. nuclear-capable bombers above the Korean peninsula on Thursday.

376,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2017 08:52PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Latin America looks to Venezuelan fuel cargoes as Harvey swamps U.S.,"By Marianna Parraga
HOUSTON (Reuters) - After Hurricane Harvey roared into Texas, flooding oil refineries and crippling ports along U.S. Gulf Coast, Latin American countries scouring the globe for other sources of fuel are zeroing in on a flotilla waiting to unload off the coast of Venezuela.
Almost no fuel tankers have sailed from Texas for Latin America in six days, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. Terminals and refineries shut by the storm are unlikely to fully recover for weeks.
The United States is the world's largest net exporter of refined petroleum products, shipping around 5.05 million barrels of fuel per day. Latin America received almost half of that, or 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd). Most of it loads from the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Latin America's top recipients of U.S. fuel shipments are Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela, which is an OPEC member sitting on the world's largest crude oil reserves. However, Venezuela refineries are in such poor repair that the country cannot meet its domestic fuel needs.
On Tuesday, a trading firm with two cargoes of diesel waiting to discharge in the port of Curacao notified Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA it plans to suspend its delivery contract and divert the shipments to Ecuador, according to a PDVSA source familiar with the firm's international trade.
PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and other countries also want to tap some of the about 7 million barrels of fuel sitting in the Caribbean sea, according to three traders and shippers.
Some of the two dozen tankers sitting offshore have been waiting for weeks to discharge, either because cash-strapped PDVSA has been slow to pay for fuels or because of bottlenecks at ports.
""Refiners are waiting for (U.S.) ports to reopen to start shipping what they have in storage, but some companies are desperate,"" said a trader from an oil firm supplying some regional state-run oil companies.
Mexico, which normally imports two gasoline cargoes per day, is among the countries looking to buy the fuels, the trading sources said.
If trading firms that control the tankers ""offer to divert a cargo from Venezuela, they (Mexico) are going to take it,"" said a source at an oil company with large operations in Latin America.
Peruvian oil company Petroperu (LM:PET) on Monday launched a tender to buy up to five cargoes of diesel for delivery in September and October, according to a document seen by Reuters. Colombia's state-run Ecopetrol (CN:ECO) has called trading firms to find gasoil cargoes for prompt delivery, a source said.
DESPERATE FOR FUEL 
Harvey has caused refinery outages that resulted in about 21 million barrels of gasoline and distillates in lost production as of Wednesday, according to Reuters' estimates based on Energy Information Administration numbers.
U.S. refineries with capacity to produce 4.4 million bpd have shut. That is nearly 4.5 percent of total global fuel supply.
Diverting the cargoes from Venezuela could bring big profits to traders as diesel and gasoline prices are rising fast due to the U.S. supply disruptions. But providers would have to reach agreements with PDVSA before moving the tankers.
PDVSA has failed to prepay for most of the tankers anchored near Venezuelan ports, according to the sources. Even so, traders would seek to agree with Venezuela to swap them for cargoes they could deliver later, rather than violate their end of a contract and damage their relationship with PDVSA.
""For diverting a cargo you need to declare a contract breach and that could lead to a long battle,"" one trader said.
""It might be easier for traders to negotiate another delivery window for September or October, which could allow charterers to divert these cargoes in the meantime.""
Some nations have more fuel in storage than others to cushion the impact on domestic markets of the reduction in U.S. supplies.
Brazil, Latin America's largest buyer of U.S. diesel and a big gasoline importer, has fuel storage constraints, said Adriano Pires, a consultant at Brazil's Center for Infrastructure. But he added that the storm's hit to U.S. shipment capacity has not yet became a problem. 
""I don't think those cargoes have a strong commitment to be delivered to PDVSA in the current situation, so South America, especially Brazil, could get something from there,"" said Robert Campbell from consultancy Energy Aspects. 
NOT SO EASY 
U.S. sanctions on new Venezuelan debt operations and on officials, including President Nicolas Maduro and PDVSA's Finance Vice President Simon Zerpa, have compounded trading difficulties.
Some banks that routinely provided trade financing for companies importing and exporting Venezuelan oil have stopped issuing letters of credit.
Maduro's government has sought to blame the shortage of essential goods on the United States for imposing financial sanctions that have delayed imports.

The sanctions meant that Venezuela ""cannot pay for imported essential goods for the people"", said Delcy Rodriguez, president of Venezuela's recently-installed pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Travelers and fuel suppliers across the United States braced for higher prices and shortages ahead of the Labor Day holiday weekend as the country's biggest fuel pipelines and refineries curb operations after Hurricane Harvey.
Just six days after Harvey slammed into the heart of the U.S. energy industry in Texas, the effects are being felt not just in Houston, but also in Chicago and New York, and prices at the pump nationwide have hit a high for the year.
(For a graphic on Harvey's impact on oil and gasoline markets, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2iK0YD9)
Supply shortages have developed even though there are nearly a quarter of a billion barrels of gasoline stockpiled in the United States. But much of it is held in places where it cannot be accessed due to massive floods, or too far away from the places it is needed. Some of it is unfinished, meaning it needs to be blended before it can go to gas stations.
Harvey has highlighted another weakness in the system: pipeline terminals typically only have a five-day supply in storage to load into the lines.
Some of the biggest pipelines in the United States, supplying the northeast market and the Chicago area, have already shut down or reduced operations because they have no fuel to pump.
""Gasoline is very much a 'just-in-time' fuel, for as many million barrels as they think we have,"" said Patrick DeHaan, petroleum analyst at GasBuddy. ""Sure, they are somewhere, but they still have to be mixed and blended together.""
At least two East Coast refiners, including Philadelphia Energy Solutions and Irving Oil, have already run out of gasoline for immediate delivery as they have rushed to send supplies to the U.S. Southeast, Caribbean, Mexico and South America to offset the lack of exports since Harvey, sources said.
Wholesale gasoline and jet fuel prices have soared as at least 4.4 million barrels per day of refining capacity, or nearly 24 percent of total U.S. capacity, has been closed due to the record rains. 
""Since Friday, my cost has gone up 30 cents per gallon,"" said Ben Little, owner of independent station Ben Little Pure, in the middle of Nashville. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued fuel waivers in 38 states and Washington, D.C. to ease concerns of supply shortages. 
The Energy Department released 500,000 barrels of crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Thursday. But the market is not short of crude, which makes up the majority of the country's strategic stockpiles.
The United States is short of fuel. The country only has a 1-million barrel gasoline reserve, established in the Northeast after Superstorm Sandy in 2012. That is enough to supply the East Coast for about eight hours. 
Gasoline production hit a record in this past week of 9.85 million barrels a day, ahead of the storm, due to the expected spike in driving demand, according to U.S. Energy Department data, a phenomenon seen in the last several years. 
TERMINAL SUPPLIES RUN LOW QUICKLY
Colonial Pipeline, the biggest U.S. fuel system, said deliveries to the U.S. Northeast from east of Lake Charles, Louisiana would be hit by supply constraints and as its Houston and Port Arthur origination points have been shut by the storm.
One terminal operator in the New York Harbor region which receives distillate fuel supplies from Colonial said it expects disruptions to its next batch of supplies set to arrive on Sept. 6.
Jet fuel supplies are also threatened. Colonial also services major airports, including Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, the busiest U.S. terminal, and Washington's Dulles. U.S. airlines had been projected to carry 16.1 million passengers worldwide this weekend, up 5 percent from last year.
Motiva Enterprises LLC's [MOTIV.UL] Port Arthur refinery, the country's largest, with the ability to produce 600,000 barrels of products a day, will be shut for at least two weeks, according to sources familiar with plant operations. 
Others may remain shut longer, so motorists nationwide may not have seen the full impact of Harvey yet. The average national price for regular-grade gasoline is up 10 cents in the last week to $2.449 a gallon, but some states have seen increases of as much as 19 cents, according to motorist group AAA.
Prices are likely to top $2.50 a gallon in coming weeks, which would be the highest since August 2015, the AAA said. 
Kim Black, 48, waited in line for 45 minutes to fill her white SUV in Garland, a suburb of Dallas, the fifth station she had tried Thursday. A clerk suddenly waived his arms at the line, yelling, ""No more gas!"" 
She was only able to pump less than two gallons, clicking the handle twice to be sure. ""$7.00. Well, that's it,"" she said.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil refiners and port facilities in Corpus Christi, Texas, were making strides resuming operations from Hurricane Harvey, but Houston and other Gulf Coast energy hubs remained flooded, officials said on Thursday.
Their efforts, which could take weeks to complete, must be repeated across a broad swath of coastal Texas and Louisiana before America's oil and fuel production can fully recover from deep cuts caused by record flooding. 
Power has been restored to all four Corpus Christi-area oil refineries and the Army Corps of Engineers is conducting final surveys of the port's waterways before fully reopening early next week, according to port officials.
""We are keeping our target of a full reopen by Sept. 4,"" said Patricia Cardenas, a port spokeswoman.
Refiners Citgo Petroleum Corp [PDVSAC.UL], Flint Hills Resources [FHR.UL] and  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) are moving to restart their plants in Corpus Christi, as is the nearby Valero Three Rivers refinery, according to sources, company officials and filings.
On Thursday, energy industry intelligence service Genscape said the Flint Hills Corpus Christi refinery restarted its largest crude distillation unit, which feeds all other units at the refinery. 
All were shut by Aug. 25, hours before Harvey roared ashore just north of the city with winds over 130 miles per hour (209 km per hour). Those four plants together have a capacity to refine 835,979 barrels of crude oil per day, or 4.4 percent of the nation's total.
Nearly a quarter of U.S. refining output is offline in the wake of the storm, as other plants in Texas and Louisiana also shut.
On Thursday, the U.S. Coast Guard began allowing vessels with up to 43 feet (13.1 m) to enter the city's port during daytime hours. Such vessels are able to hold about 500,000 barrels of oil. The Intracoastal Waterway between Corpus Christi and Brownsville, Texas, also is open, it added.

""Getting that port up and running is just so important,"" said Cleo Rodriguez Jr., president and CEO of the United Chamber of Commerce of Corpus Christi. ""It is the economic engine for the entire region."" Some $100 million of goods typically moves through the port daily, according to port officials. Rodriguez said he felt lucky Corpus Christi did not receive worse damage from Harvey, the most powerful storm to strike the state since 1961. ""Our member businesses have reported significant losses here, but so far nothing huge or catastrophic,"" he said. ""Our neighbors, like Rockport, were not so lucky. There was complete devastation there."" He said he expected Corpus Christi business to mostly recover by the end of September.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Oil prices rose 1 percent on Thursday, clawing back some of the losses made a day earlier, but U.S. crude is on track for the steepest monthly losses in more than a year on demand concerns after floods knocked out a quarter of U.S. refining capacity.
Prices also rallied in the oil products markets, with U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) hitting a two-year high above $2 a gallon, buoyed by fears of a fuel shortage just days ahead of the Labor Day weekend that typically brings a surge in driving.
Hurricane Harvey, which brought record flooding to the U.S. oil heartland of Texas and killed at least 35 people, has paralyzed at least 4.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity, according to company reports and Reuters estimates.
The shutdowns also led the U.S. government to tap its strategic oil reserves for the first time in five years on Thursday, releasing 500,000 barrels of crude to a working refinery in Louisiana.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were set to close the month down 7 percent, their steepest monthly loss since July 2016. They were trading 1.4 percent up at $46.58 a barrel at 1352 GMT.
""The current steep recovery follows yesterday's steep drop. The sell-off was bigger than expected and we see some bargain hunting now,"" said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.
International benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 58 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $51.44 a barrel. It had fallen more than 2 percent in the previous session.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Stifel said they expected U.S. infrastructure outages to last several months but said it was difficult to estimate the exact damage.
Others saw potential for operational refineries to delay typical September seasonal maintenance to benefit from high prices.
""Refineries outside the affected area may delay maintenance to benefit from high processing margins,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) oil analyst Carsten Fritsch.
""Hence, the negative impact on crude oil demand and oil product supply might be less severe than feared.""
U.S. crude and product stocks, typically watched closely by oil investors because they reflect market balancing, were largely ignored this week.
U.S. commercial crude stocks fell by 5.39 million barrels last week to 457.77 million barrels, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.  [S/EIA] 
That's down 14.5 percent from record levels reached in March.
At the same time, the amount of crude entered into refineries reached a record high of 17.73 million bpd, the data showed. The number is expected to have dropped dramatically this week because of infrastructure closures.
Analysts at JBC Energy said that figure could slip to as low as 15-16 million bpd.
Others said the refinery closures would lead to a rise in crude inventories.
""We could see rising U.S. crude inventories in the next couple of weeks until demand from refineries recovers. But by the end of September I expect the situation to be almost back to normal,"" said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW.

The trend for shrinking oil stocks and expectations for a rise in global oil demand growth meant analysts polled on a monthly basis by Reuters raised their oil price forecasts for the first time in six months.

U.S. natural gas for October delivery was at $2.929 per million British thermal units by 10:35AM ET (1435GMT), down 1.0 cent, or around 0.3%. Futures were at around $2.935 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 30 billion cubic feet in the week ended August 25, just below forecasts for a build of 32 billion.
That compared with a gain of 43 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 51 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 67 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.155 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 7.0% lower than levels at this time a year ago and less than 1.0% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas futures ended lower on Wednesday, as comfortable temperatures were seen continuing over the central and east-central U.S. in the next five days, with highs only in the 70s to lower 80s as weather systems sweep through.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on late-summer cooling demand.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for cooling.
Meanwhile, market players continued to assess the damage from Harvey on near-term supply and demand prospects.
Massive floods caused by Harvey forced several producers to scale back output along the U.S. Gulf Coast. However, gains were held in check amid expectations that production losses would be more than offset by reductions in demand due to cooler temperatures and power outages.

387,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2017 10:24AM ET</span>","As oil prices weather storm, OPEC looks for long-term boost from Harvey","By Ahmad Ghaddar and Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - For veteran OPEC officials, Hurricane Harvey's impact on global oil markets is one of the strangest things they have seen.
The storm has led to some of the biggest disruptions to U.S. energy infrastructure; yet it has failed to boost crude prices.
In contrast with previous major hurricanes such as Katrina in 2005, Harvey has actually seen oil prices edge down as traders have focused more on the hit to demand from damaged U.S. refineries than the blow to supply from knocked-out production.
That is deeply frustrating for OPEC countries currently restricting oil supplies in an attempt to push prices higher. 
""It seems no event will move the oil price up much,"" said one OPEC delegate, surprised by the lack of impact from Harvey. 
Another was also bemused after oil prices fell this week, defying too a steep drop in Libyan production due to unrest.
""It is all really strange. The sentiment of the market has changed a lot in the last 10 years,"" he said.
Whether the market continues to frustrate its would-be masters remains to be seen, however, with analysts divided whether demand from U.S. refineries will recover more quickly than U.S. production. 
'OPEC MUST BE RAGING'
OPEC long ignored the U.S. shale revolution that helped the world's largest oil consumer sharply raise output and become a major exporter of both crude and products in recent years.
When it finally recognized the threat, OPEC led by Saudi Arabia embarked on a pump war with the United States aimed at hitting the high-cost U.S. industry with lower oil prices.
In the past two years, however, OPEC has restrained production to prop up prices, because the pain of cheaper barrels was putting too much stress on most members' finances. 
The move has revived growth in the U.S. oil industry, with production and exports hitting new highs - until Harvey.
Unlike hurricanes Katrina or Gustav, when strong winds mainly caused damage to oil production, Harvey has also severely disrupted the U.S. refining industry and products pipelines, causing a spike in products prices.
Olivier Jacob from consultancy Petromatrix said U.S. gasoline prices were trading at levels normally equivalent to oil prices of around $84 per barrel, whereas Brent and WTI crude futures are actually at $51 and $46 per barrel respectively.
""OPEC must be raging, they're not getting any of this (gain),"" Jakob said.

'GLOBAL MOLECULES'
The jury is still out, however, whether this will continue, or whether Harvey will ultimately help OPEC's efforts to rebalance the oil market by hitting supply more than demand. 
OPEC and several non-OPEC producers led by Russia have cut a combined 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from their output since the start of the year in the hope of bringing global oil and products stocks down to around 2.7-2.8 billion barrels from the current record-high of over 3 billion.
U.S. stocks have declined steeply in the past few weeks.
Investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), one of the most active banks in commodities trading, said it believed the market rebalancing would be slowed by Harvey as it would cut demand by 0.7 million bpd in the next month and have an overall bearish impact.
ING said U.S. crude prices were set to fall as production hit by the hurricane would return quicker than demand from refineries, which remain shut due to record flooding.
But another crucial factor to bear in mind is U.S. exports.
When Katrina hit the U.S. Gulf in August 2005, the United States was exporting 1.3 million bpd of petroleum.
Today, it normally exports 5-6 million bpd of crude and products. According to Petromatrix's Jakob, Harvey will help OPEC and its target of reducing stocks in the rest of the world should the current disruption to exports be prolonged.
""Ultimately, at OPEC they should care about global molecules (of oil) and in that sense Harvey is bullish even if it is bearish U.S. crude in the near-term,"" said Amrita Sen from Energy Aspects.

She said that given the spike in products prices, refineries in Europe and Asia would run at top capacity, ultimately supporting crude prices across the globe.

KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Oil giant Saudi Aramco is using new technology to re-explore areas of the vast Arabian desert known as the Empty Quarter, which could help to bolster its proven reserves of oil and gas before the company offers its shares to the public.
A team of about 900 people is using advanced seismic technology developed over the last few years to explore 15,400 square kilometers (5,950 square miles) around Turayqa in Saudi Arabia, Aramco said in a statement. 
Turayqa, discovered in 2013, is an onshore conventional gas field that contains no oil. Part of the area was previously explored by joint ventures involving Aramco and foreign companies, Aramco said. The JVs failed to find recoverable quantities of oil and gas.
""Data processing is ongoing. The area partially covers areas relinquished by some of the joint ventures,"" the company told Reuters.
Aramco set up four consortia in 2003 and 2004 to explore the Empty Quarter, but they ended their search after failing to find commercial volumes of gas.
The new seismic technology may improve the chances of successful exploration, though it cannot by itself prove the existence of oil and gas reserves; drilling is needed for that.
Seismic technology uses artificially induced shockwaves in the earth. While conventional crews have 9,000 frequencies available to monitor the results, the crew at Turayqa has over 50,000. 
""The seismic data acquisition technology that is being deployed is truly phenomenal,"" said a former executive at the company.
    It not only provides a three-dimensional picture of the structure of rock going down several kilometers (miles), but also tells the user physical characteristics of the rock, such as its density and fluid saturation, he said.
""It is something that far exceeds what was achievable on land 10 years ago.""
Industry analysts said it was not clear whether Aramco's new exploration efforts would affect the company's estimate of its oil and condensate reserves, which total 261 billion barrels and have been unchanged for many years.
Any change in the reserves could affect next year's planned international offer of a stake of roughly 5 percent in Aramco, since some investors' models are based on valuations of the reserves. Private analysts have calculated the offer could value the whole company at around $1 trillion or more, though the government has predicted at least $2 trillion.
An industry source familiar with Aramco's operations said that at the very least, its exploration effort in the Empty Quarter and around the kingdom would help the company maintain its current reserves estimate for some time to come.

""At current production of 10 million barrels per day, and assuming reserves of 261 billion barrels, a discovery of 1.5 percent of the reserves replaces the reserves depleted in a year,"" he said.

393,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2017 04:52AM ET</span>",Global fuel market prices jump as Harvey's impact spreads beyond U.S. Gulf,"By Erwin Seba and Devika Krishna Kumar
HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Harvey's effect on the energy industry has spread beyond flooding U.S. refiners as fuel pipelines also shut, threatening a supply squeeze across the nation and stirring up world markets as U.S. retail fuel prices rose further.
The storm, which lashed Louisiana with rain on Thursday, has pummeled the U.S. Gulf Coast, inundating Houston and the surrounding area under several feet of rain and forcing the closure of nearly a quarter of U.S. refining capacity. 
Benchmark U.S. gasoline prices and margins surged anew in overnight trading Thursday. The jump came after the Colonial Pipeline, the biggest U.S. fuel system, said it would shut its main lines to the Northeast by Thursday, hit by outages at pumping points and lack of supplies from refiners. 
That artery can carry 3 million barrels of gasoline and other products daily.
At least two East Coast refineries have already run out of gasoline for immediate delivery as they scrambled to fill barges for markets normally supplied by the Gulf Coast, two refinery sources said.
Others were seen running at higher rates to boost profitability by filling shortages.
""This is going to be the worst thing the U.S. has seen in decades from an energy standpoint,"" said an East Coast market source, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the press.
Concerns over fuel shortages ahead of the U.S. Labor Day weekend were mounting, said analysts at JBC Energy.
U.S. gasoline futures topped $2 per gallon for the first time since 2015, with benchmark prices now up more than 20 percent since the Aug. 23 close, just before the storm's beginning.
Average U.S. retail fuel prices have surged by more than a dime per gallon from a week ago, the AAA said early on Thursday.
The Gulf makes up nearly half of total refining capacity in the United States - the world's largest net exporter of refined petroleum products - sending the disaster's effects rippling through global flows. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2xzsKWz)
About 4.4 million barrels of U.S. refining capacity have been shut by Harvey, including the nation's largest refiner, Motiva Port Arthur, which can process more than 600,000 barrels a day. The total shut-in is about 24 percent of U.S. refining capacity - almost equal to Japan's daily consumption.
Traders in Europe were rushing to reroute cargoes to the United States and Latin America to fill the gap left by refining and shipping closures, but supplies may not arrive fast enough to avert a crunch.
""Sourcing additional barrels from Europe is a potential solution, but an increased level of uncertainty is introduced surrounding the timeliness of delivery given the logistics of travel time and securing tankers,"" said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
Attracted by a surge in profits, refiners in Asia have also been trying to fix fuel cargoes to the United States, despite the huge distance across the Pacific.
Gasoline refinery profits in Singapore, a benchmark in Asia, jumped to more than $15.60 per barrel, their highest level since early 2016.
The U.S. disruptions have hit wholesalers. The premium for Chicago-area gasoline above benchmark futures is at its highest since June 2016, while the Gulf Coast price is at its widest above futures since August 2012. 
Suppliers in Chicago were trying to secure supplies after the Explorer Pipeline, which typically carries about 350,000 barrels a day (bpd) to the region, shut down. 
""It's not a significant problem at the present time, but it could turn into one,"" said William Fleischli, executive vice-president of the Illinois Petroleum Marketers Association, which represents 400 fuel distributors. Fleischli said much depended on how long the shutdowns last.
Average retail gasoline prices have risen to $2.449 per gallon nationwide, up 4.5 cents a gallon from a day earlier and 10.1 cents from a week ago, AAA data showed. In Georgia and North Carolina, fuel prices are up about 17 cents and average prices in South Carolina have risen nearly 20 cents per gallon from a week ago.

Though flood waters had yet to recede, energy analysts said they anticipated potential long-term effects from the historic storm. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts wrote Wednesday that they expected about a tenth of what is now offline to stay shut for several months.

Refinery shutdowns across Texas due to flooding from Strom Harvey, triggered fears of an uptick crude inventories, following a fall in demand for crude oil, as refining capacity continued to come under pressure.
Refineries with output of 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd) were offline on Tuesday, representing nearly 23 percent of U.S. production, according to Reuters estimates and company reports.
A report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showing crude stockpiles fell more than expected last week lifted sentiment but gains were short lived as investor focus returned to the storm’s impact on demand for crude as refineries are not expected to restart for a week or more.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 5.4m barrels in the week ended Aug 25, beating expectations of a draw of about only 1.9m barrels. It was the ninth-straight week of falling crude inventories.
Gasoline inventories, one of the products that crude is refined into, rose by roughly 35,000 barrels, missing expectations of a draw of 989,000 barrels while distillate stockpiles rose by 748,000 barrels, confounding expectations of a decline of 846,000 barrels.
The smaller-than-expected draw in gasoline inventories failed to offset concerns over fuel shortages, as gasoline hit a two-year high on reports that Total’s Port Arthur, Texas, the nation's largest refinery had been shut by a power outage resulting from the storm.
Analysts’ expect the EIA’s energy report next week to show an uptick in crude oil inventories, as the slump in refinery activity lowers demand for crude oil, the primary input at refineries, adding to the glut in crude supplies.
“Next week’s EIA data should see large draws in products due to refinery outages, prompting large builds in oil inventories,” said John Macaluso, an analyst at Tyche Capital Advisors.

Energy markets have been rocked this week by the impact of Hurricane Harvey in Texas.
Some refiners in Corpus Christi that shut down ahead of the storm were looking to restart, but heavy rains were expected to last through Wednesday, adding to catastrophic flooding.
The National Weather Service said the storm has set a rainfall record for tropical cyclones in Texas.
But even refineries that are able to restart may experience difficulties getting enough oil supplies.
Ships carrying oil are still unable to enter Texas ports, while producers in south Texas who shut down operations are only starting to ramp up and some pipelines that carry supplies to refineries are still shut.
The bearish reaction seen in oil prices this week was due to the fact that the historic storm has driven down demand.
Although it may appear to be a paradox, those same closed refineries are one of crude oil’s biggest buyers, and according to calculations from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), the closures mean that approximately 3 million barrels a day are not refined into gasoline and other products, far more than the drop in oil production itself."

CARACAS/HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. sanctions on the finance boss of Venezuela's oil company PDVSA have led to some exports to the United States being blocked as banks and investment funds refuse to provide letters of credit to potential buyers, three financial sources said.
U.S. businesses are barred from dealing with a sanctioned person or company and one of the sources said the sanctions on PDVSA's Finance Vice President Simon Zerpa were deterring some businesses from investments with the company as so many of its transactions are linked to the finance department he leads.
A Venezuelan oil shipment to the United States was blocked this month as lenders refused to provide letters of credit to PDVSA customers, the sources said.
Letters of credit, issued by banks, guarantee to a seller that a buyer will pay a specified amount on time when a shipment is accepted. Without a letter of credit, shipments cannot be delivered and the shipper does not get paid. Blocking letters of credit for PDVSA oil chokes off cash that is desperately needed in the OPEC nation.
Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., commonly known as PDVSA, is the financial motor of President Nicolas Maduro's leftist government, and it is operating within one of the deepest economic recessions Venezuela has ever experienced and widespread political unrest.
In one instance, U.S. refiner PBF Energy (N:PBF) was unable to get a letter of credit for a Venezuelan crude cargo to be received at a U.S. port.
The Suezmax tanker Karvounis has been anchored in the U.S. Gulf for more than a month. It partially discharged its cargo on Aug. 23 in New Orleans, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. A trader close to the deal said PBF Energy ultimately agreed to a prepayment, removing the need for a credit letter. It was unclear what would happen with the rest of the cargo.
Some U.S. customers can import without a letter of credit if they pay up front. 
In July, the United States imposed sanctions on 13 senior Venezuelan officials, including the head of Venezuela’s army, the national police chief, the director of elections, and Zerpa.
At the time, a U.S. official warned that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump was readying tougher measures that could be part of a “steady drumbeat” of responses to the Venezuelan crisis.
The most serious potential future step would be financial sanctions that would halt dollar payments for the country’s oil, starving the government of hard currency, or a total ban on oil imports to the United States, Venezuela’s biggest customer.
This month the United States imposed its first economic sanctions on Venezuela, banning debt trades for government-issued bonds and bonds issued by PDVSA.
The problem could spread to more cargoes if banks refuse to extend credit to companies that have a commercial relationship with PDVSA, the sources said.
The sources said foreign oil companies funding projects in Venezuela and financial entities negotiating with PDVSA were avoiding signing agreements that could involve Zerpa.
Major oil company China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) has pulled back from funding some operations at its joint venture in Venezuela, a source at PDVSA said.
Neither PDVSA nor the Information Ministry responded to requests for comment. Zerpa was not immediately available to comment.
""PDVSA will face additional trouble just by keeping a sanctioned individual as CFO,"" said Jorge Piedrahita, chief executive of broker-dealer Gear Capital Partners, who has been involved with Venezuelan debt for many years.
""Even the Russians and China's Development Bank should be worried about signing something with him as they can be subject to collateral damage from sanctions just by association.""
A close Maduro ally, Zerpa, 34, rose to prominence by leading the bilateral Venezuela-China fund through which Caracas borrows from Beijing and repays loans in oil and fuel. Venezuela has borrowed over $60 billion from China, earning Zerpa the nickname ""Zerpa the Chinese.""
Two additional financial sources said having Zerpa as the company's head of finance had made it impossible for U.S. entities to assist PDVSA in debt refinancing, even before the U.S. economic sanctions.
Even basic activities, such as a conference call with bondholders, are now essentially unthinkable, the sources said.
Sanctions against Zerpa are having a knock-on effect on Wall Street, affecting imports of food and medicine to Venezuela made through funds headed by Zerpa, according to Delcy Rodriguez, president of Maduro's new legislative assembly. 
""This wasn't done to affect Venezuelan officials but rather the entire population,"" Rodriguez said on Monday.
Zerpa has held several high-profile posts including heading Venezuela's state economic development bank Bandes and off-budget investment fund Fonden.
Opposition lawmakers have said he is an example of how the late Hugo Chavez's ""21st century socialism"" has allowed unprepared political figures to wield power over financial deals.
""I have a negative opinion of him because of the way he handled the Chinese fund,"" said opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado, describing Zerpa as Maduro's ""finance tsar."" 
U.S. pressure could force PDVSA to remove Zerpa from his post, at least on paper. However, PDVSA has had issues in the past that have led investors to tread cautiously with Venezuela.

""In part, the sanctions codify an already existing situation in which PDVSA and the Republic have little to no access to international financial markets due to the combination of political risk, unsustainable policies, concerns about legality of new issues and reputational risk from providing funds to the Venezuelan government,"" investment firm Torino Capital wrote in a report to clients after Friday's sanctions.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Wednesday but gasoline spiked to its highest since mid-2015 as flooding in the wake of Hurricane Harvey knocked out almost a quarter of U.S. refineries, crimping demand for crude but raising fears of fuel shortages.
Harvey, which has been downgraded to a storm, has caused massive floods across coastal Texas, including in Houston. It is now moving into Louisiana, where more floods are expected. 
""Catastrophic and life-threatening flooding continues in southeastern Texas and portions of southwestern Louisiana,"" the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in its latest note.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $46.35 per barrel at 0644 GMT, down 9 cents from their last close. Brent crude futures were down 6 cents, at $51.94 a barrel. 
In the refined product market, price movements have been more dramatic. 
U.S. gasoline prices were over 3 percent higher at $1.8380 per gallon. Prices earlier climbed to the most since July 31, 2015, at $1.842. Diesel futures also jumped, gaining 1.2 percent to $1.6854 a gallon and were earlier at their highest since Jan. 9 at $1.697. 
""As of August 29, we estimate U.S. refining production offline was 4.1 million barrels per day (bpd); this represents 23 percent of total U.S. refining production,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note to clients. 
Goldman also said around 1.4 million bpd of crude production was disrupted, equivalent to 15 percent of total U.S. output. 
The NHC said the next 24 hours would remain dangerous.
""There is a danger of life-threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, during the next 12 to 24 hours,"" the NHC said, adding that 6 to 12 inches of rain could fall in far east Texas and southwestern Louisiana.
The largest refinery in the United States, Motiva Enterprises' 603,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) plant in Port Arthur, Texas, was shutting down on Tuesday night because of flooding. 
Preparing for more rain and floods, Total cut production in half at its 225,500 bpd refinery, also in Port Arthur.
Restarting plants even under good conditions can take weeks.
Harvey has also delayed loading of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at Cheniere's Sabine Pass in Louisiana, the only U.S. LNG export terminal.
Beyond the impact of Harvey, the American Petroleum Institute (API) said on Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.780 million barrels last week, an indicator that the U.S. oil market is gradually tightening.
The figures, however, do not reflect the impact from Harvey. Government data for last week is due to be published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) later on Wednesday.
Traders said that EIA data would take weeks to fully reflect the impact of the storm and floods.

New York (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline futures jumped 4 percent while crude prices were mixed on Tuesday after a hurricane shut down more than 19 percent of the country's refining capacity, curbing fuel production and further bloating crude inventories.
Gasoline rose still higher post-settlement, after sources told Reuters that Motiva was shuttering the largest U.S. refinery. That meant at least 3.65 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity was offline, or 19.6 percent of total U.S. capacity, based on company reports and Reuters estimates. The Gulf is home to nearly half of U.S. refining capacity. 
""Because that demand is gone that’s where the selling pressure in the market is coming from,"" said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy. ""We have no idea when (the refineries will) come back on, the market is taking a wait and see approach.""
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) edged down 13 cents or 0.3 percent to $46.44 a barrel. International Brent crude futures (LCOc1) closed up 11 cents or 0.2 percent to $52.00 a barrel. The discount for U.S. WTI versus Brent reached $5.92 a barrel on Tuesday, its widest in more than two years. 
U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) jumped 4 percent to settle at 1.7833, the highest in more than two years.
After settlement, sources told Reuters that Motiva Enterprises was shutting down the nation's largest refinery due to flooding. Motiva has already been reducing production at the 603,000 barrel per day (bpd) Port Arthur, Texas, refinery as flood waters continued to inundate the area.
The Motiva shutdown sent after-settlement gasoline prices up to 1.8180.
Prices would be higher if not for record refinery runs in 2017, said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at Clipperdata.
""They're not spiking as much as they would have had we not had the backdrop of plentiful inventories,"" said Smith, noting gasoline supplies sit at a five year high for this time of year.

Some refineries were preparing for restarts, but heavy rains were expected to last through Wednesday, adding to catastrophic flooding. 
The storm has set a rainfall record for tropical cyclones in Texas, the National Weather Service said.
More than 18 percent of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico was shut in, the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Safety Environmental Enforcement said. Still, tropical Storm Harvey, which was downgraded from a hurricane, hit refiners harder.
After settlement, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said its data showed that last week U.S. crude stocks fell, while gasoline inventories increased and distillate stocks drew.
Crude markets were also eyeing disruptions in Libya and Colombia. Yet crude remains in ample supply. Jefferies bank said it was lowering its fourth-quarter Brent oil price estimates to $55 a barrel from $60 and its 2018 forecast to $57 from $64.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Record rains and flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey triggered more oil refining outages in Texas on Tuesday, bringing the total offline to more than 16 percent of overall U.S. capacity as the storm took aim at plants along the Louisiana coast.
As the storm moved up the Gulf Coast, supply shortages emerged, as major pipelines carrying gasoline, diesel and jet fuel started to adjust deliveries or close lines outright due to lack of supply. 
About 3 million bpd of U.S. refining capacity had already been shut, with more shutdowns expected. Restarting plants even under the best conditions can take a week or more.
The U.S. Gulf Coast is home to nearly half of domestic refining capacity, with some 5.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of capacity in Texas and 3.3 million bpd in Louisiana. 
More refinery closures were expected, as parts of Texas have received more than four feet of rain. Fuel prices were expected to keep rising as refining capacity remains down and pipelines run short. Explorer Pipeline, which runs from Texas to Chicago, will shut two lines early Wednesday. 
""These closures are already impacting markets, with crude prices lower on a perceived drop in demand and gasoline prices spiking in response to lower supply,"" said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research at Morningstar. 
Colonial Pipeline, the key artery sending gasoline up the East Coast, was still shipping barrels there, but has faced flooding at origination points in Texas.
The Northeast was already dealing with reduced supply. Philadelphia Energy Solutions, the region's largest refiner, said it has sold all its available regular gasoline barrels due to increased demand, while Monroe Energy's refinery has increased runs. 
U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) on Tuesday rose 2.6 percent to $1.756 per gallon, and have jumped about 8.5 percent since last Wednesday, when refiners started shuttering capacity ahead of the storm making landfall. Heating oil futures, a proxy for diesel and other distillates, rose 1.1 percent.

In cash trading, the spread between Gulf Coast gasoline prices and benchmark futures rallied further, a day after hitting a five-year high in anticipation of constrained supply. That price was lately 24 cents above benchmark futures (RBc1), traders said.
Retail gasoline prices have started to rise, with the average gallon of gasoline rising 1 cent overnight to $2.38 nationally. The average price in Texas rose 2 cents to $2.19 per gallon.

CYPRESS, Texas (Reuters) - The mayday call went out near midnight to all members of the Cy-Fair Volunteer Fire Department organizing rescue operations in the outskirts of Houston. There was a new emergency: Four of their own in peril.
On a suburban street transformed into a rushing waterway by Tropical Storm Harvey, a firefighter heading out to save people stranded by the storm fell into floodwaters as he was boarding a boat. 
The firefighters turned all their attention to rescuing their fellow rescuer.
Matt Perkins, a 21-year veteran of the fire department of Cy-Fair, short for Cypress-Fairbanks, listened intently to the progress from the mini-command post set up in his truck at a gas station.
""Those are my guys out there. I want to make sure they are OK,"" he said as he listened to his radio.
""Command Boat 21, do you need a helicopter at your location?"" a radio dispatcher said.
A garbled response. 
""We can't understand your response,"" the dispatcher responded. ""Your mic is wet.""
Hearing no response, the call became more urgent: ""Repeat. Do you need a helicopter at your location?""
Finally the radio crackled back to life: ""We are extracted. The boat is tied to a tree. We are walking out with the military.""
The three on board were able to pull the fourth out of the water, but the fast current pinned the boat to a tree and left them stranded.
It was just the first hair-raising moment in a long night of rescues by firefighters, police and the National Guard as rains from the devastating storm continued to hammer Houston and the surrounding area. More than 3,000 people had been rescued from their homes by late Monday and more rain was forecast for Tuesday. 
National Guard teams with Humvees and high-water vehicles coordinated with local emergency officials to respond to calls from people trapped in their homes. 
Residents of this city 30 miles (48 km) north of Houston are used to floods, having just weathered a major one last year. But many said they were caught by surprise by the extent of rising water levels, as the area was expected to get as much rain in a week as it normally sees in a year. 
In the dark hours of the night, the National Guard navigated their vehicles through neighborhoods transformed into inland lakes with water cresting to the tops of mail boxes and fire hydrants and garden shrubbery looking more like watery mangrove forests. 
With local firefighter Cassie Fritch guiding the troops with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Maps on her cell phone, they searched for people who had called for help. When the water rose above the Humvee doors on the outside, it also seeped up through the floor on the inside and dripped in from the hatch. 
""Oh, that's cold,"" said Specialist Jaylan Dawson as the water rose over his pedals. 
At one home Fritch found a man who had changed his mind about evacuating and decided to stick it out. She warned him that rescuers would not be back if he called again.

""He says he's not coming because the water receded,"" Fritch said. ""That's his choice, but the storm’s not over yet.""

U.S. natural gas for October delivery was at $2.962 per million British thermal units by 8:10AM ET (1210GMT), little changed on the day.
It fell to its lowest since August 9 at $2.880 on Monday, before reversing course to end 1.3% higher, as damage from Harvey was seen disrupting gas production in the Eagle Ford shale and the Gulf of Mexico.
Massive floods caused by Harvey forced several producers to scale back output along the U.S. Gulf Coast. The storm, which made landfall on Friday, is poised to regain strength before crashing ashore again near the Texas-Louisiana border Wednesday.
However, gains were held in check amid expectations that production losses would be more than offset by reductions in demand due to cooler temperatures and power outages.
Comfortable temperatures will continue over the central and east-central U.S. in the next five days, with highs only in the 70s to lower 80s as weather systems sweep through.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on late-summer cooling demand.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for cooling.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.125 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 6.7% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 1.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Early market expectations for this week's storage data due on Thursday is for a build in a range between 26 and 36 billion cubic feet in the week ended August 25.
That compares with a gain of 43 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 51 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 67 billion cubic feet.

427,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2017 06:50AM ET</span>","Despite new U.S. sanctions, Russian oil traders say it's business as usual","By Katya Golubkova and Gleb Gorodyankin
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian oil companies will quickly find ways to work around tighter restrictions imposed this month by the United States on the foreign finance they can use, multiple Russian oil industry sources told Reuters.
The new restrictions cut the period that U.S.-based entities can provide finance to Russian energy firms from 90 to 60 days and are part of a fresh package of U.S. sanctions that U.S. President Donald Trump approved on Aug. 2.
Initiated by Congress, the sanctions were in part designed to punish Moscow further for its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and to sanction it for what U.S. intelligence agencies say was its meddling in the U.S. presidential election, something Russia denies.
In particular, the measures were designed to hurt Russia's energy sector, its biggest source of revenue.
But though the new steps are an inconvenience that could cause Russian oil companies to incur extra costs, the sources, who work for Russian oil firms and Russian and foreign oil trading houses, said that they were only incrementally worse than sanctions that have been in place since 2014. 
Oil companies had learned to adapt then and would do so again now, they said. 
None of the oil trade sources said they knew of any transactions having been disrupted as a result of the new measures.
""Business as usual,"" said one Russian oil trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, when asked to describe how the industry was coping with the new curbs.
Still, of all the various measures targeting the energy sector, the restriction cutting the financing duration would have the biggest direct impact even if there were ways to mitigate it, the industry sources said.
POTENTIAL WORKAROUNDS
The initial sanctions, imposed in 2014 soon after Russia annexed Crimea, effectively cut off Russian energy companies from long-term Western debt of the kind they had used heavily to fund investments in new projects.
However, by allowing financing lasting up to 90 days, the initial sanctions kept the door open to trade finance, the routine debt operations that most oil companies depend on.
In crude oil transactions, the selling party usually does not get paid in full until weeks after the shipment of oil has been delivered. To mitigate liquidity gaps, an oil trader steps in and makes pre-payments to the oil producer. 
Now that the financing period has been reduced by a third, to 60 days, Russian energy companies will have to become more resourceful, said the industry sources.
One workaround, according to a second oil trading source, is that the energy firms will free up cash of their own. That could be done by selling off assets, though the more likely scenario is that they will dip into their cash reserves.
""The companies right now have significant volumes of liquidity,"" said the trader, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
Alternatively, said the same source, energy companies can use external finance, but break it down into many increments so the lender does not fall foul of the sanctions. That requires more deals with more parties.
""It's an increase in operational and financial costs,"" said the second oil trading source.
Another trader, who works for a major Western company, said the sector had already learned how to deal with a shorter financing window when the initial sanctions were imposed, so the industry would adapt again.
""Okay, so it (the financing period) is being cut, that means we need to turn it around in 60 days, not 90,"" said the trader. ""You need to keep a close eye on it. But it hasn't had a strong effect.""
Traders said they expected that the new, tighter restrictions would result in Russian banks handling more of the finance for energy trading transactions. Before sanctions, that was a role played largely by big international trading houses and Western banks.
Several Russian banks are already subject to U.S. and European Union sanctions, so have little to fear from providing finance to Russian energy companies, even if it exceeds the 60-day limit.
In one case this year Russian state oil company Zarubezhneft was seeking a buyer for 1.8 million tonnes of Urals crude oil for loading from the Baltic port of Primorsk between July 2017 and December 2018. The terms of the sale were that the buyer would have to pre-finance the deal.

Oil trading sources told Reuters that the cargo was sold to VTB Trading, a unit of Russian state lender VTB, which has been subject to U.S. sanctions since 2014.

Geopolitical risks can boost demand for safe-haven assets such as gold which is considered a good store of value during volatility in other markets.
Comex gold futures jumped $11.10, or around 0.9%, to $1,326.52 a troy ounce by 3:15AM ET (0715GMT). It rose to its highest since early November at $1,330.00 earlier.
Gold prices gained around 1.3% on Monday, its biggest one-day percentage rise since mid-May.
North Korea fired a missile early on Tuesday that flew over Japan and landed in waters off Hokkaido, in a sharp escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula.
The last time a projectile from the hermit state flew over Japan was 2009.
The U.S., Japan and South Korea asked for a United Nations Security Council meeting to discuss the test, diplomats said. A meeting of the 15-member Security Council would be held later in the day, they said.
Global markets were shaken earlier this month after President Donald Trump cautioned that North Korea would be met with ""fire and fury"" if it continued to make threats against the U.S.
Pyongyang responded by saying it was considering a strike on Guam, a U.S. territory, although it later somewhat backed down.
The escalating tensions prompted investors to dump assets seen as riskier, such as stocks and high yielding currencies, and flock to traditional safe-haven assets like the yen, Swiss franc and gold.
The dollar index was down 0.3% against a basket of six major currencies at 91.90, its lowest level since January 2015.
Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver futures gained 12.1 cents, or around 0.7%, to $17.56 a troy ounce.

Overnight, crude futures settled lower on Monday, as Tropical Storm Harvey continued to disrupt refinery activity along the U.S. Gulf coast, adding to fears of an uptick in crude oil supplies.
Crude oil made a negative start to the week as flooding caused by the storm forced refiners in the Gulf of Mexico region to shutdown, sparking concerns over an excess in crude oil supplies, the primary input at refiners.
It is estimated that approximately 331,370 barrels of oil per day (bpd), or 18.94%, of the current oil production of 1,750,000 bpd in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut-in, according to an update from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement on Monday.
While the storm is also expected to disrupt crude oil production, analysts believe the impact of lower crude demand at refineries would outweigh the dip in crude oil production.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said floods caused by Tropical Storm Harvey were expected spread from Texas eastward to Louisiana, home to roughly 3.3 million bpd.
The sharp fall in oil prices comes amid a bearish period for crude futures, which slumped to a fourth-straight weekly loss last week, as investors continued to question Opec’s commitment to the global pact to curb production.
An Opec meeting on compliance last week, failed to yield any tangible measures to address the group’s waning compliance with the deal to curb output.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. fuel prices surged on Monday as two more Gulf Coast refiners cut output and a third considered reductions, leaving more than 13 percent of the country's refining capacity offline after Tropical Storm Harvey flooded plants and shut seaports.
The storm swung back over the Gulf of Mexico on Monday and was expected to bring another 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 cm) of rain to the Houston area and up to 8 inches as far east as New Orleans, the National Weather Service said.
Marathon Petroleum Corp's (N:MPC) Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City, Texas, cut production by half, sources familiar with plant operations said. 
Lyondell Basell Industries' (N:LYB) Houston refinery early on Monday also cut output by half to conserve crude supply, other sources said.
Meanwhile the nation's largest plant, Motiva Enterprises' [MOTIV.UL] 603,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Port Arthur, Texas, refinery was considering shutting due to high water on the plant grounds and running with essential personnel only, two sources said.
The profit that refiners make per barrel of gasoline jumped as high as 21 percent  in the first trading day following Harvey's landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas, late on Friday, as fears of short supplies gripped the market. 
Gasoline for immediate delivery in the Gulf Coast hit five-year highs, traders said, while U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) jumped as much as 7 percent to $1.78 per gallon, the highest since late July 2015. 
In total, 2.45 million bpd of U.S. refining capacity was shut due to Harvey, which knocked out four refineries in South Texas before bringing flooding rains to plants near Houston.
Nearly 19 percent of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut, the U.S. Department of the Interior said on Monday.
The latest refining cutbacks were at Marathon's 459,000 bpd plant and Lyondell's 264,000 bpd Houston plant.
Marathon spokeswoman Stefanie Griffiths declined to comment. Lyondell and Motiva did not reply to requests for comment. 
Oil prices fell as the refinery closings reduced demand, with U.S. crude futures (CLc1) dropping by more than 3 percent on Monday. 
Among other Gulf Coast refiners, Exxon Mobil's (N:XOM) 362,300 bpd Beaumont, Texas, refinery has cut production, the company said. It did not provide additional details. Earlier, Exxon halted production at its 560,500 bpd Baytown, Texas, plant. 
Valero Energy's (N:VLO) 335,000 bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery is running at or near maximum capacity but contending with flooding in the plant, sources said on Monday. Valero confirmed the plant is running, but has not commented on further. 
 Total  SA (PA:TOTF)'s 225,500 bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery is operating normally, sources said.
In the area where the storm first hit, Citgo Petroleum's refinery in Corpus Christi is preparing to begin its restart process as early as on Wednesday, sources said. A spokesperson did not reply to requests for comment.

Beijing proposed cutting steel overcapacity by 150 million tonnes by 2022 in a deal twice rejected by Trump, who instead urged advisers to find ways to impose tariffs on imports from China, the paper said, citing the sources. 
(http://on.ft.com/2iCb7Sn)
The deal was endorsed by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross a week before U.S. and Chinese officials held a high-level economic dialogue, the FT added, citing a U.S. official and another person familiar with the matter.
White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom declined to comment on the ""purported internal discussions"" between the president and his cabinet members when contacted by Reuters.
Last week, American steel industry executives appealed to Trump for immediate import restrictions in a letter seen by Reuters, saying the industry was suffering the consequences of government inaction.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Monday announced a 2-1/2 month delay in determining final anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on Canadian softwood lumber to buy more time to negotiate a settlement of the trade dispute.
The Commerce Department had previously been scheduled to announce final lumber duties on Sept. 6, a step that would have ended the current negotiating process with Canada's government. Ross set a new deadline of no later than Nov. 14.
""I remain hopeful that we can reach a negotiated solution that satisfies the concerns of all parties,"" Ross said. ""This extension could provide the time needed to address the complex issues at hand and to reach an equitable and durable suspension agreement.""
U.S. and Canadian softwood lumber producers and government officials have all said they want to reach an ""equitable"" arrangement to settle U.S. claims that Canadian lumber is unfairly subsidized and dumped onto U.S. markets below cost.
But both sides say they are unwilling to settle for a ""bad deal,"" pushing the talks past the start of negotiations to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement. As long as the Commerce Department is negotiating on behalf of the United States, the lumber talks can continue on a separate track to the NAFTA talks, which are being handled by the U.S. Trade Representative's office.
The decades-old dispute centers on the fees paid by Canadian lumber mills for timber cut largely from government-owned land. They are lower than fees paid on U.S. timber, which comes largely from private land. The Canadian government argues that its fees are fair and is prepared to litigate the matter if a settlement cannot be reached. 
U.S. lumber producers want a ""clean quota"" system that limits Canadian mills to a specific share of the U.S. market.
Canada's ambassador to the United States and envoys from major lumber-producing provinces said last week in a joint statement that the coming weeks ""will be critical to determine whether we have a partner in the United States prepared to advance our shared interests."" 
The U.S. Commerce Department is collecting preliminary duties of 17 percent to 31 percent on Canadian softwood lumber.

The attack took place in rural El Carmen municipality in Norte de Santander (MC:SAN) province, near the border with Venezuela, the sources said. The bombing caused a crude spillage into a nearby river.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because an official announcement has not yet been made.
Production at the Cano Limon oilfield, operated by U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY), and exports have not been affected, the sources said.
Ecopetrol officials said a team from the company was in the area to carry out clean-up operations. Repairs are expected to take several days, they said.
Attacks against the pipeline have left 751 victims over the last 17 years, including 167 deaths. Since 1986 the pipeline has been out of service 3,800 days, or 10.4 years, 30 percent of its life. Some 66 million gallons of crude have been spilled since 2000, according to Ecopetrol figures.
The 485-mile (780-km) pipeline can carry up to 210,000 barrels per day.
The National Liberation Army (ELN), considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union, has frequently attacked Colombia's oil infrastructure during the group's five-decade war with the government.
Despite peace talks begun with the government in February, the ELN has continued pipeline attacks. It opposes the presence of multinational companies in the mining and oil sector, claiming that they seize natural resources without leaving benefits to the country's population or economy.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said floods caused by Tropical Storm Harvey were expected spread from Texas eastward to Louisiana, home to roughly 3.3 million bpd.
The sharp fall in oil prices comes amid a bearish period for crude futures, which slumped to a fourth-straight weekly loss last week, as investors continued to question Opec’s commitment to the global pact to curb production. 
An Opec meeting on compliance last week, failed to yield any tangible measures to address the group’s waning compliance with the deal to curb output."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures fell more than 3 percent on Monday but gasoline prices surged to two-year highs as Tropical Storm Harvey kept hammering the U.S. Gulf Coast, knocking out several refineries which backed up crude supplies and disrupted fuel production. 
Massive floods caused by the storm forced refineries in the area to close. In turn, U.S. crude futures fell as the refinery shutdowns could reduce demand for American crude. 
“The reduced inputs to those Gulf refineries will result in an increase in crude inventories,"" said Tony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging, ""That outweighs the outages in crude oil production from the storm.” 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were down $1.48 or 3.1 percent to 46.39 at 1:31 p.m. EDT (1731 GMT) Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were down 70 cents or 1.3 percent at $51.71 per barrel. 
The WTI discount versus Brent  expanded to as much as $5.48 per barrel, its widest in two years. 
Prompt U.S. gasoline differentials in the Gulf Coast hit a five-year high.
Spot prices for U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) surged 7 percent to a peak of $1.7799 per gallon, the highest since late July 2015, before easing to $1.7078 by 1:33 p.m. EDT (1733 GMT), up 2.5 percent.
Harvey, the most powerful hurricane to hit Texas in more than 50 years, killed at least two people, caused large-scale flooding and forced closure of Houston port and several refineries.
The International Energy Agency in Paris said it was monitoring the storm are ready to respond to major oil supply disruptions.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Harvey was expected to linger close to the shore through Tuesday, with floods spreading from Texas eastward to Louisiana.
Texas is home to 5.6 million bpd of refining capacity, and Louisiana has 3.3 million bpd. Estimates say the storm has taken more than 2 million bpd of refining capacity offline.
Sources said the Motiva Port Arthur refinery in Texas, the largest U.S. refinery, was considering a shutdown.
U.S. traders were seeking oil product cargoes from North Asia, several refining and shipping sources told Reuters, with transatlantic fuel exports from Europe expected to surge.
""Global refining margins are going to stay very strong,"" said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Petromatrix.
""If (U.S.) refineries shut down for more than a week, Asia will need to run at a higher level, because there's no spare capacity in Europe."" 
On Monday Mexico's Pemex said supply of fuel was guaranteed in light of Harvey.
About 22 percent, or 379,000 bpd, of Gulf production was idled due to the storm as of Sunday afternoon, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said.
There might also be around 300,000 bpd of onshore U.S. production shut in, trading sources said.
In Libya pipeline blockades by militia brigades have slashed the OPEC state's output by nearly 400,000 bpd.

The market was also waiting for data on U.S. crude and refined product inventories. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast that U.S. crude inventories fell for the ninth straight week, while refined products also declined. The American Petroleum Institute (API) releases its data on Tuesday, and the U.S. government data is due on Wednesday.

Hurricane Harvey came ashore over the weekend as the most powerful hurricane to hit Texas in more than 50 years, killing at least two people, causing large-scale flooding, and forcing the closure of Houston port as well as several refineries.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Monday that Harvey was moving away from the coast but was expected to linger close to the shore through Tuesday, and that floods would spread from Texas eastward to Louisiana.
Texas is home to 5.6 million barrels of refining capacity per day, and Louisiana has 3.3 million barrels. Over 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity were estimated to be offline as a result of the storm.
About 22%, or 379,000 bpd, of Gulf production was idled due to the storm as of Sunday afternoon, according to the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. There may also be around 300,000 bpd of onshore U.S. production shut in, trading sources said.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude September contract was at $47.56 a barrel by 09:00 a.m. ET (13:00 GMT), down around 31 cents or 0.65%.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for October delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rose 15 cents or 0.29%, to $52.12 a barrel.
The commodity has been under pressure in recent weeks as concerns over rising U.S. shale output overshadowed production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, agreed since the start of the year to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018 in order to reduce a global supply glut and rebalance the market.
So far, the deal has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, as well as a relentless increase in U.S. shale output.
 Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for October advanced 3.75% to $1.601 a gallon. It climbed 7% earlier in the day to hit its highest since July 2015 at $1.618.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Monday that Harvey was moving away from the coast but was expected to linger close to the shore through Tuesday. The storm is expected to track towards Louisiana mid-week and then finally eject over the East late in the week.
Comfortable temperatures will continue over the central and east-central U.S. in the next five days, with highs only in the 70s to lower 80s as weather systems sweep through.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on late-summer cooling demand.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for cooling.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.125 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 6.7% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 1.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Early market expectations for this week's storage data due on Thursday is for a build in a range between 26 and 36 billion cubic feet in the week ended August 25.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - A hurricane in the heart of the U.S. energy industry is set to curtail near-record U.S. oil production for several weeks, with the impact expected to reverberate throughout the country and across international energy markets.
Harvey hit the Texas shore as a fierce Category 4 hurricane, causing massive flooding that has knocked out 11 percent of U.S. refining capacity, a quarter of oil production from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and closed ports all along the Texas coast. 
Gasoline futures jumped as much as 7 percent to their highest level in more than two years in early Monday trading in Asia as traders took stock of the storm's impact.
The outages will limit the availability of U.S. crude, gasoline and other refined products for global consumers and further push up prices, analysts said.
Damage assessments could take days to weeks to complete, and the storm continues to drop unprecedented levels of rain as it lingers west of Houston, home to oil, gas, pipeline and chemical plants. And restarts are dangerous periods, as fires and explosions can occur.
So far, the federal government has not announced if it will release barrels of oil or refined products from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which holds nearly 680 million barrels of oil.
The SPR was established in the 1970s to prevent supply shocks in the wake of an embargo imposed by several members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
""This is not like anything we have ever seen before,"" said Bruce Jefferis, chief executive of Aon Energy, a risk consulting practice. It is too soon to gauge the full extent of Harvey's damage to the region's energy infrastructure, he said. 
More than 30 inches (76 cm) fell in the Houston area in 48 hours and a lot more rain is forecast, according to the National Weather Service.
The storm was felt from coastal ports to inland oil and gas wells. Oil producers in the Eagle Ford shale region of south Texas have halted some operations.
At least four marine terminals in the Corpus Christi area, an export hub for energy deliveries to Latin America and Asia, remained closed due to the storm.
""We just simply don't know yet the damage all this rain will have on Houston's energy infrastructure,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of energy consultancy Lipow Oil Associates LLC. 
Texas refineries could be offline for up to a month if their storm-drainage pumps become submerged, he said.
As the storm churned towards Texas on Friday, U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) rose to their highest level in three years for this time of year. Those gains came even before several large Houston area refiners, including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), halted some operations. 
Exxon closed the second largest U.S. refinery, its 560,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Baytown, Texas, complex because of flooding. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) also halted operations at its 325,700-bpd Deer Park, Texas, refinery. The refinery may be shut for the week, it said.
Flooding on highways between Houston and Texas City nearer to the coast led Marathon Petroleum Corp (N:MPC) to cut back gasoline production at the company's 459,000-bpd Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, said sources familiar with plant operations.
Marathon Petroleum (N:MPC) employees were unable to drive to work and conditions at the plant forced the company to reduce gasoline output, said industry sources. Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry declined to discuss plant operations.
Not every plant in the region was hit. Operations were stable at the largest U.S. crude refinery, Motiva Enterprises' [MOTIV.UL] 603,000-bpd Port Arthur plant, the company said. 
Motiva double-staffed the refinery's crew ahead of the storm, as did  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) at the company's 225,500-bpd Port Arthur refinery, said sources familiar with plant operations.
Coastal refineries in Texas account for one-quarter of the U.S. crude oil refining capacity. All of those refineries have been impacted by Harvey since Thursday when refineries in Corpus Christi, Texas, shut in production ahead of the storm's landfall on Friday. 
Colonial Pipeline, the largest mover of gasoline, diesel and other refined products in the United States, said its operations had not been affected by Harvey. Any disruptions to the conduit would send prices across the U.S. Southeast and Northeast soaring. Traders have been keeping a close eye on whether there will be an outage at the pipeline.

Citgo Petroleum Corp [PDVSAC.UL] and Flint Hills Resources [FHR.UL], two of the refiners that closed last week as the storm approached, did not provide updates about the status of their Corpus Christi refineries on Sunday.

461,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 27, 2017 05:22AM ET</span>",Crude oil futures - weekly outlook: August 28 - September 1,"Investing.com - Oil prices ended higher on Friday, as Hurricane Harvey threatened to disrupt production and refinery activity along the Gulf Coast.
About 25% of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production was offline due to storm activity, the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said on Saturday. That equates to approximately 428,568 barrels of oil per day out of the roughly 1.75 million bpd pumped from the Gulf.
Around 112 platforms have been evacuated in the Gulf so far as a result of Harvey, about 15% of those in the region. Half of the drilling rigs in the Gulf have also been evacuated, BSEE said.
Prices received additional support after an update from oilfield services firm Baker Hughes showed its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the U.S. fell for the second time in row, by four rigs to a total of 759.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude October contract tacked on 44 cents, or around 0.9%, to end at $47.87 a barrel by close of trade.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for October delivery advanced 37 cents, or about 0.7%, to settle at $52.41 a barrel.
The rise in oil prices on Friday failed to offset losses sustained earlier in the week, as crude futures slipped to their fourth-straight weekly loss.
New York-traded crude ended the week down 64 cents, or nearly 1.3%, while the global Brent benchmark shed 31 cents, or roughly 0.6%.
Oil prices have been under pressure in recent weeks as concern over rising U.S. shale output canceled out production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, agreed since the start of the year to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018 in order to reduce a global supply glut and rebalance the market.
So far, the deal has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, as well as a relentless increase in U.S. shale output.
Because of soaring U.S. output, the discount of WTI crude to Brent rose to its widest in almost two years at $4.54 per barrel.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for September inched up 0.2 cents, or about 0.2%, to end at $1.666 on Friday, but that represented a hefty retreat from the nearly five-month highs of $1.740 seen earlier in the session. It closed around 2.6% higher for the week.
Meanwhile, September heating oil edged up by less than 0.1% to $1.622 a gallon, ending around 0.1% higher on the week.
Natural gas futures for September delivery shed 5.0 cents, or 1.9%, to settle at $2.892 per million British thermal units, little changed for the week.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Meanwhile, traders will also continue to pay close attention to comments from global oil producers for evidence that they are complying with their agreement to reduce output this year.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.
Tuesday, August 29
The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, is to publish its weekly report on U.S. oil supplies.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2017 01:24PM ET</span>",Flood threat rises as Harvey dumps torrential rains on Texas,"By Brian Thevenot
ROCKPORT, Texas (Reuters) - The most powerful hurricane to hit the U.S. state of Texas in more than 50 years moved slowly inland on Saturday, dumping torrential rain expected to cause catastrophic flooding after battering the coast with 130 miles per hour (209 km per hour) winds.
Texas utility companies said just under a quarter of a million customers were without power. Wind and rain continued to lash the coast as residents began to assess the damage.
Harvey is the strongest storm to hit Texas, the center of the U.S. oil and gas industry, since 1961.
The seaside town of Rockport, 30 miles (48 km) north of the city of Corpus Christi, was hit hard. 
Several homes had collapsed, and many more buildings suffered damage. Roofs had been ripped off some, and windows blown in.
The streets were flooded and strewn with power lines and debris. At a recreational vehicle sales lot, a dozen vehicles were flipped over and one had been blown into the middle of the street outside.
""It was terrible,"" resident Joel Valdez, 57, told Reuters. The storm ripped part of the roof from his trailer home at around 4 a.m., he said. ""I could feel the whole house move.""
Valdez said he stayed through the storm to look after his animals. 
""I have these miniature donkeys and I don't know where they are,"" he said, as he sat in a Jeep with windows smashed by the storm.
Resident Frank Cook, 56, also stayed through the storm.
""If you have something left of your house, you’re lucky,"" he said, surveying the damage from his vehicle.
Before the storm hit, Rockport's mayor told anyone staying behind to write their names on their arms for identification purposes in case of death or injury.
A high school, hotel, senior housing complex and other buildings suffered structural damage, according to emergency officials and local media. Some were being used as shelters.
The coastal city of Port Lavaca, farther north on the coast, had no power and some streets were flooded.
""There is so much tree damage and debris that the cost of cleanup will be enormous,"" Mayor Jack Whitlow told Reuters, after touring the city earlier Saturday.
The hurricane came ashore near Port Lavaca late on Friday with maximum winds of 130 mph (209 km/h). That made it a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale, the second-highest category and the most powerful storm in over a decade to hit the mainland United States.
The streets of Corpus Christi, which has around 320,000 residents, were deserted early on Saturday, with billboards twisted and strong winds still blowing.
City authorities asked residents to reduce use of toilets and faucets because power outages left waste water plants unable to treat sewage. 
The city also asked residents to boil water before consumption.
A drill ship broke free of its mooring overnight and rammed into some tugs in the port of Corpus Christi, port executive Sean Strawbridge said. The crews on the tugs were safe, he added.
The city was under voluntary evacuation ahead of the storm. 
HEADING INLAND, STORM WEAKENS
The storm weakened to Category 1 early on Saturday and was expected to be downgraded to a tropical storm later in the day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Harvey was about 150 miles (241 km) west-southwest of Houston, moving at about 2 mph (4 km/h), the center said in a morning update.
Harvey was expected to linger for days over Texas and bring as much as 40 inches (101.6 cm) of rain to some parts of the state.
The latest forecast storm track has Harvey looping back toward the Gulf of Mexico coast before meandering north again on Tuesday. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2g9jZ0W)
Nearly 10 inches (25 cm) of rain had already fallen in a few areas in southeastern Texas, the center said. Flash floods have already hit some areas, the National Weather Service said.
As many as 6 million people were believed to be in Harvey's path, as is the heart of America's oil-refining operations. The storm's impact on refineries has already pushed up gasoline prices. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency eased rules on gasoline specifications late on Friday to reduce shortages. 
U.S. President Donald Trump, facing the first big natural disaster of his term, said on Twitter he signed a disaster proclamation that ""unleashes the full force of government help"" shortly before Harvey made landfall.
""You are doing a great job - the world is watching,"" Trump said on Saturday in a tweet referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which coordinates the response to major disasters. 
Utilities  American Electric  Power Company Inc (NYSE:AEP) and CenterPoint Energy Inc (NYSE:CNP) reported a combined total of around 237,000 customers without power.
While thousands fled the expected devastating flooding and destruction, many residents stayed put in imperiled towns and stocked up on food, fuel and sandbags.
HOUSTON PREPARES FOR FLOODS
The size and strength dredged up memories of Katrina, the 2005 hurricane that made a direct hit on New Orleans as a Category 3 storm, causing levees and flood walls to fail in dozens of places. About 1,800 died in the disaster made worse by a slow government emergency response.
Texas and Louisiana declared states of disaster before Harvey hit, authorizing the use of state resources to prepare. 
Residents of Houston, the nation's fourth most populous city, were awakened early on Saturday by automatic cell phone warnings of flash floods.
The city warned of flooding from close to 20 inches (60 cm) of rain over several days. 
GASOLINE PRICES SPIKE
U.S. gasoline prices spiked as the storm shut down several refineries and 22 percent of Gulf of Mexico oil production, according to the U.S. government. Many fuel stations ran out of gasoline before the storm hit.
More than 45 percent of the country's refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast, and nearly a fifth of the nation's crude is produced offshore.
Ports from Corpus Christi to Texas City, Texas, were closed to incoming vessels and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc, Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and others have evacuated staff from offshore oil and gas platforms.
Disruptions to fuel supply drove benchmark gasoline prices to their highest level in four months.
The U.S. government said it would make emergency stockpiles of crude available if needed to plug disruptions. It has regularly used them to dampen the impact of previous storms on energy supplies.

465,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2017 03:50PM ET</span>",Chile's presidential hopefuls propose sweeping changes in mining sector,"By Gram Slattery
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Two of Chile's three main candidates in the November presidential election proposed broad changes for the mining sector at a forum on Friday hosted by the country's largest business organization.
At the event organized by business group Sofafa in downtown Santiago, center-left candidate Alejandro Guillier struck a pro-business tone but said he would consider modifying free trade accords to promote the local smelting industry.
Hard-left candidate Beatriz Sanchez, meanwhile, pushed for billions of dollars in new taxes on mining companies, a stark contrast to proposals from a representative of conservative frontrunner Sebastian Pinera to streamline the permitting process for new mines.
Pinera, a billionaire former president, currently has a large lead in the polls over Guillier and Sanchez. However, it is unlikely any candidate will win enough votes in the Nov. 19 election to avoid a December runoff, and any second-round vote with Pinera looks to be much closer.
Among the key policy areas that investors are watching is mining, as Chile is the world's number one copper exporter but faces falling productivity as much of the country's best-quality ore has already been mined.
Guillier told the gathering that his government would speed up Chile's environmental permitting process, which many have accused of being too onerous. He said the government could avoid inter-agency confusion by delegating more decision-making to regional authorities.
Guillier added that the government needed to take a more hands-on approach to promoting value-added industry, given that Chile - despite being the wealthiest nation in Latin America - is still heavily dependent on raw material exports.
He said his campaign team was studying the possibility of modifying free trade accords which penalize refined copper exports from Chile, in effect incentivizing raw concentrate.
""We can't keep growing only on raw material exports,"" Guillier said. ""We have to advance toward adding value.""
Sanchez, who represents the newly formed Frente Amplio bloc, pledged to hike mining taxes to raise an estimated $1.8 billion to $2.5 billion in funds to pay for a revamp of the nation's increasingly unpopular social security system.
She added that she would like to see state-run copper giant Codelco [COBRE.UL] play a larger role in Chile's mining industry.
Francisco Orrego Bauza, a lawyer and legislative aide representing investor favorite Pinera, gave relatively few specifics and did not take questions. His speech focused on spurring private sector investment, and he said a Pinera government would create an agency that actively supports large-scale and greenfield mining projects.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery rose 44 cents to settle at $47.87 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 37 cents to trade at $52.41 a barrel.
Government weather agencies said Harvey became a Category 2 storm as it crossed the Gulf of Mexico with winds of 110 mph (175 kph), 145 miles (235 km) off Port O'Connor, Texas.
Analysts expect the main hit to the industry would probably be caused by flooding and power cuts, leading to disruption at refineries, reducing demand for crude, the primary input at refineries.
“Demand numbers might suffer, and some [crude-oil] inventories might increase while refinery production also dips.” said Richard Hastings, macro strategist at Seaport Global Securities.
Two refineries in Corpus Christi, Texas - Flint Hills Resources' 296,470 barrels per day plant and Citgo Petroleum's 157,000 bpd plant - were shutting down operations in preparation of the storm.
More than 45% of the nation’s petroleum refining capacity is located along the Gulf Coast, as well as 51% of U.S. natural-gas, processing plant capacity, according to the EIA.
The rise in oil prices on Friday failed to offset losses sustained over the past few days, as crude futures slipped to their fourth-straight weekly loss.
Falling crude prices have weighed on U.S. drilling activity over recent weeks, as data showed the number of U.S. oil rigs continued to drop.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the United States fell by four to a total of 759 this week.

According to investing.com’s fed rate monitor just over 30% of traders expect the fed to hike rates in December, compared to nearly 50% in the prior week. 
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. 
Gold has traded in a narrow range so far this week, but remained on track to post a weekly gain, as investor doubts grew over the possibility of tax-reform amid rising turmoil in Washington.

Oil prices strengthened as markets prepared for potential output disruptions as Hurricane Harvey headed for the heart of the U.S. oil industry in the Gulf of Mexico.
The storm has intensified since Thursday and could potentially be the biggest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in 12 years. It is currently taking aim between Houston and Corpus Christi on the coast of Texas.
The commodity was hit earlier in the week after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said domestic crude production rose to its highest level since July 2015, although crude oil inventories fell for the eight consecutive week.
Oil prices have also been under pressure in recent weeks despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to limit production in order to boost prices.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday as the U.S. petroleum industry braced for Hurricane Harvey, which has grown into what may become the biggest storm to hit the U.S. mainland in more than a decade.
Harvey has rapidly intensified since Thursday, spinning into potentially the biggest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in 12 years, and expected to the coast of Texas between Houston and Corpus Christi.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $47.83 a barrel at 0703 GMT, up 40 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last settlement.
International Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $52.53 per barrel, up 49 cents, or 0.9 percent, from their last close.
Prices rose as production in the affected area shut down in preparation for the hurricane, and on expectations that closures could last if the storm causes extensive damage.
""Damage and flooding to refineries and shale fields, disrupted production in the Gulf of Mexico and infrastructure damage are unlikely to be bearish for WTI,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA.
Traders said U.S. imports could also be affected due to interrupted shipping.
U.S. gasoline prices (RBc1) have shot up by almost 10 percent since Wednesday to $1.73 per gallon, their highest level since April as refiners shut down in preparation to the storm.
The Port of Corpus Christi, Texas, was closed to vessel traffic, a spokeswoman for the city's Port Authority said on Thursday. Oil refineries in the city operated by Citgo Petroleum,  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) and Flint Hills Resources also began shutting down ahead of the storm.
Beyond the storm's potential impact on the oil industry, crude remains in ample supply globally despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to hold back production in order to prop up prices.
OPEC, together with non-OPEC producers including Russia, has pledged to cut output by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) this year and during the first quarter of 2018.
However, not all producers have lived up to their pledges and supplies remain high, resulting in the ongoing low prices.
A joint OPEC, non-OPEC monitoring ministerial committee said on Thursday that an extension to the supply-cut pact beyond March was possible, though not yet decided.
Part of the reason for the crude glut has been rising U.S. production, which has jumped by 13 percent since mid-2016 to 9.53 million bpd, close to its 9.61 million bpd record from June 2015. 
Because of soaring U.S. output, the discount of WTI crude to Brent on Friday rose to its widest in almost two years at 4.69 per barrel. 
Deeply discounted WTI makes U.S. crude exports attractive, and Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows shipments to Asia and Europe hit a combined record of over 450,000 bpd during the first half of the year.

Comex gold futures were steady at $1,292.06 a troy ounce by 03:00 a.m. ET (07:00 GMT).
Neither Yellen nor Draghi were expected to announce new policy messages later Friday, but market participants will be eyeing any potential hints on future policy moves.
Gold prices had benefited from a weaker dollar earlier in the week, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would be willing to shut down the government to finance a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and that he might terminate the NAFTA trade treaty.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 93.26.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 0.01% to $1,291.94 a troy ounce.
Overnight, gold prices were flat amid thin trading volumes as market participants awaited clues on monetary policy from a central banking symposium in Jackson Hall which got underway on Thursday.
Gold traded in a narrow $6 range, as traders appeared to keep their powder dry ahead of key speeches by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.
Draghi, however, is not expected to offer much insight into the European Central Bank’s thinking on monetary policy but traders are expected to parse Yellen’s comments to gauge the Fed’s sentiment on a third rate hike later this year.
Analyst expectations have turned lower for a third rate hike in December, following the release of the Fed’s minutes last week showing that policymakers remained concerned with the slow pace of inflation.
“Yes the Fed may hike in December and yes the ECB may announce a further taper for 2018 in October but recent events (softer inﬂation, softer market sentiment and the strong Euro for the ECB) may mean that now might not be the time they choose to guide markets towards such an outcome”. Analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said.
According to investing.com’s fed rate monitor just over 30% of traders expect the fed to hike rates in December, compared to nearly 50% in the prior week.

Hurricane Harvey rapidly intensified overnight Thursday, spinning into the potentially biggest hurricane to hit the mainland United States in dozen years with landfall in refinery alley near Houston and Corpus Christi in Texas. An estimated 870,000 barrels of capacity may be curbed as refiners eye the storm's track, according to analysts. Also ahead are weekly U.S. rig count figures.
Overnight, crude futures settled lower on Thursday, as Hurricane Harvey looks set to hit the refinery hub of the U.S., stoking fears of an uptick in crude supplies as refineries are expected to shut down operations.
Sentiment on oil futures soured, as traders anticipated a rise in supplies of crude oil, the primary input at refineries amid expectations of refinery outages along the U.S. Gulf Coast, after the U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasted Harvey was expected to be a major hurricane when it approaches the middle Texas coast on Friday.
“Demand numbers might suffer, and some [crude-oil] inventories might increase while refinery production also dips.” said Richard Hastings, macro strategist at Seaport Global Securities.
Two refineries in Corpus Christi, Texas - Flint Hills Resources' 296,470 barrels per day plant and Citgo Petroleum's 157,000 bpd plant - were shutting down operations in preparation of the storm.More than 45% of the nation’s petroleum refining capacity is located along the Gulf Coast, as well as 51% of U.S. natural-gas, processing plant capacity, according to the EIA.
The slump in crude oil prices comes a day after the Energy Information Agency (EIA) released a report showing that supplies of crude fell for an eighth straight week.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 3.3m barrels in the week ended Aug 18, missing expectations of a draw of about 3.5m barrels.
The trend of falling crude supplies, however, comes against the backdrop of the rising U.S. crude output to a more than two-year high.
The EIA reported that total domestic crude production rose 26,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.528m bpd last week, holding at levels not seen since July 2015.

The two sides had hoped to settle the matter before talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)opened last week but little progress has been made.
""The coming weeks will be critical to determine whether we have a partner in the United States prepared to advance our shared interests,"" said a joint statement issued by Canada's ambassador to the United States and envoys from the major lumber-producing Canadian provinces.
The statement also said ""provinces are prepared to proceed with litigation on all fronts if a fair solution cannot be achieved."" Canada's Liberal government had already made clear it would be prepared if necessary to launch a case against the United States at the World Trade Organisation.
The U.S. Commerce Department was not immediately available for comment.

The bilateral dispute is the fifth over lumber in less than 40 years. U.S. firms have long accused Canada of unfairly subsidizing its lumber producers through low fees for timber cut on public lands, a charge Ottawa rejects.

477,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2017 05:48PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. steel executives appeal directly to Trump for import restrictions,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American steel industry executives have appealed directly to President Donald Trump for immediate import restrictions in a letter seen by Reuters, as a U.S. Commerce Department national security probe languishes and steel imports surge back to 2015 levels. 
Senior executives from 25 U.S. steel and steel-related companies sent the letter to Trump late on Wednesday, saying the industry was suffering the consequences of government inaction that could change with his ""bold leadership"" and ""America First"" vision.
""The need for action is urgent. Since the 232 investigation was announced in April, imports have continued to surge,"" the executives said in the letter.
""Immediate action must meaningfully adjust imports to restore healthy levels of capacity utilization and profitability to the domestic industry over a sustained period,"" they wrote.
A White House spokeswoman said she could not immediately comment on the letter.
The Commerce Department has delayed the release of its recommendations from a ""Section 232"" investigation into whether steel imports pose a threat to national security, a finding that could lead to Trump imposing broad quotas or tariffs on steel imports. 
The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), an industry trade group, reported on Wednesday that total steel imports through July this year were up 22 percent from the same period a year ago, with imports taking 28 percent of the U.S. market.
Imports captured 30 percent of the U.S. market in June, according to Commerce Department data compiled by the institute. Steel imports dipped briefly last year because of Commerce Department anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties imposed on steel products from China and some other countries.
The letter followed last week's departure of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who had been a vocal advocate for steel tariffs and other trade protections in the administration's internal debates over trade.
'SOONER RATHER THAN LATER'
The executives from companies including  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE) U.S. Steel (N:X), ArcelorMittal (AS:MT) and Commercial Metals Co (N:CMC) said the sustained surge of steel imports into the United States had ""hollowed out"" much of the domestic steel industry and was threatening its ability to meet national security needs.
""Your leadership in finding a solution to the crisis facing the steel industry is badly needed now. Only you can authorize actions that can solve this crisis and we are asking for your immediate assistance,"" they wrote.
Under the Cold War-era law authorizing the steel national security probe, Trump would have 90 days to act once the Commerce Department submits its probe.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had set an internal deadline for announcing his steel recommendations at the end of June, but it was delayed for a G20 summit and bilateral talks with China in July. Trump said later that month a final decision may wait until other top priority issues on his agenda are addressed, including healthcare and taxes. 
The steel executives are concerned that the Commerce report could be delayed further, pushing off a decision on quotas or tariffs until next year and allowing more foreign steel to flood the U.S. market, said Philip Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association, who also signed the letter.
""This needs to be wrapped up sooner rather than later and we wanted to help the president understand that,"" Bell said.
Another signatory, AISI President Tom Gibson, told Reuters the industry was trying to keep the issue ""front and center"" while Trump administration officials deal with a range of other issues from North Korea to fiscal policy.
He said that domestic steel producers' capacity utilization rate was hovering around 75 percent, as steelmakers from South Korea to Turkey target U.S. demand to soak up their excess output.

""Over the long term, that is not a sustainable level,"" Gibson said.

478,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2017 03:38PM ET</span>","U.S. Energy Department grid study calls for boost to coal, nuclear power","By Valerie Volcovici and Nichola Groom
WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A U.S. Energy Department report calls for incentives to boost coal-fired and nuclear power plants following a slew of closures that it said undermined reliable sources of electricity. 
The findings of the study, released late on Wednesday, drew praise from the coal and nuclear industries and a mixed reaction from renewable energy groups - some of which said the report's recommendations could help them too. 
President Donald Trump has promised to revive the ailing coal mining sector but has also said he welcomes all forms of energy development to shore up domestic production.
Energy Secretary Rick Perry commissioned the grid study in April to evaluate whether ""regulatory burdens"" imposed by past administrations, including that of former President Barack Obama, had hurt the grid by forcing shutdowns of baseload plants, which provide nonstop power, like those fired by coal and nuclear fuel.
Obama introduced regulations intended to slash emissions of carbon dioxide, which are blamed for climate change. This accelerated the retirement of coal-fired power plants and bolstered the nascent solar and wind sectors, which depend heavily on weather conditions for their power output. 
""It is apparent that in today’s competitive markets certain regulations and subsidies are having a large impact on the functioning of markets, and thereby challenging our power generation mix,"" Perry said in a letter introducing the study. ""It is important for policy makers to consider their intended and unintended effects.""
The study, conducted by the department's staff, said cheap natural gas was the main driver of the closure of baseload coal and nuclear plants, a trend that was putting areas of the country at greater risk of power outages. 
The department recommended giving baseload plants pricing advantages for their power, as well as making it easier and cheaper to get permits to build more such projects.
MIXED REACTION
The report differed from an earlier draft, which had said big increases in renewable power generation remained possible without undermining grid reliability, and which did not propose added support for baseload producers. 
The administration had not yet reviewed the earlier draft, which was written by department staff. 
Some coal and nuclear energy groups welcomed the final report's findings.
""This is a much-needed, pragmatic look at U.S. electricity reliability and resilience, including the priority of maintaining critical clean baseload power as electricity markets change,"" said Rich Powell, director of ClearPath, which advocates for nuclear and hydropower.
Renewable fuels supporters had a wide range of reactions. The Center for Biological Diversity called the report's recommendations ""dangerously misguided,"" and the Sierra Club also bashed the study.
But America's biggest solar and wind power associations said they felt the study contained elements that were positive such as not singling out renewable energy as a big problem.
""The report did not... lay the demise of coal at the feet of renewable energy, and that is an important finding,"" Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, wrote in an email to the trade group's members on Thursday.
SEIA and other groups, including the American Wind Energy Association, said wind and solar could benefit from some of the report's recommendations, such as a call for infrastructure development and market reforms.

AWEA said in a blog post that technological advances could allow wind energy to provide reliability services, such as fast ramping to regulate the grid's frequency signal.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for October delivery fell 2% to settle at $47.43 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent slid 1% to trade at $52.05 a barrel.
Sentiment on oil futures soured, as traders anticipated a rise in supplies of crude oil, the primary input at refineries amid expectations of refinery outages along the U.S. Gulf Coast, after the U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasted Harvey was expected to be a major hurricane when it approaches the middle Texas coast on Friday.
“Demand numbers might suffer, and some [crude-oil] inventories might increase while refinery production also dips.” said Richard Hastings, macro strategist at Seaport Global Securities.
Two refineries in Corpus Christi, Texas - Flint Hills Resources' 296,470 barrels per day plant and Citgo Petroleum's 157,000 bpd plant - were shutting down operations in preparation of the storm.
More than 45% of the nation’s petroleum refining capacity is located along the Gulf Coast, as well as 51% of U.S. natural-gas, processing plant capacity, according to the EIA.
The slump in crude oil prices comes a day after the Energy Information Agency (EIA) released a report showing that supplies of crude fell for an eighth straight week.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 3.3m barrels in the week ended Aug 18, missing expectations  of a draw of about 3.5m barrels.
The trend of falling crude supplies, however, comes against the backdrop of the rising U.S. crude output to a more than two-year high.
The EIA reported that total domestic crude production rose 26,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.528m bpd last week, holding at levels not seen since July 2015."

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $3.27, or 0.25%, to $1,291.42 a troy ounce.
Gold traded in a narrow $6 range, as traders appeared to keep their powder dry ahead of key speeches by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.
Draghi, however, is not expected to offer much insight into the European Central Bank’s thinking on monetary policy but traders are expected to parse Yellen’s comments to gauge the Fed’s sentiment on a third rate hike later this year.
Analyst expectations have turned lower for a third rate hike in December, following the release of the Fed’s minutes last week showing that policymakers remained concerned with the slow pace of inflation.
“Yes the Fed may hike in December and yes the ECB may announce a further taper for 2018 in October but recent events (softer inﬂation, softer market sentiment and the strong Euro for the ECB) may mean that now might not be the time they choose to guide markets towards such an outcome”. Analysts at Deutsche Bank said.
According to investing.com’s fed rate monitor just over 30% of traders expect the fed to hike rates in December, compared to nearly 50% in the prior week.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 43 billion cubic feet in the week ended August 18, while analysts had forecast a decrease of just 45 billion.
Natural gas for delivery in August on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained 4.6 cents, or 1.54%, to trade at $2.972 per million British thermal units by 10:33AM ET (14:33GMT).
Futures initially popped to hit an intraday high of $2.982, but quickly pared those gains and were last up around 1.46% at around $2.971 prior to the release of the supply data.
That compared with a build of 53 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the preceding week and represented a decline of 223 billion from a year earlier but was 45 bcf above the five-year average.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 3.125trillion cubic feet, 6.7% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 1.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
A weather system with showers and cooling will sweep across the central and east-central U.S. through the end of the week, dropping demand to much lighter levels due to highs only reaching the 70s to lower 80s Fahrenheit.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on late-summer cooling demand.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for cooling."

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude September contract was at $47.98 a barrel by 09:15 a.m. ET (13:15 GMT), down around 44 cents or 0.83%.
Brent oil for October delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London lost 22 cents, or 0.42%, to $52.35 a barrel.
Oil prices weakened after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Wednesday that domestic crude production edged up by 26,000 barrels a day to 9.528 million last week, the highest level since July 2015.
However, crude oil inventories fell by 3.3 million barrels, the eighth weekly decline in a row.
Gasoline stockpiles were down 1.2 million barrels for the week, according to the EIA.
Oil prices have been under pressure in recent weeks as concern over rising U.S. shale output canceled out production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, agreed since the start of the year to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018 in order to reduce a global supply glut and rebalance the market.
So far, the deal has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, as well as a relentless increase in U.S. shale output.

“Yes the Fed may hike in December and yes the ECB may announce a further taper for 2018 in October but recent events (softer inflation, softer market sentiment and the strong Euro for the ECB) may mean that now might not be the time they choose to guide markets towards such an outcome”.

The estimate, calculated by the University of Wageningen at the request of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, was sent to parliament on Wednesday ahead of a debate on how the affair has been handled.
Investigators in early August detected fipronil, a flea poison, in slightly higher than acceptable levels on Dutch chicken farms, leading quickly to culls, quarantines and other measures to prevent further production of contaminated eggs..
In the following days, millions of Dutch chicken eggs and products containing egg were recalled in countries around Europe and as far away as Asia.
Two Dutch men who ran the cleaning company Chickfriend were arrested and continue to be held in the Netherlands on suspicion of threatening public health for using the chemical on chicken farms.
Belgian authorities are investigating whether the Belgian firm that sold Chickfriend a cleaning product containing fipronil was also aware, complicit or responsible for it entering the food chain.
The university's calculation of the damages to around 200 Dutch chicken farms did not attempt to measure the probably greater financial damages caused by the international egg recalls.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday, weighed down by concerns of oversupply as Libyan output improves and as U.S. gasoline inventories rose despite the peak summer driving season.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1), the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $51.65 per barrel at 0655 GMT, down 22 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $47.65 a barrel, down 18 cents, or 0.4 percent.
Libya's Sharara oil field, the country's largest, was gradually restarting on Tuesday after a shutdown, although instability in the country means that output there could be volatile, traders said.
Sharara recently reached output of 280,000 barrels per day (bpd), but closed earlier this week due to a pipeline blockade. Its production is key to Libya's oil output, which surged above 1 million bpd in late June, about four times its level last summer.
Libya's rising output is a headache for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which together with non-OPEC producers including Russia has pledged to hold back around 1.8 million bpd of supplies between January this year and March 2018 to tighten supplies.
However, OPEC has so far fallen short of its pledge, in part due to Libya's strong output. The OPEC-member has been exempt from cuts.
""Sentiment towards oil remains bearish amid oversupply fears and the possible threat of OPEC's supply cut deal falling apart,"" said Lukman Otunuga, analyst at futures brokerage FXTM.
The next meeting of a ministerial committee of OPEC and non-OPEC states to discuss their production pact has been proposed for Sept. 22.
In the United States, crude inventories fell by 3.6 million barrels in the week to Aug. 18 to 465.6 million, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said Tuesday.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA said that the rising U.S. gasoline inventories were ""not a good sign during the U.S. summer driving season"" during which fuel demand tends to be high.
Official inventory data by the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due to be released late on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Bernstein Research warned that low prices and ample supplies were resulting in low oil industry investment levels.

""We see (oil and gas)... order intake activity at almost the same low level as in 2016 ... For now, we remind investors that contract levels appear to still be insufficient to drive recovery in earnings,"" it said.

The U.S. Commerce Department will impose countervailing duties on Argentine and Indonesian biodiesel ranging from 50.29 percent to 64.17 percent for biodiesel from Argentina and 41.06 percent to 68.28 percent for biodiesel from Indonesia.
Argentina accounts for two-thirds of U.S. biodiesel imports, which totaled 916 million gallons (3.5 billion liters) in 2016, according to U.S. government data. Total U.S. biodiesel consumption is about 2 billion gallons.
Argentine biodiesel association Carbio said the duties would result in the immediate suspension of exports to the United States.
U.S. trade group Advanced Biofuels Association (ABFA) said the duties would raise fuel prices.
""Fuel provided from ocean-going trade is far cheaper for coastal communities than Midwest products transported via rail,"" said ABFA President Michael McAdams. ""We believe that the federal government is capable of finding a better resolution to this issue that will benefit all countries involved.""
The finding comes after the U.S. National Biodiesel Board (NBB) in March asked the government to impose countervailing and antidumping duties against the foreign imports, claiming the supplies were entering the country below market value and undercutting U.S. biodiesel producers.
""We're grateful that the Commerce Department has taken preliminary steps that will allow our industry to compete on a level playing field,"" said NBB Chief Executive Officer Doug Whitehead.

U.S. natural gas for September delivery was at $2.998 per million British thermal units by 8:15AM ET (1215GMT), up 3.6 cents, or around 1.2%. It touched its highest since August 14 at $3.000 earlier.
Futures posted their strongest one-day gain in roughly two weeks on Monday, jumping 2.5% after updated weather forecasting models showed that hot high pressure will dominate most of the U.S. in the week ahead.
Highs of upper 80s to 100s are expected to drive considerably stronger than normal national demand until the end of the week.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on late-summer cooling demand.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for cooling.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.082 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 7.6% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 1.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Early market expectations for this week's storage data due on Thursday is for a build in a range between 37 and 47 billion cubic feet in the week ended August 18.
That compares with a gain of 53 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 11 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 53 billion cubic feet.

OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, agreed since the start of the year to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018 in order to reduce a global supply glut and rebalance the market.
However, so far, the deal has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, as well as a relentless increase in U.S. shale output.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell nearly 2 percent on Monday, pulling back from last week's rally built on signs the global market is starting to rebalance from chronic oversupply.

U.S. hedge funds and money managers have already started reducing bets on rising prices, with Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showing on Friday that investors had cut bullish bets on U.S. crude for a second straight week.
Investors in Europe disagree on the outlook, however, as data from the InterContinental Exchange showed speculators raised bullish Brent crude bets last week.
The world remains awash with oil despite a deal struck by some of the world's biggest producers to rein in output. Rising U.S. production has been a major factor keeping supply and demand from balancing. 
There are indications that U.S. output may soon slow, as energy companies cut rigs drilling for new oil for a second week in three, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday. Drillers cut five rigs in the week to Aug. 18, decreasing the count to 763.

528,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2017 08:02AM ET</span>",Special Report: Refiner Valero's secret campaign against U.S. biofuels mandates,"By Chris Prentice
(Reuters) - U.S. biofuels regulations, which mandate mixing corn-based ethanol into gasoline, have lately drawn together a diverse cast of political opponents.
They include an upstart gas station owners' trade group, a former Obama administration environmental adviser and billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, who owns a refiner and served as U.S. President Donald Trump's special advisor on business regulation - until he resigned Friday amid allegations of a conflict of interest.
Even the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), a leading biofuels industry group, recently dropped its opposition to policy changes sought by this ad hoc coalition.
These players would seem to have few shared interests, but they share one key connection – close ties to  Valero Energy  Corp. (N:VLO), America's largest oil refiner.
As part of an extensive behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign, Valero played a key role in bringing these people and groups together around a policy proposal that could save the refiner hundreds of millions of dollars each year in regulatory costs, according to two former Valero executives with knowledge of the firms' lobbying strategy.
Valero is a big loser under current regulations, which require refiners to either blend biofuels into their gasoline and diesel or buy government-issued credits from firms that do such mixing. After selling off much of its ethanol-blending operations in cash-raising deals in 2006 and 2013, Valero was forced to spend $750 million last year alone buying the credits, according to Valero's securities filings.
The policy overhaul favored by Valero would free refiners from the obligation to blend biofuels or buy credits, shifting that burden to firms further down the supply chain toward retailers.
Such a change would amount to a multi-billion-dollar transfer of wealth to Valero. It would also benefit Icahn's refining company, CVR Energy (N:CVI), and a handful of other refiners that lack blending operations.
Top Valero officials wanted others to act as the public face of the push to upend renewable fuels policy, the former Valero executives told Reuters.
""There was an effort to line up people who would support us who were more palatable to decision makers,"" said one of the former executives. ""It's easier to support a small business than a big refining company.""
In response to Reuters' inquiries, Valero stressed that it has publicly criticized current regulations. Spokeswoman Lillian Riojas called the rules harmful to ""workers, small business retailers, consumers, the refining base, energy security and even the drive for more biofuels blending.""
Valero has joined petitions to change the law, sued the EPA, and sent executives to challenge the policy at industry conferences. But its more extensive and less visible lobbying through proxies served a purpose – to create a perception of broader support for a change that would primarily benefit Valero and a small number of other refiners.
The push to change the so-called ""point of obligation"" for biofuels blending is opposed by most ethanol producers and large integrated oil companies with blending facilities. They argue the shift would rope in thousands of additional companies - from gasoline retailers to shippers such as FedEx (NYSE:FDX) - and undermine the program by complicating enforcement.
The Trump administration has said it is considering the regulatory changes, but it has not announced a decision.
In early August, three sources familiar with the administration's biofuels policy deliberations told Reuters that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was preparing to reject proposals for the change. The White House declined comment and referred questions to the EPA, which did not respond to requests for comment.
Valero strategists viewed Icahn as a better public advocate to change biofuels policy despite his majority ownership of a small refinery, the two Valero executives said. That's because the famous Wall Street investor has a diverse array of business interests and unique access to Trump, a longtime friend.
""Our folks wanted to get him involved,"" said one of the Valero executives, who was regularly involved in company discussions on biofuels lobbying.
When Icahn wrote the EPA in August of 2016 to push for the policy change - arguing current rules create a ""rigged market"" - representatives from Valero helped him craft the letter, the executive said.
Valero declined to comment on its role in crafting Icahn's proposal. Jesse Lynn, a lawyer for Icahn, said the billionaire ""sought input from a number of people"" on the letter but declined to name them.
Shortly after being elected, Trump named Icahn his special advisor on regulation, an informal role.
Icahn stepped down from the post on Friday after facing criticism that he was advising Trump on policy changes that would enrich his refining business. Icahn denied any conflicts of interest late Friday in an open letter to Trump.
""I never sought any special benefit for any company with which I have been involved, and have only expressed views that I believed would benefit the refining industry as a whole,"" he wrote.
The White House has said there is no conflict of interest between Icahn's refining business and his biofuels policy advocacy because he was not paid as a presidential advisor.
'REGULATORY HAIL MARY’
The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was adopted in 2005 during the presidency of Republican George W. Bush as a way to bolster U.S. energy independence, reduce pollution and support Midwest corn farmers. Today, about 10 percent of U.S. motor fuel comes from vegetation.
The law's critics - which cover a broad ideological spectrum, from fossil-fuel firms to environmentalists - argue variously that it is essentially a farming subsidy; that ethanol hurts gas mileage and does little to help the environment; and that its impact in reducing foreign oil dependence has been dwarfed by booming U.S. oil production.
Jack Lipinski, chief executive of Icahn's CVR Energy, told Reuters that the current rules create a ""contrived and manipulated marketplace."" The law provides a windfall to major integrated oil companies - who profit from selling the credits - and unfairly punishes certain refiners for not investing in costly biofuels blending facilities, he said.
Lobbying against the mandates became more urgent for CVR and Valero in 2013, when prices for biofuels credits soared as energy firms worried about an impending increase in required biofuels blending volumes.
By then, major refiners such as  Tesoro  Corp (NYSE:ANDV) and Marathon Corp (N:MPC) were investing in blending facilities to lower regulatory costs.
But Valero, looking to focus on its core refining business, had been selling off its already limited blending operations as part of larger deals. It sold a pipeline and logistics unit in 2006 to raise $880 million and spun off its retail unit in 2013 in transactions that brought it $1.4 billion.
Valero has said it now has little ability to blend ethanol and biodiesel into the more than 2 million barrels of petroleum products it produces each day in the United States. As a result, the firm is forced to spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually on biofuels credits.
By 2015, Valero CEO Joseph Gorder was convinced that lobbying the EPA to change regulations was a better strategy than operating blending facilities, one of the former Valero executives told Reuters.
The second former Valero executive described the tactic as a ""regulatory Hail Mary"".
SIGNING UP AN OBAMA ENVIRONMENTAL ADVISOR
In 2015, Valero's external lobbying firm - Bracewell LLP, a Houston-based law and government relations outfit - hired Ron Minsk, a former advisor to President Barack Obama on energy and the environment, as a consultant.
Bracewell never announced the high-profile hire, made months after Minsk left the White House, and Minsk never registered as a lobbyist, according to U.S. Congressional disclosures.
In February 2016, Minsk testified before Congress as an expert on biofuels regulation, citing his experience as an Obama advisor and arguing in favor of a shift in the point of obligation for blending.
Minsk did not disclose his relationship with Valero in his written testimony but acknowledged it when a lawmaker pressed him about industry ties.
""I have been retained by a law firm to consult on issues related to the RFS, and Valero Energy Corporation is one of their clients,"" Minsk said, referring to Bracewell.
Asked why he didn't disclose the Valero connection before testifying, Minsk told Reuters: ""I was sharing my own views, and not anyone else's.""
Minsk also filed public comments to EPA in February 2017, urging the same policy change – again without noting his Valero connection.
Scott Segal, a Bracewell partner in Washington, said in a statement that Minsk ""provides technical advice to us on a variety of topics"" and that he was ""certainly not testifying or writing on behalf of the firm or its clients.""
'RETAILER OF THE YEAR'
Throughout 2016, Valero cultivated allies that would ultimately mobilize around the same policy proposal to the White House.
The refiner helped one of its retailers, Bill Douglass, launch a grassroots organization of small gas station owners that would argue biofuels mandates hurt their mom-and-pop businesses.
Douglass said he contacted all of his fuel suppliers for help in starting the organization, but only Valero provided assistance, giving him a list of its retailers to recruit.
Bracewell helped connect the fledgling Small Retailers Coalition with a website developer, the firm said. The site is devoted largely to arguing for the same regulatory changes Valero supports. Douglass also sent a letter to the EPA and spoke personally with an EPA official to urge adoption of the policy.
Bracewell was happy to help a political ally of its client Valero, Segal said.
""It should come as no surprise that groups with which we are allied, we help,"" Segal said, while noting the firm did not control the website's content. ""We share information and frankly we're glad to do it. We are not opposed to providing assistance when it's appropriate.""
Valero's spokeswoman denied the company had played a significant role in setting up the SRC and declined further comment on the firm's relationship to the group.
Valero did, however, name SRC founder Douglass its ""Retailer of the Year"" in 2016.

'TRYING TO SPLIT THE INDUSTRY'
Valero also sought to join biofuels industry groups and persuade them to back its policy position, according to the former Valero executives and three biofuels industry sources.
Valero had reason to join one of those groups. Although it lacked sufficient ethanol-blending facilities, it was one of the nation's top five ethanol producers.
Still, Valero was seen as an outsider by many biofuels producers because the refiner had opposed regulations they supported, two oil and four biofuels industry sources told Reuters.
Michael McAdams, President of the Advanced Biofuels Association, said he received a phone call in May or June of 2016 from Valero's Richard Walsh – a senior vice president and corporate counsel who led the refiner's push to change biofuels policy, the former Valero executives said.
Walsh said Valero wanted to join the biofuels organization - but first wanted the chance to convince the group to support its proposed regulatory change.
""My board said, 'No, thank you. We can't align with you,'"" McAdams said, adding that it seemed Valero was ""trying to split” the biofuels industry, McAdams said.
Walsh did not respond to requests for comment.
NEUTRALIZING AN OPPONENT
The refiner, however, did end up joining the Washington-based Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), among the most prominent biofuels producer groups and a powerful lobbying force.
The RFA had previously criticized proposals to shift the biofuels blending point of obligation, arguing it would discourage production of blends with higher ethanol content and complicate enforcement.
Valero and RFA President Bob Dinneen declined to discuss how and why Valero came to join the group but said it had nothing to do with the RFA's position on the refiner's policy priorities.
The RFA, however, ultimately did agree to drop its opposition to the policy change sought by Valero – a clear victory for the refiner.
In February, Valero representatives and Icahn held a meeting with the RFA's Dinneen. Icahn told Dinneen he believed Trump would support the refiners' biofuels policy proposal – and that the RFA should lend its political support.
Dinneen told Reuters at the time that the RFA decided not to oppose what it believed was a done deal. He also said Icahn assured the group that it could win concessions from the Trump Administration in return, including support for a different regulatory change that would encourage production of fuel blends with higher ethanol content.
Other biofuel industry groups slammed the RFA's policy shift. Fuels America, a coalition of renewable fuel and farm groups, dropped the RFA as a member of their alliance in response.
LOBBYING A LOBBYIST AT THE WHITE HOUSE
In March, Valero's Walsh, CVR's Lipinski and representatives from other refiners went to the White House to pitch their case to Trump's top aide on domestic energy policy, Michael Catanzaro, a former energy industry lobbyist.
Trump had banned former lobbyists hired by his administration from participating in issues on which they lobbied for two years – but the White House later granted Catanzaro a waiver from that rule.
Catanzaro is advising on the same issues that were recently the focus of his lobbying for clients such as Koch Industries - a diversified conglomerate with major energy assets - and groups including the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, which petitioned the EPA for the biofuels change last year.
Catanzaro declined to comment.
Valero's Walsh invited Douglass to join the meeting to represent the Small Retailers Association, Douglass said.
As in other forums, Valero representatives let others take the lead in carrying the message, mainly Douglass and a union representative for workers at a Philadelphia refinery.

""They let me do most of the speaking,"" Douglass said. ""They let me hold the floor because I think they regard my dilemma as being more critical.""

529,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 21, 2017 03:26AM ET</span>",Oil starts the week on back foot amid U.S. production jitters,"Investing.com - Oil prices drifted lower on Monday, as concern over rising production in the U.S. dampened sentiment.
Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed last week that total domestic crude production edged up by 79,000 barrels a day to 9.5 million barrels, its highest level since July 2015.
That comes despite data showing that U.S. energy firms cut rigs drilling for new oil for a second week in three. Drillers cut five oil rigs in the week to Aug. 18, bringing the total count down to 763, oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said Friday.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude September contract was at $48.52 a barrel by 3:25AM ET (0725GMT), down 14 cents, or around 0.3%.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for October delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London shed 16 cents, or about 0.3%, to $52.58 a barrel.
Oil prices settled sharply higher on Friday, jumping about 3% in a surprise rally after reports surfaced that a unit at Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Mobil’s Baytown, Texas refinery shut down. The 584,000 barrel-a-day plant is the second-largest refinery in the U.S.
Despite Friday's rally, New York-traded oil prices ended the week down 31 cents, or nearly 0.6%, its third such loss in a row. In contrast, London-traded Brent futures notched a weekly gain of 62 cents, or roughly 1.2%.
The global benchmark has been buoyed by recent signs that global supplies are tightening.
OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, agreed since the start of the year to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018 in order to reduce a global supply glut and rebalance the market.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for September declined 1.7 cents, or nearly 1.1%, to $1.605 a gallon, while September heating oil slumped 0.9 cents, or 0.6%, to $1.610 a gallon.

531,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2017 01:42AM ET</span>","In Montana’s Indian country, tribes take opposite sides on coal","By Valerie Volcovici
LAME DEER, Montana (Reuters) - U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Vice President Mike Pence took a horseback tour in May of a Montana coal mine belonging to the Crow Nation. They posed for photos with tribal leaders and declared an end to the U.S. government’s “war on coal.”
The trip annoyed leaders of the neighboring Northern Cheyenne - a Native American tribe that chooses not to mine its coal reserves for environmental reasons. Zinke's department had ignored their requests for a meeting before its March decision to lift a coal-mining moratorium on federal lands, tribal leaders said. (Graphic: Coal war - http://tmsnrt.rs/2fMDqwx)
The Crow and Northern Cheyenne live miles apart but stand on opposite sides of U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-energy agenda. Their differences reflect a broader divide on drilling and mining among America’s 567 federally recognized tribes.
While Native American lands cover 2 percent of the U.S. surface, they have been estimated to contain a fifth of the nation’s remaining petroleum, along with vast coal reserves - making them a key part of Trump’s effort to boost domestic production.
For tribes such as the Crow, Trump's rise marks an opportunity to tap more of the vast energy reserves beneath their lands for a needed economic boost.
""We have a window now that is short,"" said Kenneth Brien, who directs the tribe's energy development.
For other tribes including the Northern Cheyenne, the administration poses a threat by too forcefully injecting its fossil-fuel agenda into tribal policy while ignoring environmental and social concerns.
The tribe wants more stringent rules to ensure that nearby mines don't pollute its water supply with waste runoff and that a nearby coal-fired power plant has the proper air pollution controls. It also supported the moratorium on new federal coal leases, instituted last year by President Barack Obama, and a planned study of environmental and social impacts.
Trump aims to streamline regulations that make it much harder to drill on federal and tribal lands than on private land.
The administration also approved the Dakota Access Pipeline in January over protests led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. More recently, Zinke recommended reducing the size of the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah – about 1.3 million acres of forests and canyons believed to hold oil but considered sacred by tribes.
Zinke riled tribal leaders in May with remarks questioning the future of Indian lands held in federal trust – an arrangement dating to treaties the U.S. government signed with indigenous tribes in the 1700s.
“As the steward of our Indian trust land, what are we going to be 100 years from now? Is there an off ramp?” Zinke asked at a tribal energy summit in Washington.
After a backlash, the Interior Department affirmed its commitment to tribal sovereignty and said it had no current plans to change the trust relationship.
While promoting energy development, Trump has proposed cuts to housing, education and health care programs on Native American reservations. Separately, the president has said proceeds from energy will help tribes “build new schools, fix roads, improve your communities and create jobs.”
Gabe Galanda, a lawyer specializing in tribal law, said the administration appears to view energy development as a way to wean tribes off federal support.
Zinke spokeswoman Heather Swift did not directly respond to that assertion, but said: “Building a stronger economy across the board will help all communities and tribes - regardless of whether they are ‘energy’ or not.”
    
    LIVING ON DEER MEAT
    Crow leaders' mining ambitions have gained them access to Trump’s White House, where Crow Chairman AJ Not Afraid has attended two meetings, most recently in June with leaders of about 10 other energy-producing tribes.
Not Afraid asked for regulatory rollbacks, urged approval of a new Pacific coal export terminal and sought to make permanent a 10 percent Indian coal production tax credit.
The stakes are high, said Brien, Not Afraid’s energy adviser.
    The Crow government is financed largely by revenues from the Absaloka coal mine, which the tribe leases to Westmoreland Resources. 
But last August, weak coal prices caused the tribe to cut its share of profits from the mine after the company threatened to close it. The slump caused the Crow administration to slash two-thirds of its workforce late last year, adding to already high unemployment.
A Westmoreland official did not respond to a request for comment.
Crow leaders hope Trump can stoke U.S. demand for coal by easing environmental rules and attract investment by extending the Indian coal tax credit. Federal approval of the West Coast terminal could allow for exports of the Crow's coal to Asia.
Relaxed regulations could also help convince Cloud Peak Energy to open its planned Big Metal mine on the Crow reservation. The firm paid the tribe $4 million in 2013 for development rights and has until 2018 to exercise the option.
Wearing jeans and a white rancher’s hat, Brien said he remains ""bullish"" that Trump can revive coal and the Crow economy.
“I don’t want to be that poor again that I will live on deer meat,” he said, referring to a time he had to hunt for his meals.
Sharon Stewart Peregoy, a Crow member and Democratic state representative, said the tribe’s engagement with the administration was driven by desperation.
    “We have to ensure that we remain at the table, and that we carve out our own destiny,” she said. “That destiny is for survival.”
SURROUNDED BY COAL
    The Northern Cheyenne, by contrast, have shunned coal development, and tribal leaders are now seeking to build an alternate economy to ward off double-digit unemployment. The tribe broke ground this summer on an RV park, a casino and a restaurant.
""Our ancestors worked so hard to maintain a pristine area here - and we are surrounded by coal mines, coal generating power plants,"" Conrad Fisher, vice president of the tribal council, said in an interview at the tribe’s headquarters in Lame Deer, a brick building with a solar-paneled roof.
    The issue remains divisive and complex. Some tribe members continue to push for mining to alleviate poverty. And the tribe has stopped short of directly opposing coal mines operated by the neighboring Crow out of respect for that tribe's sovereignty - even as it pushes for more government scrutiny of all nearby mining.
The tribe sued the Interior Department in March seeking to restore the coal moratorium on the grounds that Zinke its their request for what's called a government-to-government consultation between the tribe and the United States.
Zinke said the ban is not needed because mining can be done responsibly, and that the lawsuit didn't surprise him. ""I get sued a lot,"" he said in an interview.
An Interior spokesperson declined comment on whether the department ignored the tribe's meeting requests.
The Northern Cheyenne had anticipated an ally in Zinke, their former Congressman. Now they see an adversary.

    “If the energy-producing tribes are who they want to protect,” Elkshoulder said, “they should also understand they have treaty obligations to not just those nations, but to all nations.”

533,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2017 10:35PM ET</span>","The victor, the spoils? Trump eyes Afghanistan's elusive mineral riches","By James Mackenzie
KABUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is eyeing Afghanistan's mineral wealth to help pay for a 16-year war and reconstruction efforts that have already cost $117 billion. Investors who have studied the country, one of the world's most dangerous, say that is a pipe dream.
Ever since a United States Geological Survey study a decade ago identified deposits later estimated to have a potential value of as much as $1 trillion, both Afghan and foreign officials have trumpeted the reserves as a likely key to economic independence for Afghanistan.
As well as deposits of gold, silver and platinum, Afghanistan has significant quantities of iron ore, uranium, zinc, tantalum, bauxite, coal, natural gas and significant copper - a particular draw given the dearth of rich new copper mines globally.
Afghanistan, some reports say, even has the potential to become ""the Saudi Arabia of lithium"", thanks to deposits of the raw material used in phone and electric car batteries.
But a lack of basic logistics - paved roads and rail links needed to export copper concentrate or iron ore - pervasive corruption, a messy bureaucracy and a growing insurgency that has left much of the country beyond the writ of the Kabul government have stifled attempts to a build a legitimate mining sector.
Much of the basic data dates back to the Soviet occupation in the 1980s. And the cost of having foreign geologists and engineers visit remote sites to carry out new surveys is prohibitive when nothing is yet being produced to pay for it.
""There is no low-hanging fruit that could trigger rapid growth and foster self-sustaining development,"" said the government's own National Peace and Development Framework document, presented at last year's donor conference in Brussels. 
Major projects such as the Mes Aynak copper mine, being developed by a Chinese consortium, remain at a standstill.
""There is zero active mining and very little exploration, if any,"" says Leigh Fogelman, director at merchant bank Hannam & Partners in London. The bank's founder, former JP Morgan rainmaker Ian Hannam, has been a long-time investor in Afghanistan through the Afghan Gold and Minerals Company (AGMC).
AGMC won the license for another copper deposit, at Balkhab in northern Afghanistan, in 2012.
For the rest, resources have been prey to what William Byrd, a development economist with the United States Institute of Peace, has dubbed ""industrial-scale looting"".
While small and medium-sized mines do exist, many are outside government control, profiting powerful local operators and depriving the treasury of what the government estimates at $300 million in unpaid taxes.
""The big mining opportunities are just languishing and there's looting of smaller resources everywhere,"" Byrd said.
GREAT GAME
As Afghan officials sought to raise interest in Afghanistan with the incoming U.S. administration earlier this year, they pushed the idea of the mineral reserves. 
""President Trump is keenly interested in Afghanistan's economic potential,"" Hamdullah Mohib, Afghanistan's ambassador to Washington, told Reuters in June. ""Our estimated $1 trillion in copper, iron ore, rare earth elements, aluminum, gold, silver, zinc, mercury and lithium. That's new.""
U.S. officials have told Reuters that Trump argued at a White House meeting with advisors in July that the United States should demand a share of Afghanistan's mineral wealth in exchange for its assistance to the Afghan government. [nL1N1KP007]
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that Trump has made a decision on the United States' strategy for Afghanistan after a review with national security advisors, but did not give any details. [nL8N1L60GC] 
It is easy to see why the mining sector has aroused so much interest in Afghanistan, a landlocked country with an economy worth about $20 billion a year - roughly half the size of Wyoming, the least populous U.S. state.
But private investors are wary, says Fogelman, and there is no quick fix.
""In the case of large, public sector investment, the situation would be different - however, there would still be the problem of building up logistics and export links,"" he said. ""I reckon it would still likely take years to get a meaningful large-scale operation going.""
Even if private armies could be hired to defend the mines against insurgent attack, the cost of moving minerals out would likely be prohibitive until the entire country was secure - which could take many years.
One longtime mining expert formerly based in Kabul recounted his conversation with a top mining firm.
""They said: 'Don't worry, we can bring our own security detail and do the mining operation'. But, they said, 'How are we going to get this stuff out of the country?'""
According to a 2014 mining ministry study, some of Afghanistan's most promising deposits of lithium are in the eastern province of Ghazni and in the far southern region of Gowde Zereh in Helmand province, all areas largely under the control of the Taliban.
""The idea that this will materialize in the near future and pay for the security sector budget is unrealistic,"" said Byrd.
Even without the war, mining is tough.
China acquired a 30-year lease on the Mes Aynak copper mine for around $3 billion in 2008 but, although the Taliban has explicitly declared that it will not target it, the project has been plagued by delays due to contractual wrangling.
Under a donor program agreed in Tokyo in 2012, Afghanistan was supposed to be earning $1 billion a year from mining revenues by 2017 but expectations have been pulled back.
In the first 11 months of the last fiscal year, the government raised just $18 million from mining revenues and the government's own projections now do not see them exceeding the $1 billion mark before 2029.
That compares with security spending of $4.6 billion this year, equivalent to almost a quarter of the total budget.

""It's illusory to think that minerals will save Afghanistan in any foreseeable future,"" said one senior Western diplomat in Kabul.

""Attracting foreign investment and technology is a priority for us in the oil industry, whether in shared fields or for increasing the production of oil at fields that are already operational,"" he said during a live television interview on state TV.
Zanganeh, who won parliamentary approval on Sunday to stay on as oil minister, has been credited with increasing Iran's crude output since many global sanctions were lifted last year following an international deal on Iran's nuclear program.
He has also won praise with a multi-billion-dollar deal with France's Total to develop South Pars, the world's largest gas field.
Total will be the operator with a 50.1 percent stake, alongside Chinese state-owned oil and gas company CNPC with 30 percent and National Iranian Oil Co subsidiary Petropars with 19.9 percent.
The project will cost up to $5 billion and production is expected to start within 40 months, Iran's oil ministry said in a statement last month.
Approximately $3 billion of that will go toward generating work for Iranian companies, Zanganeh said. Some 27 phases of South Pars will be operational by spring of 2019, Zanganeh said.
Iran needs approximately $200 billion investment for oil and gas production, development and refineries and roughly 65 to 75 percent of that needs to come from foreign investment, he said. 
Iran is going to try to attract $60 billion in foreign investment for the oil industry by the end of the Iranian calendar year in March 2018, Zanganeh said. 

Less than 30 percent of Iran’s 700 billion barrels of oil reserves are currently extractable, according to Zanganeh.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - As Monday's total solar eclipse sweeps from Oregon to South Carolina, U.S. electric power and grid operators will be glued to their monitoring systems in what for them represents the biggest test of the renewable energy era. 
Utilities and grid operators have been planning for the event for years, calculating the timing and drop in output from solar, running simulations of the potential impact on demand, and lining up standby power sources. It promises a critical test of their ability to manage a sizeable swing in renewable power.
Solar energy now accounts for more than 42,600 megawatts (MW), about 5 percent of the U.S.'s peak demand, up from 5 MW in 2000, according to the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), a group formed to improve the nation's power system in the wake of a 1964 blackout. When the next eclipse comes to the United States in 2024, solar will account for 14 percent of the nation's power, estimates NERC. 
For utilities and solar farms, the eclipse represents an opportunity to see how well prepared their systems are to respond to rapid swings in an era where variable energy sources such as solar and wind are climbing in scale and importance. 
Power companies view Monday's event as a ""test bed"" on how power systems can manage a major change in supply, said John Moura, director of reliability assessment and system analysis at the North American Electric Reliability Corp.
    ""It has been tested before, just not at this magnitude,"" adds Steven Greenlee, a spokesman for the California Independent System Operator (CISO), which controls routing power in the nation's most populous state.
CISO estimates that at the peak of the eclipse, the state's normal solar output of about 8,800 MW will be reduced to 3,100 MW and then surge to more than 9,000 MW when the sun returns.
    CISO's preparation includes studying how German utilities dealt with a 2015 eclipse in that country. Its review prompted the grid overseer to add an additional 200 MW to its normal 250 MW power reserves. 
""We've calculated that during the eclipse, that solar will ramp off at about 70 MW per minute,"" said Greenlee. ""And then we'll see the solar rolling back at about 90 MW per minute or more."" 
Power utilities say the focus will be on managing a rapid drop off and accommodate the solar surge post the eclipse. Utility executives say they do not expect any interruption in service, but are prepared to ask customers to pare usage if a problem arises.""We want to assure our customers that we have secured enough resources to meet their energy needs, even with significantly less solar generation on hand,"" said Caroline Winn, chief operating officer at utility San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 
In the Eastern United States, utilities will have more time to watch the results of their Western counterparts. PJM Interconnection, which coordinates electricity transmission among 13 states from Michigan to North Carolina, says non-solar sources such as hydro and fossil fuel can easily supplant the 400 MW to 2,500 MW solar loss, depending on the cloud cover.
For small-scale solar providers, the eclipse is a drop in the revenue bucket. Ron Strom, a North Carolina real estate developer, sells the power from a 58 kilovolt system atop a commercial property in Chapel Hill to  Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK). 

""The event may cost me eighteen cents or thereabouts if my panels don't produce solar for three hours,"" said Strom.

Crude oil recovered from session lows, as traders piled into oil futures, after reports surfaced that a unit at Exxon Mobil’s Baytown, Texas refinery has been shut down.
The reports surfaced ahead of an update from oilfield services firm Baker Hughes on Friday, showing its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the United States last week fell by five rigs to a total of 763.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
The dip in U.S. oil rigs eased investor concerns that rising U.S. production could hamper Opec’s ability to stem the glut in supplies, which has pressured prices for more than three-years.
Total crude-oil production rose to 9.502m barrels per day, an uptick of 79,000 barrels a day compared to last week, the EIA said on Wednesday. That was the highest weekly output figure since mid-July 2015.

Gold prices strengthened after a van rammed into pedestrians in a crowded tourist area of Barcelona on Thursday evening, killing at least 14 people and injuring 100 others.
Shortly after, a second attack was perpetrated in Cambrils, a coastal town south of Barcelona, where police said they killed five attackers.
So far three men have been arrested as country-wide anti-terror operations remain underway, according to local officials.
The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the incident, though the claim has not been verified.
The precious metal was also supported by a weaker U.S. dollar on Friday, amid concerns U.S. President Donald Trump will not be able to implement his agenda, as he faces mounting opposition even from within his own political party.
Eight chief executives quit two business advisory councils on Wednesday, in protest over Trump’s controversial remarks on weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Republican Senator Bob Corker also made headlines this week when he slammed Trump's handling of the protests in Charlottesville, saying that the President ""has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,.""

Elsewhere, Brent oil for October delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London added 0.5 cents or about 0.1% to $51.05 a barrel, after hitting a three-week low of $50.01 in the previous session.
Crude prices remained under pressure after U.S. government data this week revealed an increase in domestic production to the highest level in over two years.
However, crude oil inventories fell by 8.9 million barrels, according to the EIA figures, the seventh weekly decline in a row.
Oil prices have been under pressure in recent weeks as concern over rising U.S. shale output canceled out production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, agreed since the start of the year to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018 in order to reduce a global supply glut and rebalance the market.
However, so far, the deal has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, as well as a relentless increase in U.S. shale output.
Oil traders were also sensitive to overall risk-aversion on global markets after after a van rammed into pedestrians in a crowded tourist area of Barcelona on Thursday evening, killing at least 13 people and injuring 100 others.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices were largely steady on Friday, torn between a broad-based selloff across markets and signs that crude supplies are gradually tightening.
Brent crude futures, (LCOc1) the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $51.12 per barrel at 0711 GMT, up 9 cents from their last close but still set for a weekly drop of some 2 percent.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $47.17 a barrel, up 8 cent but also on track to fall over the week, down over 3 percent.
Oil prices have been weighed down amid a selloff across markets, including U.S. and Asian stocks, where investors voted with their feet amid growing scepticism that U.S. President Donald Trump, embroiled in controversy, would achieve his economic agenda.
The overall softness in financial markets added to the perception that oil supply remains higher than demand despite producer efforts to reduce output. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), together with non-OPEC producers like Russia, has pledged to restrict output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) between January this year and March 2018.
""Sentiment in oil markets remains weak,"" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said. 
Oil is declining even amid signs that crude markets are tightening.
The Brent forward curve <0#LCO:> has moved from contango into backwardation, where prices for immediate delivery are higher than those later on, for the three months of futures. A so-called backwardated market is considered a bullish sign for prices since it indicates that demand is outpacing supply. 
Signs of supply tightness are also appearing in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer. Despite a 13 percent jump in production  since mid-2016 to 9.5 million bpd, the country's commercial crude inventories  have fallen 13 percent from their March records to below 2016 levels.
On the demand side, Asia in particular could see some stronger crude orders going into the second-half of the year.
Driven by the start-up of a refinery in Yunnan province in southern China and the completed expansion of a fuel processing facility at Huizhou, Chinese crude oil imports are expected to pick up.
""We expect Chinese crude imports to increase by 700,000 bpd year-on-year on average in 2H 2017,"" said energy consultancy FGE.
New oil demand is also coming from Vietnam, which will see record crude oil imports in August as it readies its second refinery for start-up.
""As domestic crude production continues to fall, Vietnam's historical surplus in crude oil will come to an end by 2019, turning the country into a net importer,"" said Peter Lee, oil analyst at BMI Research.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up 0.02% to $1.292.57 a troy ounce.
India and China, the world's top two gold buyers, started a standoff two months ago when Indian troops confronted Chinese forces working on a road over the Doklam Plateau, a strategically important area near where Tibet, India and Bhutan meet, and which both China and Bhutan – an ally of India – claim as their own.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2017 07:10PM ET</span>",Syria says it has more than six months' strategic wheat reserves,"DAMASCUS (Reuters) - Syria has more than six months' worth of strategic wheat reserves, Internal Trade and Consumer Protection Minister Abdullah al-Gharbi said on Thursday.
While President Bashar al-Assad has scored vital military gains against rebels seeking to oust him in a six-year-old civil war he is under pressure to ensure supplies of strategic commodities such as wheat keep flowing to supporters in areas under his control to avoid the risk of unrest.
""We have a reserve of more than six months, I will not give the exact figure, we have a lot more than countries that have not lived through war like us,"" Gharbi told Reuters on the sidelines of the Damascus International Fair.
The fair is taking place this week for the first time since the Syrian conflict began.
Gharbi did not say how much the strategic reserves totaled in terms of tonnes but said the government aimed to increase reserves to more than a year's worth.
""Last year we had 17 days now we have more than six months,"" he said.
The government needs about 1 to 1.5 million tonnes of wheat annually to feed areas under its control.
Gharbi said that Syria's wheat supplies came from local crops and from abroad.
""We are importing from Russian companies in addition to our local production,"" he said.
Although foodstuffs are not restricted, U.S. and European sanctions on banking and asset freezes have made it difficult for most trading houses to do business with Assad's government.
State grain buyer Hoboob has been struggling to import wheat in recent years.
In October, Hoboob struck a deal to buy 1 million tonnes of wheat from a little known Russian firm to supply government-held areas and prevent bread shortages.
No wheat from that deal has arrived yet and traders have said the deal is in jeopardy and might never materialize.
In February, Hoboob agreed contracts to buy another 1 million tonnes of Russian wheat outside of the tender process from local firms.
Syria's agriculture ministry has said local wheat production would be 2 million tonnes for the 2017 season but sources have told Reuters that the amount will be much lower than that.
The country's wheat harvest nearly halved to 1.3 million tonnes in 2016, the lowest level in 27 years, as fighting and poor rainfall had a further impact on agriculture.

550,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2017 03:49PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Bank jitters over Venezuela stall oil delivery to U.S. refiner,"By Marianna Parraga
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A tanker carrying a cargo of about 1 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy crude has been stranded for more than a month off the coast of Louisiana for lack of a bank letter of credit to discharge, three sources have told Reuters.
The cargo's fate adds to state-run oil company PDVSA's precarious financial position. Revenue from the company's oil sales, which have suffered because of low prices and declining production, account for more than 90 percent of the nation's exports.
Major banks are cutting exposure to Venezuela as a result of political upheaval in the South American country. Some have closed accounts linked to officials of the OPEC member who have had sanctions leveled against them by the U.S. government and have refused to provide correspondent bank services or trade in government bonds. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) this month barred operations involving certain Venezuelan bonds and is now requiring that business with President Nicolas Maduro's government and related entities undergo a reputation risk review. 
The United States is considering further economic sanctions that would dry up the country's access to Wall Street. 
PDVSA and its joint ventures exported 638,325 barrels per day (bpd) to the United States in July, 22 percent less than the same month of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters Trade Flows data.
A GUARANTEE FOR DELIVERY
The tanker Karvounis carrying Venezuelan oil is anchored at South West Pass off the coast of Louisiana, according to Reuters vessel tracking data. PBF Energy Inc, the intended buyer of the cargo, has been trying unsuccessfully to find a bank willing to provide a letter of credit to discharge the oil, according to two trading and shipping sources. 
Crude sellers typically request letters of credit from customers that guarantee payment within 30 days after a cargo is delivered. The documents must be issued by a bank and received before the parties agree to discharge.
It was not immediately clear which banks have denied letters of credit or if other U.S. refiners are affected. 
PBF Energy spokesman Michael Karlovich would not confirm any details about the cargo, saying: ""We treat commercial and logistics arrangements as business confidential information."" 
PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment. 
The tanker loaded in late June at the Caribbean island of St. Eustatius where PDVSA rents storage tanks, and has been waiting for authorization to discharge since early July, according to four trading sources and Reuters data.
CASH BUYERS PDVSA's cash flow has shrunk in recent years due to extended deals to barter its oil for refined products, services and loans. Chinese and Russian entities currently take about 40 percent of all PDVSA's exports as repayment for over $60 billion in loans to Venezuela and the company in the last decade, according to a Reuters analysis of its sales. This has left U.S. refiners among the few remaining cash buyers. Some banks have continued working with Venezuela. In May, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) purchased $2.8 billion of Venezuelan debt bonds at steep discount, a move criticized by the Venezuelan opposition and other banks. But as more banks look to reduce their exposure to Venezuela, the situation is affecting PDVSA's payments to bondholders and its routine oil sales and purchases, according to bank and trade sources.
The Karvounis was chartered by Trafigura [TRAFG.UL], the Reuters data shows. Since last year, the trading firm has been marketing an increasing volume of Venezuelan oil received from companies such as Russia's Rosneft, which lift and then resell PDVSA's barrels to monetize credits extended to Venezuela, according to traders and PDVSA's internal documents. Some barrels get sold on the open market, others are supplied to typical PDVSA's customers including U.S Gulf Coast refiners. PBF and PDVSA have a long-term supply agreement for Venezuelan oil signed in 2015 when PBF bought the 189,00-bpd Chalmette refinery from PDVSA and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp.

The U.S. refiner received three cargoes for a total of 1.58 million barrels last month, the lowest figure since February. Other U.S. refineries such as Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) did not receive any cargo. In early August, PBF's Chalmette refinery received 514,000 barrels of Venezuelan DCO on tanker Ridgebury Sally B, the Reuters data say. A second delivery got stuck on tanker Karvounis.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday as renewed attention was put on U.S. oil stockpile declines after an industry report suggested oil inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma hub were declining. 
Inventories at Cushing, the delivery hub for U.S. crude futures, declined more than a million barrels in the week to Aug. 15, traders said citing estimates from energy industry information provider Genscape.
In the latest week to Aug. 11 for which government data was available, Cushing inventories increased nearly 700,000 barrels. 
Inventories in the United States are closely watched as the market grapples with a global supply glut. 
Brent crude (LCOc1) settled up 76 cents, or 1.51 percent at $51.03 a barrel. U.S. light crude (CLc1) was 31 cents, or 0.66 percent, higher at $47.09 a barrel. 
Both benchmarks fell more than 1 percent on Wednesday despite data showing that U.S. inventories last week fell the most in nearly a year. [EIA/S]
Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed commercial U.S. crude stocks  have fallen by almost 13 percent from their peaks in March to 466.5 million barrels. Stocks are now lower than in 2016. 
U.S. oil output, however, is rising fast as shale producers take advantage of a recent increase in prices.
U.S. crude production rose 79,000 barrels per day (bpd) to over 9.5 million bpd last week, its highest level since July 2015, and 12.8 percent above the most recent low in mid-2016. 
""Yesterday, the production number trumped the storage number, but it was still a draw of 9 million,"" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures, energy futures at Mizuho. ""There are some weaker shorts that are probably sold out and they want to get out.""
Rising U.S. output has been undermining efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia to drain a global fuel glut.
They have promised to restrict output by a total of 1.8 million bpd between January this year and March 2018.
William O'Loughlin at Rivkin Securities said that if inventory declines continued at the current pace, U.S. stocks would fall below the five-year average in two months.
""The pace of the declines indicates that OPEC production cuts are having an effect, although the current oil price suggests that the market is skeptical about the longer-term prospects for rebalancing of the oil market,"" he added.

Brent prices are down almost 12 percent since OPEC and its allies began cutting production in January.

Crude oil snapped a three-day losing streak, as traders appeared to take advantage of lower crude prices, following a slump on Wednesday, after a report from the Energy Information Administration showed U.S. production hit two-year highs.
Total crude-oil production rose to 9.502m barrels per day, an uptick of 79,000 barrels a day compared to last week, the EIA said. That was the highest weekly output figure since mid-July 2015, offsetting bullish crude inventories data, narrowing expectations of crude futures breaching $50 a barrel.
“Barring any geopolitical catalysts, $50 [for WTI] will likely remain a stubborn resistance level in the near term, and if production continues to grind higher in the U.S., expect prices to remain under pressure,” said Tyler Richey, co-editor of the Sevens Report.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 8.9m barrels in the week ended Aug 11, confounding expectations  of a draw of about only 3.6m barrels. It was biggest draw in crude inventories in eleven-months.
The uptick U.S. production, however, adds to concerns that the global glut in crude supplies will continue during the second half of the year, as Opec’s rate of compliance with the global deal to curb production fell in July.
Opec’s rate of compliance with output cuts slid to 75 percent in July, the lowest since the accord started in January, the IEA said.
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year."

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $7.66, or 0.59%, to $1,290.51 a troy ounce.
The minutes of the Fed's July 25-26 policy meeting on Wednesday, showed some policymakers believed the Fed could afford to stand pat on further rate increases until it is clear the trend of soft inflation is transitory.
The somewhat dovish minutes, dampened investor expectations of third rate hike later this year, underpinning a move higher in gold futures.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 232,000 for the week ended Aug. 12, the Labor Department said. That beat economists’ forecasts of a just 4,000 decline.
In a separate report, the Federal Reserve bank of Philadelphia said that its Philly Fed manufacturing index rose to a seasonally adjusted 18.9 for August, compared with consensus estimates of 18.5.

558,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2017 06:46AM ET</span>",Booming thermal coal price on China demand cheers miners,"By Henning Gloystein and Jim Regan (Australia)
SINGAPORE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian thermal coal prices for spot cargoes above $100 a tonne, lifted by reports of strikes and strong Chinese demand, are providing a boost in earnings and share prices for miners like  Glencore  and Whitehaven Coal. 
A crackdown on illegal mining and pollution in China has curbed domestic supplies, just as a heat wave and lower hydro power output have boosted demand for coal for power generation, forcing up prices. 
A similar squeeze in 2016 pushed prices to $114 a tonne and miners are again eyeing windfall profits, despite warning that the market is volatile. 
""Coal demand remains strong, especially in Asia,"" said Paul Flynn, managing director of Whitehaven Coal (AX:WHC).
""Imports of thermal coal into China have been higher than anticipated, and when combined with weather related constraints on supply from Indonesia and some production issues in Australia, have pushed up the price of seaborne thermal coal.""
Reports of more planned strikes at Australia's Hunter Valley mine, as well as weather-related supply disruptions in Indonesia, have also been pushing up prices, traders said.
Adding fuel to the already hot market, a huge gas-fired power outage in Taiwan this week has triggered emergency orders from coal-fired power stations scrambling to fill the electricity production gap, traders said. 
Australian thermal coal shipments hit a 2017 high in July of over 11 million tonnes, shipping and trading data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows. Despite a dip in shipments earlier this month, traders say orders for the rest of August and into September are high.
Spot cargo prices for Australian thermal coal cargoes from its Newcastle terminal have jumped by over 40 percent from their 2017 lows. Coal topped $100 in early August and last closed at $101.25 per tonne. 
The soaring demand and prices are a boon for companies like global miner Glencore (L:GLEN), the world's biggest exporter of sea-traded thermal coal, and Australian miners like Whitehaven, which profited from last year's spike and have seen their stocks rally since June.
Shares in Whitehaven hit their highest since 2013 on Thursday after it reported a near 20-fold full-year profit rise to A$405 million ($322 million).
Glencore this month raised its earnings forecast for 2017, citing higher commodity prices, after it reported a 68 percent surge in first-half earnings.
The key question is whether the current boom will last.
""Chinese coal production continues to fall due to capacity closures ... stocking hopes that import demand will remain strong in China in coming months,"" ANZ bank said on Thursday.
Last year's rally caught the market by surprise and this year's spike has again defied forecasts, given ample coal supplies and a growing raft of alternative energy sources.
""Will prices stay above $100 forever? Certainly not. But given the spikes this year and last, I and many of my colleagues don't want to be caught short again,"" said one trader.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.80% to $1,293.21 a troy ounce.
Fed minutes showed an increased debate about another rate hike this year and the political backlash against Donald Trump's remarks on racist confrontations this passed weekend in Virginia weighed.
The divide appeared in minutes released from the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting, when central bank policymakers voted to hold the target rate to a range of 1% to 1.25%. The summary portrays views that inflation ultimately will get to the Fed's 2% target but is clearly not there yet.
Earlier, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said that while some price readings have fallen this year, expectations are more stable, adding that monetary policy must anticipate changes in the data and not react to temporary aberrations. She said there is roughly an equal chance that the Fed is forced to raise rates more or less aggressively than currently planned in the months and years ahead.
Overnight, gold prices turned positive on Wednesday, on the back of weaker U.S. housing data. Housing starts dropped 4.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.16 million units, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.

Energy consumption in China, the world's second-largest economy, will peak then at 4.06 billion tonnes of oil equivalent, up from the previous forecast of 3.75 billion tonnes five years prior, CNPC said in its annual long-term energy outlook. CNPC raised its forecast because it predicts transportation demand will rise through to 2050, twenty years longer than previously estimated. 
China's oil demand will reach a ceiling of 690 million tonnes a year, equivalent to 13.8 million barrels per day (bpd), by 2030, CNPC said. The country is the world's second-largest oil consumer. That compares with last year's estimate of a peak of 670 million tonnes a year by 2027.
Oil demand will grow at an annual rate of 2.7 percent until 2020, slowing to 1.2 percent until 2030, the report said.
The headline number indicates that Chinese energy markets will continue to set the pace globally. However, the slowdown in oil consumption raises further doubt about the future role of oil in China's energy mix as alternative fuels take a greater share of the transportation and power generation sectors. 
Gasoline demand will peak as soon as 2025, CNPC said. That would mean China's gasoline demand would peak only shortly after the United States.
China has vowed to cap its energy consumption in 2017 in order to raise the use of cleaner fuels as part of a wider campaign to fight air pollution.
Clean energy, including renewable fuels and natural gas, will replace coal power as the largest fuel source for power generation by 2030 and account for more than half of the nation's power generation by 2045, it said.
Natural gas consumption will rise to 620 billion cubic meters in 2030, said CNPC, up from 510 billion in last year's report. 
Power demand will total 11.8 trillion kilowatt hours by 2050, the report said.
Annual crude output will remain around 200 million tonnes, or 4 million bpd, until 2030, at which point it will start to fall. Gas output will reach 380 billion cubic meters by 2050. At that point, China will account for around 15 percent of world's gas production, it said.

572,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 16, 2017 03:27AM ET</span>",Oil bounces off 3-week lows on bets for bullish U.S. supply data,"Investing.com - Oil prices edged higher on Wednesday, bouncing off their lowest levels in three weeks amid speculation weekly supply data due later in the session will show another big drop in U.S. crude inventories.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report at 10:30AM ET (1430GMT). Analysts expect crude oil inventories dropped by around 3.0 million barrels at the end of last week. If confirmed, it would mark a seventh weekly decline in a row.
Meanwhile, gasoline supplies are seen decreasing by 1.0 million barrels and distillates are forecast to fall 572,000 barrels.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories fell by 9.16 million barrels in the week ended August 11. The API report also showed a gain of 300,000 barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks fell by 2.1 million barrels.
There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude September contract was at $47.84 a barrel by 3:25AM ET (0725GMT), up 29 cents, or around 0.6%. It slumped to its lowest since July 25 at $47.02 a day earlier.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for October delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London tacked on 40 cents, or about 0.8%, to $51.20 a barrel, after falling to a three-week low of $50.02 in the prior session.
Crude prices settled lower on Tuesday as lingering concerns over a global supply glut weighed on sentiment.
OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, agreed since the start of the year to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018 in order to reduce a global supply glut and rebalance the market.
However, so far, the deal has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, as well as a relentless increase in U.S. shale output.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for September ticked up half a cent, or roughly 0.3%, to $1.587 a gallon, while September heating oil rose 1.1 cents, or 0.7%, to $1.611 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for September delivery dipped 2.6 cents, or 0.9%, to $2.909 per million British thermal units.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Mergers among offshore oil drillers are raising hopes that consolidation could bring relief to a sector struggling to emerge from an industry downturn triggered by low crude prices. 
 Transocean Ltd  (NYSE:RIG), one of the world's largest offshore drilling contractors, on Tuesday agreed to buy Norwegian rival Songa Offshore SE for $1.1 billion. The deal follows Ensco Plc's pending purchase of Atwood Oceanics Inc in a transaction valued at $839 million.
The deals would bolster both companies' positions in major oil and gas-producing regions: Transocean in the North Sea and Ensco in offshore Australia. They come as oil prices remain below where they began the year, adding to worries about excess rig capacity continuing into the next year. 
""I think everyone realizes that consolidation is important for the health of this market,"" Transocean Chief Executive Jeremy Thigpen said on a conference call on Tuesday.
Transocean's acquisition of Songa, which has a fleet of rigs designed for harsh drilling environments, also provides it with four advanced rigs contracted to Norwegian oil company  Statoil  (OL:STL).
Offshore drillers are leasing rigs at cash break-even prices and do not have much room to go lower, said Leslie Cook, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie.
""Although demand going forward is expected to be flat to moderate, one thing that may help in the North Sea is that some of those rigs are aging out,"" Cook said.
Despite the potential strategic benefits of the merger, U.S.-listed shares of Swiss-based Transocean touched a record low on Tuesday, following news of the deal, before closing down 5.7 percent at $7.91.
Not all offshore drillers are convinced consolidation is the right in the near term. Diamond Offshore said in July, when it released second-quarter earnings, that it was evaluating opportunities to acquire rigs and companies, but ""deal economics simply don't work for us"" at current prices.  Noble Corp  (NYSE:NE), during its earnings call in early August, also said it too soon to consider acquisitions.
Still, an increase in acquisitions may help offshore companies recover by allowing them to raise prices.

""As more assets are concentrated in fewer hands, the companies will try to move pricing higher,"" said James West, a senior managing director at investment bank Evercore ISI.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Wednesday, lifted by declining U.S. crude inventories, although markets were still restrained by general oversupply.
Market focus was turning to the release of official U.S. Energy Information Administration data later on Wednesday for a further update on inventories.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $51.06 per barrel at 0651 GMT, up 23 cents, or 0.45 percent, from their last close.
Traders said that reports of a dip in Libyan output to between 130,000 and 150,000 barrels per day (bpd), down from 280,000 bpd, had supported Brent.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $47.71 a barrel, up 16 cents, or 0.3 percent.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 9.2 million barrels in the week to Aug. 11 to 469.2 million, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday.
That compared with analyst expectations for a decrease of 3.1 million barrels.
""The market took this as a mildly bullish report,"" said William O'Loughlin of Australia's Rivkin Securities.
However, gasoline stocks climbed by 301,000 barrels, compared with analyst expectations for a 1.1 million barrel decline.
More broadly, analysts said ample supplies were preventing prices from moving much higher.
""Excessive supply ... is continuing to weigh on oil prices ... Not a lot has changed despite the OPEC and Russia efforts recently. While these producers have tried to limit their oil output, U.S. shale oil continues to rise,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at futures brokerage Forex.com.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries together with non-OPEC producers like Russia has pledged to restrict output by 1.8 bpd between January this year and March 2018.
Offsetting much of that effort, however, U.S. oil production has soared by almost 12 percent since mid-2016 to 9.42 million bpd. 
""OPEC and Russia still face an uphill battle in reducing the global supply surplus in the face of growth in output elsewhere and less than compliant behavior in their midst (Iraq, UAE),"" said French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP).
On the demand side, analysts see a gradual slowdown in fuel consumption growth.
In the United States, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said gasoline demand was already peaking due to improving fuel efficiency and the rise of electric vehicles.
In China, state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) said on Wednesday that gasoline demand would likely peak around 2025 and outright oil consumption would top out around 2030.

This means that oil demand from the world's two biggest consumers may soon stall, while consumption has already peaked in Europe and Japan.

The yellow metal suffered its steepest one-day drop in nearly six weeks on Tuesday, after strong data on U.S. retail sales and manufacturing activity kept alive the chance of another Fed rate hike by the end of this year.

576,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 16, 2017 12:10AM ET</span>",Pullback in U.S. fracking sand use pressures producers,"By Arathy S Nair and Nivedita Bhattacharjee
(Reuters) - U.S. shale oil companies are pulling back on the amount of sand they use to hydraulically fracture new wells, responding to rising prices of the material that are driving up costs.
Investors worry a slowdown in sand use, combined with new mining capacity coming online, could lead to a glut of the material and bring down prices. The worries have pressured shares of sand companies. 
Sand prices soared in the last year as oil companies ramped up shale drilling and production.
But with crude (LCoC1) (CLC1) prices below where they started the year, oil producers are employing new well designs and chemical agents that lessen the use of sand that represents around 12 percent of the cost of drilling and fracturing.
The price of frack sand is expected to rise 62 percent this year to average $47 a ton, according to researcher IHS Markit. That is expected to drive oilfield service price inflation to 15 percent over 2016, according to researchers at Wood Mackenzie. 
Oilfield services provider  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL), which buys sand for its drilling customers, last month reported its first decline in average sand used per well, saying customers wanted designs that consumed less of the material.
Average sand volumes for each foot of a well drilled fell slightly last quarter for the first time in a year, said exploration and production consultancy Rystad Energy. Volumes are expected to drop a further 2.5 percent per foot in the current quarter over last, Rystad forecast.
""As alternative strategies are optimized, sand density will fall on a foot by foot basis – dramatically in time,"" said Dallas Salazar, chief executive of energy consulting firm Atlas Consulting.
For a graphic showing frack sand use per well over time, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2fHzJbc
LOGISTICS PROBLEMS?
Frack sand is mixed in a slurry and forced at high pressure into wells to free oil and gas trapped in rocks. Any weakening of sand demand would collide with several sand producers' plans to open new mines. 
Companies including Unimin Corp,  U.S. Silica Holdings Inc  (N:SLCA), and  Hi Crush Partners LP  (N:HCLP) are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new mines to address an expected increase in demand.
On Thursday, supplier Smart Sand (O:SND) reported it shipped less frack sand in the second quarter than it did in the first. Rival Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc (N:FMSA) forecast flat to slightly higher volumes this quarter over last.
In the last six weeks, shares of U.S. Silica and Hi Crush are both off about 30 percent. Smart Sand is off about 43 percent since June 30. 
Some shale producers add chemical diverters, compounds that spread the slurry evenly in a well, and can reduce the amount of sand required. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (N:APC) and  Continental Resources Inc  (N:CLR) are reducing the distance between fractures to boost oil production. The tighter spacing allows them to extract more crude with less sand. 
In the Denver-Julesburg Basin of Colorado, Anadarko said the new well designs have increased oil and gas production by as much as 35 percent. It is ""no secret we have experimented with less sand out there,"" Bradley Holly, Anadarko's head of U.S. onshore exploration and production, told analysts last month. 
Analysts and frack sand providers continue to forecast an overall rise in sand consumption as more wells are drilled and completed. Smart Sand last week blamed its decline on operational and logistics problems.
""The cases where people were scaling back (sand) usage, that was probably due to logistics problems,"" Duane Scardino, Hi Crush's corporate development manager, said in an interview this week. ""It's hard for me to imagine what would be more cost effective than frack sand."" 

Still, Atlas Consulting's Salazar said of the major U.S. shale basins, only two - Haynesville and Eagle Ford - are pumping in more sand per well.

SINGAPORE/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Asia would be the biggest beneficiary of any potential sanctions by the United States on Venezuela's oil sector, said traders and analysts, as exports from the South American OPEC member could be redirected to the region, filling a vacuum left by producer supply cuts. 
Washington is considering sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry in response to the ruling Socialist Party's crackdown on officials and parties opposed to the government. An embargo against Venezuelan crude could block imports of about 740,000 barrels per day to the U.S.
Asian refiners would welcome the so-called heavy, or higher density, crude since production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have mainly curtailed this type of oil. At the same time, the start-up of new refining capacity is boosting demand. 
China and India, the two biggest buyers of Venezuelan crude after the United States, have room to increase imports while other north Asian refiners, with equipment sophisticated enough to handle heavy Venezuelan oil, are seeking opportunities to tap this supply, analysts and traders said.
""Whatever oil that the United States doesn't want will find its way into the global market,"" a trader with a north Asian refiner said, adding that Venezuelan oil could be a good fit for the company's plant.
A trader with another north Asian refiner said he is also looking for opportunities to import Venezuelan crude if the U.S. imposes sanctions. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media. 
Venezuela's main creditors China and Russia will have first priority to its oil if sanctions are imposed, the sources and analysts said, and the countries would likely make the surplus cargoes available in the spot market.
In the first quarter of 2017, Venezuela delivered to Chinese companies about 485,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude and oil products to repay loans extended since 2007, according to internal documents from state-run oil company PDVSA reviewed by Reuters.
Russian oil firms Rosneft (MM:ROSN) and Lukoil (MM:LKOH) are also receiving about 250,000 bpd to repay loans, according to the PDVSA reports.
PDVSA has cut sales to U.S. refining unit Citgo Petroleum since May to increase its supply to Rosneft in order to catch up on overdue Russian deliveries.
Rosneft may ship Venezuelan crude to its newly acquired Essar Oil refinery in India, said one trader based in Asia who deals with Venezuelan crude, adding any surplus could be re-sold by Russian companies to other Asian buyers. 

""The realignment of trade flows to push Venezuelan crude to Asia...would entail substantial logistical challenges that would on the margin be bullish (for) sour crude markets, but not necessarily sustainably bullish (for) crude prices,"" RBC Capital analyst Mike Tran wrote in a note last month.

Market participants were also looking ahead to U.S. retail sales data, to be released later Tuesday, for further indications on the strength of the economy after disappointing inflation figures on Friday dampened expectations for another rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year.
The greenback found some support after New York Fed President William Dudley said on Monday that he favored another interest rate hike this year if the economic conditions evolved in line with his expectations.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.30% at 93.62, the highest since August 10.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Tuesday after sharp falls the session before to the lowest in about three weeks as a stronger U.S. dollar and a drop in Chinese refining runs hit the market.
Global benchmark Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were up 3 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $50.76 at 0551 GMT. That was just above the contract's 100-day moving average, briefly breached in the previous session.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) were down 1 cent at $47.58 a barrel.
Oil prices tumbled more than 2.5 percent on Monday in volatile trade as the dollar strength and the demand concerns in China, the world's second-largest oil user, weighed on sentiment. A stronger dollar tends to limit the demand for oil for buyers paying in other currencies. Both Brent and WTI had reached two-month highs on Aug. 10.
""Stale speculative long positioning and a reluctance to hold unprofitable positions has been the main force behind the oil rally running out of steam over the last few sessions,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA.
Chinese oil refineries operated in July at their lowest daily rates since September 2016, official data showed on Monday, to ease brimming inventories as state-owned oil giants faced off independents in a retail petrol price war. 
Analysts said the drop was steeper than expected, exacerbating concerns that a glut of refined fuel products could weaken Chinese demand for oil.
The dollar firmed on Tuesday after North Korea's leader signaled that he would delay plans to fire a missile near Guam, further easing tensions and prompting investors to move back into riskier assets. 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, climbed 0.4 percent on Monday and was up 0.1 percent on Tuesday. 
An announcement by the Nigerian subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) that it had lifted a force majeure on Bonny Light crude exports also added to market surplus woes.
Oil prices had earlier on Monday been supported by reports that Libya's top oilfield had cut its output by 30 percent on security concerns.
""A mere supply cut is not going to boost prices,"" said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of energy consultancy Trifecta. ""We actually need product demand for that to happen.""
U.S. crude stockpiles  likely fell for the seventh consecutive week, along with a probable fall in distillate and gasoline inventories last week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed.
The weekly U.S. crude inventory report from the industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) is due out later on Tuesday. Official U.S. government statistics will be released on Wednesday. 
Efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers to limit output have helped lift Brent past $50 a barrel, but concerns remain that these efforts could be undermined by producers in the U.S. and other countries.

U.S. shale oil production is expected to grow for its ninth consecutive month in September to 6.15 million barrels per day, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Monday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were flat on Monday, falling early on worries about Chinese demand but then recovering from session lows on questions about potential reductions in crude supply from Libya.
Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said an investigation had been opened into recent security violations at Sharara oil field. The NOC did not specify whether the violations had affected output at the country's largest field, which has been producing about 270,000 barrels a day.
Workers at Libya's Zueitina export terminal threatened to block a tanker due to dock on Saturday unless demands for salary and overtime payments are met.
""It is back to the Libyan situation being the most important thing here,"" said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. ""You have Libyan barrels off the market, so supply is not what it was at this time last week.""
Prices retraced all their losses, then see-sawed within a few cents of unchanged.
Global benchmark Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $51.73 a barrel by 11:21 a.m. EDT, down 37 cents from Friday's close. They touched a low of $51.60 earlier in the session.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) were trading at $48.62, down 20 cents.
Oil futures reversed course as gains were seen across global markets with world stocks rising, recovering some of their poise after fears of a U.S.-North Korea nuclear standoff drove them to the biggest weekly losses of 2017.
Efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers to limit output have helped lift Brent past $50 a barrel. A cutback from Libya could help improve the group's compliance with the cuts. 
The latest ICE exchange data showed investors last week raised net long holdings of the commodity by the highest amount this year.
This contrasts with more bearish bets placed in the U.S. market, where investors cut net long U.S. crude positions last week, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Rising production in Libya has added to the global crude glut. The OPEC member country is exempt from the global deal to cut output and has been trying to regain pre-war production levels.
""The recovery in Libyan production has been the single largest factor driving global supply growth in the last few months,"" oil analysts at Panmure Gordon wrote. 
Oil prices fell earlier on news that refinery runs in China dropped in July. 

Analysts said the drop was steeper than expected, exacerbating concerns that a glut of refined fuel products could weaken Chinese demand for oil.

Prices saw a weekly gain of nearly 7.5% last week, the biggest weekly price rally of the year, amid bullish weather forecasts that should increase demand for the fuel.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer cooling demand.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for cooling.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.038 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 8.3% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 2% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Early market expectations for this week's storage data due on Thursday is for a build in a range between 41 and 51 billion cubic feet in the week ended August 11.

601,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2017 07:10AM ET</span>","Energy hedge funds look to spreads, margins as long bets flail","By Julia Simon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - For the oil-trading community, the fall of hedge fund manager Andy Hall signaled a heavy blow, but while commodity funds continue to shutter their doors, some are finding other ways to make money, including trading refining margins and calendar spreads.
Commodity hedge funds have dwindled in recent years as oil prices slumped, leaving only a handful of larger players, including Hall, who ran the Astenbeck Capital Management fund until deciding to close it following losses this year.
A number of funds bet heavily on an oil rally early in the year, boosting long futures positions to a record in late February, before oil went into a prolonged slump as global supply remained elevated despite cuts from OPEC.
Many commodity funds have struggled this year as oil stagnated and volatility fell, hurting bets on large back-and-forth fluctuations. According to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), CTA funds - which concentrate on futures - were down 2.8 percent in 2017 through the end of July, while Hedge Fund Research's commodity hedge fund index was down 0.9 percent through the end of July.
Betting on other spreads has worked better with refining margins increasing sharply this year, as heavy demand for distillates has boosted those margins by more than 50 percent in the last two months.
After remaining depressed for most of 2016, gasoline margins have also rebounded. U.S. refining margins rallied to the highest in nearly two years early this month.
“Refining margins are healthy worldwide and global demand is healthy,” said RCMA Asset Management Chairman Doug King, whose Merchant Commodity Fund runs some $190 million in commodities. That fund is down 12 percent on the year, however.
Oil dropped sharply in March, bringing down Hall along with others including Andurand Commodities Fund, which through the end of July had lost more than 15 percent, according to a source close to the firm.
Those funds did not respond to request for comment.
""Funds started the year at record length in futures,” said Matthew Perry, partner at energy-focused hedge fund Kronenberg Capital Advisors LLC. ""That turned out to be devastating for most traders.""
Hall's decline was most surprising, according to traders, given decades of history in the market. But in a late 2016 investor letter he said OPEC's deal to cut supply meant the cartel was going to be more heavily involved in setting prices, and was likely to be bullish.
Not all funds are doing poorly. A group of 12 energy hedge funds monitored by Eurekahedge are up 5.1 percent so far this year. It is unclear if these funds are included in other indexes.
IN SEARCH OF LOST VOLATILITY
Volatility, as measured by the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index, has fallen in 2017. After two years of big price swings, the oil VIX has generally stayed below 30 in 2017, a level consistent with rangebound trading, which frustrates fund managers hoping for more up-and-down action.
“You can't put a lot of money to work when crude oil is trapped in a six-dollar range,"" said a hedge fund manager who could not comment on the record.
Some funds say they are finding opportunities in other areas, such as calendar spreads. These spreads measure price differences between pairs of contracts with different delivery dates, and they have been moving around more of late.
On Thursday, the December 2017 U.S. crude futures contract traded at a premium to the December 2018 contract briefly, known as backwardation.
“Time spreads and refinery margins have seen significant moves of late,"" said a hedge fund industry source who could not comment on the record. ""The people who will do well trade dynamically and take long and short positions.""

602,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 13, 2017 06:57AM ET</span>",Gold / Silver / Copper futures - weekly outlook: August 14 - 18,"Investing.com - Gold prices rose to a two-month high on Friday following a weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation report that investors worried would delay plans for another interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year.
Gold futures for December delivery settled up 0.38% at $1,295.00 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest close since June 6.
A Labor Department report showed that U.S. consumer prices edged up 0.1% in July from the prior month, bringing the annual increase in the consumer price index to 1.2%.
The data was the latest in a string of weak inflation readings that investors worry will make the Fed more cautious about plans for a third rate hike this year.
Futures traders are pricing in about a 35% chance of another rate hike by December, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.
Demand for the precious metal was also underpinned by increased safe haven demand amid heightened geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and North Korea.
Elsewhere in precious metals trading, silver was at $17.07 a troy ounce late Friday, after hitting $17.24 in the previous session, its highest since June 14. For the week, silver was up 5.24%, the largest weekly percentage gain since July 2016.
Platinum was up 0.19% to $987.8 a troy ounce after rising to $995.55 earlier, the most since March 2. It was up 2.23% for the week.
Palladium slid 0.34% to $894.02 a troy ounce to end the week up 2.27%.
Meanwhile, copper climbed 0.41% to $2.91 a pound to end the week with a gain of 1.01%. The industrial metal has been boosted in recent weeks from improved demand prospects from China and the country’s potential ban on scrap imports.
In the coming week, Wednesday’s minutes of the Fed’s latest meeting will be in focus as investors look for more hints on the timing of the next U.S. rate hike. A report on U.S. retail sales will also be closely watched.

603,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 13, 2017 05:44AM ET</span>",Crude oil futures - weekly outlook: August 14 - 18,"Investing.com - Oil prices settled higher on Friday, but still ended the week with a loss amid lingering concerns over a global supply glut.
Aside from supply and demand, investors also closely followed developments in the U.S.-North Korea standoff.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude September contract tacked on 23 cents, or around 0.5%, to end at $48.82 a barrel. It slumped to its lowest in around two-and-a-half weeks at $47.98 earlier in the session.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for October delivery inched up 20 cents, or about 0.4%, to settle at $52.10 a barrel by close of trade.
For the week, WTI lost 76 cents, or about 1.5%, while Brent dipped 32 cents, or roughly 0.6%, amid indications that OPEC members boosted production in July, despite the current pact to reduce output.
The International Energy Agency said OPEC's compliance with the cuts had fallen to 75% last month, the lowest since the deal began in January.
The bearish compliance data comes a day after OPEC released its monthly report, showing production from the group rose further in July, led by gains in Libya and Nigeria, two members exempt from the cuts, and top exporter Saudi Arabia.
OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, agreed since the start of the year to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018 in order to reduce a global supply glut and rebalance the market.
However, so far, the deal has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, as well as a relentless increase in U.S. shale output.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported Friday that its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the U.S. ticked up by three rigs to a total of 768 last week.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for September rose 1.0 cent, or about 0.6%, to end at $1.613 on Friday. It closed around 2% lower for the week.
September heating oil finished up 0.3 cents, or 0.2%, at $1.634 a gallon, ending roughly 0.9% lower for the week.
Natural gas futures for September delivery shed 0.2 cents, or 0.1%, to settle at $2.983 per million British thermal units. It saw a weekly gain of nearly 7.5%, the biggest weekly price rally of the year.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Meanwhile, traders will also continue to pay close attention to comments from global oil producers for evidence that they are complying with their agreement to reduce output this year.

Net profit crashed nearly 90 percent to $828 million from $7.3 billion the previous year, the company added.
Economists tend to focus on PDVSA's PDVSA.UL revenue because of its multibillion-dollar contributions to anti-poverty campaigns, which make profit figures less relevant in assessing performance than for private firms.
The OPEC nation, led by unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro, has the world's largest crude reserves, at around 300 billion barrels.
But production has been dropping due to a severe economic crisis, underinvestment, and shortages of basic equipment in oil fields. (Full Story)
PDVSA said average crude oil production, including natural gas liquids dropped to 2.57 million barrels per day, from 2.9 million in 2015. Exports, meanwhile, averaged 2.19 million barrels per day, from 2.4 million the previous year.
The company, the financial motor of Maduro's government, highlighted that it had brought costs down from 2015.
PDVSA had sought to delay the release of its audited financial statements until Friday, it said in a letter sent to a bank serving as a bond trustee and seen by Reuters this month.
Auditor KPMG signed off on the financial statements by PDVSA, published just before midnight on Friday.
PDVSA highlighted it had made bond payments of about $8.8 billion last year, ""despite constant attacks by the right-wing.""

It added that as of year-end 2016, the company had financial debts of nearly $42 billion, or 6 percent less than in 2015.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - An overhaul of Brazil's biofuels policy in coming days, aimed at cutting the country's carbon emissions, should boost demand for cleaner fuels, stabilize the volatile industry and accelerate a recent wave of mergers and acquisitions in the sector.
The new federal program, called RenovaBio, will give fuel distributors targets to cut emissions, which will force them to gradually increase biofuels volumes, according to policymakers, executives and analysts following discussions of the new law.
President Michel Temer will soon announce the program via presidential decree, the Agriculture Ministry said this week, and the law could go into effect next year as soon as new regulations are established.
RenovaBio could be a lifeline to Brazilian ethanol producers who have struggled in recent years to compete with cheap gasoline. It could also bolster sugar prices by encouraging mills to produce more ethanol and less sweetener.
""Our company sees this program very positively,"" said Rui Chammas, chief executive of Biosev SA (SA:BSEV3), the Brazilian sugar and ethanol unit of commodities trader Louis Dreyfus. ""It could mark a relevant change in how ethanol is valued, recognizing positive aspects such as the low carbon footprint.""
Ethanol production stagnated in recent years, as Brazil's government, in a failed effort to fight inflation, held down fuel prices which led cane mills to produce more sugar instead.
Brazil's ethanol industry complained that unpredictable fuel pricing policy distorted markets, discouraged investment and forced dozens of mills into bankruptcy. Cane industry group Unica said 80 plants have been idled in Brazil's center-south region since 2010, or a fifth of all mills.
Heavily indebted sugar and ethanol firms have been forced to sell assets to rivals with stronger capital structures, such as  Glencore  Plc (L:GLEN) and Raízen Energia SA, a 50-50 joint venture between Cosan SA Industria e Comercio (SA:CSAN3) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa).
2030 OUTLOOK
Plinio Nastari, a sugar and ethanol analyst at the Datagro consultancy and advisor to Brazil's National Energy Policy Council, said investments may pick up as RenovaBio gives a better sense of the industry's potential through 2030.
""Investors will have an idea of future size of this market to better plan their strategies,"" he said.
Nastari estimated the new policy could result in domestic demand for as much as 40 billion liters of ethanol by 2030, up sharply from just over 26 billion liters in 2016.
According to preliminary information from the Energy Ministry, RenovaBio will force fuel distributors to show they are cutting carbon emissions based on certificates issued by biofuel producers. The certificates will estimate the emissions cut compared to equivalent petroleum products.
The new policy provides distributors to buy and sell the certificates on a secondary market to meet emissions targets that will grow stricter, tracking Brazil's commitments within the Paris climate agreement.
""This program promises to boost investments in the current period of crisis,"" said Marcelo Moreira, a senior researcher at agricultural trade think-tank Agroicone. ""It is likely to spur (M&A) movements in the sector.""
Elizabeth Farina, head of cane industry group Unica, expects the policy shift to mark a return of more vigorous investments in the sector.
""New capital will be needed to expand production capacity and increase area under cultivation,"" she said.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery rose 23 cents to settle at $48.82 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added $0.10 to trade at $52 a barrel.
The International Energy Agency said OPEC's compliance with the cuts in July had fallen to 75%, the lowest since the cuts began in January. That despite the group’s pledge to increase compliance levels.
In May, Opec producers agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.2 million bpd agreed in November last year.
The bearish compliance data comes a day after Opec released its monthly report, showing production from the group rose further in July, as exempt producers – Nigeria and Libya – and top exporter Saudi Arabia increased output.
Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih on Friday attempted, however, to quell investor fears that the excess supplies would continue to weigh on prices, saying the kingdom did not rule out the possibility of additional production cuts.
Meanwhile, oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported Friday, its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the United States last week ticked up by three rigs to a total of 768.

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $3.40, or 0.26%, to $1,293.37 a troy ounce.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued a new threat to North Korea, saying American weapons were ""locked and loaded"" as Pyongyang accused him of driving the Korean Peninsula to the brink of nuclear war.
Trump’s latest salvo to threats from North Korea, stoked investor demand for safe-haven gold, lifting gold prices to its biggest weekly gain in four months.
Also underpinning a move higher in the precious metal, was data showing a continued slowdown in the pace of inflation as consumer prices rose less than expected in July.
The Labor Department said on Friday the Consumer Price Index (CPI) edged up 0.1% last month after being unchanged in June. That lifted the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 1.7% from 1.6% in June.
Economists had forecast the CPI rising 0.2% in July and climbing 1.8% year-on-year.
The downbeat inflation data added to growing expectations the Federal Reserve may abandon its plan to hike rates later this year, after the central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged in June, citing concerns over the stuttering pace of inflation.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
In other precious metal trade, silver futures rose 1.01% to $17.034 while platinum futures rose by 0.36% to $990.15.

U.S. crude futures for September delivery were down 0.76% at $48.20 a barrel, the lowest since July 26.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the October Brent declined 0.67% to $51.58 a barrel, the lowest since August 2.
Oil prices dropped after OPEC reported another rise in production in July, as exempt producers – Nigeria and Libya – and top exporter Saudi Arabia increased output.
This Opec report stoked fears that Opec and its allies’ may not be able to stem the glut in supplies by only curbing production, offsetting optimism from the prior session, when crude prices snapped a two-day losing streak, following bullish U.S. inventory data.
The cartel also raised its outlook for oil demand this year by 100,000 barrels a day, saying it now expects growth of 1.37 million barrels a day in 2017.
The news came a few days after OPEC members met in Abu-Dhabi to address concerns of falling compliance. The outcome of the meeting, however, failed to lift sentiment as the group offered little in the way of tangible solutions to increase compliance.
The meeting “proved fruitful and “will help facilitate full conformity with the Declaration of Cooperation, which participating countries remain steadfast in their commitment to fulfil.” Opec noted in a statement on its website.
Meanwhile, market participants also continued to monitor exchanges between North Korea and the U.S., as tensions seemed to escalate.
U.S. President Donald Trump warned the peninsula on Thursday against attacking Guam or U.S. allies and said his first threat to unleash ""fire and fury"" may have not been tough enough.
North Korea's state media had earlier said that Pyongyang has the capacity develop a plan by mid-August to launch intermediate-range missiles at the U.S. territory of Guam.
In an attempt to dial down the aggressive rhetoric, US Defense Secretary James Mattis said war would be ""catastrophic"" and that diplomacy was gaining results.

612,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2017 06:30AM ET</span>",IEA says strong oil demand growth helping market rebalance,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - World oil demand will grow more than expected this year, helping to ease a global glut despite rising production from North America and weak OPEC compliance with output cuts, the International Energy Agency said on Friday.
The agency raised its 2017 demand growth forecast to 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.4 million bpd in its previous monthly report and said it expected demand to expand by a further 1.4 million bpd next year.
""Producers should find encouragement from demand, which is growing year-on-year more strongly than first thought,"" said the Paris-based IEA, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy.
""There would be more confidence that rebalancing is here to stay if some producers party to the output agreements were not, just as they are gaining the upper hand, showing signs of weakening their resolve,"" the IEA said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is curbing output by about 1.2 million bpd, while Russia and other non-OPEC producers are cutting a further 600,000 bpd until March 2018 to help support oil prices.
The IEA said OPEC's compliance with the cuts in July had fallen to 75 percent, the lowest since the cuts began in January.
It cited weak compliance by Algeria, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.
In addition, OPEC member Libya, which is currently exempt from the output cuts, steeply increased output. 
As a result, the overall global oil supply rose by 520,000 bpd in July to stand 500,000 bpd above year-ago levels.
Adding to the challenges of oil producers to support oil prices is rising non-OPEC output, which is expected to expand by 0.7 million bpd in 2017 and by 1.4 million bpd in 2018 on strong gains in the United States, which is not participating in the output caps.
Still, strong global demand growth is helping to clear excess barrels with the IEA registering a decline in stocks in industrialized nations in both June and July.
Stocks remain 219 million barrels above a 5-year average - a level that OPEC is targeting with its output cuts.
The IEA also revised historic demand data for 2015-2016 for developing countries, cutting it by 0.2-0.4 million bpd. 
As a result of those historic revisions, the IEA cut baseline demand figures for 2017-2018 by around 0.3-0.4 million bpd and hence lowered demand for OPEC crude by the same amount.
""The impact of carrying this lower demand base into 2017 against unchanged supply numbers is that stock draws later in the year are likely to be lower than first thought,"" the IEA said.

Changes mainly happened as the IEA revised down historic demand data for Indonesia, Malaysia and Iran while revising up India and keeping China largely unchanged.

615,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2017 03:40AM ET</span>",A false dawn for Chinese aluminum? Some think so,"By Tom Daly and Melanie Burton
BEIJING/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Chinese aluminum prices have skyrocketed amid a crackdown on overcapacity, but traders say final demand is weak and cuts may not be as big as expected. Trading data shows some are bracing for a correction.
China, the world's largest producer of the metal, is forcing illegally built plants to close and pursuing others that have not met environmental targets as it pushes to clear its skies and shore up loss-making industries.
Analysts see 3-4 million tonnes of smelting capacity closures this year, equal to about a tenth of China's production. Just last month, China's top aluminum region Shandong ordered 3.2 mln tonnes offline.
Expectations of a supply shortfall have seen aluminum prices on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) skyrocket 16 percent since Aug. 1. Open interest has ballooned by 50 percent to a record high above 910,000 lots.
But traders and analysts warn that the market has climbed too far, too fast, which has scared off physical consumers.
""Considering the current situation of the physical market ... I think [the speculators] are crazy,"" said one trader in Shanghai, noting weak downstream demand. 
""China's supply side reform is more than expected (but) the reality is inventories are higher, consumption is not good and aluminum rod processing fees are sharply lower,"" said a manager at a Chinese futures brokerage.
Bears are betting that booming prices will encourage some plants to restart, while new capacity that has been closed by regulators will be allowed to reopen after winter.
""There's a lot of hype to it. This is all expectations of massive cuts coming through,"" said analyst Ed Meir of INTL FC Stone in New York.
The world's largest aluminum maker, China Hongqiao Group Ltd said last week it would cut more than 2 million tonnes per year of ""outdated capacity"", but that new capacity would keep its total at 6.5 million-7 million tonnes.
""They are keeping their overall production target intact. If you're not going to see any cutbacks overall, how is that bullish?"" said Meir.
At the same time, producers are ramping up output.
China's aluminum production hit its second highest on record in June while SHFE stocks are at four-year highs. One trader at a global merchant in Asia said she expected China's stockpiles to grow from 1.2 million tonnes now to 2 million tonnes by year end. 
Bears are boosting positions in the options market, with a surge in put interest at strike prices well below London Metal Exchange aluminum, which was at $2,024 a tonne on Friday. Open interest at strikes of $1,700, $1,800 and $1,900 has jumped by 50-100 percent in the past month. 
Meanwhile, premiums for delivery of aluminum held in China's bonded zones sank to one-year lows this week, indicating weak demand for the metal, although premiums have since partially recovered. 
To be sure the market is expected to tighten and prices could have further to run. More closures may come from November as China begins its winter heating season, when aluminum producers in 28 cities have been ordered to slash output to curb pollution.
""The LME price is still hitting new highs since 2014 and I feel the Chinese supply side reform is not at the end yet,"" said one investor in Shenzhen.
But one producer source noted that previously closed capacity can count to the total. 
Shares in Aluminium Corp of China (Chalco),, a gauge of investor interest in the sector, have fallen 13 percent in the past two days after touching a two-year high.
""I still hold Chalco shares and options, but have reduced my positions,"" the Shenzhen investor added.

In an attempt to dial down the aggressive rhetoric, US Defence Secretary James Mattis said war would be ""catastrophic"" and that diplomacy was gaining results.
Meanwhile, market participants were eyeing an upcoming report on U.S. consumer price inflation, due later on Friday, after the U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday that producer price inflation and its core reading both unexpectedly declined last month.
The U.S. Department of Labor separately reported that initial jobless claims increased unexpectedly in the week ending August 5.
The reports came after a series of upbeat U.S. employment reports had fueled expectations the Federal Reserve will stick to its plans for a third interest rate hike this year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 93.31.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both U.S. rates and the dollar. A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency, while a rise in U.S. rates lifts the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

Brent crude, the global benchmark, was down 30 cents, or 0.58 percent, at $51.60 per barrel by 0336 GMT. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 31 cents, or 0.64 percent, at $48.28 a barrel.
Oil prices touched 2-1/2 month highs on Thursday, but retreated to close down around 1.5 percent, with U.S. prices slipping back below $50 per barrel amid ongoing oversupply concerns.
""Crude oil prices failed to hold recent gains, with a nervous market starting to doubt recent falls in inventories,"" ANZ bank said in a note.
""Supply-side issues also weighed on prices, with data showing Libyan production in July hit its highest level for the year."" 
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump stepped up his rhetoric against North Korea again on Thursday, saying his earlier threat to unleash ""fire and fury"" on Pyongyang if it launched an attack may not have been tough enough.
""I think the issue that is affecting the market is the general risk sentiment of saber-rattling between Washington and Pyongyang,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.
Official data showed crude inventories in the United States, the world's top oil consumer, fell sharply by 6.5 million barrels in the week ending to Aug. 4, as refiners ramped up run rates to the highest in 12 years due to strong demand. 
But doubts remain over whether enough crude would be consumed to end a global glut after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reported on Thursday another increase in the oil cartel's production, even though it raised outlook for oil demand in 2018.
OPEC said its oil output rose by 173,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) in July to 32.87 million bpd.
Faced with lingering global glut woes, OPEC and some non-OPEC members including Russia in May extended oil production cuts to reduce 1.8 million bpd. 
Meanwhile, Russian oil producer Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) Neft is considering resuming production in mature fields after the OPEC-led production cut agreement, a representative of the company said on Thursday.

Rising output from Nigeria and Libya is further undermining the oil producers' attempt to limit oil production. Nigeria and Libya are exempted from curbing output as they seek to restore supplies hurt by internal conflicts.

In a monthly report Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries raised its outlook for oil demand this year by 100,000 barrels a day, saying it now expects growth of 1.37 million barrels a day in 2017.
The cartel also said, however, that production from the group rose further in July, as exempt producers – Nigeria and Libya – and top exporter Saudi Arabia increased output.
This Opec report stoked fears that Opec and its allies’ may not be able to stem the glut in supplies by only curbing production, offsetting optimism from the prior session, when crude prices snapped a two-day losing streak, following bullish U.S. inventory data.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 6.5m barrels in the week ended Aug 4, confounding expectations of a draw of about only 2.5m barrels, the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday. It was the sixth-straight weekly decline.
The uptick in Opec production comes a few days after the group met in Abu-Dhabi to address concerns of falling compliance. The outcome of the meeting, however, failed to lift sentiment as the group offered little in the way of tangible solutions to increase compliance.
The meeting “proved fruitful and “will help facilitate full conformity with the Declaration of Cooperation, which participating countries remain steadfast in their commitment to fulfil.” Opec noted in a statement on its website.

621,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2017 08:32PM ET</span>",Senators urge Trump to avoid blockade of Venezuela oil shipments,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four U.S. Senate Republicans from oil refining states urged the Trump administration on Thursday to not block oil shipments from Venezuela as part of U.S. sanctions against the country, saying it could raise costs for U.S. fuel consumers. 
The United States sanctioned President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan officials after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on widespread opposition. It has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member's oil industry.
Senators John Cornyn of Texas, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, and Thad Cochran and Roger Wicker of Mississippi said in the letter, which was seen by Reuters, that unilaterally blocking oil exports could harm the U.S. economy and Venezuelan people. 
The United States imports about 740,000 barrels per day of oil from Venezuela. 
The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the letter, which was addressed to President Donald Trump. 
""We believe it is critical to consider the role the U.S. energy industry and refining sector play in our economic and national security interest,"" the senators wrote. ""Blockading imports could inflict great harm on this industry and burden U.S. taxpayers with the cost.""
The senators said sanctions on shipments of Venezuelan oil to the United States could also increase the likelihood of a disorderly default by Venezuela, given the oil business is its main source of revenue. Creditors could then seize Venezuelan oil assets and cut off the government's remaining sources of financing. 
They also noted that such sanctions could expand the interests of China and Russia in Venezuela's oil business. Both countries have invested in Venezuela for years. 
Sources have said the United States could use heavy crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve held in caverns along the Gulf Coast, to relieve any short-term supply pressure if Venezuela's shipments were blocked. Nearly 680 million barrels of oil are in reserve.

A drilling boom in the United States has allowed the government to store more oil than it needs to meet international spare supply agreements.

622,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2017 05:00PM ET</span>","Oil service firms see fewer, but bigger, bankruptcy filings in 2017: report","By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oilfield service creditors have been hit harder this year by bankruptcy court filings than during all of 2016, according to law firm Haynes and Boone, a sign of the oil industry's uneven recovery. 
Through the first seven months, U.S. oilfield service companies filed for bankruptcy owing $16.4 billion, compared with $13.5 billion in total debt for all of last year. There were 33 oilfield service bankruptcies through July, compared with 46 filings in the same period last year, according to the law firm. 
While drilling activity has sharply gained among U.S. onshore producers and oil prices (CLc1) at about $48.50 are above last year's low, they are still not high enough to lift offshore drilling activity and pricier international projects.
Deepwater drilling contractor Ocean Rig USW Inc listed debts of about $3.7 billion in its March bankruptcy filing, the largest since Haynes and Boone began tracking energy bankruptcies in 2015. Geophysical services provider CGG (US) Holding Inc was the second-largest filing, owing creditors $3.4 billion, when it declared bankruptcy in June. 
""Many of the larger companies were able to do some out-of-court restructurings to weather the storm, but as depressed commodity prices continued, the market drove them into bankruptcy,"" said Stephen Pezanosky, a restructuring partner with Haynes and Boone in Dallas. 
Companies involved in offshore services currently dominate energy restructurings. 
Bankruptcy filings among companies that explore for and produce oil and gas have fallen sharply this year, with only 14 seeking court protection as of July 31, compared with 55 in the same period last year, according to the study.
No energy producers filed for bankruptcy in July, but some are anticipated to seek restructuring help in the third and fourth quarter of this year, Pezanosky said.
""We've got a number of companies that were able to keep their heads above water in 2016, but now that commodity prices have not completely recovered, they're having to do something, whether it's in-court or out-of-court restructuring,"" he said.
Since the start of 2015, 128 oil and gas producers have filed for bankruptcy, according to Haynes and Boone's tally.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 10, 2017 10:54AM ET</span>","OPEC sees higher 2018 oil demand, points to easing glut","By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC forecast higher demand for its crude in 2018 on Thursday due to rising global consumption, and pointed to signs of a stronger oil market that suggest an OPEC-led production cut is getting rid of price-sapping excess supply.
In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said the world would need 32.42 million barrels per day (bpd) of its oil next year, up 220,000 bpd from the previous forecast.
OPEC also said physical oil markets in Europe and West Africa had firmed and that an increase in the price of Brent crude oil for immediate delivery compared to later supplies indicated the glut was easing.
""The entire forward curve has flattened for Brent amid some bullish indicators in the physical market,"" OPEC said. ""Crude differentials strengthened notably for a range of key grades in the Mediterranean, North Sea and West African markets.""
Oil (LCOc1) rose to more than $53 a barrel, shrugging off data in the report showing another jump in OPEC output and suggesting the market will remain in surplus next year.
OPEC is curbing output by about 1.2 million bpd, while Russia and other non-OPEC producers cut half as much, until March 2018.
The deal is aimed at getting rid of excess stocks and in a sign it is working, OPEC said inventories in developed economies declined in June and have fallen by 87 million barrels compared to the five-year average since the cut started in January.
""Further declines in U.S. crude stocks are likely, given the record rates at which U.S. refineries are running,"" OPEC said. 
U.S. refinery use has hit a 12-year high, official figures showed on Wednesday.
DEMAND, OUTPUT UP
OPEC raised its forecasts for global oil demand growth in 2017 and 2018, saying consumption would rise by 1.28 million bpd next year. It was also upbeat about the global economy.
""World economic growth has gained momentum,"" OPEC said. ""With the ongoing growth momentum and an expected continued dynamic in second-half 2017, there is still some room to the upside.""
But the report showed the 14-country group's oil output in July came in above the demand forecast, led by gains in Libya and Nigeria, two members exempt from the cuts. 
OPEC said its oil output rose by 173,000 bpd in July to 32.87 million bpd, led by the exempt producers plus top exporter Saudi Arabia, citing figures it collects from secondary sources. 
Saudi Arabia told OPEC it cut output to 10.01 million bpd last month, from 10.07 million bpd in June, meaning its production fell back below its OPEC target of 10.058 million bpd.
The figures mean OPEC has complied 86 percent with its output-cutting pledge, according to a Reuters calculation, down from 96 percent initially reported for June but still high by OPEC standards.
Supply is rising outside the group as well, although not quite as fast as OPEC thought. 
OPEC estimated supply from non-OPEC next year would rise by 1.10 million bpd, down 40,000 bpd from the previous forecast, citing downward revisions to the United States and Canada.

Should OPEC keep pumping at July's rate, the market would see a 450,000-bpd surplus next year, the report indicated, although this was less than the surplus implied by last month's report.

U.S. natural gas for September delivery was at $2.963 per million British thermal units by 10:50AM ET (1450GMT), up 8.0 cents, or around 2.8%. It touched its highest since July 28 at $2.967 earlier. Futures were at around $2.896 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 28 billion cubic feet in the week ended August 4, below forecasts for a build of 38 billion.
That compared with a gain of 20 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 29 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 54 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.038 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 8.3% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 2% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Futures ended higher on Wednesday, notching their third-straight session of gains, as near-term weather forecasts turned hotter.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer cooling demand.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for cooling.

Comex gold futures rose to a daily peak of $1,291.20 a troy ounce, a level not seen since June 8. It was last at $1,290.45 by 9:05AM ET (1305GMT), up $11.10, or around 0.9%.
The Labor Department said its producer price index slipped 0.1% last month, reversing June's 0.1% gain. July's drop was the largest since August 2016.
In the 12 months through July the PPI increased 1.9% after rising 2.0% in the year through June.
Economists had forecast the PPI ticking up 0.1% last month and climbing 2.2% from a year ago.
The unexpected drop in producer prices backed bets of a slower pace of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
Gold has been well-supported in recent weeks as fading expectations for a third Fed rate hike this year due to weak inflation combined with deepening political turmoil in the White House boosted the appeal of the precious metal.
Gold scored its sharpest daily rise since mid-May on Wednesday as investors piled into safe haven assets amid intensifying tensions between the U.S. and North Korea.
North Korea's state media kept up its anti-U.S. rhetoric on Thursday, saying the nation will develop a plan by mid-August to launch intermediate-range missiles at Guam, where the U.S. has a large military base.

Elsewhere, Brent oil for October delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London tacked on 83 cents, or about 1.6%, to $53.53 a barrel. It touched its highest since May 25 at $53.63 earlier in the session.
Sentiment was boosted after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries forecast higher demand for its oil in 2018 due to rising global consumption and slower supply growth from rivals.
In its monthly report released earlier, OPEC said the world would need 32.42 million barrels per day (bpd) of its crude next year, up 220,000 bpd from the previous forecast.
The group was also upbeat about 2018 economic growth and said oil stocks in developed economies declined in June and would fall further in the U.S., a sign the OPEC-led supply cut is working.
According to the report, the cartel's oil output rose by 173,000 bpd in July to 32.87 million bpd, led by gains in Libya and Nigeria, two members exempt from the cuts aimed at eliminating excess supply.
The figures mean OPEC has complied 86% with its output-cutting pledge, down from 96% initially reported for June but still high by OPEC standards.
OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, agreed since the start of the year to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018 in order to reduce a global supply glut and rebalance the market.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday, lifted by a sustained decline in inventories and as Saudi Arabia prepared to cut crude supplies to its prized Asian customers.
Crude is down nearly 7 percent so far this year, suppressed in large part by concern that OPEC and its partners may not be able to force global oil inventories to drop by cutting production.
However, Saudi Arabia said on Tuesday it would cut supplies to most buyers in Asia - the world's biggest oil-consuming region - by up to 10 percent in September.
Brent crude futures were up 29 cents at $52.99 a barrel by 0855 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 17 cents at $49.73.
In a sign that investors are turning more optimistic about the pace at which oil supply and demand are rebalancing, prices for crude for prompt delivery are trading above those for delivery further in the future. 
""This is the march toward the flattening of the curve,"" said SEB chief commodity strategist Bjarne Schieldrop.
""The major event now going forward is the Middle East and Asian refineries rushing back into operation and consuming more crude, just as Saudi Arabia says it will cut September deliveries to Asia,"" he said.
The physical market is also showing signs of stronger near-term demand, after having suffered from a persistent overhang of unused crude.
Prices for prompt deliveries of North Sea crude oil are at their smallest discount to future prices in nearly two years and a surplus of oil stored on ships is gradually dissipating, having hit two-year highs. 
Inventories in the United States are at their lowest since October, having fallen for 10 of the last 12 weeks.
Global stocks remain above their longer-term averages and with the summer driving season nearly at an end, investors are well aware that the attempts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers to boost prices may bring unwanted side-effects.

""The minute OPEC try to raise prices by cutting production, U.S. producers will react accordingly to fill the void. This results in a tug of war that we have witnessed all year and the final outcome is a range-bound market,"" said Matt Stanley, a commodities broker at Freight Investor Services in Dubai.

U.S. oil inventories fell by 6.5 million barrels at the end of last week to 474.4 million barrels, much more than the expected drop of around 2.7 million barrels.
However, the report also showed that gasoline inventories rose by 3.4 million barrels, disappointing expectations for a decline of 1.4 million barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a fall of 1.7 million barrels.
Meanwhile, market players awaited monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency to assess global oil supply and demand levels.
OPEC will publish its monthly assessment of oil markets at around 7:00AM ET (1100GMT) on Thursday. It includes figures on the state of global crude stockpiles for July.
On Friday, the International Energy Agency will release its own monthly report on global oil supply and demand.
The data will give traders a better picture of whether a global rebalancing is taking place in the oil market.
OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, agreed since the start of the year to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018 in order to reduce a global supply glut and rebalance the market.
However, so far, the deal has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, as well as a relentless increase in U.S. shale output.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for September was little changed at $1.624 a gallon, while September heating oil ticked up less than half a cent to $1.656 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for September delivery shed 0.6 cents to $2.877 per million British thermal units as traders looked ahead to weekly storage data due later in the global day.

The statement, attributed to Wang Hejun, head of the Commerce Ministry's trade remedy and investigation bureau, was more strongly worded than typical responses to trade disputes with the United States. 
The statement said there were no grounds to accuse China's downstream aluminum companies of benefiting from subsidies.
Washington has previously made similar claims about China's banking sector, unreasonably labeling Chinese commercial banks as public institutions, the statement also said. 
The Wechat post followed news on Wednesday that China's top foil producers are preparing to launch a legal challenge to a U.S. Commerce Department ruling that would slap antidumping duties of 16.56 percent to 80.97 percent on Chinese aluminum foil imports.
China's government said it is highly concerned about the action the United States is taking to provide relief to its aluminum industry. 
Washington is also investigating whether to curb aluminum imports from China under the rarely used Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows restrictions on imports for reasons of national security.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is conducting a separate investigation into steel imports from China.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Wednesday after a report showed U.S. refineries processed record amounts of crude in the latest week, eating into inventories, although a surprise jump in gasoline stockpiles limited price gains.
U.S. crude inventories  fell 6.5 million barrels last week, government data showed, steeper than the expected decrease of 2.7 million barrels. Refiners processed nearly 17.6 million barrels of crude, surpassing a record set in May and the most for any week since the U.S. Department of Energy started keeping data in 1982. 
Brent crude (LCOc1), the global benchmark, was up 33 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $52.47 at 1:07 p.m. EDT (1708 GMT), after two days of declines. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) gained 19 cents, or 0.4 percent to $49.36.
""A drop in crude oil imports and another step up in refinery utilization accounts for the bulk of the decline in crude inventories,"" said David Thompson, executive vice president at Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington, D.C..
""Demand for both gasoline and distillate fuels remains strong but it's worth noting that gasoline demand should be strong at this time of year and we are drawing closer to the end of summer driving season.""
The data showed gasoline stocks , rose by 3.4 million barrels, confounding expectations in a Reuters poll for a drop of 1.5 million barrels as imports into the East Coast region picked up. Gasoline futures (RBc1) fell about 1 percent to the lowest in nearly two weeks.
""Whilst the upside to imports into the U.S. East Coast remains limited amidst refinery issues in Europe, interest in shipping gasoline from the U.S. Gulf Coast into PADD 1 appears to have picked-up as we move into the transitioning period between summer and winter specifications,"" Energy Aspects said in a note.
From a technical perspective, $48.16-$48.37 a barrel region is a key zone of support for front-month WTI futures, Thompson said. 
The drop in U.S. crude stocks also raised hopes that OPEC-led output cuts were helping wipe out a three-year global supply glut.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers are cutting output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) under a deal set to run until March 2018.
The deal has supported prices but an output recovery in Libya and Nigeria, OPEC members exempt from the cut, has complicated the effort. U.S. shale oil drillers have also ramped up production.
OPEC officials met this week in Abu Dhabi to boost adherence to the supply cuts. In a statement after the meeting, OPEC said the conclusions reached would boost compliance. Still, some analysts remained sceptical. 
""The statement on the OPEC website following the Abu Dhabi meeting was short on substance,"" Vienna-based JBC Energy said.

Top OPEC exporter Saudi Arabia, keen to get rid of the glut, will cut crude allocations to customers in September by at least 520,000 bpd, an industry source said on Tuesday.

ALMYETYEVSK, Russia (Reuters) - A global deal cutting crude output has forced mid-sized Russian oil company Tatneft to curb flows at some fields, leaving it with lower revenues but little relief from maintenance and running costs. Its response: innovation.
Yelkhovneft, a Tatneft unit in the semi-autonomous republic of Tatarstan some 1,200 km (750 miles) southeast of Moscow, has cut oil output by 6.6 percent since May, following an extension of the supply-reducing deal led by Russia and Saudi Arabia. 
""Faced with lower profits due to the cut in production, we have put greater emphasis on bringing down operating costs,"" Azat Khabibrakhmanov, head of the Tatneft unit, which produced 3.3 million tonnes of oil last year, told Reuters.
The unit has oil pumps in two colors: green brings lighter crude to the surface while yellow draws heavier oil. Under the global deal, aimed at boosting the price of oil, Yelkhovneft's output of both types is down. 
Standing near one of the pumps, surrounded by yellow rapeseed flowers, Khabibrakhmanov said his unit was scaling back production mainly at wells with low flow rates, particularly those with a high water content. 
""This has given us a certain stimulus to find new solutions for cutting production costs, bringing in new energy-efficiency technologies,"" he said. 
Yelkhovneft, which accounts for around 12 percent of Tatneft's oil production, is not altering key processes such as drilling or enhanced oil recovery - indeed, the company wants to be able to ramp up output quickly once the supply deal expires. 
Instead, Yelkhovneft is scaling back measures aimed at limiting water flow and various other types of work, including in the rock formation at the bottom of a well.
""This way, we will be able to restore oil production to its previous levels quite quickly, I think in a month or two,"" Khabibrakhmanov said. 
Yelkhovneft has also started drilling more smaller-scale wells, allowing it to halve drilling-related spending. It has begun to use lighter or fewer metal parts in equipment, cutting costs further, Khabibrakhmanov said.
Yelkhovneft has more than 5,800 wells drilled in Tatarstan's Almetyevsk area, in a swathe of land three times the size of Hong Kong. Of those, 2,300 produce oil. This number was cut from 2,500 after Russia backed the extension of the OPEC/non-OPEC deal until March next year.
CUTTING COSTS
Tatneft, which itself produces almost 600,000 barrels of oil per day, is substituting revenues it would have otherwise received without the cuts by trying to limit costs. 
""This (cost-cutting) project ... is actively developing and will allow the company to reach its strategic goal of increasing production while cutting costs,"" Khabibrakhmanov said. 
Khabibrakhmanov did not say how much Tatneft had saved. In total, Tatneft will cut its oil output by around 350,000 tonnes (2.6 million barrels) this year under the global deal. 
Tatneft was spending an average of 235 rubles ($4) to extract a barrel of oil in the first quarter of this year, down almost 15 percent quarter-on-quarter thanks to cost savings, the company's latest report showed. 
Tatneft, which did not provide a comparison with global oil producers, has yet to present second-quarter results. 
Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil producer, has long said the cost of extracting oil in Russia is among the lowest in the world thanks to a favorable rouble exchange rate.
Before the global oil pact took effect in January, officials had said Moscow would find it hard to cut production without risking damage to some of its wells, due to harsh, icy weather. 
But the decision was made and output is being curbed in different ways: some are curbing flows at the newest fields, such as Rosneft; others, including Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) Neft and Tatneft, are focusing on aging deposits. 
Apart from adapting to output curbs, the Russian oil industry was forced to seek new ways to extract crude after the imposition of sanctions in 2014 that limited the use of Western equipment in offshore Arctic, shale and deepwater projects. 
Although Tatneft was not affected by the sanctions, it started to substitute foreign equipment essential for its high-viscosity oil projects - which it sees as a source of future growth - with domestic equipment. 
Tatneft mainly operates mature fields in its native Volga-Urals region of Tatarstan, where the Romashkinskoye oilfield, launched more than 70 years ago, still accounts for more than half of the company's production. 
Of 29 million tonnes of oil planned to be extracted this year, some 1.5 million - double last year's amount - should be high viscosity, which requires heating to extract crude. 
""At the beginning (of the high-viscosity oil project), we used mostly foreign equipment, starting to implement substitution step-by-step. Now, over 95 percent of the equipment is domestically produced,"" Robert Akhmadullin, first deputy head of Tatneft's high-viscosity oil department, told Reuters. 
Tatneft plans to invest around 20 billion rubles into developing high-viscosity deposits in 2017-2018 compared to an overall investment program of 100 billion rubles for this year. 

High-viscosity oil resources in Tatarstan are estimated to be over 1.4 billion tonnes, Tatneft says, hoping the company will be able to substitute aging deposits for this type of crude as time passes.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian security companies have seen a surge in demand for guards to protect palm oil plantations from fruit thieves and land grabbers, amid a rebound in prices of the commodity used to churn out everything from cooking oil to soap.
Palm prices have jumped over 15 percent in the last few months, boosting the temptation for individuals or small-scale criminal gangs to steal fruit to sell to middlemen in the world's biggest producer of the tropical oil. 
Security companies said this was driving more business their way, with palm growers looking to step up the number of guards patrolling plantations that can sometimes cover up to 30,000 hectares, equivalent to nearly half the entire land area of nearby Singapore.
Some of those vast plantations are now being guarded by up to 200 people, Agoes Dermawan, secretary-general of the Indonesian Security Industry Association, told Reuters.
""Palm is one of the sectors that require a lot of security forces because the level of theft of fresh fruit bunches is quite high, and other crimes related to plantations have also been rising, Dermawan said.
Unclear regulations on land ownership in palm-growing regions such as Sumatra and Kalimantan have also led to overlapping claims for land, with indigenous people occasionally occupying the concession areas of palm oil companies.
Around 15 percent of the 650 members of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association are expected to use private security services this year, up from 10 percent in 2016, said Eddy Martono, head of the body's agrarian and spatial planning unit.
Thieves of fresh fruit bunches tend to use motorbikes or pickup trucks to speed loot to middlemen, Martono said.
HOT COMMODITY 
PT Nawakara Perkasa Nusantara, founded over 20 years ago by former police officers, started venturing into security for palm producers after a slowdown in demand for its services from oil and gas companies, said Chief Executive Dino Hindarto.
""Crude oil prices fell, so some of our clients in oil and gas also started slowing down their exploration, and that affected us,"" Hindarto said, adding that the firm plans to open two offices in palm-growing regions next year.
Security guards trained by Nawakara, which has around 10,000 employees in total, are tasked with preventing ""unauthorized people"" from accessing palm plantations, especially during the harvest season, Hindarto said.
Most plantation companies declined to comment on their security arrangements, but PT Perusahaan Perkebunan London Sumatra Indonesia Tbk President Director Benny Tjoeng said the firm had hired security personnel relative to the size of its plantations.
Tjoeng added that cases of attempted crime at those sites were ""under control"", without giving more detail.

Palm prices have been pushed up as key buyer China replenished some of its stocks and as dry weather in the United States prompted buyers to switch to the tropical oil from soybeans.

After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories fell by 7.89 million barrels in the week ended August 4.
The API report also showed a gain of 1.5 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks fell by 157,000 barrels.
There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA.
Meanwhile, officials from a joint OPEC and non-OPEC technical committee said on Tuesday that they expect greater compliance with their output-cutting pact.
According to recent calculations, compliance fell to 86% in July, the lowest level since January.
OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, agreed since the start of the year to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018 in order to reduce a global supply glut and rebalance the market.
However, so far, the deal has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, as well as a relentless increase in U.S. shale output.

Overnight, gold prices edged lower on Tuesday, pressured by a rebound in the dollar, after U.S. job openings topped forecasts, pointing to an improving labor market, lifting expectations the Federal Reserve will keep to its plan to raise rates at least once more this year.
Gold struggled to hold onto gains, as the dollar hit a nearly two-week high, after U.S. job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 461,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.2 million, the highest level since the series started in December 2000, the Labor Department said on Tuesday.
Losses in the precious metal were limited, however, as some Fed members suggested that the slowdown in inflation will continue to weigh on the Fed’s ability to raise rates even if the U.S. job market continues to improve.

North Korea said it is considering plans for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam. The strike plan would be put into practice at any moment once leader Kim Jong Un makes a decision, a spokesman for the Korean People's Army (KPA) said in a statement carried by the North's state-run KCNA news agency.
Saudi Arabia—the world’s largest producer of crude oil—is expected to cut sales of oil supplies to Asia by up to 10% in September, to stem the global crude glut, according to multiple reports Tuesday.

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC officials were holding a second day of meetings in Abu Dhabi to discuss ways to boost compliance with their oil output-cutting pact, sources familiar with the talks said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers are cutting production by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018 to get rid of a glut and support prices.
In Abu Dhabi, a panel comprising Russia, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, plus officials from OPEC's Vienna headquarters, has met individually with officials from Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan and Malaysia, one of the sources said.
A statement on the compliance-boosting effort is being drafted and will probably be issued after the meeting concludes on Tuesday, two sources said. 
Major OPEC producers Iraq and the UAE have shown relatively low compliance with the deal based on figures OPEC uses to monitor its supply. Non-OPEC Kazakhstan and Malaysia have been boosting output in the last few months, according to the International Energy Agency.
At a meeting held in Russia last month, both OPEC countries confirmed their commitment to the pact but offered no concrete plan on how to meet their production targets, sources said. 
Iraq and the UAE say the assessment of their production by secondary sources - figures from government agencies, consultants and industry media that OPEC uses to monitor its output - before the pact took effect in January was too low. 

They argue that as a result, the two countries have the unpalatable task of making an even bigger cut to comply fully.

U.S. natural gas for September delivery was at $2.800 per million British thermal units by 9:05AM ET (1305GMT), down 0.1 cents, or less than 0.1%.
Natural gas futures ended higher on Monday, snapping a three-day losing streak.
Prices fell to their lowest since March 2 at $2.753 at the end of last week amid bearish weather forecasts that should limit demand for the fuel.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer cooling demand.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for cooling.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.010 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 8.5% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 2.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Early market expectations for this week's storage data due on Thursday is for a build in a range between 32 and 42 billion cubic feet in the week ended August 4.
That compares with a gain of 20 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 29 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 54 billion cubic feet.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Tuesday after news of lower crude supplies from Saudi Arabia offset higher output from other large producers including the United States.
Saudi state oil company Aramco will cut allocations to its customers worldwide in September by at least 520,000 barrels per day (bpd), sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
The cut is in line with the kingdom's commitments in a supply reduction pact led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries designed to bolster oil prices that have been depressed for more than three years by a global glut.
But oil production remains high in many parts of the world and prices are still around half the level seen in 2011-2014.
Benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 20 cents at $52.57 a barrel by 1020 GMT. U.S. light crude (CLc1) was 20 cents higher at $49.59.
""Support is coming from a stabilizing U.S. rig count, falling U.S. inventories and the Saudi cut in exports,"" Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark's Saxo Bank, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.
""But against this we still have robust production growth from the United States, Libya and Nigeria.""
Production from Libya's 270,000 bpd Sharara field is returning to normal after a disruption when protesters broke into a control room, the National Oil Corp said.
OPEC member Libya is exempt from limits on its production and a recovery of the North African country's output has complicated OPEC's efforts to curb supply, fuelling doubts over the effectiveness of the agreed cuts. Libya pumped 1.03 million bpd in July, according to the latest Reuters survey. 
OPEC output hit a 2017-high in July and its exports were at record levels.
Officials from a joint OPEC and non-OPEC technical committee are meeting in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday to discuss ways to increase compliance with the deal to cut 1.8 million bpd in production. 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration, part of the Energy Department, will release its weekly petroleum status report at 1430 GMT on Wednesday, giving details on stockpiles and refinery runs.
U.S. crude inventories were expected to have posted their sixth straight weekly decline last week, while refined product stockpiles probably fell too, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday. [EIA/S]

Oil output in the United States has risen this year, although Baker Hughes data on Friday showed a cut of one drilling rig in the week to Aug. 4.

Heavy rainfall and flash flooding is possible across the Yucatan and parts of Belize.
Franklin, which formed on Sunday, is located 75 miles (121 km) east of Chetumal, the Mexican city near the country's border with Belize, and was closing in on making landfall at a speed of 14 miles per hour (23 km per hour).
Officials from five towns along the coast in Quintana Roo state closed schools for Monday and Tuesday, and the Chetumal airport was also shut Monday afternoon.
Franklin is blowing maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (97 kph), and the center of the storm is expected to make landfall late Monday night, cross the peninsula and then reach the Bay of Campeche late Tuesday on the other side, the Miami-based NHC said in an advisory.
Once in the southern Gulf of Mexico, the storm is expected to strengthen and could become a hurricane on Wednesday.
The southern rim of the Gulf is near state oil company Pemex's major shallow water drilling projects, home to more than 80 percent of the firm's crude production.
Pemex said the company is closely monitoring the storm, and that all facilities are operating normally.
Franklin is producing tropical storm-strength winds fanning out in a radius of 140 miles (225 km), which would put top beach resort Cancun in the path of the dangerous gusts.
A hurricane watch has been issued from Puerto de Veracruz north to Rio Panuco.
The NHC estimates that rainfall caused by Franklin along a large swatch of the Yucatan Peninsula and Belize will average between 3 to 6 inches (8-15 cm), with as much as 12 inches (30 cm) possible in some areas.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell as much as 2 percent on Monday on selling triggered by a rebound in production from Libya's largest oil field, along with worries about higher output from OPEC and the United States.
Output at Libya's Sharara field was returning to normal after a brief disruption by armed protesters in the coastal city of Zawiya, the National Oil Corporation (NOC) said. The field has boosted Libya's oil production, which climbed to more than 1 million bpd in late June.
Global benchmark Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were down 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $52.16 a barrel at 2:05 p.m. EDT (1805 GMT) after trading as low as $51.37 a barrel 
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) were down 34 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $49.24 per barrel, after seeing a low of $48.54 a barrel.
Both contracts stood below levels hit last week, which marked their highest since late May. 
Doubts have emerged about the effectiveness of output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other big producers including Russia. OPEC output hit a 2017 high in July and its exports hit a record. 
""The petroleum markets are tipping toward the lower end of their recent trading range as oil producers meeting in Abu Dhabi have been slow to assure the market that compliance with this year’s production cuts will be improved, although we continue to note that adherence to the limits has actually been quite strong by historical standards,"" Tim Evans, Citi Futures' energy futures specialist, said in a note. 
""The recent increase in OPEC production has mostly been a function of recovering volumes from Libya and Nigeria."" 
Officials from a joint OPEC and non-OPEC technical committee are meeting in Abu Dhabi on Monday and Tuesday to discuss ways to boost compliance with the deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in production. 
Oil output in the United States remained high even though Baker Hughes data on Friday showed a cut of one drilling rig in the week to Aug. 4, bringing the U.S. rig count down to 765.  
U.S. weekly oil production hit 9.43 million bpd in the week to July 28, the highest since August 2015 and up 12 percent from its most recent low in June last year.  Morgan Stanley said in a note on Monday it expects to see U.S. oil production growing by 900,000 bpd in the fourth quarter versus a year earlier, up from a forecast of 860,000 bpd earlier.
Some analysts expected OPEC could talk up prices. 
""Saudi Arabia will restate that they will export only 6.6 million bpd (six-year low) in August and inventories will continue to draw down,"" SEB Markets chief commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop said. 
On the global demand side, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said data available so far for June points to continued strong growth.

""We believe that the biggest driver for this robust demand is strong economic growth in recent months,"" Goldman said in a note.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery fell 19 cents to settle at $48.39 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent lost $0.11 to trade at $52.31 a barrel.
Fresh from posting a weekly loss, crude futures showed little sign of a rebound, as data showed U.S. production rose to a two-year high while a rebound in Libyan oil output also added to oversupply concerns. 
U.S. weekly oil production hit 9.43 million bpd in the week to July 28, the highest since August 2015 and up 12 percent from its most recent low in June last year.
In Libya, Output at the Sharara field, the country’s largest oil field, was returning to normal after a brief disruption by armed protesters in the coastal city of Zawiya, the National Oil Corporation (NOC) said. 
The downbeat data comes amid a two-day meeting of Opec and non-Opec members in Abu Dhabi on Monday, as they seek to reaffirm their commitment to increase compliance with the deal to curb production.
Opec output hit a 2017 high of 33 million bpd in July, up 90,000 bpd from the previous month, a Reuters survey showed last week. 
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year.
Some analysts believe oil prices will continue to ebb and flow, as investors await the outcome of the compliance meeting. 
“Spot prices, we feel, are going to be rather choppy as we await the decision from the OPEC compliance meeting,” said Tariq Zahir, a managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors."

Gold futures for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $0.80, or 0.06%, to $1,265.40 a troy ounce.
Gold continued to pare losses, following a slump on Friday on the back of strong nonfarm payrolls data suggesting the U.S. economy could sustain further rate hikes while St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said that low interest rates are “likely to remain appropriate” over the near term.
""The current level of the policy rate is likely to remain appropriate over the near term,"" Bullard said in slides prepared ahead of a speech to the America's Cotton Marketing Cooperatives 2017 Conference in Nashville, Tennessee.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Inflation data later in the week, however, are expected to provide the yellow metal with fresh direction, as market participants are keen to establish whether the slowdown in inflation has continued unabated.
The slowdown in inflation, has weighed on the prospect of rate hikes later this year, pressuring both the dollar and bond yields while helping the yellow metal trade close to seven-week highs.
The producer price index and the consumer price index data are slated for Thursday and Friday respectively.
A slump in trading volumes due to the holidays (in Asia), however, is expected to keep gold prices range bound.
""We think gold is going to trade in a very tight range because of the low level of liquidity in the market due to the holidays (in Asia),"" said Richard Xu, a fund manager at China's biggest gold exchange-traded fund HuaAn Gold.

Prices saw a weekly drop of nearly 5.7%, last week, its third such loss in a row, amid bearish weather forecasts that should limit demand for the fuel.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer cooling demand.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for cooling.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.010 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 8.5% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 2.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Early market expectations for this week's storage data due on Thursday is for a build in a range between 32 and 42 billion cubic feet in the week ended August 4.
That compares with a gain of 20 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 29 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 54 billion cubic feet.

676,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2017 03:40AM ET</span>","Japan, Russia need to enhance trust before gas pipeline plans: minister","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan and Russia need to work on building a more trusting relationship before any plans to build a natural gas pipeline between the two nations can be fulfilled, Japan's Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry Hiroshige Seko said on Monday.
Building a pipeline linking Russia and Japan is a long-standing idea, but a dispute over islands seized by Russia near the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido at the end of the World War Two has kept relations testy at times.
Japanese gas and electric utilities that have invested heavily in import terminals for liquefied natural gas (LNG) may also be reluctant to invest in a pipeline.
""Without a sense of further sense of trust such as a peace treaty, a pipeline would be no good,"" Seko said during a speech in Tokyo while answering a question about Japan's energy relationship with Russia.
Japan imports nearly all of its energy sources and is the world's biggest buyer of LNG, which is natural gas cooled until it becomes a liquid and then transported on ships.
Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in April that Japan wants to resolve a territorial row that has over-shadowed ties with Russia since World War Two.
Russia and Japan did not sign a formal peace treaty at the end of the war because of a dispute over the northern islands, called the Northern Territories in Japan and the Southern Kuriles in Russia.
The islands were seized by Soviet forces at the end of the war and 17,000 Japanese residents were forced to flee.
Despite the lingering dispute, Seko said that Japan imports around 10 percent of its LNG from Russia and the country could increase its reliance on Russia's LNG a little bit more.

679,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>",Higher-cost crude could squeeze margins at U.S. refiners,"By Erwin Seba
HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. refiners could face a continued squeeze on profit margins in the months ahead as dwindling supplies of heavy crude from Venezuela and elsewhere are leading several to switch to higher-priced but easier-to-refine light, sweet crude. 
The shift also could mean higher prices for consumers in the last weeks of the summer driving season and into the fall if refiners are able to pass along those higher costs to drivers, analysts said.
PBF Energy Inc ,  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO), Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) said in earning calls over the past two weeks they are running more light crude as a result of narrower discounts for heavy crude. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp also is running a heavier slate of light crude at a Gulf Coast plant. 
Refiners' ""margins have already been heavily impacted,"" said John Auers, executive vice president at refining consultancy Turner, Mason & Co. ""They will be impacted in the third quarter"" as well, Auers said. The final period's outlook could depend on whether the U.S. applies sanctions on Venezuelan imports, he added. 
In part, the companies are reacting to high costs and anticipating weaker supplies of Venezuelan crude coming to the United States. Heavy crude prices also have been impacted by tax changes in Russia that have raised prices of its heavy crudes and by reduced production from Canada last quarter. 
Through June, U.S. imports of Venezuelan crude declined 7.1 percent compared with the same six month period last year, to 654,078 barrels per day (bpd), according to Reuters data. 
Light, sweet crude costs more than heavier oils, narrowing the discount that U.S. refiners, especially those along the Gulf Coast, have gained by configuring their plants to run heavy, sour crude over the past 20 years.
Marathon's second-quarter income from its refining and marketing operations fell in part due to ""unfavorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs, primarily due to lower sweet/sour crude oil price differentials,"" the company said on Thursday.
PBF also said narrower heavy crude discounts contributed to its second quarter loss of $1.01 a share, compared to Wall Street expectations of a 2-cent a share gain.
Exxon is studying adding a light crude-processing unit at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery early in the next decade, spokeswoman Charlotte Huffaker said this week. It would be the second light-crude processing unit at the plant. 
""These investments reflect the increased availability of abundant, affordable supplies of U.S. light crude,"" Huffaker said in an email.
Valero and Phillips beat analysts' estimates, Valero by 13 cents at $1.23 a share and Phillips by 5 cents at $1.06 a share.
Other factors could balance the higher crude cost in the coming months, such as strong global demand for U.S. refined products, said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.
""Prices are going up because we're seeing the impact of the cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC countries,"" Lipow said. 
Neil Earnest, president of Dallas energy consultancy Muse, Stancil & Co, said changes in the price of crude could also affects refiners' margins ahead. 

""They don't move in lockstep,"" Earnest said. ""It may, however, impact a refiner who has customized a process to run heavy crude. That refiner may see narrower margins.""

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery rose 55 cents to settle at $49.58 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added $0.36 to trade at $52.35 a barrel.
Crude oil prices settled lower for the week amid renewed concerns over Opec’s compliance with the deal to curb production, after a survey, earlier this week, showed Opec supplies rose to their highest level of the year so far. That despite the current pact to reduce output by 1.2m barrels per day (bdp).
Opec output hit a 2017 high of 33 million bpd in July, up 90,000 bpd from the previous month, a Reuters survey showed earlier this week, despite the group’s pledge to curb production.
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year.
Concerns over growing Opec production come ahead of a highly anticipating meeting between Opec members on Aug 7-8, as the group seeks to reaffirm its committee to increase compliance with the deal to curb production.
Market participants, however, downplayed the importance of the meeting next week, suggesting oil prices may struggle to sustained upward momentum.
“I think we [oil prices] are going to be relatively range-bound unless we see some kind of weather or political event,” Tariq Zahir, managing member at commodity-trading adviser Tyche Capital Advisors said Thursday.
Meanwhile in the U.S. investors cheered bullish data showing the weekly count of oil rigs operating in the United States ticked down by one rig to a total of 765, oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported Friday.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand."

686,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2017 07:40AM ET</span>",Oil bulls aren't out of the woods yet,"By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil investors seem to buy the idea that recovery is finally underway after three years of gluts, but a price boom seems unlikely as the options market shows that at least until OPEC's supply deal expires, producers will pounce on any rallies. 
The oil price (LCOc1) has gained about 20 percent in the last two months to above $52 a barrel, doggedly posting higher highs and higher lows, which would suggest this rally is more robust than the recoveries seen in March and May this year.
""It has been a good rally since June but now crude oil has to prove that it can break its downtrend channel,"" Petromatrix analyst Olivier Jakob said. 
Investors have been rattled by nagging doubt about the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners to stick with a pledge to restrict output by 1.8 million barrels per day until March, especially given resurgent output from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt.
A 10 percent rise in U.S. production this year and the painfully slow decline in global oil inventories, which OPEC says must return to their longer-term average before the output restriction can disappear, has fed trader and investor scepticism.
Since OPEC and its 11 partners, including Russia, began curtailing production in January, oil inventories across the world's most developed nations have risen by around 40 million barrels and are still some 200 million barrels above their five-year average, OPEC's target.
However, year-on-year, inventories have fallen for two months in a row, marking the first annual declines in stocks in over three years, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The premium of oil for delivery in December this year compared with December next year has fallen to just 62 cents, from nearly $2.50 at the start of July. 
The so-called ""Dec/Dec"" spread traded at an average premium of nearly $4.00 a barrel from late 2014 to early this year, when that structure turned negative after OPEC and its partners in late 2016 reached their historic decision to cut supply.
But a seemingly relentless rise in global inventories and disenchantment with OPEC's ability to rein in exports as well as output drove the Dec/Dec spread to its widest in nine months by June.
PLENTY OF ""VROOM"" FOR IMPROVEMENT 
The second half of the year typically marks a season of strong demand for refined products as drivers take to the roads. 
U.S. fuel inventories, the most visible, have fallen by around 10 percent since hitting record peaks earlier this year, but this trend will have to continue to persuade longer-term investors, and OPEC itself, that the long-awaited stock draw is truly underway. 
In the last month, funds have cut their combined bearish holdings of Brent and West Texas Intermediate futures and options by more than 40 percent to their lowest in three months. 
""U.S. crude oil inventories have started to seasonally decline, but I think funds are probably going to wait and see where we stand at the end of the summer before going long again,""  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) head of commodity strategy Harry Tchilinguirian said.
""Interestingly enough, OPEC too will be waiting for the end of the summer to evaluate the impact of its supply cuts and judge what to do for the balance of the period of output restraint that runs to March next year.""
There are a few warning signals still keeping investors cautious over the resilience of this summer's rally.
One tell-tale sign of producers locking in their future oil sales, which can dampen price rallies, is an increase in implied volatility on sell, or put, options relative to that for buy, or call options. 
Implied volatility is one way of measuring how popular an option is at any given time.
The difference in implied volatility for put options with strike prices that are close to the current underlying Brent futures price expiring in six months' time over that for calls has reached its largest in two months. 
It hit a one-year low shortly after OPEC and its partners agreed in May to extend their supply deal to March 2018.
""Front-month crude oil prices are currently trending higher, buoyed by robust seasonal product demand, and tentative evidence that OECD stocks may be drawing closer to their five-year average. On the back of this trend ... longer-dated options continue to meet sustained producer hedging,""  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) said in a note.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) equity analysts, who expect the global oil market to show a surplus next year when new projects come on stream, said recent stock draws were a good start.

""But we believe additional datapoints – particularly from OECD inventories – are needed, and we are not out of the woods yet.""

U.S. crude futures for September delivery were down 0.98% at $48.55 a barrel, the lowest since August 1.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the October Brent declined 0.96% to $51.51 a barrel.
Oil prices dropped following a report saying that crude exports by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries rose to a record high in July, most of which coming from Nigeria, which posted a rise of 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) in shipments.
In addition, U.S., oil production has hit 9.43 million bpd, the highest since August 2015.
The commodity had strengthened earlier in the week, after investors viewed weekly U.S. inventory data on crude and refined products as bullish.
The Energy Information Administration reported a 1.5 million barrel drop in U.S. crude supplies last week, below analysts’ expectations.
However, gasoline inventories fell by a more-than-expected 2.5 million barrels while demand hit a record above 9.8 million barrels a day, the EIA said.
Oil traders are looking ahead to a technical meeting of some OPEC and non-OPEC producers in Abu Dhabi next week to assess how the group can increase compliance with production cuts that began at the start of this year.
So far, the output deal has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, as well as a relentless increase in U.S. shale output.

688,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2017 06:38AM ET</span>",Global refiners brace themselves as China cements its oil market dominance,"By Jessica Jaganathan and Tom Daly
SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - China is on pace to overtake the United States as the world's biggest oil importer this year, cementing its status as Asia's most pivotal oil market actor that will increasingly dominate the region's fuel trade.
For the first time, China imported more crude oil in the first half of the year than the U.S., government statistics showed. China averaged 8.55 million barrels per day (bpd) versus 8.12 million bpd in the U.S., a trend that is expected to last.
The shift highlights the change in the center of gravity in global oil markets from West to East. Chinese state-run oil trader Unipec is now the world's biggest physical oil trader. By drawing more of the world's oil to its shores, China, the second-biggest oil consumer after the U.S., will play a crucial role in setting the global price of the commodity, especially as the crude futures market in Shanghai develops.
China's import surge is being driven by the expansion of its refinery capacity. But, as the domestic demand has not materialized to soak up the fuel supply, China's exports of gasoline and diesel have climbed to record highs. This flood of products has caused headaches for competitors across Asia and depressed diesel profit margins to multi-year lows in 2016.
""China is putting a lot of pressure on the traditional export hubs of Taiwan, Korea and Singapore to capture the market share within Southeast Asia and Australia,"" said Joe Willis, senior research analyst, Asia refining, at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
The trend of more refining capacity and higher exports is set to continue. 
China plans to add at least 2.5 million bpd of refining capacity by 2020, according to a recent presentation from China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, or Sinopec. Sinopec is Asia's biggest oil refiner and the parent of Unipec.
This year, PetroChina Ltd will start a 260,000 bpd refinery in Yunnan in southern China while China National Offshore Oil Corp will start up a 200,000 bpd expansion at its existing Huizhou plant in Guangdong province. The start ups will add 350,000 bpd of new Chinese capacity in 2017 though both plants will not reach full capacity until 2018.
Exports of gasoline from China are expected to increase by at least 10,000 barrels per day this year from 2016, driving overseas gasoline sales to between 235,000 bpd and 240,000 bpd this year and about 330,000 bpd in 2018, estimates from consultants FGE and Wood Mackenzie showed.
Unipec is leading the way in targeting new overseas markets, moving jet fuel from Singapore to northwest Europe in June for the first time in several years. Meanwhile, Chinese diesel shipments in 2017 have more than doubled to France, more than quadrupled to Italy and the country shipped diesel to Kenya for the first time this year.
HIGH QUALITY FUEL
Export-oriented refiners in Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan will be most affected by the Chinese competition. 
""We're trying to diversify and find new markets by increasing the number of our customers in existing countries,"" a South Korean refining source said, declining to be named as he was not authorized to speak with the media. 
""It's affecting Korean refiners as we are having one more player in the market.""
Japanese and Indian refiners will be less affected. 
China and India have eclipsed Japan as Asia's biggest oil consumer. Japanese refiners are consolidating capacity because of a falling population and the increasing use of alternative fuels in the power and transportation sector has cut oil consumption.
Meanwhile, Indian refiners are focusing on meeting soaring domestic demand.
China's new modern refineries are competing with the region's exporters in producing fuels for countries with stringent fuel standards such as Australia. Diesel exports to Australia climbed seven-fold to 850,000 tonnes in 2016 and are on pace to nearly match that level this year.
A slowdown in Chinese domestic fuel demand as people use more electric vehicles or co-share bicycles and scooters has pushed refiners to export more gasoline. 
China's gasoline demand is expected to slow to 3.5 to 4 percent in 2017 compared with last year's 6.5 percent growth, said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of East of Suez oil at FGE. 
Sales growth for automobiles, mainly powered by gasoline, has slowed to 0.7 percent in the first half of 2017, compared with 8.7 percent a year ago, while those powered by alternative fuels grew 52.9 percent, BMI Research said.

Investors were now looking ahead to the nonfarm payrolls report for July, due later Friday, to gauge whether the U.S. economy is strong enough for the Fed to stick to its planned tightening path.
The greenback has been under pressure recently amid worries over political turmoil in Washington and recent lackluster economic reports, which have raised doubts over whether the Federal Reserve will raise rates again this year.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.11% at 92.60, just off Wednesday’s 15-month low of 92.39.

British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said ""we expect a downward (price) correction during this quarter,"" but see Brent at an average of $54 per barrel during the fourth quarter. 
Crude oil exports by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose to a record high in July, driven largely by soaring exports from the group's African members, according to a report by Thomson Reuters Oil Research this week. 
July's 26.11 million barrels per day (bpd) in exports marked a rise of 370,000 bpd, most of which came from Nigeria, which posted a rise of 260,000 bpd in shipments. 
In the United States, oil production has hit 9.43 million bpd, the highest since August 2015 and up 12 percent from its most recent low in June last year.
""Quarterly reporting season has seen a swathe of (U.S.) shale producers announce aggressive production targets, despite weak prices as they cut costs and become more efficient,"" ANZ bank said on Friday.
Strong demand is still preventing prices from falling.

691,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 04, 2017 01:21AM ET</span>",Russian ban on Turkish tomatoes bears domestic fruit,"By Polina Devitt
MOSCOW (Reuters) - A ban on Turkish tomato imports that was motivated by geopolitics has inspired Russia to become self-sufficient in tomato production, a windfall for companies who invested in the technology that would increase year-round production.
Russia has been ramping up production of meats, cheese and vegetables since it banned most Western food imports in 2014 as a retaliatory measure for sanctions meant to punish Russia's support of rebels in eastern Ukraine and annexation of Crimea. 
After Turkey shot down a Russian jet near the Syrian border in November 2015, Moscow expanded the ban to include Turkish tomatoes, for which Russia was the biggest export market. 
Ties between Ankara and Moscow have since largely normalized but the ban remains in place and may not be lifted for another three to five years, officials have said.
That may be too late for Turkish exporters if Russian efforts to ramp up domestic production bear fruit.
Greenhouse projects being built with state support are key to Russia's plans to become self-sufficient for its 144 million population by 2020, industry players, analysts and officials say.
Although Russia only imports about 500,000 tonnes of the 3.4 million tonnes of tomatoes consumed annually, the country's notoriously harsh winters have limited its ability to ramp up to full capacity, IKAR agriculture consultancy said.
Currently only 620,000 tonnes of production comes from ""protected ground"", or greenhouses, IKAR said. The remainder comes from ""open ground"" productive only from June to September, and most of that comes from private plots maintained and used by individual families or sold at local farmers' markets.
Sergey Korolyov, the head of National Fruit and Vegetable Producers' Union, estimated that greenhouse projects that have already started growing tomatoes could start seeing their money back in 8-9 years thanks to state support, which includes partial investment compensation and favorable loan rates.
""Now greenhouses which were originally built for cucumbers are being repurposed for tomatoes,"" Korolyov told Reuters. 
MEGA-GREENHOUSES
Although the greenhouse sector is dominated by dozens of small-size firms, several big players have also stepped in.
Russian conglomerate Sistema, bought the country's largest Yuzhnyi greenhouse complex in December 2015, when the ban on Turkish supplies was announced. 
The 144-hectare complex produces more than 45,000 tonnes of tomatoes and cucumbers per year.
""We were slightly lucky in this case - we bought the asset which was already working with good quality, customers and employees,"" said Sistema's senior vice president Ali Uzdenov.
The decline of the rouble currency against the dollar since mid-2014 has helped by making tomato imports less competitive, he said.
Other large vegetable producers include Russia's second biggest food retailer Magnit, with a 84-hectare complex.
Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, who is in charge of the agriculture sector, said the government is fully behind the effort.
""We need to achieve a certain share of independence from import supplies to stabilize the domestic market. And we will be supporting these projects,"" Dvorkovich told Reuters in June. 
But with so much of tomato production taking place in people's private plots, imports will continue to be important in the near-term, he added.
The plan does not bode well for Turkey. As much as 70 percent of the country's tomato exports went to Russia in 2015, earning Turkish growers $259 million, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute.
When the ban was put in place, most of the slack was taken up by Morocco, Azerbaijan and Belarus. 
Ankara proposed in May that Moscow lift the ban outside of the main harvest season.

Asked about Turkey's proposal, Dvorkovich said it might work, but only for local production of tomato paste or juices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lumber mill owners said on Thursday they were ""in no hurry"" to reach a softwood lumber deal with Canada that fails to limit Canadian producers' share of the U.S. market to a strict percentage.
The owners of four lumber mills told Reuters that talks to end a decades-old dispute with Canada should stay on a separate track from negotiations to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement that are due to start on Aug. 16.
""We're in no hurry to settle for a bad agreement,"" said Steven Swanson, president of Swanson Group Inc in Glendale, Oregon. ""We're not willing to sacrifice and settle for a bad agreement just to avoid a fight in NAFTA.""
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said he wants to complete a softwood lumber agreement before NAFTA talks to avoid complications. Swanson, however, said he was not optimistic that a deal could come together in the next two weeks.
The U.S. mill owners, who were in Washington to meet with their trade group and promote their negotiating position, said they wanted a deal with a ""clean quota"" that had strict market share limits for Canada, but they declined to specify the percentages they would support.
Canada's ambassador to the United States, David MacNaughton, was quoted on Wednesday by the Canadian Press as saying that the United States and Canada were close to agreeing on a split that would give roughly 70 percent of the market to U.S. producers and 30 percent to Canadian producers.
Jason Brochu, co-president of Pleasant River Lumber Co in Dover-Foxcroft, Maine, said he had no knowledge of such a split. 
""A clean quota is a percentage of the market, a percentage of the consumption. As the market grows, there's more volume that's able to come in. As the market shrinks there's less volume that's able to come in.""
U.S. producers have long charged that Canada unfairly subsidizes its lumber producers through low fees for timber cut on public land. U.S. producers get most of their timber from private land, where costs are higher.
They were only starting to recover from the 2007-2009 U.S. housing collapse and financial crisis when the last lumber agreement expired in 2015 and Canada's share of the market rose, prompting them to file anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Canadian producers.
The U.S. Commerce Department this year agreed with them and imposed combined duties of 17 to 31 percent.
While that could buy them some leverage to wait longer for a deal, Canadian lumber is continuing to flow into the United States, due to strong demand for U.S. home building. 

""They're paying the duties,"" said Chuck Roady, vice president and general manager of F.H. Stoltze Land and Lumber Co. in Columbia Falls, Montana.

U.S. shale oil producers expect to pump at least 160,000 more barrels per day this year than previously announced, according to a Reuters review of second-quarter regulatory filings.
In general, the industry has slowed rig expansion plans first put in place earlier this year. U.S. oil and gas companies added 10 drilling rigs in July, the fewest in any month since May 2016. Cuts in planned spending come as crude prices have lost more than 7 percent this year to $49.03. [O/R]
""We essentially can do more with less,"" said Lee Tillman, chief executive of  Marathon Oil  Corp (N:MRO), which on Wednesday shaved its 2017 spending plan by between $200 million and $300 million after posting a quarterly loss. Still, Marathon boosted its production forecast by about 7 percent for the year.
Marathon's stock gained 3.9 percent to $12.51 on Thursday after the announcement. 
Wall Street has been pushing shale producers to cut spending in the face of stubbornly high global oil inventories that have depressed pricing and thrown off efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to balance supply and demand. 
Shares of  Noble Energy  Inc (N:NBL),  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co (N:PXD),  Concho Resources Inc  (N:CXO) and  Apache Corp  (N:APA) - none of which cut their budgets - dropped on Thursday. 
""I think OPEC had more success in stabilizing prices than people thought at the end of last year,"" said Keith Phillips, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. ""They have done pretty well in holding back production, but that means production in the U.S. can now be pretty significant in terms of how it affects oil prices.""
Concho, one of the most-profitable Permian producers, said it would boost output by 25 percent this year over last year's levels, a strategy its executives defended.
""We're well-positioned for the volatility and we'll continue to build value in all points of the cycle,"" said CEO Tim Leach. Concho shares dropped nearly 9 percent on Thursday.
Pioneer dropped more than 7 percent on Thursday after disclosing higher costs and lower-than-expected oil production in some new wells in the Permian, the largest U.S. oilfield. 
As oil wells age, they tend to produce more natural gas, but Pioneer said it has been finding a larger amount of gas than expected.
Pioneer executives sought to play down the unexpected development, with Tim Dove, the company's CEO, calling it a ""settled issue"" and promising to meet future oil production goals. 
But Wall Street analysts peppered other companies on conference calls on Thursday with queries about rising gas production from Permian oil wells. It was an ironic twist, as shares of companies operating in the Permian have been Wall Street darlings for months.
Those worries helped drag down shares of other Permian producers.  WPX Energy Inc  (N:WPX) lost 8.7 percent;  Parsley Energy  (N:PE) slid 7.6 percent; and Noble Energy lost 7.7 percent. 

""Investors are really thinking right now about capital discipline and they're thinking about your highest quality companies as the place to invest,"" Ken Fisher, Noble Energy's finance chief, said in an interview.

696,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2017 04:40PM ET</span>","U.S. to reject biofuel program tweaks in blow to refiners, Icahn: sources","By David Shepardson and Jarrett Renshaw
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Environmental Protection Agency will reject a proposed overhaul of the U.S. biofuels program that would have shifted blending responsibility away from refining companies further down the fuel supply chain, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. 
The decision is a blow to independent oil refiners like  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) and CVR Energy that have said the requirement costs them hundreds of millions of dollars every year, as well as to billionaire investor Carl Icahn who holds a majority stake in CVR and vocally supported the change.
Online news site Politico was first to report the EPA's decision, citing an unnamed senior administration official.
One of sources who spoke to Reuters said agency will likely announce the move next week.
An EPA official declined to comment. Efforts to reach Icahn were not successful. 
None of the sources were able to give a reason behind EPA's decision. But ethanol producers had lobbied for years against the proposed change, saying it would undermine biofuels policy by making it too complicated.
The sources declined to speak for attribution because they were not authorized to speak publicly. 
The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, adopted in 2005, requires increasing volumes of biofuels like ethanol in the nation's gasoline supply to boost U.S. agriculture, reduce pollution, and cut reliance on imports.
Independent refiners had petitioned the EPA repeatedly during the administration of former President Barack Obama to change the law's requirement that refiners blend the fuels, saying they do not have the facilities needed to do so.
Refiners unable to blend are required to purchase blending credits, called RINs, from others who can. The requirement cost Valero, America's top refiner, some $750 million in 2016, the company has said.
Icahn threw his weight behind the proposed change this winter, submitting a plan to the White House on the topic. This raised the hackles of Democratic lawmakers who said the move was a conflict of interest because of his refinery stake.
His company, CVR Energy, deferred most of its 2016 RIN obligation into this year, betting prices would fall. Prices fell in the first quarter as Icahn, then an adviser to Trump, was working to change the point of obligation or where the responsibility lies for blending. 
RIN prices were stable on Thursday.
""I think refiners knew this was coming,"" one broker said.
Shares of CVR were down 0.4 percent at $19.02 on Thursday afternoon. Valero shares were down 0.2 percent at $68.38.
Biofuels maker POET LLC applauded the move.

""Changes to the point of obligation would create market confusion, raise fuel prices and remove incentives for offering cleaner-burning biofuel blends to consumers across the country,"" said spokesman Rob Walther.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery fell 1.1% to settle at $49.03 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent lost 0.63% to trade at $52.03 a barrel.
Investor sentiment on oil soured as concerns over an uptick in Opec supplies offset bullish data showing U.S. gasoline demand hit a record high while crude stockpiles dropped for the fifth straight week.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 1.5m barrels in the week ended July 28, below expectations  of a draw of about only 2.9m barrels, the Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday.
Opec output hit a 2017 high of 33 million bpd in July, up 90,000 bpd from the previous month, a Reuters survey showed earlier this week, despite the group’s pledge to curb production.
Concerns over growing Opec production come ahead of a highly anticipating meeting among Opec members next week, as the group seeks to reaffirm its commitment to increase compliance with the deal to curb production.
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year.
Market participants, however, downplayed the importance of the meeting next week, suggesting oil prices may struggle to sustained upward momentum.
“I think we [oil prices] are going to be relatively range-bound unless we see some kind of weather or political event,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member at commodity-trading adviser Tyche Capital Advisors."

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $4.38, or 0.35%, to $1,267.41 a troy ounce.
Gold struggled to for direction in early morning U.S. trade, as investors remained cautious of initiating large positions in the yellow-metal ahead of nonfarm payroll data on Friday, expected to provide further clues on the outlook for interest rate increases.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Gold has edged higher in recent weeks, as investor uncertainty concerning the pace of U.S. interest rate increases continued amid a raft of mixed economic data fuelling expectations that the Federal Reserve could backtrack on its plan to raise rates later this year.
The U.S. labor market continued to show signs of tightening, after initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 240,000 for the week ended July 29, the Labor Department said on Thursday.

699,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2017 12:29PM ET</span>",Russian gas pipelines to go ahead despite U.S. sanctions,"By Oksana Kobzeva and Alissa de Carbonnel
MOSCOW/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - New U.S. sanctions will make it harder for Russia to build two gas export pipelines to Europe but the projects are unlikely to be stopped. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has reluctantly signed into law further sanctions on Russia but some of the measures are discretionary and most White House watchers believe he will not take action against Russia's energy infrastructure. 
This would allow Gazprom's two big pipeline projects to go ahead, although at a higher price and with some delays.
The Kremlin, dependent on oil and gas revenues, sees the pipelines to Germany and Turkey - Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream - as crucial to increasing its market share in Europe. 
It also fears that Western partners - needed to develop the deepwater, shale and Arctic gas deposits that will fill the pipelines - will be scared off by sanctions. 
Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) warned investors last month that the sanctions ""may result in delays, or otherwise impair or prevent the completion of the projects by the group.""
With all that in mind, the Russian gas giant is taking steps to reduce the impact of sanctions.
It has accelerated pipe-laying by Swiss contractor Allseas Group under the Black Sea for TurkStream - even though there is no final agreement on where the pipeline will make landfall in Turkey. It is also hurriedly building a second TurkStream line to export gas to Europe.
""The construction of the second line is underway just in case the sanctions hit,"" a senior Gazprom source told Reuters.
A spokesman for Allseas said 100 km of the 900-km first line have been built since June 23 and preparatory work is underway for the second line.
THE UKRAINIAN CONNECTION
The biggest cost of any delays to the new lines could come from increased transit fees paid to Ukraine, the route by which Russian gas has traditionally reached Europe.
Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream bypass Ukraine, but if they are brought into use late, Gazprom will have to continue using the Ukrainian route and may have to pay more for the privilege.
The European Union, fearing sanctions will hurt oil and gas projects on which it depends, said it was ready to retaliate unless it obtained U.S. guarantees that European firms would not be targeted. 
Five Western firms that have invested in Nord Stream 2 - Wintershall (DE:BASFn) and Uniper (DE:UN01) of Germany, Austria's OMV (VI:OMVV), Anglo-Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), and France's Engie (PA:ENGIE) - say it is too early to judge the impact of sanctions.
For now, they are standing by their pledge of up to 950 million euros ($1.13 billion) each to finance the 1,225 km (760 mile) Nord Stream 2.
Despite Trump's desire to promote U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to Europe that would compete with the Russian gas, he said he did not want the sanctions to get in the way of efforts to resolve the conflict in Ukraine.
EU officials, industry sources and experts therefore doubt that Trump will use what he regards as ""significantly flawed"" sanctions to punish Moscow.
""Their approach is going to be strictly by the letter of the law: what do they have to do,"" Richard Nephew, a former U.S. deputy chief of sanctions now with Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.
RISK PREMIUM
The sanctions law is however expected to hamper Gazprom's efforts to raise money.
""The price of any project automatically increases,"" said Tatiana Mitrova, director of the Skolkovo Energy Center.
""Gazprom's relationships with partners, subcontractors, and equipment and service providers are severely complicated,"" she said. ""They will all ask for a risk premium."" 
Gazprom will have to take on the additional cost itself, depend on Russian state banks, or seek money at higher rates from Asian lenders, financial analysts said.
""This, however, does not mean that Nord Stream 2 won't be built,"" said Katja Yafimava of the Oxford Energy Institute.
Industry sources say the loans from Western partners for Nord Stream 2 are already at above market rates to reflect the political risk of partnering with Russia in a project that has also faced opposition in Europe. 
The added uncertainty ups the stakes further. ""It's like reading tea leaves,"" one source with knowledge of the European side of the Nord Stream 2 financing structure told Reuters.
While big players may be able to stomach the risk, analysts say the smaller contractors on which Gazprom depends to build the pipelines may get spooked. ""Not all partners can afford to see things through with Gazprom,"" said Valery Nesterov, an analyst at Moscow-based Sberbank CIB.
A spokesman for Nord Stream 2 said more than 200 non-Russian companies from 17 countries, most of them European, are building the pipeline. Most of the big contracts for steel, port logistics and construction have already been concluded.
By forcing the pace of construction, Gazprom may have gained enough time to build the new pipelines but longer-term projects will take a hit.
""Unless Trump takes a really sharp turn, it is highly unlikely that companies that are supplying pipeline goods are going to be punished in the next year or so,"" Nephew said. ""A lot of companies are now thinking: 'I've got maybe 12, maybe 18 months in which I can do some stuff but after that maybe I won't'.""

700,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2017 12:17PM ET</span>",OPEC supply-cut compliance runs up against ire over country targets,"By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC has delivered record-high adherence to its oil output-cutting pact so far in 2017, but with laggards Iraq and the UAE yet to show how they can meet their prescribed targets, sources say a refocusing on exports may be the key to further progress.
The two major producers have shown relatively low compliance with the agreement based on figures from secondary sources - government agencies, consultants and industry media - that OPEC uses to monitor its output.
Both countries stress their commitment to the deal, aimed at draining global oil inventories and lifting crude prices out of a three-year slump. 
But they complain that the secondary sources' assessment of their production before the pact took effect in January was too low. 
As a result, in their opinion, the two countries have the unpalatable task of making an even bigger cut to comply fully.
""Iraq has high conformity, but secondary sources' figures are still our problem,"" said an industry source familiar with Iraqi thinking.
The United Arab Emirates' Ministry of Energy said in a statement: ""The UAE is committed to cut its oil production by 139,000 barrels of oil per day, and we have and will continue to meet this commitment.""
Iraq did not comment officially for this story. 
UAE Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui told Reuters in April the country was complying 100 percent with its own figures. Iraq's oil minister, Jabar al-Luaibi, has said the country is adhering fully.
In addition to the countries' issues with their OPEC targets, rising domestic needs and international commitments are obstacles. Iraq was initially against cutting production since it needed cash to fight Islamic State. Both countries have been expanding output capacity in recent years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers pledged last year to cut production by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1 for six months. The pact was prolonged until March 2018 and might be extended further.
Officials from a joint OPEC and non-OPEC technical committee will meet in Abu Dhabi on Aug. 7-8 to discuss ways to boost compliance with their supply reduction agreement.
""There was a call for a meeting, as there is a need to align all countries to achieve 100 percent compliance,"" a source close to OPEC said.
    
EXPORTS 'KEY METRIC'
The Abu Dhabi talks follow a July 24 meeting of an OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial group, known as the JMMC, in Russia. 
According to sources familiar with the matter, the ministers held a conference call with the UAE and Iraq from inside the closed-door meeting to discuss the two countries' compliance.
Both countries confirmed their commitment to the pact but offered no concrete plan on how to meet their production targets, the sources said.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the Joint Technical Committee, which monitors compliance with the cuts, would also study export data.
""Exports have now become the key metric for financial markets, and we need to find a way to reconcile credible export data with production data and our monitoring mechanism,"" Falih said at the JMMC meeting.
Iraqi officials believe that monitoring exports is more important than production because the former have a direct impact on the market.
""Our records show that Iraq's exports are declining and the conformity is increasing over the last six months,"" another industry source said.
Baghdad said its exports fell to 3.230 million bpd in July from 3.273 million bpd in June.
Production data gives a different picture. Iraqi figures submitted to OPEC show June output at 4.55 million bpd, higher than its output target of 4.351 million bpd under the pact. 
    
UAE EXPORT CUTS
The UAE is showing lower compliance than others in the core Gulf OPEC group, because it is using its own, higher, output level as a reference point for its supply cut, rather than the supply baseline used in the agreement.
But the country says it is trimming exports and has been informing customers of monthly allocation cuts throughout 2017 to meet its OPEC commitment. State-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co said it would cut crude allocations by 10 percent for September for the majority of its customers.
Crude allocations in coming months will remain low, according to people familiar with the matter.
Like Iraq, the UAE's own figures suggest it has further to go than other big OPEC producers to comply fully. 

In May, the UAE said it pumped 2.981 million bpd, above its target of 2.874 million bpd under the OPEC pact, while secondary sources estimated its output at 2.899 million bpd.

U.S. natural gas for September delivery was at $2.804 per million British thermal units by 10:40AM ET (1440GMT), down 0.7 cents, or around 0.3%. Futures were at around $2.841 prior to the release of the supply data.
Prices ended marginally lower on Wednesday amid bearish weather forecasts that should limit demand for the fuel.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer cooling demand.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for cooling.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 20 billion cubic feet in the week ended July 28, just below forecasts for a build of 21 billion.
That compared with a gain of 17 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a withdrawal of 6 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 44 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.010 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 8.5% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 2.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.

702,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 03, 2017 09:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Venezuela cuts oil supply to Citgo as Russia's Rosneft gets more,"By Marianna Parraga
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela's state-run PDVSA has reduced crude sales to its U.S. refining unit Citgo Petroleum while increasing supply to Russia's Rosneft (MM:ROSN), following a plan signed in May to catch up on overdue deliveries, according to PDVSA documents, sources from the company and its joint ventures. 
Venezuela's oil output has declined since 2012 with the fall accelerating this year amid a lack of investment and payment delays to suppliers. Almost all of Petróleos de Venezuela's customers are receiving reduced volumes. That includes the United States, which has received less Venezuelan crude oil this year.
PDVSA agreed in the catch-up plan to compensate Rosneft for the delayed cargoes, since the oil is being sent in lieu of payment for loans.
Venezuela's Oil Minister Nelson Martinez at a forum in St Petersburg in June said Rosneft would receive some 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) as payment for a $1.5 billion loan extended to PDVSA in 2016. He did not disclose the reason for the supply agreement.
Days later, Russia publicly released a renegotiation of bilateral loans with Venezuela, an OPEC-member. The Russian Audit Chamber said it would slash projected state revenue by nearly $1 billion this year to reflect expectations that Venezuela may not make timely payments.
Since May, the ""remediation agreement"" with Rosneft has implied an extra supply of between 63,000 bpd and 105,000 bpd of Venezuela's diluted crude oil (DCO), according to a PDVSA document.
""The agreement is linked to the debt refinancing. The idea is to catch up by reducing the number of pending cargoes (to repay debt),"" a PDVSA source said.
Rosneft and Citgo were not immediately available for comment.
Rosneft has loaned between $4 billion and $5 billion to Venezuela in recent years, mostly to be repaid with oil. Terms of most agreements have not been disclosed, but renegotiations have taken place in recent months, including on the possible return of a collateral on a 49.9 percent stake in Citgo offered to Rosneft last year.
COLLATERAL DAMAGE
Because PDVSA will allocate more of its shrunken oil supplies to Rosneft, fewer barrels will be available to ship to other customers.
Citgo's Gulf Coast refineries - in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana - have combined processing capacity of 582,000 bpd. The two typically refine a high percentage of Venezuela's heavy crude. 
Since the remediation plan with Rosneft started, Citgo has been knocking on the doors of PDVSA's joint-venture partners for supplies of upgraded crude, one of the sources said.
Some PDVSA joint ventures in the Orinoco Belt, Venezuela's main producing region, have agreed to allocate as much oil as possible to Citgo after supplying their regular clients, but PDVSA expects total exports of Venezuelan crude to Citgo will remain below 120,000 bpd versus some 230,000 bpd stipulated in the supply contracts, the sources said. 
Recent difficulties in finding Venezuelan crude supplies have increased prices for many heavy grades in the Atlantic Basin, which includes the Gulf Coast.
Citgo last year started sending gasoline and other fuels to Venezuela in exchange for a portion of its crude supply. But Citgo has increased the volume of U.S. oil it refines, and has also has also expanded its crude import sources. 
Its 167,000-bpd Lemont, Illinois, refinery mostly processes Canadian oil, while Corpus Christi and Lake Charles this year have imported crude from Africa, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil and Azerbaijan, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has promised strong economic sanctions against Venezuela's government after a Constituent Assembly was elected last week in what United States called a ""sham"" vote. The new body will have power to rewrite the constitution and abolish the opposition-led Congress.

If those sanctions were to constrain Venezuela's oil shipments to the United States, Citgo could be ahead of its competitors in finding new supply sources.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday, lifted by renewed signs of a gradually tightening U.S. market, although ongoing high supplies from producer club OPEC still weighed.
Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $52.56 per barrel at 0903 GMT, up 20 cents, or 0.4 percent from their last close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $49.79 per barrel, up 20 cents, or 0.4 percent.
Strong demand in the United States was supporting prices, as the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported record gasoline demand of 9.84 million barrels per day (bpd) for last week, and a fall in commercial crude inventories of 1.5 million barrels to 481.9 million barrels,
That's below levels seen this time last year, an indication of a tightening U.S. market.
But traders say high production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is capping prices.
OPEC and other producers including Russia have promised to restrict output by 1.8 million bpd until March 2018 to help support prices and draw down inventories.
Yet OPEC output hit a 2017 high of 33 million bpd in July, up 90,000 bpd from the previous month, a Reuters survey showed earlier this week, led by a further recovery in supply from Libya, one of the countries exempt from a production-cutting deal.
Ample supply is likely to keep a cap on prices for some time to come, analysts say.
""Our view of the oil market is that a major rally is unlikely in 2017,"" National Australia Bank analysts said in a note to clients.
""Absent further production cuts or a sustained uptick in demand, prices are likely to remain in the low to mid $50s for the remainder of the year."" 
There are signs that the oil industry has adapted to an era of low prices and can produce and operate at levels that would previously have been uneconomic. 
""Of the major projects sanctioned by the big five oil companies (ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX),  BP  (LON:BP) and Total) over H1 2017, there has been a clear breakeven target price of $40 per barrel or lower at offshore oil projects,"" BMI Research said.

715,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2017 09:24AM ET</span>",Drifting crop chemical deals ‘double whammy’ to U.S. farmers,"By Rod Nickel
(Reuters) - An advanced weed-killing chemical has twice come back to haunt Arkansas farmer John Weiss.
The herbicide, known as dicamba, has long been employed in the United States to kill weeds before fields were planted, but its use spiked after regulators last year approved a new formulation that allowed farmers to apply it to growing plants. 
That should have been good news for Weiss and hundreds of other farmers, who planned to use it to control hard-to-kill weeds in fields planted with crops bioengineered to survive the chemical.
Instead, farmers reported the agricultural chemical was drifting into neighboring fields and damaging crops unable to resist it. Last month, in response to the reports, Arkansas and Missouri temporarily banned its use.
The fallout from dicamba hit Weiss on two fronts: The drifting chemicals, he said, stunted his unprotected soybean crops and marked the plants with damaged, withered leaves. 
Then came the ban, which meant he could no longer use the chemical on the dicamba-resistant soybeans and cotton it was meant to protect. 
""It's just a double whammy, this whole thing,"" said Weiss.
Crops have suffered damage across much of the farm belt. Governments in 17 states are investigating more than 1,400 complaints of dicamba problems covering 2.5 million acres, Kevin Bradley, a University of Missouri associate professor in the plant sciences division, wrote last week.
The three companies that sell the chemical in the United States for use on growing crops of soybeans and cotton,  Monsanto  Co (N:MON), BASF (DE:BASFn) and DuPont (N:DD), say their products have not always been used according to label instructions.
Some farmers used older dicamba products that were more drift-prone, deployed spraying equipment contaminated with other herbicides, or applied dicamba in the wrong conditions, Monsanto's chief technology officer Robb Fraley said.
The situation is part of an evolving battle between farmers and pests that threaten their crops. For two decades, growers have sown crops genetically modified to resist chemicals such as glyphosate, popularly known as Roundup, allowing them to selectively kill all the weeds in a field.
But the weeds have rallied, developing resistance to many popular chemicals, prompting farmers to try alternatives such as dicamba.
LIMITED OPTIONS
It is unclear what is causing dicamba to drift into other crops, though agronomists say it could be caused by high winds or changes in temperature.
Complaints have been rampant. So far, Arkansas has received 760 reports from farmers of dicamba drift damage - a record for one product - spanning 209,000 acres, according to the state plant board.
The state has taken a tough stance against the chemical, banning its use for 120 days starting July 11. Missouri imposed a one-week ban starting July 8. Tennessee placed tight restrictions on when dicamba can be sprayed.
The Arkansas State Plant Board relies on the ""honor system"" to enforce its ban, said director Terry Walker. Violations are punishable by fines up to $25,000, he said.
The damaged crops and the subsequent bans have created tensions among some farmers. Lee Cole, a farmer in Hayti, Missouri, who said his soybeans looked like they had been burned by ""a blowtorch"" because of dicamba, doubts everyone will comply with the regulations. 
""Even the best farmers, when you're under pressure to get it done, you're going to do whatever you've got to do.""
Farmers who lose bushels because of drift have little recourse, since U.S. crop insurance does not cover losses caused by dicamba, according to U.S. Agriculture Department guidelines.
Some farmers have filed lawsuits against dicamba producers, while others have turned on their neighbors, blaming them for ruined crops. In one case late last year, an Arkansas sheriff said a farmer fatally shot a neighbor over a dispute about crops damaged by dicamba, according to media reports.
Many farmers, such as Brad Doyle, have scrambled to find alternative ways to protect their crops. The Arkansas grower, who planted dicamba-resistant soybeans to re-sell through his seed business, said he chose to spray less-effective fomesafen to avoid dicamba drifting. He has deployed workers to pull weeds by hand.
""Options are running out,"" he said.
Ted Glaub, who manages 30 farms in Arkansas, Missouri and Mississippi, said it would be a costly mistake to write off dicamba. ""We need dicamba. We don't have enough tools,"" he said. 
STRAIGHTENING UP 
Farmers, regulators and the companies selling the pesticide are examining ways to control the drift. BASF, for instance, gave away 600,000 chemical spray nozzles to prevent the wrong ones from being used. 
In Missouri, the department of agriculture consulted Monsanto, BASF and DuPont to develop new requirements for dicamba, including spraying only when wind is light and during certain hours. Penalties range up to $10,000 per violation. 
The chemical companies must inform pesticide sellers and trained applicators of the restrictions, according to Missouri's department of agriculture. A BASF spokeswoman said the changes are being flagged on industry websites and through media coverage, adding the company has spoken with retailers who sell the product.
Monsanto was consulted about Missouri's requirements, but believes its current label directions are sufficient, Fraley said. A DuPont spokeswoman said it followed all special requirements in Missouri.
Some farmers said the efforts - particularly the bans - have revived damaged plants. Tom Burnham, who grows soybeans in both Arkansas and Missouri, is among them.
""Ever since we got the ban in Arkansas, my crop has really progressed, started to straighten up,"" Burnham said.

Burnham added, however, that his Missouri crop shows fresh dicamba damage since the state's ban lifted.

718,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 02, 2017 04:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Venezuelan oil supply to Phillips 66 falls amid quality issues,"By Marianna Parraga and Erwin Seba
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela's supply of heavy crude to U.S. independent refiner Phillips 66 has dropped by more than two-thirds this year in part due to quality problems, and the company has cancelled at least one cargo in recent months, according to sources from state-run oil company PDVSA.
Phillips 66 (N:PSX) has also asked for price discounts for other shipments of Venezuelan crude, according to the sources.
Venezuela's heavy crude supply to Phillips 66's Sweeny refinery in Texas fell to 33,500 barrels per day (bpd) in June from 105,000 bpd in January, according to Thomson Reuters Trade Flows data. The contract between Phillips and Venezuela's PDVSA allows a maximum supply of some 170,000 bpd.
The Merey crude Phillips 66 typically receives from Venezuela has to be processed before shipping to remove its high content of salt and metals. But operational problems at Venezuela's Orinoco Belt have changed the quality of some grades for exports, one of the sources said.
Phillips 66 declined to comment on ""matters that are commercially sensitive.""
The declining quality of Venezuelan crude comes as output has been falling and a growing number of Venezuela's barrels have been used to pay for loans from Russia and China. That has reduced supplies to PDVSA's commercial customers, mainly in the United States, which in May imported 767,000 barrels of crude and fuels from Venezuela daily.
Venezuela is a key source of heavy sour crude supplies for U.S. refiners.
Phillips processed less heavy oil at its nine refineries in the second quarter, the company said in a conference call on Tuesday. Chief Executive Greg Garland cited operational disruptions in Venezuela, along with reduced supply from Middle Eastern producers and problems with Canada's oil sands for the decline.
Venezuela's weak oil exports are one reason why U.S. refiners are shifting away from heavy crude. Some firms are also trying to lessen the potential impact on their businesses in case the United States imposes sanctions affecting supplies from Venezuela following the nation's controversial vote to give more power to unpopular President Nicolas Maduro.
So far, the United States has not targeted Venezuela's energy industry, instead imposing sanctions on Maduro himself and several other officials.

PDVSA's unit in the United States, Citgo Petroleum;  Valero Energy  (N:VLO);  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX); and Phillips 66 were the largest importers of Venezuelan crude in the first half of the year, according to Reuters data.

The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.8 million barrels to 488.8 million last week.
The data undermined optimism that recent reports showing inventory drawdowns were an indication that the U.S. market is tightening.
Official storage figures were due to be published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration later on Wednesday, with a consensus forecast for a drawdown of 2.9 million barrels.
Oil prices were also under pressure amid fresh doubts over how effective production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will be at reducing the global supply glut.
A Reuters survey this week showed OPEC production climbing in July to the highest level since December 2016.
The increase in production is threatening to undermine efforts by leading OPEC member Saudi Arabia, which has announced plans to cap exports and enforce compliance in reducing output.
OPEC, together with several other major oil-producing nations, agreed to cut production late last year and extended the deal through March 2018, but traders have become more doubtful over the effectiveness of the agreement in rebalancing the market.
Meanwhile, U.S. shale production has ramped up since the agreement was reached, offsetting the OPEC cuts.

A weaker dollar makes commodities such as gold that are priced in the greenback cheaper to buyers outside of the United States.
Overnight, gold prices bounced off lows on Tuesday, shrugging off an uptick in the greenback after a raft of economic data pointed to moderate economic growth and inflation, adding to expectations the Federal Reserve may abandon its plan to raise rates again this year.
Gold prices hit seven-week highs, after a trio of mixed economic reports on inflation; personal spending and manufacturing activity, failed to ease concerns about the strength of the U.S. economy.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.1% in June. In the 12 months through June, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5% after advancing by the same margin in May.
Fresh on the heels of the inflation data, was a report indicating a slowdown in consumer spending as personal income failed to increase for the first time in seven months, pointing to a moderate pace of consumption growth in the third quarter.
Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing gauge slowed to 56.3 in July, from a reading of 57.8 the previous month. That compared with economists’ expectations for the manufacturing index to fall to 56.4.
Readings above 50 are meant to signal that output in the industry is rising.
The mixed economic reports failed to ease investor doubts over whether the Federal Reserve will keep to its plan to raise rates at least once more this year.

OSLO (Reuters) - Scientists searching for everything from oil and gas to copper and gold are adopting techniques used by companies such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to sift through vast amounts of data, a study showed on Tuesday.
The method has already helped to discover 10 carbon-bearing minerals and could be widely applied to exploration, they wrote in the journal American Mineralogist. ""Big data points to new minerals, new deposits,"" they wrote of the findings.
The technique goes beyond traditional geology by amassing data about how and where minerals have formed, for instance by the cooling of lava after volcanic eruptions. The data can then be used to help find other deposits.
""Minerals occur on Earth in clusters,"" said Robert Hazen, executive director of the Deep Carbon Observatory at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington and an author of the study.
""When you see minerals together it's very like the way that humans interact in social networks such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB),"" he said.
Hazen said the technique was also like Amazon, which recommends books based on a client's previous orders, or by media streaming company Netflix, which proposes movies based on a customer's past viewing habits.
""They are using vast amounts of data and make correlations that you could never make,"" he told Reuters.
Lead author Shaunna Morrison, also at the Deep Carbon Observatory and the Carnegie Institution, said luck often played a big role for geologists searching for new deposits.
""We are looking at it in a much more systematic way,"" she said of the project. (https://mineralchallenge.net/)
Among the 10 rare carbon-bearing minerals discovered by the project were abellaite and parisaite-(La). The minerals, whose existence was predicted before they were found, have no known economic applications.
Gilpin Robinson, of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) who was not involved in the study, said the USGS had started to collaborate with the big data project.
""The use of large data sets and analytical tools is very important in our studies of mineral and energy resources,"" he wrote in an email.
The DCO project will also try to collect data to examine the geological history of the Moon and Mars.

U.S. natural gas for September delivery was at $2.766 per million British thermal units by 9:40AM ET (1340GMT), down 2.8 cents, or around 1%. It fell to its lowest since March 2 $2.768 earlier in the session.
Prices saw a drop of roughly 2% on Monday amid bearish weather forecasts.
A weather system with cooling will linger over the East with showers and thunderstorms through August 5, resulting in comfortable temperatures.
A fresh weather system will arrive over the central, southern, and eastern U.S. the following week, resulting in light demand.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer cooling demand.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for cooling.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.990 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 9.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 3.7% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Early market expectations for this week's storage data due on Thursday is for a build in a range between 17 and 27 billion cubic feet in the week ended July 28.
That compares with a gain of 17 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a withdrawal of 6 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 44 billion cubic feet.

Crude futures rose above $50 a barrel for the first in two months, after U.S. officials said sanctions on Venezuela’s oil sector could be announced as early as Monday, in response to an election held on Sunday, which Washington has called a “sham”.
Also supporting upbeat sentiment on oil prices, were reports from several news agencies suggesting that some members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and non-Opec nations will meet on Aug 7-9 in Abu Dhabi to discuss how to increase compliance with the deal to cut production by 1.8m barrels per day (bpd) to March 2018.

U.S. crude supplies, however, have fallen four weeks in row while production activity has also eased, with just 10 rig added in July, the fewest since May 2016.

Crude futures rose above $50 a barrel for the first in two months, after U.S. officials said sanctions on Venezuela’s oil sector could be announced as early as Monday, in response to an election held on Sunday, which Washington has called a “sham”.
Also supporting upbeat sentiment on oil prices, were reports from several news agencies suggesting that some members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and non-Opec nations will meet on Aug 7-9 in Abu Dhabi to discuss how to increase compliance with the deal to cut production by 1.8m barrels per day (bpd) to March 2018.
The reports come a week after ministers from major crude-producing nations gathered in St. Petersburg, Russia, and vowed to increase compliance while Saudi Arabia said it would limit crude oil exports at 6.6 million bpd.
Opec’s compliance rate with deal to curb production, fell to 78% in June, the IEA said in its report earlier this month.
The rally in crude futures comes after weeks of bearish sentiment pressured prices to slump under $42 a barrel amid fears that growing U.S. crude stockpiles would undermine Opec and its allies’ efforts to stem the glut in the supply.
U.S. crude supplies, however, have fallen four weeks in row while production activity has also eased, with just 10 rig added in July, the fewest since May 2016."

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $1.76, or 0.13%, to $1,266.64 a troy ounce.
Gold prices traded in a narrow five-dollar range between $1,268.40 and $1,270.31, struggling to capitalise on dollar weakness amid a drop in physical demand for the yellow metal.
Gold prices in India last week recorded the biggest discount in seven months as a rebound in prices hurt retail demand while imports of the precious metal are expected to come under pressure amid a seasonal slowdown.
According to Thomson Reuters GFMS “With imports in the first half already near the whole of 2016 volumes, it is less likely in our view that imports will cross 250 tonnes in the second half.”
Meanwhile, political uncertainty from Washington continued to limited downside in gold prices, as the Trump administration struggles to deliver on its economic agenda which includes tax-reform, after the U.S. Senate rejected a bill to repeal Obamacare.
Market participants, however, will turn attention to monetary policy, as central bank policy decisions from Australia and the United Kingdom are slated for this week while U.S. nonfarm payrolls data due Friday rounds off the trading week.

Members of an oil prospecting team were kidnapped in the northeast's restive Lake Chad Basin region on Tuesday, prompting a rescue bid that left at least 37 dead including members of the team, rescuers from the military and vigilantes, officials say.
Three kidnapped members of the oil team later appeared in a video seen by Reuters on Saturday.
""The Vice chancellor said the University of Maiduguri won't check out of the oil exploration in the Lake Chad despite the recent unfortunate incident,"" said Danjuma Gambo, a spokesman for the university.
He confirmed comments attributed to the vice chancellor in a NNPC statement during a visit of NNPC delegation. Some of the dead were from the geology department of the university of Maiduguri, capital of Borno state and birth place of a Boko Haram insurgency.
The insurgency has killed 20,000 people and forced some 2.7 million to flee their homes in the last eight years, and the frequency of attacks has increased in the last few months. At least 113 people have been killed by insurgents since June 1.
On Sunday, the acting president's spokesman said Nigeria had scaled up its military response to the Boko Haram insurgency and will secure the northeast.
President Muhammadu Buhari left Nigeria on May 7 to take medical leave in Britain for an unspecified ailment. He handed power to his deputy, Osinbajo, seeking to allay concerns of a void at the helm of Africa's most populous nation.
The government and military have repeatedly said Boko Haram - which also carries out cross-border attacks in neighboring Cameroon and Niger - was on the verge of defeat.

Prices logged a gain of 1.1% last week, its third such rise in a row, as fading expectations for the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates again later this year combined with deepening political turmoil in the White House sent the dollar to 13-month lows.
Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
Meantime, investors continued to monitor geopolitical uncertainty on the Korean peninsula after North Korea conducted another missile test late on Friday.
Pyongyang said it had proved its ability to strike the U.S. mainland, prompting Washington to respond by flying two bombers over the Korean peninsula on Sunday.

Oil prices rose for the fifth session in a row on Friday to cap off their biggest weekly jump since early December last week.
WTI gained $3.94, or about 8.5%, while Brent rose $4.46, or roughly 9.3%, as fresh pledges from Saudi Arabia and Nigeria to respectively pull back on exports and output boosted sentiment.
Data showing a fourth consecutive week of declines in U.S. crude inventories and signs of a possible slowdown in U.S. shale production further added to optimism that the oil market was beginning to rebalance.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.

U.S. natural gas for September delivery was at $2.851 per million British thermal units by 8:25AM ET (1225GMT), down 9.0 cents, or around 3%. It fell to its lowest since July 5 at $2.834 earlier in the session.
Prices saw a drop of roughly 1% last week.
A weather system with cooling will linger over the East with showers and thunderstorms through August 5, resulting in comfortable temperatures.
A fresh weather system will arrive over the central, southern, and eastern U.S. the following week, resulting in light demand.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer cooling demand.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for cooling.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.990 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 9.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 3.7% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Early market expectations for this week's storage data due on Thursday is for a build in a range between 17 and 27 billion cubic feet in the week ended July 28.
That compares with a gain of 17 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a withdrawal of 6 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 44 billion cubic feet.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose on Monday, putting July on track to become the strongest month this year, as news of a producers' technical meeting next week added to bullish sentiment driven by the threat of U.S. sanctions against OPEC member Venezuela.
Oil traders also eyed the bullish impact from a production outage following a fire at Europe's largest refinery and further signs that the U.S. market is tightening after heavy inventory falls and slower new oil rig additions last week.
""The sentiment in the oil market became very bullish after OPEC said it will meet with partners in Abu Dhabi next week to discuss compliance,"" said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW.
Some OPEC and non-OPEC members will meet on Aug. 7-8 in Abu Dhabi to assess how the group can increase compliance with production cuts that began on Jan. 1.

The United States is considering imposing sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector in response to Sunday's election of a constitutional super-body which Washington has denounced as a ""sham"" vote.
In Europe, a production outage at Shell's 404,000 barrel-per-day Pernis refinery in the Netherlands following a fire sent benchmark European diesel margins, which reflect the profit made from refining crude oil into the road fuel, to their highest since November 2015 at $14.60 per barrel.
U.S. production has hampered efforts to rebalance the market but signs the market is tightening have emerged.

U.S. crude inventories have fallen by 10 percent from their March peaks to 483.4 million barrels.
U.S. output dipped by 0.2 percent to 9.41 million barrels per day (bpd) in the week to July 21, after rising by more than 10 percent since mid-2016.

747,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2017 05:29AM ET</span>","Canadian heavy oil plugs gap left by OPEC, Latam","By Nia Williams
CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada's struggling oil market has found something of a lifeline as traders scramble for heavy crude due to OPEC production cuts and sinking Latin American output. 
Output has fallen in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC Latin American countries such as Mexico and Colombia, leading refiners as far away as China to look to Alberta's oil sands to fill the gap.
The interest has boosted the price for heavy Western Canada Select (WCS) oil, which is within range of its tightest discount to U.S. crude ever. 
Canadian heavy oil is an easy substitute for Middle Eastern and Latin American grades, and the rising demand represents a rare bright spot for the oil sands, which have been hit hard by falling prices and the high cost to produce and blend Alberta's heavy, tar-like bitumen.
""We've been seeing a structural change (in the market) since OPEC cut medium sours, and Canadian heavy fits beautifully in there,"" one trader at an oil sands company said.
OPEC is attempting to rebalance global markets by cutting sour crude output, keeping light sweet barrels flowing as U.S. shale producers are pumping at record levels.
Output in Venezuela, an OPEC member, fell 11 percent in the first five months of the year to a 27-year-low due to underinvestment and infrastructure problems. And as political turmoil mounts there, the United States could impose sanctions that would hinder Venezuela's ability to sell crude.
Mexico's production fell 8 percent in the first five months of 2017 from a year ago as a result of long-running natural production declines in aging oilfields. Colombia's dropped 11.5 percent as a consequence of rebel attacks on pipelines.
Venezuela, Mexico and Colombia produce about 5.3 million barrels per day, while OPEC has cut about 1.8 million bpd in supply, most sour crude. 
Gulf Coast refiners are paying more for Canadian production to replace these barrels, pushing the discount for Canadian oil delivered to the U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, to around $5 a barrel below U.S. crude. At current levels that would put the outright price of WCS at Cushing at just under $45 a barrel.
The narrowest differential at Cushing was $4.10 per barrel below U.S. crude in mid-2015.
Canada exports more than 3 million barrels of crude daily to the United States, its No. 1 customer, according to U.S. Energy Department data. Canadian barrels could supply refineries in Sweeney, Texas, and St. Charles, Louisiana, where Venezuela accounts for the majority of imports.
Major beneficiaries would be producers with committed capacity on Enbridge Inc pipelines that funnel crude to the Gulf, like Suncor Energy and MEG Energy, because they enjoy lower tariffs than spot shippers.
Sending more Canadian oil to the United States may be difficult due to pipeline constraints, though more oil could be sent by rail, albeit at a higher price. High costs and poor returns prompted international energy companies to sell around $22.5 billion in Canadian assets this year.
With OPEC cuts now starting to bite in Asia, traders said demand for sour barrels was rising in a region that historically sourced oil from the Middle East and Russia.
Two traders in Calgary said their companies were getting more calls from potential Chinese buyers, and declining freight rates meant more Canadian crude could make its way to Asia.
State-owned Indian Oil Corp bought its first cargo of U.S. and Canadian heavy crude in July, and 1 million barrels of Canadian crude went to China in the first quarter. 

""So many tankers out there are looking for work it would not be surprising for somebody to get a sweetheart deal to take it to Asia,"" said RBC analyst Michael Tran. However, the country's lack of pipelines to the coast make significant exports to Asia unlikely, he said.

Gold for August delivery closed up 0.74% at $1,269.34 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. For the week, the precious metal was up 1.08%, its third consecutive weekly gain.
The dollar weakened broadly after data showing that wage growth and inflation remained tepid in the three months to June offset another report showing that U.S. economic growth accelerated in the second quarter.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, ended down 0.61% at 93.20, the lowest close since June 22, 2016.
The index has fallen around 2.3% so far this month and is down around 9% for the year to date.
A weaker dollar tends to boost prices for gold, which is denominated in the U.S. currency.
The subdued inflation outlook has raised doubts over whether the U.S. central bank will be able to stick to plans for a third interest rate hike this year.
The Fed left rates on hold on Wednesday and said it expected to start shrinking its balance sheet ""relatively soon.""
The precious metal received an additional boost after North Korea fired a ballistic missile, spurring safe-haven buying.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery rose 67 cents to settle at $49.71 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added $1.02 to trade at $52.51 a barrel.
Crude futures edged closer to a key $50 level, capping off a bullish week which has seen crude futures for the nearest delivery trade at premium to those of the following month, a pattern known as backwardation, usually associated with tighter supplies.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported Wednesday, crude and gasoline stockpiles fell by more than expected last week, pointing to an uptick in demand for crude and refinery activity.
Saudi Arabia pledged earlier this week to lower crude exports to 6.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, almost 1 million bpd below the level last year.
Also supporting a rise in crude prices was the possibility of major disruptions to crude supplies from Venezuela, which faces a national vote Sunday to elect a constituent assembly whose job will be to redraft its constitution.
Meanwhile, an uptick in the latest number of active drilling failed to weigh on investor sentiment as crude prices notched their best weekly gain since December, rising 8.6%.

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $9.53, or 0.75%, to $1,269.52 a troy ounce.
Gold recouped some of its losses sustained earlier during the week, as traders mulled over a downward revision in first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) which offset second-quarter gross domestic product that met expectations.
U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) increased 2.6% in the second quarter, meeting expectations, while first quarter GDP was revised down to 1.2%, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Friday.
The data also revealed a slowdown in the annual pace of inflation, as the U.S. GDP price index, the broadest inflationary indicator, dipped more-than-expected to 1%, adding to recent concerns over the slowing pace of inflation.
A slowdown in inflation has proven a key concern among Fed members, who voted on Wednesday to keep the central bank’s benchmark rate unchanged.
In a falling interest rate environment, investor appetite for gold weakens as the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal reduces relative to other interest-bearing assets such as bonds.
Other precious metals capitalized on a slump in the dollar, as silver futures rose 0.66% to $16.683 while platinum futures rose by 1.03% to $935.90.

WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. coal exports have jumped more than 60 percent this year due to soaring demand from Europe and Asia, according to a Reuters review of government data, allowing President Donald Trump's administration to claim that efforts to revive the battered industry are working. 
The increased shipments came as the European Union and other U.S. allies heaped criticism on the Trump administration for its rejection of the Paris Climate Accord, a deal agreed by nearly 200 countries to cut carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels like coal. 
The previously unpublished figures provided to Reuters by the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed exports of the fuel from January through May totaled 36.79 million tons, up 60.3 percent from 22.94 million tons in the same period in 2016. While reflecting a bounce from 2016, the shipments remained well-below volumes recorded in equivalent periods the previous five years.
They included a surge to several European countries during the 2017 period, including a 175 percent increase in shipments to the United Kingdom, and a doubling to France - which had suffered a series of nuclear power plant outages that required it and regional neighbors to rely more heavily on coal.
""If Europe wants to lecture Trump on climate then EU member states need transition plans to phase out polluting coal,"" said Laurence Watson, a data scientist working on coal at independent think tank Carbon Tracker Initiative in London. 
Nicole Bockstaller, a spokeswoman at the EU Commission's Energy and Climate Action department, said that the EU's coal imports have generally been on a downward trend since 2006, albeit with seasonable variations like high demand during cold snaps in the winter. 
Overall exports to European nations totaled 16 million tons in the first five months of this year, up from 10.5 million in the same period last year, according to the figures. Exports to Asia meanwhile, totaled 12.3 million tons, compared to 6.2 million tons in the year-earlier period. 
Trump had campaigned on a promise to ""cancel"" the Paris deal and sweep away Obama-era environmental regulations to help coal miners, whose output last year sank to the lowest level since 1978. The industry has been battered for years by surging supplies of cheaper natural gas, brought on by better drilling technologies, and increased use of natural gas to fuel power plants.
His administration has since sought to kill scores of pending regulations he said threatened industries like coal mining, and reversed a ban on new coal leasing on federal lands.
TAKING CREDIT
Both the coal industry and the Trump administration said the rising exports of both steam coal, used to generate electricity, and metallurgical coal, used in heavy industry, were evidence that Trump's agenda was having a positive impact. 
""Simply to know that coal no longer has to fight the government - that has to have some effect on investment decisions and in the outlook by companies, producers and utilities that use coal,"" said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association.
Shaylyn Hynes, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Energy Department, said: ""These numbers clearly show that the Trump Administration's policies are helping to revive an industry that was the target of costly and job killing overregulation from Washington for far too long.""
Efforts to obtain comment from exporters Arch Coal (N:ARCH) and privately held Murray Energy Corp were unsuccessful. Contura Energy, which emerged as part of Alpha Natural Resource's bankruptcy and restructuring, and filed for public offering in May, declined to comment.
A spokesman for Peabody Energy, the largest coal producer, though without a major export profile, said the United States was generally a ""swing supplier of seaborne coal."" 
U.S. Energy Information Administration analyst Elias Johnson said the U.S. coal industry may now be better positioned to meet foreign demand because U.S. miners have learned to produce at lower cost, after coming through a series of recent bankruptcies. 
""There's the possibility that the U.S. will become more of a primary player in the global coal trade market,"" he said.
But he added there are also plenty of reasons the spike in demand could be temporary. For one thing, U.S. coal production and transportation costs are much higher than for other producers such as Indonesia and Australia.
Because coal can often be transhipped from European ports before it is consumed, it is also hard to determine where shipments ultimately end up. 
Johnson pointed out that some of the fuel shipped into Western Europe, for example, could be making its way to other places like Ukraine, which is having trouble securing coal from its separatist-held regions. 
Trump said last month that his administration is offering more coal to Ukraine, but it was unclear how, given deals are typically worked out between companies.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Friday, reaching fresh two-month highs and on track to post the strongest weekly gains this year as investors digested signs of an easing oversupply picture.
U.S. crude and gasoline inventories fell much more steeply than expected this week and the world's biggest oil exporter Saudi Arabia said it would further reduce oil output in August.
Brent crude futures were up 22 cents at $51.71 a barrel at 0931 GMT after reaching a fresh two-month high of $51.75 a barrel. The front of the crude oil curve jumped into backwardation, with the month-ahead trading above the subsequent month, showing investors are not expecting recent gains to last.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were flat at $49.04 a barrel, near a two-month high of $49.24.
""Positive signs came from the draw in gasoline stocks this week, as the U.S. moves into the peak driving season,"" said Ashley Kelty, oil analyst at Cenkos Securities.
U.S. crude stocks fell sharply by 7.2 million barrels in the week to July 21 due to strong refining activity and an increase in exports, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). 
Brimming U.S. crude supplies have been a challenge to production cuts to prop up prices led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, meaning weekly U.S. inventory data is closely watched.
Despite these signs, analysts' assessments of the oil market remained bearish.
""We believe the latest price rise is on a fragile footing,"" said analysts at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), adding OPEC production was likely to rise in the coming months as the group has not officially capped output from members Libya and Nigeria. 

Investors were eyeing an update on the U.S. rig count expected later on Friday to assess any signs of a slowing down in drilling activity.

764,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 28, 2017 03:41AM ET</span>","Japan to hike tariffs on frozen beef imports from U.S., other nations","TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Japan will raise tariffs from August on imports of frozen beef from the United States and other countries, in a move to protect domestic producers, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Friday. 
Between Aug. 1 and the end of March next year, tariffs will jump to 50 percent from 38.5 percent now, as a ""safeguard"" mechanism is triggered to protect domestic farmers, the ministry said in a statement. 
It will be the first time the tariff mechanism has been tripped for beef imports since August 2003, when it was triggered for chilled beef, the farm ministry said. 
The hike threatens a significant sector of United States' access to the biggest Asian market for U.S. beef, just as President Donald Trump seeks to expand American exports to Japan. 
Last year, U.S. frozen beef exports to Japan were worth more than $400 million.
""The safeguard will not only have negative implications for U.S. beef producers, but will also have a significant impact on the Japanese food service industry,"" said Philip Seng, president and chief executive of the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF), in a statement on its website.
The hike will be especially hard on gyudon beef bowl restaurants, which use U.S. frozen beef cuts as a primary ingredient, he said. 
An increase is automatic if quarterly imports of specific beef products - both from all nations and from those lacking economic partnership agreements (EPAs) with Japan - rise more than 17 percent from a year earlier. 
In April-June, Japan's first fiscal quarter, frozen beef imports from all nations, at 89,253 tonnes, were up 17.1 percent on the year, while imports from non-EPA nations reached 37,823 tonnes, an increase of nearly a quarter, government data showed. 
Nations that have EPAs with Japan, such as Australia, Mexico and Chile, escape the tariff hike. 
Japan has been contacting affected nations, such as the United States, to explain the increase, Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters, Kyodo news agency said. 
Imports of chilled beef face no increase as their volumes did not exceed the trigger level. 
Japan's beef bowl restaurants were ""finally enjoying robust growth due to greater availability of U.S. beef,"" Seng said, following tremendous setbacks experienced during previous curbs of U.S. beef imports. 
U.S. sales of frozen beef cuts to Japan last year were worth $418 million, or around 18 percent of the U.S. total, U.S. Census Bureau data shows.
For the period January-May this year, total U.S. beef exports to Japan were valued at $731 million, up 32 percent on the corresponding 2016 period, the same data showed. 
By volume, total U.S. beef sales to Japan for January-May were 123,290 tonnes, up from 96,394 tonnes a year ago. Overall U.S beef exports for the first five months were 497,323 tonnes. 
U.S. beef makes up the vast majority of beef procurement at fast-food chain Yoshinoya, which buys about 11,000 tonnes of it annually, said a company spokesman.
But the company is not considering raising prices at the moment, as a lackluster economy makes it hard to pass on higher costs to customers, he added.
""We don't yet have a clear idea about the impact on earnings,"" he said. ""But considering conditions around consumption, we feel it will be difficult to raise prices.""

An official of a supermarket chain with more than 100 stores nationwide, who declined to be identified, ruled out a price hike for now, saying stocks were sufficient for the foreseeable future, though the proportion of U.S. beef it sold was limited.

769,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2017 07:45PM ET</span>",Lawmakers say Ross defers to Trump on U.S. steel tariff timing,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers said on Thursday that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told them he will defer to President Donald Trump on the timing of a decision on new steel import curbs, likely meaning further delays and deliberations on the issue.
Members of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee attending a briefing with Ross said he did not specify a timetable for releasing a long-awaited report that will lay out options for shielding the steel industry from imports on national security grounds.
Ross had originally hoped to release the steel ""Section 232"" report at the end of June but the timing has slipped amid disagreements among White House aides over the merits of restricting imports that could hurt steel consuming industries.
A House Democratic aide who attended the briefing said Ross repeated President Donald Trump's comments in a Wall Street Journal interview this week that the decision on potential steel tariffs would take more time and could come after congressional debates on health care, tax reform and infrastructure spending. 
""I can only follow my leader,"" the aide said Ross told the briefing.
The Commerce secretary also told lawmakers the issue had a lot of complexities and that he was considering the interests of both steel makers and steel users and concerned about potential trade retaliation against U.S. agricultural products. The lawmakers said Ross told them he was taking a similar approach to a parallel national security probe into aluminum imports.
""I think it's a good sign that they're actually slowing down and taking a long look, not trying to mix this in with these other issues that have to be lifted,"" said Republican Representative Jackie Walorski. 
""I think that Secretary Ross is committed to making sure that we're doing no harm, that we're getting this right. I need it to be right when it comes to aluminum,"" Walorski said, adding that the recreational vehicle industry in her northern Indiana district does not want to higher aluminum prices due tariffs.
Representative Judy Chu, a California Democrat, said Ross told the lawmakers that the Trump administration also wanted to pursue negotiations with other steel-producing countries to address the problem of excess capacity that was causing a flood of dumped imports.
But Ross and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week failed to secure commitments from their Chinese counterparts to make specific commitments to cut steel production capacity.

China, which produces half the world's steel, is widely viewed as the source of much of the metal's excess production.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for September delivery rose 0.61% to settle at $49.04 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 1.10% to trade at $51.53 a barrel.
Crude advanced to eight-week highs on Thursday, as investor expectations grew that U.S. crude supplies would continue to drop during the second half of the year, easing the global glut in supply.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported Wednesday, crude and gasoline stockpiles fell by more than expected last week, pointing to an uptick in demand for crude and refinery activity. 
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 7.2m barrels in the week ended July 14, confounding expectations  of a draw of about only 2.6m barrels while gasoline inventories, one of the products that crude is refined into, fell by roughly 1m. 
Crude prices remained on track to post a weekly gain amid an uptick in sentiment on oil, following news that Saudi Arabia plans to lower crude exports to 6.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, almost 1 million bpd below the level last year.
Rising U.S. oil production, however, is expected to limit upside momentum in oil prices, offsetting positive impact of falling U.S. crude stockpiles which has pushed crude prices near the key $50 a barrel level. 
“The near-term trend of falling oil stocks is helping fuel a rally in the energy space; however, the trend of rising U.S. oil production remains relentless,” said Tyler Richey, co-editor of the Sevens Report.
“Until that trend begins to show signs of slowing, the upside gains in the energy market will be limited,” he said."

As was widely expected, the Federal Reserve stood pat on interest rates Wednesday, keeping its benchmark rate in a target range of 1%-1.25% while expressing concerns about the slowdown in inflation, pushing the dollar to fourteen-month lows.
The dollar recovered, however, after economic reports showed durable goods orders for June topped expectations, offsetting a larger-than-expected rise in initial jobless claims.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims rose by more than expected to 244,000 in the week ended July 23, missing forecasts of a 7,000 decline.
In a separate report, core durable goods orders rose by 6.5% in June, the Commerce Department said Thursday, reflecting a sharp jump in orders for transportation equipment.
Dollar-denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar – A rise in the dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, and thus, reduces demand.

Prices ended lower for the fifth time in six sessions on Wednesday amid bearish weather forecasts that should limit demand for the fuel.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer cooling demand.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for cooling.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 17 billion cubic feet in the week ended July 21, below forecasts for a build of 24 billion.
That compared with a gain of 28 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 17 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 47 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.990 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 9.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 3.7% above the five-year average for this time of year.

The recognition of soft inflation added to expectations that the Fed's plan to raise interest rates a third time this year might be delayed.
According to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, conviction for another rate hike before the end of the year has faded, with less than 40% of market players expecting another move by December.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Data released earlier did little to sway the Fed's view on monetary policy.
New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in June, but a fifth straight monthly increase in shipments suggested that business spending on equipment supported economic growth in the second quarter.

777,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2017 04:55AM ET</span>",Why record U.S. oil exports are poised for even more growth,"By Devika Krishna Kumar and Marianna Parraga
NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. refineries are producing more fuel than ever as they seek to meet rising demand - from overseas, rather than the drivers on nearby roadways.
Last year, the U.S. became the world's top net exporter of fuel, an outgrowth of booming domestic production since the shale oil revolution started in 2010. That's a fundamental shift from the traditional U.S. role in global markets as a top importer and consumer.
Net exports are on track to hit another record in 2017, making foreign fuel markets increasingly important for the future growth prospects and profit margins of U.S. refiners.
Shale oil producers have provided refiners with abundant and cheap domestic crude supplies, giving them the raw material they need to produce internationally competitive fuel.
The nation set a record in 2016 by sending a net 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of petroleum products to foreign markets. That compares to net fuel imports of 2.3 million just a decade ago, according to U.S. government data.
Booming exports have bolstered margins at the biggest U.S. refiners - including Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and Valero - and compensated for lack of strong growth this year in U.S. fuel demand.
Now, the government of U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to deregulate oil and gas production to further leverage rising U.S. exports for international political gain - a policy Trump calls ""energy dominance"".
Surging U.S. crude production has already complicated the ongoing effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to tame a global glut that has halved oil prices since 2014.
The United States remains a massive importer of crude oil - regularly trading the top spot with China - but American refineries now re-export much of that oil as jet fuel, diesel and gasoline.
The U.S. has a growing role in satisfying demand for motor fuel in countries such as Mexico and Brazil, where the thirst for U.S. fuel is likely to accelerate amid refinery outages and high production costs.
Refined U.S. exports are also going further afield to Asia, and diesel exports to Europe increased in June to levels not seen in nearly two years, traders have said.
(See graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2sSqsRP)
Traditionally, oil traders, refiners and investors have considered U.S. fuel demand as one of the leading metrics for predicting international crude oil supply and price trends. Now, they are increasingly looking to foreign demand for U.S. fuel for guidance.
""Globally, you're going to have increased demand for all of our products, and so our focus will go beyond the U.S. borders,"" said Texas-based Valero's Chief Executive, Joe Gorder.
In contrast, he predicted a ""slight decline"" in U.S. gasoline demand over the next decade.
U.S. gasoline demand hit a record in 2016, as low pump prices encouraged consumption, but has leveled off this year. Rising fuel efficiency in cars is expected to limit future domestic demand growth.
LATIN AMERICAN BUYERS
U.S. refined products are filling shortages in countries such as Mexico and Venezuela, where refineries have been running below capacity. U.S. exports have also made inroads into Brazil's market by undercutting the price of locally produced fuel.
Latin America's imports of U.S. fuels reached almost 2.5 million bpd in the first quarter compared with 2.32 million bpd in 2016. The growth was fueled by Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Venezuela and Central America, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).
Mexico - already the biggest export market for U.S. gasoline and diesel - is seeking higher-than-usual volumes in July and August to fill a void left by a fire at its biggest refinery last month.
In recession-scarred Venezuela, the country's largest refining complex has lowered operating rates this month to less than half of its 955,000-barrel-per-day capacity, a level that has required state-run oil company PDVSA to import more fuel to meet domestic demand.
Between them, Mexico and Venezuela have recently said they want to buy extra volumes of almost 19 million barrels in the second half of the year - mostly from the United States - an amount suggesting that U.S. exports will grow again this year over last year's record levels.
Net U.S. exports of transport fuels could rise 8.8 percent this year, according to PIRA Energy, an analytics and forecasting unit of S&P Global Platts.
In Brazil, fuel distributors have begun buying more U.S. imports because they are cheaper than fuel sold by state-run oil firm Petrobras.
Petrobras had failed to align its wholesale prices with international markets, opening a window for importers to bring fuel into Brazil.
Petrobras last month said it would peg its fuels more closely to international prices as it tried to slow the expansion of U.S. imports. Analysts said supply from U.S. refiners was unlikely to slow much.
BEYOND THE AMERICAS
U.S. refiners have also boosted exports to Europe and Asia.
In Europe, U.S. shipments of diesel rose to nearly 500,000 bpd in June, according to traders, well above flows that have rarely exceeded 370,000 bpd since July 2015.
U.S. global distillate exports, including diesel, hit a record that month, said researcher ClipperData, which tracks global oil flows.
Exports of refined products to several Asian countries, including India, Japan and South Korea, rose to record levels in 2016, and China took a record 303,000 bpd of U.S. produced fuels in February.
U.S. refiners are likely to play in important role in meeting rising demand from Asia, said Nicole Leonard, senior project consultant at Platts Analytics Oil & Gas Consulting.
Analysts and traders expect U.S. refined products exports to continue to grow, even with increased competition from large exporters in the Middle East, Europe and India.
Demand for U.S. fuels is underpinned by refinery challenges in neighboring countries, said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research for Morningstar Commodities Research in Austin, Texas.
""It doesn't seem that these Latin American countries are going to cure their refining problems overnight,"" he said.

Tariffs on frozen beef will jump to 50 percent from the current 38.5 percent between Aug. 1 and the end of March as a 'safeguard' mechanism for domestic farmers is to be triggered for the first time in 14 years, reports said, without citing sources.
The move comes as U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to expand exports of U.S. products to Japan.
The safeguard is automatically triggered if quarterly imports from all nations and from countries that do not have economic partnership agreements (EPAs) with Japan both rise more than 17 percent from a year earlier, according to reports in the Nikkei and Yomiuri newspapers.
Nations that have EPAs with Japan, such as Australia, Mexico and Chile, will be excluded from the hike in tariffs, the Asahi newspaper said.
Japan's farm ministry could not immediately be reached for comment.
Frozen beef imports from the U.S. have risen this year as another major supplier Australia was hit by drought, the Yomiuri said.
The country's frozen beef imports in the year ended March 2017 totalled about 290,000 tonnes, including about 90,000 tonnes from the United States, the Asahi said, adding that frozen meat imports accounted for about 54 percent of beef imports.

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $2.06, or 0.59%, to $1,249.82 a troy ounce. 
Gold futures struggled for direction ahead of the Fed interest rate decision due later during the session, as investors awaited fresh clues on monetary policy. 
A tick lower in treasury yields, however, suggested that market participants expect a dovish central bank policy statement concerning future rate hikes, after a string of recent inflation data undershot expectations. 
The Fed is expected to stand pat on its balance sheet unwinding plan, as analysts continued to expect the central bank will move to normalize its balance sheet in September. 
“The Fed has worked too hard to lay the groundwork for a smooth launch to take a chance by surprising the market about the timing,” said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN).
In a falling interest rate environment, investor appetite for gold rises as the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal decreases relative to other interest-bearing assets such as bonds.
Ahead of the Fed’s decision on interest rates, investors mulled over downbeat housing data pointing to continued supply constraints in homes available for sale. 
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new home sales rose 0.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 610,000 units last month. May's sales pace was revised down to 605,000 units from the previously reported 610,000 units.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose to near eight-week highs on Wednesday, with Brent crude futures at over $50 a barrel, as a fall in U.S. inventories bolstered expectations that the long-oversupplied market was moving toward balance.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were up 67 cents to $50.87 a barrel by 10:39 a.m. EDT (1439 GMT). Prices surpassed levels seen Tuesday when Brent futures strengthened more than 3 percent.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures (CLc1) climbed 83 cents to $48.72 a barrel.
U.S. crude stocks fell last week as refineries hiked output and imports dropped, while gasoline stocks decreased and distillate inventories fell, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.
Crude inventories fell 7.2 million barrels in the week ending July 21, more than the expected decrease of 2.6 million barrels. The decline was the fourth consecutive drop, giving support to the market. 
This added to hopes a long-awaited rebalancing was underway in the oil market. Saudi Arabia said on Monday it would limit oil exports to 6.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, down nearly 1 million bpd from a year earlier. 
""Today’s report has strengthened the bullish sentiment already prevailing in the market, although the longevity of the move remains in doubt,"" said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London. ""Nevertheless, the country’s crude and gasoline stockpiles remain above their five-year averages, which will cap price gains.""
The drawdown was a combination of higher exports from the United States, marginal decline in oil output and a rise in the refinery utilization rate, he said. 
""The market has been tightening and the refinery margins are strong,"" said PetroMatrix managing director Olivier Jakob, saying the U.S. stock draw offered a boost to prices. ""You add geopolitical risk premium for Venezuela, and you've got a strong market.""
Venezuela, an OPEC member producing about 2 million bpd of oil, faces deepening economic woes and protests.
President Nicolas Maduro's opponents launched a two-day national strike on Wednesday to push him to abandon a weekend election. The United States is considering financial sanctions to halt dollar payments for Venezuelan oil. 
Nigerian output slipped this week as leaks forced Shell (LON:RDSa) to shut a pipeline exporting some 180,000 bpd of oil. Nigeria, which has been exempted from OPEC-led production curbs, has agreed to cap or cut output when it stabilized at 1.8 million bpd.
But analysts said the current oil price rally could encourage more production, particularly from the United States. 
""Relieved bulls should be careful what they wish for. Any price rebound will only embolden U.S. shale producers at a time when rumors have started to emerge that the U.S. shale boom is slowing,"" PVM oil analyst Stephen Brennock said in a note. 

Anadarko Petroleum Corp (N:APC) said on Monday it would cut its 2017 capital budget by $300 million because of depressed oil prices, the first major U.S. oil producer to do so, after posting a larger-than-expected quarterly loss.

There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA.
Oil prices scored their biggest one-day rally of 2017 on Tuesday as fresh pledges from Saudi Arabia and Nigeria at the start of the week to respectively pull back on exports and output boosted sentiment.
At an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting on Monday, Saudi Arabia announced it would cut August exports to 6.6 million barrels a day, which would be a million less than a year earlier.
In addition, Nigeria, which has been exempt from this year’s OPEC-led production-cut deal, pledged to cap output once it reaches a level of 1.8 million barrels a day. The cartel’s latest data put the country’s output at around 1.7 million.
In May, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers, such as Russia, extended an agreement to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
So far, it has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, as well as a relentless increase in U.S. shale production.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) has been surveying for more than a year for what it says could be vast oil reserves in the Lake Chad Basin, a region wracked by Boko Haram's eight-year insurgency, which has killed at least 20,000 people and forced millions to flee their homes.
OPEC member Nigeria relies on crude oil for two-thirds of government revenue. Attacks on energy facilities in its southern Niger Delta oil heartland last year cut production by more than a third, deepening the recession in Africa's biggest economy.
NNPC spokesman Ndu Ughamadu said the contractors were kidnapped near Jibi village in Borno state on Tuesday afternoon.

KARACHI/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A strike by Pakistani fuel tanker owners entered a third day on Wednesday, with panicked buyers forming huge queues around petrol stations in the capital Islamabad and across the country.
Local media reported Pakistan has 10-11 days of oil stock reserves, but many service stations were shuttered with ""Petrol Finished"" signs after panic buying overnight in a nation of nearly 200 million people.
The tanker owners are protesting police corruption and a government move to improve safety following a fuel tanker disaster last month, when a tanker explosion killed more than 200 people in one of the worst accidents in Pakistan's history.
""It is better to fill the tank,"" said Waseem Sheikh, one of hundreds of people waiting at a Shell (LON:RDSa) petrol station in capital Islamabad. ""I don't want to face a hard time just because I don't have fuel in my car.""
Shamas Shiwani, Vice Chairman All Pakistan Tankers Association, told Reuters the motorway, traffic and excise police always demand bribes so a ""tanker driver has to pay so much in extortion that he hardly manages to keep his clothes"".
A new safety push by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) following the tanker explosion in Punjab last month has made matters worse, Shiwani added.
Government officials say safety has to improve in a country where many trucks are not road worthy and pose a danger to the public.
Imran Ghazanvi, spokesman for OGRA, said the regulator suspected oil marketing companies were backing the strike and would ""expose"" the firms.
""We will not allow this blackmailing,"" he told a press conference on Tuesday.
More talks with tanker owners are scheduled for Wednesday.
Petrol stations in the Punjabi city of Multan had mostly run out of fuel, local media said, while in Peshawar and other cities rationing petrol purchases were limited to 1,000 rupees ($9.50) per car and 100 rupees per motorbike.
The government has been trying to enact tougher safety regulations following the June 25 disaster. 
A tanker carrying fuel rolled over in the Punjab province and villagers rushed to collect leaking fuel. Something then set off a fireball.

Overnight, crude futures settled higher on Tuesday, as investors continued to cheer Saudi Arabia’s pledge to lower crude exports and Opec’s commitment to boost compliance with output cuts to curb excess supplies.
At a gathering of ministers from major crude-producing nations in St. Petersburg, Russia on Monday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said his country would limit crude oil exports at 6.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, almost 1 million bpd below levels a year ago.
The Saudi energy minster added that the production-cut agreement could be extended beyond March if necessary but any further extension would rely on non-compliant nations adhering to the agreement.
Opec’s compliance rate – with the deal to curb production –fell to 78% June, the IEA said in its report earlier this month.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said an additional 200,000 bpd of oil could be removed from the market if there is 100% compliance with the OPEC-led deal.
Despite the somewhat positive outcome of the meeting, Opec has its work cut out to curb excess supplies and lower crude stockpiles to the five-year average, which is the target level for Opec and non-Opec members.
Opec said that stocks held by industrial nations had fallen by 90 million barrels in the first six months of the year but were still 250 million barrels above the five-year average.

Brent crude futures rose $1.60 or 3.3 percent to settle at $50.20 a barrel, the first time the benchmark closed above $50 since June 6. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures rose $1.55 or 3.3 percent to settle at $47.89 a barrel, the benchmark's highest close since early June.
The lower oil prices in June and July may have been affecting U.S. shale production, said Mark Watkins, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank.

Nigeria agreed to join the deal by capping or cutting its output from 1.8 million bpd once it stabilizes at that level.
OPEC said stocks held by industrial nations had fallen by 90 million barrels in the first six months of the year but were still 250 million barrels above the five-year average, which is the target level for OPEC and non-OPEC members.
Market players will watch U.S. crude inventory data due Tuesday afternoon from the American Petroleum Institute and Wednesday morning from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Analysts estimated, on average, that crude stocks fell 3 million barrels in the latest week.
""The general consensus around the campfire is that you’re going to get sizeable draws in crude and gasoline,"" said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Americas.
However, higher oil prices could be a ""double edged sword"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) wrote in a note on Tuesday. 

""U.S. shale oil companies... would immediately take advantage of the higher price for hedging purposes and would step up their production again in the medium term.""

At a gathering of ministers from major crude-producing nations in St. Petersburg, Russia on Monday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said his country would limit crude oil exports at 6.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, almost 1 million bpd below levels a year ago.
The Saudi energy minster added that the production-cut agreement could be extended beyond March if necessary but any further extension would rely on non-compliant nations adhering to the agreement. 
Opec’s compliance rate – with the deal to curb production –fell to 78% June, the IEA said in its report earlier this month.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said an additional 200,000 bpd of oil could be removed from the market if there is 100% compliance with the OPEC-led deal.
Despite the somewhat positive outcome of the meeting, Opec has its work cut out to curb excess supplies and lower crude stockpiles to the five-year average, which is the target level for Opec and non-Opec members.
Opec said that stocks held by industrial nations had fallen by 90 million barrels in the first six months of the year but were still 250 million barrels above the five-year average. 
The rally in crude prices comes ahead of a fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) expected to show that U.S. crude stockpiles fell for a fourth-straight week. 
Analysts forecast crude inventories fell by about 2.6m barrels in the week ended July 21."

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $2.29, or 0.18%, to $1,252.14 a troy ounce.
Although analysts widely expect the Federal Reserve to keep rates unchanged on Wednesday, treasury yields ticked higher, lowering demand for non-interest bearing gold, suggesting that market participants expect the central bank to keep to its recent stance monetary policy.
Following its decision to raise rates in June for the second time this year, the Fed said that the slowdown in inflation was transitory and signalled its intention to raise rates at least once more this year.
In a rising interest rate environment, investor appetite for gold weakens as the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal increases relative to other interest-bearing assets such as bonds.
Ahead of the Fed’s decision on interest rates, investors mulled over better-than-expected consumer confidence data, easing fears about a slowdown in the US economy.

810,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2017 07:53AM ET</span>",China urges halt to oil drilling in disputed South China Sea,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry has urged a halt to oil drilling in a disputed part of the South China Sea, where Spanish oil company Repsol (MC:REP) had been operating in cooperation with Vietnam.
Drilling began in mid-June in Vietnam's Block 136/3, which is licensed to Vietnam's state oil firm, Spain's Repsol and Mubadala Development Co of the United Arab Emirates. 
The block lies inside the U-shaped 'nine-dash line' that marks the vast area that China claims in the sea and overlaps what it says are its own oil concessions.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China had indisputable sovereignty over the Spratly Islands, which China calls the Nansha islands, and jurisdiction over the relevant waters and seabed.
""China urges the relevant party to cease the relevant unilateral infringing activities and with practical actions safeguard the hard-earned positive situation in the South China Sea,"" Lu said at a regular briefing, when asked if China had pressured Vietnam or the Spanish company to stop drilling.
He did not elaborate.
This week the BBC reported that Vietnam had halted drilling there after Chinese threats, but there was no independent confirmation and neither Vietnamese officials nor Repsol made any comment on the report.
Thomson Reuters data showed the drilling ship Deepsea Metro I was in the same position on Monday as it had been since drilling began on the block in the middle of June.
An Indonesian naval ship that passed there on Saturday reported that three coastguard vessels and two Vietnamese fishing boats were nearby and there was no sign of trouble.
The Norwegian drilling ship operator, Odfjell Drilling Ltd., did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
China claims most of the energy-rich South China Sea through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims.
China's naval build-up and its increasingly assertive stance over disputed territory in the South China Sea have unnerved its neighbors. 

The United States has criticized China's construction of islands and military facilities there, concerned they could be used to restrict free movement and extend Beijing's strategic reach.

""It shows real additional willingness on their part to do something, which is hugely important, rather than sitting back and letting OPEC motions roll forward. They're acting unilaterally and adding pressure.""
Falih also said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC partners were committed to extending their existing 1.8 million bpd supply reduction deal beyond next March if necessary but would demand that any non-compliant nations stick to the agreement.
OPEC and some of its competitors met in the Russian city of St Petersburg to review market conditions and examine proposals related to their pact to cut output.
There was no discussion of deeper oil output cuts, but Falih said that Nigeria, which is exempt from the deal, had signaled it was ready to cap its output at about 1.8 million bpd. 
Nigeria and Libya have been exempt from the cuts as they recover from years of unrest.

OPEC and some non-OPEC states, including Russia, agreed to cut production by 1.8 million bpd from January 2017 to the end of March 2018.

821,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2017 08:30AM ET</span>","After China-induced price spike, coal set to resume long-term decline","By Nina Chestney and Henning Gloystein
LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Coal prices' march to eight-month highs, driven by China's huge appetite for power consumption, looks like an interlude in a longer-term decline and is seen losing traction later this year. 
Investors widely anticipate a slow demise for coal use due to policies encouraging cleaner natural gas and renewable energy generation, but the shorter-term outlook for the industry has seen a sharp reversal of fortunes.
Asia's benchmark physical coal prices have gained more than a third from lows seen in May to nearly $98 per ton, while European benchmark API2 2018 coal futures are at eight-month highs of around $74 a ton.
Recent gains are largely due to high demand in China, where power consumption has jumped more than 6 percent since the beginning of the year.
This month, torrential rains forced China to cut capacity by as much as two thirds at its Three Gorges and Gezhouba hydropower plants in an effort to ease pressure on the Yangtze river, forcing utilities to switch to coal.
Three Gorges is by far the world's biggest power station, with an installed generation capacity of 22.5 gigawatts - equivalent to around 20 coal-fired power plants.
Heatwaves in the north also boosted air-conditioning demand, while coal mining and shipping were hampered due to adverse weather in Indonesia and South Africa. Production in Australia was disrupted by a strike.
Many of these conditions should ease next month, however. 
""Downside (to prices) is likely from the end of August but a lot depends on China,"" said Wayne Bryan, analyst at Alfa Energy.
China's decision last year to cap domestic mining output resulted in a sudden surge in overseas orders by its utilities and triggered a price spike.
However, there have been several Chinese policy changes since, surprising traders and contributing to a price slump in late 2016 and earlier this year.
Singapore-listed commodity merchant Noble Group, a major global coal trader, reported a $129.3 million loss in May for the first quarter this year to which coal prices heavily contributed. 
""INTERMEZZO""
China had cut coal capacity by 111 million tonnes by the end of June, representing 74 percent of its target for this year. 
""China is likely to continue the consolidation of its coal mining industry, yet will probably try to avoid production being slashed in the way that happened in the past,"" analysts at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) wrote. 
""We regard the latest price rise as merely an intermezzo and expect coal prices to fall again in the second half of the year."" 
Analysts expect average futures prices to fall to $60-$70/ton in the third and fourth quarters of this year and $50-$65/ton in the first quarter of next year.
China plans to add 200 million tonnes of new coal mining capacity this year, in addition to the 90 million tonnes already added in the first half of this year.
In January, the National Development and Reforms Commission said it wanted Chinese coal prices to trade in a range of 500-570 yuan a ton, and would take action if they were outside this.
""With prices now trading above the range, there are growing expectations that the government will take steps to increase domestic supply,"" analysts at ING Research wrote.
At higher price levels, many miners are making money and there is a good chance that new supply will come to the market, said Georgi Slavov, head of qualitative research at commodities brokerage Marex Spectron.
""We saw this spike coming but did not expect it to last this long. (For European physical prices) to go down to $70 a ton, we would need to see supply increase to 20 million tonnes a week. It is now 17 million.""
Physical prices are currently around $83/ton.
The extent of any decline would also depend on power demand in China, which traditionally rises toward the peak winter demand season after September, traders said.
Although there is no shortage of Asian supply, output from 
Indonesia's Kalimantan island - one of the world's biggest thermal coal export regions - is also erratic due to bad weather, corruption probes and port disruptions.

822,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2017 08:21AM ET</span>","OPEC moves to cap Nigerian oil output, boost compliance","By Katya Golubkova, Vladimir Soldatkin and Rania El Gamal
ST PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuters) - OPEC moved on Monday to cap Nigerian oil output and called on several members to boost compliance with production cuts to help clear excessive global stocks and support flagging prices.
OPEC has agreed with several non-OPEC producers led by Russia to cut oil output by a combined 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from January 2017 until the end of March 2018.
OPEC states Libya and Nigeria were exempted from the limits to help their oil industries recover from years of unrest.
The deal to curb output propelled crude prices above $58 a barrel in January but they have since slipped back to a $45 to $50 range as the effort to drain global inventories has taken longer than expected.
Rising output from U.S. shale producers has offset the impact of the output curbs, as has climbing production from Libya and Nigeria.
A ministerial committee of OPEC and non-OPEC states that monitors the global oil pact said it had agreed Nigeria would join the deal by capping or even cutting its output from 1.8 million bpd, once it stabilizes at that level from 1.7 million bpd recently.
The monitoring committee, known as JMMC and which met in the Russian city of St Petersburg, did not give the timeframe for when this would happen, saying it would track Nigerian production patterns in the next weeks. 
The committee did not back capping Libyan output as it said its production was unlikely to exceed 1 million bpd in the near future compared to its capacity of 1.4 million-1.6 million bpd before unrest erupted in 2011 and plunged the nation into chaos.
Brent oil prices rose about 1 percent at about $48.50, helped by news of a cap on Nigeria and by comments from Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih that the kingdom's exports would fall to 6.6 million bpd in August as demand at home was rising, effectively representing a cut of 1 million bpd year-on-year.
He said global stocks had fallen by 90 million barrels, but were still about 250 million barrels above the five-year average for industrialized nations, which is the level OPEC and non-OPEC states are targeting with their output curbs.
BEARISH SENTIMENT
Russia and Saudi Arabia face mounting pressure to prop up oil prices. Russia, which is heavily reliant on oil revenues, holds a presidential election next year. Saudi Arabia needs higher prices to balance its budget and support next year's planned listing of state oil firm Saudi Aramco.
""We must acknowledge that the market has turned bearish with several key factors driving these sentiments,"" Falih told the meeting of the monitoring committee.
Falih said weaker compliance with cuts by some OPEC states and a rise in OPEC exports had led to a softer crude price.
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have cut more than they pledged but others, such as the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, have shown relatively weak adherence to the limits.
""Some countries continue to lag which is a concern we must address head on,"" Falih said. ""Exports have now become the key matrix to financial markets and we need to find a way to reconcile credible exports data with production data.""
Falih said the committee spoke to those who were lagging, without naming them, and said they pledged to boost compliance.
The Saudi minister said global oil demand was expected to grow by about 1.4 million to 1.6 million bpd next year, similar to 2017 and so should more than offset rising U.S. output.
JMMC's chair Kuwait said OPEC could call an extraordinary meeting to include Nigeria and could extend existing production curbs beyond March 2018 if markets failed to rebalance.
Alongside Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the committee includes Russia, Venezuela, Algeria and Oman.

Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer, will limit exports to 6.6 million barrels a day in August, energy minister Khalid Al-Falih said after a meeting with fellow producers who gathered to discuss compliance with the cartel's deal to cut production.
The oil ministers gathering in St. Petersburg, Russia, made no major changes to their wider supply agreement, stopping short of capping output of Libya and Nigeria.
However, multiple reports said Nigeria committed to voluntarily taking part in cuts if it reaches a production level of 1.8 million barrels a day. Libya, which has increased output above 1 million barrels a day, is not planning to limit production until reaching its target of pumping 1.25 million a day.
The two countries had been exempted from the pact among major oil producers to allow their production to recover from years of unrest.
In May, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers, such as Russia, extended an agreement to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
Energy ministers at the meeting said the output-cap agreement could be extended beyond next year’s first quarter if needed, according to multiple reports.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude September contract was at $46.22 a barrel by 7:05AM ET (1105GMT), up 45 cents, or around 1%. It touched its lowest since July 13 at $45.41 earlier in the session.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for September delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rose 53 cents, or about 1.1%, to $48.59 a barrel, after touching a more than one-week low of $47.70 in overnight trade.
WTI posted a nearly 1.7% decline last week, while Brent lost about 1.8%, as sentiment soured amid indications that supply from OPEC was set to rise, despite the cartel's agreement to curb production.
Meanwhile, in the U.S., weekly figures from energy services company Baker Hughes showed that the number of active rigs drilling for oil declined by 1 to 764 last week, suggesting early signs of moderating domestic production growth.
The count is often seen as proxy for the outlook on domestic production.

Prices logged a gain of more than 2% last week, as ongoing political turmoil in the White House and weakness in the U.S. dollar spurred haven demand for the precious metal.
In the coming week, global financial markets will focus on the outcome of Wednesday's Federal Reserve policy meeting for any new insight on the timing of the next U.S. rate hike and clues on how the central bank plans to pare back its massive balance sheet.
There are also several key U.S. economic reports, with the biggest being second quarter GDP due on Friday.
Besides the GDP report, this week's calendar also features U.S. data on both existing and new home sales, as well as consumer confidence, durable goods orders and weekly jobless claims.
According to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, conviction for another rate hike before the end of the year has faded, with just 35% of market players expecting another move by December, as the subdued inflation outlook raised doubts over whether policymakers will be able to stick to their planned tightening path.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Focus will also be on headlines coming out of Washington, where the Senate is expected to continue working to repeal Obamacare. The investigation into U.S. President Donald Trump campaign's ties to Russia will continue to get attention.

Unionized miners started the nationwide strike on Wednesday to protest what they described as proposed labor reforms that would make firing easier and workplaces less safe.
The government has denied that it wants to pass laws that would be bad for workers.
Union leaders called off the strike after five hours of talks, the Labor Ministry said in a statement. A task force that includes Labor Minister Alfonso Grados and union representatives will discuss laws for mining workers over a month-long period starting in August, it said.
The strike has not affected production at some of Peru's biggest mines, according to the companies that operate them, but clashes between police and hundreds of striking miners erupted during protests in Lima on Thursday and Friday.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for July delivery fell 2.5% to settle at $45.77 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent dropped 2.76% to trade at $47.94 a barrel.
Opec's July oil supply was set to rise by 145,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared to June, Reuters reported citing data from PetroLogistics, a company that tracks Opec supply forecasts.
The increase in oil supply would push production above 33 million barrels per day, and further reduce Opec’s compliance rate - with the deal curb production – which fell to 78% to June. 
Higher supply from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Nigeria would drive this month's gains, according to PetroLogistics.
The bearish news came ahead of data showing a slowdown in U.S. drilling activity suggesting a possible tightening in U.S. production growth. 
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported its weekly count of oil rigs operating in the United States ticked down by one rig to a total of 764. 
The slump in oil prices on Friday, erased earlier gains during the week, as crude futures posted a weekly loss ahead of the Opec meeting on July 24. 
Opec is not expected to introduce additional measures to curb the recent growth in supply, as some members believe it’s too early to determine whether the current level of production cuts need to be deepened. 
""We are in the first two weeks of the extension period. It is too early to say now what I will do in November,"" Kuwait's oil minister Essam al-Marzouq said on Tuesday. 
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8m bpd for a period of nine months until March but rising production from the U.S., Nigeria and Libya has undermined the cartel’s efforts to curb excess supply. "

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $8.46, or 0.68%, to $1,254.06 a troy ounce.
Several news agencies reported that U.S. President Donald Trump’s private business is set to come under scrutiny as special counsel Robert Mueller will expand investigations into allegations that Russia influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The political uncertainty in Washington pegged the greenback to its lowest level in more than a year against its rivals, boosting gold prices to session highs, as the precious metal seeks to notch its biggest weekly gain in two months. 
Dollar-denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar – A dip in the dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency and thus, increases demand.
Gold’s recent stretch of gains comes on the back of an uptick in safe-haven demand, amid a batch of timid economic data suggesting that the Federal Reserve may struggle to keep to its plan to hike rates at least once more this year. 
“Amid rising evidence of price and growth risks, [investors] are now being replaced by safe-haven buyers,” Peter Grant, chief market analyst with gold broker USAGOLD said.

""We have seen healthy demand and a flattening of rig counts in the United States,"" Mazroui told reporters.
""This is the beginning of the third quarter and demand picks up in the third quarter and I hope the agreement will have a significant impact in the third and fourth quarter.""
Brent crude oil prices remain just under the key $50 per barrel mark on concerns about high supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) despite a pledge to cut output in a bid to tighten the market.
OPEC, together with some non-members like Russia, has extended a deal to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to March 2018. 
However, OPEC's compliance slumped to 78 percent in June as higher-than-allowed output from Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Iraq, the UAE and Venezuela offset strong compliance from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Angola, the International Energy Agency said last week.
""The UAE is committed to its cut,"" Mazroui said.
""We have seen some increase in production in some of the countries that were not part of the agreement because of their special stance.""
Oil traders are looking ahead to Monday's meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC members to see if it will address rising production from Nigeria and Libya, which have been exempted from the cuts.
OPEC's Joint Ministerial Committee monitors compliance with the supply pact and will meet in St Petersburg, Russia.
OPEC's supply cuts have also been countered by rising U.S. production, which has increased almost 12 percent since mid-2016 to 9.4 million bpd. The number of rigs drilling for new U.S. oil supply has also climbed since last year though the pace has slowed in recent weeks.

Elsewhere, Brent oil for September delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rose 18 cents, or 0.47%, to $49.38 a barrel.
Despite this week’s gains, oil has tumbled more than 10% year-to-date as skepticism over the capability to reduce the global supply cut caused investors to sell off black gold.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed with non-OPEC members led by Russia to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day through March 2018 though the latest reading on compliance by OPEC members was at just 78%.
Furthermore, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.
Earlier this week, tiny producer Ecuador signaled it might not abide by the cuts, causing fears that other larger producers might follow suit.
OPEC and non-OPEC producers are scheduled to meet Monday in Russia and traders are watching for any signs that Saudi Arabia, the largest producers of crude in the world, may cut its output.
There is speculation that Saudi Arabia is considering a 1 million-barrel cut to its oil exports to offset the output rise in Libya and Nigeria.
Kuwait’s oil minister has also reportedly said that the two African nations may soon be asked to limit their production.
Monday’s gathering is a routine meeting of the Joint OPEC/Non-OPEC Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) whose task is to monitor compliance with agreement to cut production.
Beyond what is said in the meeting itself, market players will be paying close attention to any comments on the sidelines that may indicate plans for further action to rebalance global supply.
On Friday, market participants will also eye the latest weekly data from Baker Hughes on U.S. drilling activity.
Last Friday, the energy services company reported that U.S. drillers had added two oil rigs, which brought the total count up to 765, the most since April 2015, underlining concern that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production is derailing efforts by other major producers to rebalance the market.

Gold hit an intraday high of $1.247.65 earlier in the session, its highest level since June 30, and was on track for weekly gains of 1.5% in what would be its second consecutive weekly rise.
The Republican Party’s incapacity to achieve a replacement healthcare plan and headlines revolving around multiple congressional and federal investigations into possible ties between Trump and Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign have recently put pressure on the dollar.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, dropped 0.07% at 94.01 by 3:44AM ET (7:44GMT).
A weak dollar usually supports gold prices, as it bolsters the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more attractive to holders of other currencies.

The catalyst for the spike was a unanimous decision by the European Central Bank not to change their guidance on monetary policy or discuss changes to an ongoing stimulus program for the time being. The dovish stance was not out of tune with the tone taken by the US federal Reserve.
The Gold futures for August delivery dropped very slightly by 0.07% to $1,244.57 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange by mid-morning in Asia but were still up more around $7 from a day earlier. At one point, gold rose as high as $1,247.48, the highest point in three weeks.

US Dollar Index futures, which track the greenback against a basket of six currencies, were up 0.05% to $94.61, with the dollar struggling to gain traction but halting a plunge that has taken it to 10-month lows. 
The plunge in the greenback was slowed down by expectations, fuelled last week by the testimoney of US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, that any monetary tightenting in the US would happen slowly and reports from China that suggested growth there is slightly ahead of target for the year.
Earlier this week, China released second quarter GDP growth with a gain of 1.7% that matched expectations and a year-on-year increase of 6.9% that came in slighltly higher than the expected 6.8%. At the same time, China reported industrial production gained 7.6% from a year earlier in June and retail sales rose 11% in June.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $46.91 per barrel, also down 1 cent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Seeking a more positive spin on U.S.-China economic talks viewed as ending in discord, China said on Thursday that the two sides agreed to ""active and effective measures"" to reduce global excess steel production capacity.
The statement issued a day after the talks by the Chinese embassy in Washington did not elaborate on the measures discussed by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong Shan on Wednesday.
""In this breakout session, the two sides focused their discussion on steel, aluminum and high-tech trade,"" the embassy said in a statement. ""The two sides had in-depth discussion on cutting excess steel production capacity in the world and agreed to active and effective measures to jointly address this global issue.""
A U.S. Commerce Department spokesman declined comment on the Chinese statement and referred Reuters to a joint statement from Ross and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Their statement did not mention steel and cited only one point of consensus, a ""shared objective"" to work toward reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China.
Late on Wednesday, a Trump administration official told Reuters that China had refused to agree to U.S. demands that it eliminate excess steel capacity and take other steps to open its economy for foreign firms.
The first annual economic summit between the Trump administration and their Chinese counterparts ended with canceled news conferences, no joint statement and no new transaction announcements.
The Chinese embassy statement also said China agreed to ""deepen its cooperation"" with the United States on expanding trade in services. The two sides also will start work on a one-year economic cooperation plan, determining an ""early harvest"" as soon as possible.
Before the latest Chinese statement, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced that China would allow imports of U.S. rice for the first time, agreeing to phytosanitary protocols.
TOUGHER STANCES
The rocky dialogue session in Washington was a sharp contrast to U.S. President Donald Trump's rosy first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at Trump's Mar-A-Lago, Florida estate in April.
Both sides found each other harder to deal with than expected, China trade experts said.
The Trump team's expectations that Beijing would agree to quick, substantial reforms to shrink the U.S. trade deficit and eliminate excess steelmaking capacity were dashed, while China found that further minor steps and vague action plans would no longer placate the U.S. side.
""There was a misalignment of expectations. The Americans pushed for deliverables, and the Chinese said no, everything is fine,"" said Scott Miller, an Asia trade expert at the Center for Strategic and Economic Studies in Washington. ""These are difficult issues that don't lend themselves toward easy boxes to check.""
Domestic politics contributed to both sides taking a tougher stance, said Eswar Prasad, a trade policy professor at Cornell University and former China division chief at the International Monetary Fund.
China faces a once-in-five-years Communist Party congress to set new leadership this autumn, while Trump is keen to hold to campaign promises to help ailing U.S. steel and coal industries and grow U.S. manufacturing jobs.
Prasad said that China found that the Trump administration is ""no pushover"" on trade and may need to offer bigger concessions to keep its relationship with its biggest trading partner on an even keel.

""The administration seems unwilling to settle for further symbolic, cosmetic victories in terms of access to China’s markets and is pressing for more specific and time-bound commitments from China about opening up its markets to U.S. exporters and investors,"" he added.

Investors remained uncertain as to whether Opec will introduce additional measures to curb the recent growth in supply, with a production cap for both Libya and Nigeria touted as a possible course of action.
In recent months both Libya and Nigeria, two countries exempt from the current output cuts, ramped up production, adding to the glut in supply, which has pressured prices for more than three years.
Some Opec members, however, appeared reluctant to introduce further measures to curb supply, insisting that it’s too early to determine whether the current level of production cuts need to be deepened.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Thursday in choppy U.S. trading, as nagging worries about abundant global crude supplies dragged prices lower after an early rally pushed Brent above $50 per barrel for the first time since early June. 
Traders predicted prices would hold near current levels ahead of Monday's meeting between key OPEC and non-OPEC producers in St. Petersburg, Russia. The market has been watching reports that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude producer, is considering an additional supply cut to bring markets into balance.
The Financial Times reported Wednesday that the Saudis were considering additional cuts, citing a consultant's report. On Tuesday, Reuters reported the country was committed to working with other countries to draw down stocks, taking into account the surprising increase in production from OPEC members Nigeria and Libya.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC allies, including Russia, agreed last year to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd); that deal has been extended to March 2018.

In early trade, both benchmarks rose to their highest since June 7, after rallying in the previous session on data showing U.S. crude and fuel inventories fell sharply last week. 
U.S. crude inventories  dropped by 4.7 million barrels in the week to July 14, according to the Energy Information Administration, more than forecast. 
Gasoline stocks fell by 4.7 million barrels, exceeding expectations, while distillate stocks also fell.
""I'm skeptical, after seeing many years of drawdowns in summer driving season,"" said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
""We're waiting to see if this is really what's going on or the normal seasonal drop-off.""
U.S. oil stocks, at roughly 490 million barrels, remain well above the five-year average, while U.S. production  has increased almost 12 percent since mid-2016 to 9.4 million bpd. 

Oil futures also fell in tandem with other risk markets in the mid-morning after Bloomberg reported that Robert Mueller, special counsel appointed to investigate allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible ties with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, was also looking into Trump's business transactions. Stock markets and the dollar dropped on that news before recovering somewhat.

That compared with a gain of 57 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 34 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 59 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.973 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 9.1% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 4.6% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, updated weather forecasting models pointed to increased summer demand in the coming weeks.
Hot high pressure over the western, central, and southern U.S. will strengthen and expand as the week progresses, eventually dominating almost the entire country besides the far northern U.S. with highs of upper 80s to 100s for strong national demand.
Longer-term models showed the western, central and southern U.S. will be hot with highs of upper 80s to 100s through August 1, due to strong high pressure.

Oil prices finished higher for the second session in a row on Wednesday, after data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a large drop in domestic crude and gasoline supplies.
U.S. oil inventories fell by 4.7 million barrels at the end of last week to 490.6 million barrels, more than the expected drop of around 3.2 million barrels.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories decreased by 4.4 million barrels, compared to expectations for a much more modest decline of 0.7 million barrels.
Despite recent gains, concerns over rising global supplies remained on investors' minds.
A ministerial committee from OPEC and non-OPEC countries, which is headed by Gulf OPEC member Kuwait, will meet in Russia on July 24 to discuss compliance with the cartel's deal to cut production.
In May, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended an agreement to slash 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018. So far, the agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria.

855,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2017 06:32AM ET</span>","Backing of workers, communities key to Libya's oil revival","By Aidan Lewis
SHARARA OIL FIELD, Libya (Reuters) - When the head of Libya's state energy company visited Sharara oil field in early July, community leaders and workers crowded into a conference room to ask about jobs, training and services for local people.
When, they asked, would their villages start to see the benefit of the country's rising oil production?
""You've been very patient,"" Mustafa Sanalla reassured them, before adding: ""You need to be patient a little longer.""
Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) raised output to more than one million barrels per day (bpd) at the end of June for the first time since 2013, a feat that seemed near impossible after the chaos that followed the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
The NOC did it by cajoling community leaders, shaming blockaders and navigating a bewildering range of tribal feuds as it reopened fields and patched up infrastructure.
But the comeback, crucial to Libya's survival, is fragile.
To keep it going, NOC chief Sanalla has to tour the country regularly, placating restive armed factions and local groups while at the same time tussling with the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli over budget and control over the oil sector.
Even if the NOC can continue to stop the port and field blockades that crippled Libya's production in recent years, its goal of pushing production to 1.25 million bpd later this year will be difficult to achieve.
Output is already wavering due to problems linked to long shutdowns and a lack of maintenance and investment.
Idled pipelines have corroded, thieves have stolen copper wiring at desert oil facilities. No new drilling has been done for three years and few foreign contractors have returned. Funds to replace and maintain infrastructure are badly needed.
""Unless we have the money, not only can we not increase production, we cannot sustain production,"" Sanalla told Reuters as he flew back from the visit to Sharara and another southwestern field called El Feel. ""Until now we haven't received one penny.""
Among the parties closely watching the situation is OPEC, which wants to bolster global oil prices. OPEC exempted members Libya and Nigeria from a deal to cut output that took effect in January, but the group is now considering if and when quickly rising production should be capped.
Sanalla will share his production plans at a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers in Russia on Saturday.
CONFLICT, SHUTDOWNS
Libya has the biggest proven oil reserves in Africa. Before the uprising that killed Gaddafi, it was pumping around 1.6 million bpd, much of it light, sweet crude shipped to Europe.
From 2013, however, shutdowns and fighting linked to a messy conflict that spread across the country brought the sector to its knees.
Militia leaders closed ports and pipelines, militants set storage tanks ablaze. Some oil facilities were plundered. Blockades were set up by armed groups demanding salary payments or seeking to cut off a source of government revenues.
A government set up in the east of the country tried, and failed, to sell its own oil through a parallel national oil company in Benghazi.
The NOC in Tripoli survived the conflicts relatively unscathed, emerging as perhaps the only major institution that could function effectively across the country.
Appointed NOC chairman in May 2014, Sanalla and his colleagues travel freely to meet people, unlike the country's politicians who are largely split between east and west and rarely venture beyond their base.
Last summer, with production languishing below 250,000 bpd, Sanalla began a campaign against the blockades, criss-crossing Libya's huge land mass in an eight-seat propeller plane.
""Since last July, for one year, I'm always moving - all the oil fields, all the tribes, all the blockaders. I sit down with all of them and explain the problem,"" said Sanalla, 56, a chemical engineer and former operations manager who has worked at the NOC for more than three decades. ""To solve the problems you need face-to-face dialogue.""
A big breakthrough came in September when Ibrahim Jathran, an armed group leader who had closed several key ports and whom Sanalla vocally denounced, lost control of the terminals to eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar.
Haftar, widely seen to harbor national ambitions, quickly allowed the NOC to reopen the ports and connected fields.
Three months later a two-year blockade on pipelines leading to Sharara and El Feel was lifted near the western town of Zintan, after months of NOC mediation with the factions involved. The fields now account for about of third of Libya's total output.
During Sanalla's visit to El Feel and Sharara, he warmly greeted employees, leaders of the local community and turbaned guards, pausing for selfies and handshakes before leading discussions over local conditions and requests for aid.
At Sharara, Sanalla handed over provisions for the nearby town of Ubari, including hundreds of beds and equipment for schools. A community leader at El Feel said he needed water pumps, petrol stations, football pitches and leisure parks.
Sanalla would not give details about exactly what he has had to promise in his various deals to reopen fields and pipelines. But he insists he has never offered payments.
""The issue is to explain to people today in two oil fields that we have a partnership with the stakeholders,"" Sanalla said. He said his message is ""production is very crucial to you as well, not just to us"".
RISKS
There are limits and risks to the NOC's strategy.
The Government of National Accord in Tripoli has failed to extend its authority or win over factions in the east since it started governing in March last year, meaning bigger political and security threats to Libya's production still loom.
Relations between the GNA and NOC have also soured over a contract dispute with German oil firm Wintershall, which has two concessions in the east. The NOC accused the government of using the dispute to extend its power over the oil sector and accused Wintershall of colluding with the GNA.
Sanalla says politicians need to stop competing for control of oil resources and give the NOC the budget it needs.
The GNA responds that even with oil output on the rise, funding is limited. According to the central bank, oil revenues are expected to reach 16.6 billion Libyan dinars ($11.4 billion) this year, still well short of the 21 billion dinars ($14.5 billion) needed for state salary payments alone.
Workers and locals remain restless, worn down by years sliding living standards. Even oil employees have trouble accessing salaries.
Sharara, where output is about 270,000 bpd, suffered brief closures when valves were switched off in March and April, and again when staff went on strike after a worker drowned in a swimming pool at the field in June.
El Feel, now pumping about 60,000 bpd, did not open until May because of a protest by guards, who in reality are militiamen with local loyalties.
Sanalla says the NOC is doing what it can for communities near oil facilities, but it takes time.
""We cannot substitute (for) a government,"" Sanalla said in an interview with Reuters in May. ""We cannot do everything."""

Comex gold futures were at $1,238.68 a troy ounce by 3:20AM ET (0720GMT), down $3.30, or around 0.3%. Gold prices finished a few cents higher on Wednesday, extending their streak of gains to a fourth session.
The ECB's latest interest rate decision is due at 1145GMT (7:45AM ET) on Thursday, with no big changes expected.
Most of the focus will be on President Mario Draghi's press conference 45 minutes after the announcement, as investors look for more clues on when and how the ECB could scale back its massive quantitative easing program.
Market experts believe the central bank is likely to wait until September before announcing a tapering of its 60 billion euros of monthly asset purchases.
Earlier in the session, the Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady as a two-day meeting concluded. The central bank also cut its inflation forecasts for fiscal years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019.
Besides central banks, investors will focus on U.S. data due later in the session to gauge the strength of the world's largest economy and how it will impact the Fed's view on monetary policy.
Weekly jobless claims and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey are both due at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT).
Gold prices have been well-supported in recent sessions amid fading expectations for another rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year.
Futures traders are pricing in less than a 40% chance of a rate hike by December, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, as recent dovish comments from Chair Janet Yellen and soft inflation data raised doubts over whether policymakers will be able to stick to their planned tightening path.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

Gold futures for August delivery dropped 0.28% to USD1,238.48 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange by mid-morning in Asia.
Other commodities fared better. Oil was up from a day ealier after reports that US crude inventories dropped more than expected. Copper futures on the Comex were up 0.22% to $2.713 a pound. 
Gold prices have lost some upward traction as the US dollar halted a plunge but stayed aroune 10-month lows. The plunge was slowed down by expectations, fuelled last week by the testimoney of US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, that any monetary tightenting in the US would happen slowly and reports from China that suggested growth there is slightly ahead of target for the year. 
Earlier this week, China released second quarter GDP growth with a gain of 1.7% that matched expectations and a year-on-year increase of 6.9% that came in slighltly higher than the expected 6.8%.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for August delivery rose by 1.6% to settle at $47.12 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 1.82% to trade at $49.73 a barrel.
Crude prices settled higher for a second-straight day, after a report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed crude and gasoline stockpiles fell by more than expected last week, pointing to an uptick in demand for crude and oil products.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 4.7m barrels in the week ended July 14, confounding expectations  of a draw of about only 3.2m barrels. It was third-straight week of falling crude inventories.
Gasoline inventories, one of the products that crude is refined into, fell by roughly 4.5m barrels against expectations of a draw of 655,000 barrels while distillate stockpiles unexpectedly fell by 2.1m barrels, compared to expectations of a rise of 1.2m barrels.
Despite the better-than-expected drawdown, both products’ inventories remain in the upper half of the average range for the time of year, the EIA said.
Earlier this month, the EIA said U.S. production rose to 9.43m barrels per day, its highest since July 2017, adding to the current output glut amid efforts from Opec to rein in excess supply, which has pressured prices over the past three years.
A report on Tuesday, suggesting that Saudi Arabia is considering cutting crude exports by up 1 million barrels a day to offset a rise in output from Libya and Nigera, drew praise from analysts, who suggested that the export cuts signal real intent to curb excess supply.
Saudi Arabia’s reported “efforts to rebalance the rise in Libyan and Nigerian supplies by reducing output by 1 [million barrels] a day is an admirable approach,” said Adrienne Murphy, chief market analyst at AvaTrade. “The cartel would ensure investors that they will do ‘whatever it takes’ to revitalize the market, instead of the ‘just about enough’ approach they took ... when they simply extended supply curbs.”
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8m bpd for a period of nine months until March, but allowed Nigeria and Libya to remained exempt from the cuts."

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $0.88, or 0.01%, to $1,241.86 a troy ounce.
Gold gave up some its recent gains after soaring as much as 2% in the previous session, as the dollar bounced off lows, following the release of better than expected housing data indicating a possible turnaround in U.S. homebuilding.
Housing starts jumped 8.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.22 million units, the highest level since February, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.
Economists had forecast activity rising to a rate of 5.8%.
The better-than-expected data underpinned a move higher in the dollar, reducing investor appetite for the precious metal. 
Dollar-denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar – A dip in the dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency and thus, increases demand.
An update on monetary policy from both the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank (ECB) due Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, also weighed on upside momentum in gold prices, amid expectations that the ECB is moving closer towards tapering its ultra-accommodative monetary policy. 
Analysts expect that dollar weakness will continue to be the main driver of gold prices, however, pointed to tighter monetary policy and low inflation as potential headwinds. 
“We anticipate moderately higher gold prices this year and in 2018 based mostly on USD weakness, but expect tighter monetary policies and low inflation globally to create headwinds to rallies, a stop-and-go path,” James Steel, Chief Precious Metals Analyst at HSBC said.

Oil prices finished higher on Tuesday, boosted by speculation of possible output curbs in Libya after the head of Libya's National Oil Corporation said he plans to attend a meeting of global crude producers in Russia on July 22 to share his country's production plans.
In May, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018. So far, the agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil markets steadied on Tuesday, supported by firm demand but weighed down by high supplies from OPEC and producers in the United States. 
Benchmark Brent crude was down 10 cents at $48.32 a barrel by 0720 GMT. U.S. light crude oil was 10 cents lower at $45.92.
""We're stuck in a range that, I think, will be tough to break out of without some kind of political factor coming into play,"" said Matt Stanley, fuel broker at Freight Investor Services.
In a sign of strong demand, data on Monday showed refineries in China increased crude throughput in June to the second highest on record.
But many markets are well supplied and oil for prompt delivery is trading at heavy discounts to forward futures in several parts of the world. As a result, crude oil prices are trading at only around half the levels seen three years ago.
A deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with Russia and other non-OPEC producers to cut supplies by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) between January this year and March 2018 has so far failed to tighten the market or push up prices.
Although many OPEC countries have restricted production, others including Nigeria and Libya have been allowed to increase output.
Ecuador, a small producer within OPEC, said on Tuesday it was not cutting its production by 26,000 bpd as agreed due to the country's fiscal deficit, which is expected to hit 7.5 percent of gross domestic product this year.
Oil Minister Carlos Perez said Ecuador was cutting only 60 percent of that figure, putting current output at 545,000 bpd.
""We are not meeting the quota imposed on us because of the obvious needs the country has,"" Perez said.

A 2016 deal that allowed Canadian farmers to sell milk proteins to domestic processors at a discount, curbing the flow of American imports, further raised their ire.
Jaime Castaneda, senior vice-president for the U.S. Dairy Export Council, said the influential lobby group will pursue fresh challenges through the World Trade Organization unless Canada stops the proteins sale. 
""If we can't resolve this through negotiations, I believe my members will be very clear that everything is on the table,"" he said in a phone interview.
A WTO panel ruled in 2002 that Canada breached its trade obligations through illegal subsidies to its dairy industry, siding with the United States. The U.S. and Canada reached a settlement in 2003.
Castaneda said challenges against the protein sales could eventually result in rulings that force Canada to ditch supply management.
In June, U.S. agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue said he would prefer to address dairy irritants before NAFTA talks begin and said supply management was fine as long as though it did not harm the U.S. industry.
But on July 14 he appeared to toughen his stance, saying through a spokeswoman he felt ""all options should be on the table"" in the NAFTA talks and that dairy remained a concern.
Although dairy was originally excluded from the original 1994 deal, the United States may push for it to be part of the talks on a new pact.
""I don't see why it wouldn't be, when you're looking at an overall trading relationship ... there is no doubt in my mind that it would be on the table,"" said one person familiar with Washington's approach.
Despite the more strident U.S. line, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has little interest in compromise.
""We are fully trade compliant and trade in dairy products massively favors the United States,"" said a Canadian government source. 
Canada's dairy sector includes C$6 billion ($4.8 billion) in annual farmer milk sales. 
Fearing the domestic industry's lobbying muscle, Canadian politicians of all stripes mostly treat dairy as a sacred cow.
In May, dairy farmers helped ensure the defeat of a Conservative party leader candidate who advocated eliminating supply management.
""Dairy farmers are a force to be reckoned with. I think (politicians) will do well to listen to our concerns,"" said Manitoba dairy farmer David Wiens, an executive of the influential Dairy Farmers of Canada. 
Dairy is one of several commodities, including lumber and wine, that have sparked complaints by the Trump administration leading into NAFTA talks. U.S. President Donald Trump said in April he would stand up for domestic dairy farmers against what he called unfair Canadian practices.
The American side also wants Canada to start cutting tariffs to allow more imports. As part of the talks on a proposed 12-nation Pacific trade treaty in 2015, Canada agreed to open up 3.25 percent annually of its dairy supply.
That treaty was still-born and any talk of concessions is now off the table.

""The industry is not prepared to give any additional access to the Canadian market,"" said Yves Leduc, head of government relations at the Dairy Farmers of Canada lobby group.

890,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 17, 2017 09:32AM ET</span>",There's only one way for the US to reach energy independence,"Achieving energy independence in the US is one environmental issue Democrats and Republicans  can agree on.
It's easy to see why we should produce our own energy — relying on other countries for oil, natural gas, and coal (the biggest sources used today) can get complicated. It can lead to wars, or compromise our relationships with foreign powers.
President Trump is focusing not just on energy independence, but what he calls ""energy dominance,"" vowing to ""unleash"" American natural gas and coal exports on the world.
The rise of fracking has unlocked vast natural gas reserves, allowing the US to import less natural gas in 2016 than in any year since the US Energy Information Administration started keeping track in 1973. Gas imports, most of which arrive in pipelines from Canada and Mexico, peaked in 2007 at 3.8 trillion cubic feet. But after fracking became popular, imports plummeted to 671 billion cubic feet last year.
Fossil fuels will eventually run out around the world, however. Experts estimate that the US only has enough natural gas reserves to last 93 more years, and enough coal to last about 283 years.
Putting politics aside, there is only one surefire way to be completely and indefinitely energy independent: adopt 100% renewable energy.
The US will always have its wind, sunlight, and water.
In 2016, energy produced from harnessing these renewables only made up  15% of the electricity generated in the United States. Hydropower was responsible for 6.5% of that, while wind made up 5.6%, and solar represented a scant 0.9%.
They're on the rise, though. The world added more energy from renewable sources than from fossil fuels in 2015 and 2016 — because they finally became cost effective. The plummeting price of clean energy has allowed the US to decrease its carbon emissions over the last three years while the country's GDP has increased.
Some countries are already pursuing this fossil fuel-free strategy.  Costa Rica powered its small Central American nation on  98.1% renewables in 2016. It will take more time for a massive country like the US to achieve that, but Costa Rica has demonstrated that it can be done.
True energy independence can only be unlocked when America wholeheartedly embraces renewables. The good news is that we're on our way. The question now is, ""When?"""

U.S. natural gas for August delivery was at $3.010 per million British thermal units by 8:50AM ET (1250GMT), up 3.0 cents, or around 1%.
Prices saw a gain of roughly 4% last week amid bullish weather forecasts.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer cooling demand.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for cooling.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.945 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 8.9% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 5.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 27 and 38 billion cubic feet in the week ended July 14.
That compares with a gain of 57 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 34 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 59 billion cubic feet.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil edged up to around $49 a barrel on Monday as a slowdown in the increase of rigs drilling in the United States eased concern that surging shale supplies will undermine OPEC-led cuts.
U.S. drillers added two oil rigs in the week to July 14, bringing the total to 765,  Baker Hughes  (N:BHGE) said on Friday.  Rig additions over the past four weeks averaged five, the lowest since November.
""The slowing pace of increases combined with massive drawdowns last week on both official crude inventory numbers from the U.S. probably explains the positive sentiment in general at the moment,"" said Jeffrey Halley at brokerage OANDA.
Brent crude (LCOc1), the global benchmark, was up 7 cents at $48.98 a barrel by 1051 GMT. U.S. crude (CLc1) traded at $46.55, up 1 cent.
Oil prices are less than half their mid-2014 level because of a persistent glut, even after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, plus Russia and other non-members started a supply-cutting pact in January.
U.S. crude oil inventories in the week to July 7, the most recent, dropped the most in 10 months, raising expectations that a long-awaited market rebalancing is under way.
While the OPEC-led cuts have offered prices some support, rising supplies from Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC members exempt from the pact, have weighed on the market, as has growth in U.S. shale production.
Kuwait said on Friday the market was on a recovery track due to rising demand and that it was premature to cap Nigerian and Libyan output. An OPEC and non-OPEC committee meets in Russia on July 24 to discuss the impact of the deal.
In a sign of strong demand, data on Monday showed refineries in China increased crude throughput in June to the second highest on record. OPEC is hoping higher demand in the second half will get rid of excess inventories.

898,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2017 02:50AM ET</span>",North Korea fuel prices surge after China cuts oil sales,"By Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - Gasoline and diesel prices surged in North Korea in the weeks after a Chinese state oil company suspended fuel sales to the reclusive state, according to data reviewed by Reuters and an interview with a North Korean defector.
China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), a state-controlled company, halted diesel and gasoline sales to North Korea ""over the last month or two"", amid international pressure on Pyongyang to curb its nuclear and missile programs, Reuters exclusively reported on June 28.
Scrutiny of China's commercial ties with its isolated neighbor intensified further following North Korea's first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile two weeks ago.
The price of gasoline sold by private dealers in Pyongyang and the northern border cities of Sinuiju and Hyesan jumped to $2.18 per kg ($2.92 per liter) as of July 5, up 50 percent from $1.46 per kg on June 21, according to Reuters analysis of data collected by the Daily NK website.
Daily NK is run by North Korean defectors who collect prices via phone calls with fuel traders in the North.
Kang Mi-jin, a defector who speaks regularly to market sources inside North Korea and reports commodity prices for Daily NK, said the price spikes in recent weeks were caused initially by the rumors - later confirmed - that China was restricting the flow of oil to North Korea.
North Korea gets most of its fuel from China, with some coming from Russia. A prolonged cut by China would threaten critical supplies of gasoline and diesel and force North Korea to find alternatives sources of refined fuel products.
""After North Korea's frequent missile tests including its very first ICBM test, the international community has vowed to tighten sanctions and China simply cannot exclude itself from the recent movement, although it probably does not want to indefinitely cut off fuel sales to the North,"" Kang said.
Although gasoline prices eased to $2.05 per kg by July 12, they are still more than double from the beginning of the year, when they were averaging just under $1 per kg, the data shows.
Diesel prices rose to $1.45 per kg as of July 12, up 20 percent from three weeks ago. Oil products are sold by weight in North Korea.
Prices stabilized after the sharp spikes through the first week of July, likely because North Korea encouraged fuel smuggling across its border with China, Kang said.
Last year, China shipped to North Korea more than 96,000 tonnes of gasoline and nearly 45,000 tonnes of diesel, worth a combined $64 million.
Most of that was sold by CNPC, which grew to dominate China's energy trade with Pyongyang over the past two decades.
CNPC declined to comment on Monday when asked by Reuters if fuel sales to North Korea had resumed.
The government is likely North Korea's largest user of fuel products, but most gasoline and diesel bought by ordinary citizens comes from private dealers and smugglers, experts say.
Primary users of fuel products in North Korea include fishermen, farmers, truckers and the military.

BEIJING/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - China churned out record amounts of steel and aluminum in June as producers rushed to cash-in on rallying prices in the wake of a drive by Beijing to crack down on output of low-grade metal.
That could fuel concerns the world's top steel producer will export more metal, stoking global oversupply and fanning tensions with the United States after it accused the nation of flooding international markets with cheap aluminum and steel.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to use a Cold War-era law to restrict imports for national security reasons as bilateral talks between Washington and Beijing continue.
China has long-denied that it has been offloading metals abroad at the expense of foreign producers.
Chinese steel output last month rose 5.7 percent from the year before to a record 73.23 million tonnes, surpassing April's all-time high of 72.78 million tonnes, data from the National Statistics Bureau showed on Monday.
Aluminum production jumped 7.4 percent year-on-year to 2.93 million tonnes, exceeding December's record of 2.89 million tonnes.
Export data last week showed steel products shipments fell last month, while aluminum sales abroad were steady.
But analysts said the latest numbers should not be seen as provocative move ahead of a decision by the United States on possible import tariffs.
""It's wrong to think that this is some sort of unified, homogenous voice that is deliberately making some provocative statement to the U.S,"" said Paul Adkins, managing director of aluminum consultancy AZ China.
""That couldn't be further from the truth. What we're really seeing, if anything, is ... a lack of a coordinated response (from Chinese producers).""
Analysts said the increases came as local steel and aluminum prices rose after the government cut back on metals producing capacity earlier in the year as it battles a glut in supply and looks to clamp down on pollution.
""The reason that prices were higher in the first place was the expectation of Chinese cutting back supply of aluminum and steel, yet that is what is inducing its high utilization rates,"" said Mark Pervan, chief economist at AME Group in Sydney.
Steel rebar margins were almost 1,000 yuan ($147.77) per tonne in June, enticing mills to increase output, said Bai Jing, analyst at Galaxy Futures.
""China's crackdown on low-end steel has left a capacity gap in the market,"" she said.
In the first half of the year, China eliminated around 120 million tonnes of low-end steel capacity. By May, the country had fulfilled nearly 85 percent, or 42.4 million tonnes, of its 2016 steel capacity cutting target.
The data came as better-than-expected GDP numbers brightened demand prospects for metals and spurred gains in prices, with steel rebar rising 2 percent.

Last week, oil prices settled higher for the fifth session in a row on Friday, to score a weekly gain of roughly 5% as investors cheered data suggesting that demand for oil will pick up during the second half of 2017.
Reports of accelerating demand growth from the International Energy Agency, crude oil import growth in China and falling crude stocks in the U.S. aided sentiment.
Despite recent gains, concerns over rising global supplies remained on investors' minds.
U.S. drillers added two oil rigs in the week to July 14, energy services company Baker Hughes announced on Friday. This brings the total count up to 765, the most since April 2015, underlining concern that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production is derailing efforts by other major producers to rebalance the market.
In May, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria.

Gold futures for August delivery ended up 0.95% at $1,228.88 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange after rising as high as $1,232.7 earlier, the most since July 3.
The precious metal ended the week with gains of 1.32%.
U.S. consumer price inflation slowed to 1.6% in June from 1.9% in May, the Labor Department said on Friday.
Consumer spending was also weaker than expected, with retail sales falling 0.2% in June, compared to expectations of a 0.1% rise.
The Fed hiked rates at its June meeting and stuck to its forecast for one more rate hike this year but the sluggish inflation outlook has raised questions over whether officials will be able to stick to their planned tightening path.
In testimony before Congress on Wednesday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said the economy is on a strong enough footing for the Fed to raise rates, but she also reiterated that inflation is below target and noted that it is a particular “uncertainty” that could affect monetary policy.
Expectations that rates will stay low tend to boost gold, which struggles to compete with yield-bearing investments when borrowing costs rise.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.69% to 94.9 late Friday, its lowest trough since October 5.

906,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2017 03:24PM ET</span>","Oil up 1 percent, 5 percent on the week","By Julia Simon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose 1 percent on Friday, boosted by lower U.S. stockpiles, a slight slowdown in U.S. crude production and signs of increased Chinese demand, but trading was volatile as global supply remained strong.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1), the international benchmark for oil, settled up 49 cents, or 1.01 percent, at $48.91 per barrel.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) settled up 46 cents, or 1 percent, at $46.54 per barrel.
Crude oil contracts were on track for weekly gains of more than 5.2 percent for U.S. WTI and more than 4.7 percent for Benchmark Brent.
""I think the big driver is inventory numbers,"" said Stewart Glickman, head of energy research at CFRA Research in New York, ""We've finally broken below 500 million barrels, I feel like it's a psychological barrier.""
U.S. crude inventories fell 7.6 million barrels last week, its biggest weekly plunge in 10 months, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday.
And while U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a second week in a row according to Friday data from Baker Hughes, the pace of additions has slowed to its lowest this year.
Oil production in North Dakota fell 10,000 barrels-per-day in May.
Still, oil stocks remained comfortably above the five-year average, and prices were more than 15 percent below their 2017 highs.
Moreover, output cuts from producing countries coordinated by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have been stymied by rising output from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt. June compliance among other members also fell to just 78 percent, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
Kuwait's OPEC governor told Reuters in an interview that it would be premature to cap Nigerian and Libyan oil production.
Brent and WTI prices were roughly 5 percent above the week's lows, aided by reports of accelerating demand growth from the IEA, crude oil import growth in China and falling crude stocks in the United States.
China's crude oil imports over the first six months of 2017 were 13.8 percent above the year-ago period, customs data showed. Asian traders are selling oil products out of tanks to meet soaring demand, while the EIA reported the largest drop in U.S. crude oil inventories in the week to last week in 10 months.

Analysts at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said a reduction in the developed world's oil stocks was likely to continue as long as OPEC did not further significantly increase its output.

Oil prices capped a week of steady gains on Friday, as investors continued cheer data this week suggesting that demand for oil will pick up during the second half of 2017.
On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration released its weekly inventories report showing U.S. crude stockpiles fell by a bigger-than-expected 7.6m barrels for week ended July 7.
Sentiment on oil was further boosted on Thursday, when the International Energy Agency revised up its oil demand forecast from the previous month, noting that stronger consumption in the second half of year could offset the glut in supply.
The IEA’s report, however, also showed an increase in Saudi Arabian oil output, despite the current accord in place to curb production.
Saudi Arabia has increased its flows, the IEA said, as well as Libya and Nigeria who are not part of the production freeze.
Meanwhile, investors received the latest U.S. rig count data from Baker Hughes on Friday, showing an uptick in number of active U.S. oil rigs to 765, up by 2 from the previous week.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $10.52, or 0.86%, to $1,227.83 a troy ounce.
Fresh U.S. economic jitters resurfaced Friday, following the release of inflation and retail sales data that undershot economists’ forecasts, reducing investor expectations about future rate increases.
The  rate of inflation over the past 12 months slowed to 1.6% in June from 1.9% in the prior month, and it is down from a five-year high of 2.7% just five months ago.

In a separate report the Depart of Commerce said retail sales dipped by 0.2% in June, missing  economists’ forecasts of a 0.2% increase.
It was the second-straight month of timid retail sales activity.
The timid inflation report comes amid fears that a slowdown inflation could weigh on the Federal Reserve’s ability to hike rates after Fed chair Janet Yellen, earlier this week, said future rate increases would be gradual.
Both the dollar and U.S. 10-Year dipped to lows, lifting investor sentiment for gold, which remained on track to snap a five-week losing streak.

909,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2017 10:10AM ET</span>","Kuwait says premature for OPEC to cap Libya, Nigeria oil output","By Rania El Gamal
DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC member Kuwait said on Friday it would be premature to cap Nigerian and Libyan oil production as the two African countries' output needed to stabilize further.
The market is on a recovery track due to rising global demand, Kuwait's OPEC governor Haitham Al-Ghais told Reuters.
In an effort to eradicate a supply glut, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is curbing output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018, while Russia and other non-OPEC producers are cutting half as much.
But oil prices have fallen more than 15 percent this year due to still-booming supplies and stubbornly high global stocks, which remain way above OPEC targets despite the cut agreement.
A ministerial committee from OPEC and non-OPEC countries, which is headed by Gulf OPEC member Kuwait, meets in Russia on July 24 to discuss compliance with the cuts, from which Nigeria and Libya are exempt due to years of output-sapping unrest.
""All this talk about putting a production cap on Libya and Nigeria is premature,"" Al-Ghais said. ""Data so far is showing that the real spike in production only happened in June."" 
The official added that output had increased on average by between 300,000 and 500,000 bpd from the two countries combined since the start of the supply-cutting agreement in January 2017.
He said representatives from Libya and Nigeria had been invited to a technical OPEC/non-OPEC committee meeting on July 22 ahead of the ministerial gathering, to give presentations on production from both countries.
""We have to look at the sustainability and stability of production from those countries,"" said Al-Ghais, who also heads the technical committee. ""We need to wait and see more production data before we can make any decision.""
The technical committee could make recommendations on Nigeria and Libya, which the ministerial committee would then review. The latter cannot take production decisions but can make recommendations to OPEC and other participating producers, which are scheduled to meet formally in November.
Al-Ghais said that despite production increases from Libya and Nigeria, there were signs of market rebalancing including U.S. government data showing a large drop in stockpiles.
""We feel that the market is on the right way of correcting itself,"" he said. ""Demand will pick up and we expect to see stronger demand in the third quarter.""

910,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2017 09:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: ICE selected to run LBMA silver auction,"By Jan Harvey and Peter Hobson
LONDON (Reuters) - ICE Benchmark Administration, a unit of Intercontinental Exchange, was confirmed on Friday as the new operator of the London Bullion Market Association silver benchmark.
The LBMA said it expected IBA to take over the LBMA Silver Price in autumn this year, confirming a Reuters report.
A race to provide the auction process that sets the benchmark, for which the LBMA owns the intellectual property rights, narrowed to two potential providers, ICE and the London Metal Exchange, earlier this year. 
ICE is the operator of the LBMA Gold Price benchmark, which is set via an electronic auction. The exchange introduced clearing of business transacted during the auction in April.
For silver, ICE offered a model with clearing, while the LME proposed a flexible auction process.
""Our centrally cleared model has already enabled broader participation and we continue to expand the gold auction. We anticipate this will support expanded participation in silver as well,"" IBA President Finbarr Hutcheson said in a statement. 
Ross Norman, chief executive of bullion dealer Sharps Pixley, described IBA as ""a solid and safe choice"".
""They've demonstrated that they can manage the job well,"" Norman said.
The LBMA said in March that the current incumbents, CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) and Thomson Reuters, were stepping down from providing the auction process less than three years after they successfully bid to provide it. 
The benchmark is used by silver producers and consumers globally to price contracts.
Its previous incarnation, the 117-year-old London silver ""fix"", ended in 2014 after its operators said they would stop running the telephone-based auction. 
The new electronic benchmark has been plagued in the past by big swings away from the underlying spot price, which traders have attributed to a lack of liquidity and an unwillingness on the part of the banks taking part in the auction to adjust orders once the process has started.

The gold benchmark also experienced large, unpredictable fluctuations after some banks left the auction in April following the introduction of clearing.

912,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2017 06:05AM ET</span>",Bullish oil funds lead hedge fund losers at half-year mark,"By Maiya Keidan and Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - Many of last year's most successful oil market bulls have seen their winnings dissolve in the first half of this year, as the crude price has wallowed below $50 a barrel despite output cuts by some of the world's largest producers.
Three of the top five worst-performing hedge funds in the first half of the year specialize in trading oil, directly or indirectly, according to a list compiled by HSBC. Two of those had led the performance charts in 2016.
""The majority of funds came into the year with a bullish view driven by supply/demand fundamentals,"" said Fred Ingham, who invests in hedge funds at Neuberger Berman, adding that the price had fallen since due partly to a focus on U.S. production.
The oil market has been struggling to absorb a surplus of unused crude but when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 partners agreed late last year to cut output for the first time in eight years, bulls pushed the price up to a one-year high above $50 a barrel.
But as this year has worn on, OPEC's failure to erase a multi-million-barrel overhang and shale oil's dominance have become apparent, stripping 15 percent off the crude price.
Among the biggest casualties so far is the oil equities-focused AlphaGen Elnath Fund, part of Janus Henderson Investors-owned AlphaGen Capital, which ended 2016 as the best-performing fund with gains of 78 percent, the HSBC data showed.
Six months on, however, and it is now the worst performer, nursing losses of 48 percent.
The firm did not respond to requests for comment but Elnath fund manager Mark Gordon told Reuters last summer he thought the oil price had fallen too far and the market had no spare capacity globally. 
""I think the oil price will continue to go up because production globally is falling and that is not sustainable,"" he said.
Another to call the oil price wrongly in the first half of the year is high-profile trader Pierre Andurand, who shot to fame with his correct prediction on the slide in crude from record highs in 2008.
His Andurand Commodities Fund lost 17 percent between January and June, giving back almost all of 2016's 22 percent gains. David Knott's Dorset Energy Fund lost 42 percent this year, having pocketed 66 percent last year. 
""Losses in oil have been sizeable this year for specialists like Andurand,"" said one hedge fund investor, leading most to reduce their positions aggressively even though they remained bullish.
U.S. hedge fund firm Elm Ridge Capital Partners, meanwhile, lost 23.67 percent year-to-date after gains of 25.5 percent in 2016. 
A spokesman for Andurand declined to comment. Dorset and Elm Ridge did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Many so-called ""macro"" hedge funds, which bet more generally on macroeconomic trends, also lost money from oil over the past six months, said Philippe Ferreira, head of hedge funds research at Lyxor Asset Management.
""Most ... multi-asset macro funds we track have lost money on oil so far this year because of bullish positions.""
Among the losers so far is Conquest Capital Group's Star Fund, which has a roughly 10 percent exposure to energy. It had lost 3.1 percent in the six months to June 30 after gains of 17.1 percent last year, an investor letter showed.

The average macro hedge fund is down 0.8 percent in the first six months of 2017, data from industry tracker Hedge Fund Research showed, compared with returns of 3.68 percent for the average hedge fund.

913,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 14, 2017 05:55AM ET</span>",Top 5 things to know in the market on Friday,"Investing.com - Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday, July 14:
1. Bank earnings in spotlight as Q2 earnings season kicks off
The “unofficial” start of the second quarter (Q2) earnings season will begin on Friday with JP Morgan’s (NYSE:JPM) report scheduled for approximately 7:00AM ET (11:00GMT).
With only 26 of the S&P 500 firms having reported so far, the JP Morgan will be the first Dow component to release earnings on Friday in what will be a big day for bank shares.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) will also step up to the plate ahead of the open with their own earnings releases at approximately 8:00AM ET (12:00GMT).
2. Inflation data not expected to remove Fed’s cautious stance
Remarks from Federal Reserve (Fed) chair Janet Yellen in her testimony to Congress this week suggested that the central bank still planned on tightening monetary policy only gradually over concerns about readings of subdued inflation.
June inflation figures will be released at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT) Friday. Market analysts expect consumer prices to ease up 0.1%, while core inflation is forecast to increase 0.2%.
On a yearly base, core CPI is projected to climb 1.7%. Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.
Rising inflation would be a catalyst to push the Fed toward raising interest rates.
Markets remain skeptical that the central bank will undertake a further hike this year, putting the odds at only around 41%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
3. Consumer data in focus
Market participants will also keep a close eye on consumer data on Friday as spending represents roughly 70% of the U.S. economy.
The Commerce Department will publish data on June retail sales alongside the inflation figures at 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT). The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0.1% last month. Core sales are forecast to inch up 0.2%.
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth, while weaker sales signal a declining economy
Then at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT), the University of Michigan will release its preliminary reading of consumer sentiment for July.
4. Global stocks tread water near record highs
Global stocks treaded water on Friday, holding near record highs and capping their best week in over two months with bets on a gradual Fed rate hike path and hopes for a strong earnings season boosting risk appetite.
U.S. stock futures pointed to a slightly lower open on Wall Street as market players were cautious ahead of bank earnings and a slew of data. At 5:50AM ET (9:50GMT), the blue-chip Dow futures slipped 0.05%, S&P 500 futures lost 0.10% while the Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.06%.
European shares were poised for their best week since late April, though investors showed caution ahead of key references. At 5:52AM ET (9:52GMT), the European benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 inched up 0.04% while Germany’s DAX slipped 0.09%. London's FTSE 100 led decliners among major stock market indices, falling around 0.3% as a stronger pound put pressure on exporters and investors opted to take profit at the end of a positive week.
Earlier, Asian stocks also showed muted trade with Japan’s Nikkei ending up just 0.09% and China’s Shanghai Composite closing 0.13% higher.
5. Oil on track for weekly gains of 5%
Oil continued its rally for a fifth straight day on Friday, heading for weekly gains of nearly 5%.
Supporting bullish sentiment in crude this week, U.S. crude inventories registered a larger-than-expected draw and investors cheered data pointing to an increase in demand for oil from China as imports increased 13.8% to 8.55m bpd during the first six months of the year, compared to the same period a year ago.
That outweighed the bearish news that OPEC compliance on the agreement to extend production cuts with non-OPEC members led by Russia by 1.8 million barrels per day through March 2018 hit 78%, its lowest level in six months.
U.S. crude oil futures gained 0.56% to $46.34 at 5:54AM ET (9:54GMT), while Brent oil traded up 0.58% to $48.70.
Market participants will keep an eye on increasing U.S. shale production when Baker Hughes releases its most recent weekly rig count data later on Friday.

Gold has fallen on the back expectations that the U.S. central would continue raising its key benchmark rate, decreasing investor demand for gold, as a rising interest environment increases the opportunity cost of holding the non-interest bearing precious metal.
Still ahead on the economic calendar, June inflation figures will be released at 8:30AM ET (1230GMT) Friday. Market analysts expect consumer prices to ease up 0.1%, while core inflation is forecast to increase 0.2%.
On a yearly base, core CPI is projected to climb 1.7%. Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.
Rising inflation would be a catalyst to push the Fed toward raising interest rates.
At the same time Friday, the Commerce Department will publish data on June retail sales. The consensus forecast is that the report will show retail sales rose 0.1% last month. Core sales are forecast to inch up 0.2%.
Rising retail sales over time correlate with stronger economic growth, while weaker sales signal a declining economy. Consumer spending accounts for as much as 70% of U.S. economic growth.
Investors will also watch industrial production for June, as well as the preliminary Michigan consumer sentiment for July.
The greenback edged down Friday, showing caution ahead of the data dump. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, dropped 0.09% at 95.47 by 4:00AM ET (8:00GMT).
Elsewhere in metals trading, silver was down 0.46% at $15.619 a troy ounce.
Platinum inched up 0.03% at $907.40 a troy ounce, while palladium gained 0.20% to $856.42 a troy ounce. Copper rose 0.24% to $2.668 a pound."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With talks to renegotiate the NAFTA trade pact just weeks away, U.S. farm groups and lawmakers from rural states are intensifying lobbying of President Donald Trump's administration with one central message: leave farming out of it. 
Trump blames the North American Free Trade Agreement - the ""worst trade deal ever"" in his words - for millions of lost manufacturing jobs and promises to tilt it in America's favor.
But for U.S. farmers the 23-year old pact secures access to stable, lucrative markets in Mexico and Canada that now account for over a quarter of U.S. farm exports. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2tNMtlc)
Now they fear this access could become a bargaining chip in efforts to get a better deal for U.S. manufacturers.
""Perhaps some other sectors of our economy are given better terms and in exchange for that agriculture tariffs would be reintroduced,"" said Joe Schuele, a spokesman for the U.S. Meat Export Federation in Denver, Colorado.
Another concern is that the mere uncertainty of open-ended trade talks could drive Mexico to alternative suppliers of grains, dairy products, beef and pork.
Mexico became even more crucial after Trump's pullout from a vast Pacific Rim trade pact negotiated under Barack Obama dashed farmers' hopes of free access to more markets. 
Next week, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is due to outline the administration's goals for the NAFTA talks to Congress and the farm lobby has turned up the heat in the past weeks to ensure that its interests will make Lighthizer's list.
Operating under the umbrella of the U.S. Food and Agriculture Dialogue for Trade, more than 130 commodity groups and agribusiness giants since Trump's inauguration have been bombarding the new administration with phone calls and letters, public comments to USTR and face-to-face meetings with top officials who have Trump's ear.
""Our first ask is to do no harm,"" said Cassandra Kuball, the head of the umbrella group.
Lobbyists said that Lighthizer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have been receptive, but the wild card is how Trump ultimately will come down on the talks. They also wonder what concessions Mexico will seek from Washington in the talks due to start in mid-August.
Among the groups involved are the American Soybean Association, Corn Refiners Association and National Grain and Feed Association and firms such as Land O'Lakes, Inc.,  Tyson Foods  (N:TSN), Inc., Louis Dreyfus Company North America, Archer Daniels Midland Co. and others.
For example, U.S. cotton producers, marketers and shippers in mid-June warned the Trump administration that any weakening of NAFTA ""would threaten the health of the U.S. industry and the jobs of the 125,000 Americans employed by it.""
QUADRUPLING EXPORTS
Annual U.S. farm exports to Mexico have grown from about $4 billion in 1994, when NAFTA began, to an estimated $18.5 billion this year. With Canada included, that number is forecast to reach $40 billion, quadrupling under NAFTA.
Republican lawmakers from rural states that have backed Trump in the 2016 election have sought to leverage their political clout to press farmers' case at a time when they struggle with low crop prices.
Pat Roberts, Republican senator from Kansas, who chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee, said he used an unexpected invitation for a private White House meeting with Trump to plug in agriculture's cause in NAFTA and beyond.
""He (Trump) wanted to know what was happening in farmland,"" Roberts said. ""I told him we went through a very rough patch and if we did not have a strong, robust, predictable trade policy, it's going to make life much more difficult in farm country,"" Roberts said of the 45-minute meeting in late June.
In May, 18 Republican senators, mainly from pro-Trump farming states, wrote the administration about the ""tremendous growth"" in U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada as a result of NAFTA.
""Efforts to abandon the agreement or impose unnecessary restrictions on trade with our North American partners will have devastating economic consequences,"" they warned.
Trump's pledges to crack down on immigration and calls for a wall along the border with Mexico also vex farm state lawmakers. 
""What I really need is a good, solid immigration system,” South Dakota Republican Senator Mike Rounds said. Given his state's low unemployment rate of just around 2.8 percent, farmers and ranchers need better access to legal foreign labor, he said. 
STORM OVER SUNNY SLOPE
Agriculture Secretary Perdue got a taste of farmers' angst when met cattle ranchers in Nebraska on May 20. The event was held shortly after Washington agreed with China to resume beef exports, but some 60 ranchers who gathered at U.S. Senator Deb Fischer's Sunny Slope Ranch quickly turned to NAFTA. 
""If the president wants to renegotiate that agreement with our neighbors and partners in Mexico and Canada please leave the ag portion of that discussion out,"" said Pete McClymont, executive vice president of Nebraska Cattlemen, summarizing the discussion.
While lobbying in Washington, some Republican lawmakers have also met with Mexico's ambassador and U.S. farming representatives traveled south to assure their partners unsettled by Trump's ""America First"" mantra.
""The common comment is: 'why are you here? The problem is not with us. The problem is in Washington. Why are you talking to us?'"" said Tom Sleight, president and CEO of the U.S. Grains Council. ""The new normal is that feed buyers, millers, grain buyers are actively looking at alternative sources,"" he said.
It will take months to find out how effective the lobbying was. Meantime, some are willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.
Daryl Haack, a corn and soybean farmer from Primghar in northwest Iowa, like others fears retaliation from either Canada or Mexico, but is optimistic it will not come to that.

""I think President Trump is a negotiator,"" he said. ""I think he runs bluffs. A lot of negotiators will do that.""

Better-than-expected trade figures out of China helped shore up confidence in currencies and equity markets and take some of the shine out of gold, which is usually seen as a safe haven in troubled times.
Gold futures for August delivery were down 0.11% to $1,216.00 as of mid-morning in Asia. The US dollar index, which measures the strength of the dollar against a basked of six major currencies, was down just 0.03% to 95.53.
The greenback weakened on Thursday after US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen expressed dovish views on the outlook for the US economy and the prospect of raising interest rates, saying more rates are likely to happen but without providing a timeline. Yellen's testimony coupled with ongoing political concersn in the U.S. surrounding any links that may exist between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia.
Stock markets throughout Asia continued to gain ground on Friday, with investors anticipating relatively strong economic performances in both the U.S. and the major Asian economies for the rest of the year. "
918,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 14, 2017 12:24AM ET</span>",Oil slows down in Asia after strong week,"INVESTING.COM – Oil prices slowed their advance on Friday morning trade in Asia, reacting to the prospect of high inventories and more efficient production. 
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude August contract dropped 0.20% to $45.99 a barrel. Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for September delivery was last quoted down 0.14% to $48.35 a barrel.
The slight losses on Friday morning in Asia have done little to cap one of the best weeks for oil in months. Oil prices have been depressed for some three years now, but reports earlier this week of dropping stocks in the U.S. and the possibility of extending an OPEC production cap to members Nigeria and Libya helped shore up markets.
Oil started rising on Tuesday after reports that stockpiles in the main delivery point for West Texas Intermediate crude in Oklahoma, U.S., had dropped 2.1 million barrels in the week to July 7. Oil rose on again on Wednesday after the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a drop in crude supplies of 7.6 million barrels for the week to July 7. The drop was about three times higher than expected and a bit less than the 8.1 million barrel reported by the American Petroleum Institute (API) the day before.
Nigeria reported on late Thursdday that it would limit its output of crude when production after output stabilizes at 1.8 million barrels per day. Nigerian crude output in May hit 1.733 million bpd and June production is expected to be close to the target. 
China reported a surprise jump in both exports and imports on Thursday. With stronger global demand lifting exports 11.3% year-on-year, up from 8.7% growth in May. Imports rose 17.2%. 
The increases in imports out of China have extended to oil. Chinese customs reported Thursday that the country imported 8.55 million barrels of oil per day in the first half of 2017, an increase of 13.8%. Imports from refiners along increased 15.4% year on year in May to 273 million barrels. China is the second largest consumer of oil in the world. "
919,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2017 09:35PM ET</span>","Trump administration reduces royalty rates in first U.S. oil, gas lease sale","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday announced its first offshore oil and gas lease sale, offering 76 million acres (30 million hectares) in the Gulf of Mexico and reduced royalty rates for shallow-water leases to encourage drilling at a time of low oil prices.
U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said the sale on Aug. 16 would offer leases offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida for exploration and development. The sale will be the first of the administration's 2017-22 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. 
Zinke signed an order last week to hold more lease sales and speed up approvals of permits to explore for oil and gas, a process he said got bogged down under former President Barack Obama.
Zinke told reporters on Thursday that offshore royalties returned about $18 billion to taxpayers in 2008, before Obama took office, but had dwindled to $2.6 billion last year.
He acknowledged that 2008 was an ""abnormal year"" because of high oil and gas prices, but he said drilling expanded on private lands where developers saw a better return on their investment and fewer regulatory hurdles.
""Some of it was oil and gas price, some of it was, the signal was clear: that we're not in the business as a government to deliver on oil and gas,"" Zinke said.
The Interior Department said it would lower royalty rates for shallow-water leases in the August sale to encourage drilling by oil companies, which have faced lower profits during years of sustained low global crude prices.
Energy companies will pay 12.5 percent royalty rates for leases in less than 200 meters (656 feet) of water, instead of a rate of 18.75 percent that had been proposed earlier. 

""The rate change reflects this Administration's willingness to swiftly respond to economic indicators,"" said Vincent DeVito, counselor to Zinke on energy policy. ""The 12.5 percent royalty rate is closer in harmony with the current market and federal onshore lease sales,"" he said.

920,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2017 05:20PM ET</span>",The age of 'stranded assets' isn’t just about climate change: James Saft,"By James Saft
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors may be entering the age of ""stranded assets"", and it very likely could be driven as much by technological change as by climate change.
The concept that energy firms and their investors will take big hits as carbon-generating forms of energy face regulation to cap climate change has had much attention, notably via warnings to long-term investors and others by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney.
The idea is that energy reserves, be it coal, oil or gas, now valued by energy companies as exploitable will in the end be made uneconomic by regulation, or allied technological change. These so-called “stranded assets” would then be a loss to investors, who’ve previously assigned a large value to them.
That, obviously, is an analysis which depends in substantial part on the doubtful prospect of successful coordinated official intervention to assist in a move away from fossil fuels.
A May report from think tank RethinkX, founded by Stanford economist Tony Seba, lays out a more radical case, in which the convergence of the use of autonomous and electric vehicles absolutely eviscerates huge swaths of the sunk costs of industries from energy to automobiles.
“By 2030, within 10 years of regulatory approval of fully autonomous vehicles, 95 percent of all U.S. passenger miles will be served by transport-as-a-service (TaaS) providers who will own and operate fleets of autonomous electric vehicles providing passengers with higher levels of service, faster rides and vastly increased safety at a cost up to 10 times cheaper than today’s individually owned (IO) vehicles,” according to the report. ( https://www.rethinkx.com/ )
If true, a big if, this implies U.S. oil demand will peak at 100 million barrels a day in 2020, but drop by 30 percent over the next decade, taking the per barrel cost down to $25.
Because those cars in use will be used ten times more, rather than sitting idly in garages, demand for vehicles will tumble even as miles traveled rises. Car manufacturing revenue will fall to less than 20 percent of 2015 levels by 2030. The value of oil burned by cars will fall to about 7.0 percent of today’s levels, according to the study.
To be sure, the RethinkX report reaches optimistic conclusions about the rate of adaptation, though it says its base case is derived solely from existing technology.
NOT A LOW VOLATILITY SCENARIO
In the RethinkX scenario, the overall economic impact will be positive. Cheaper transport will put $1 trillion a year more into consumer pockets, and presuming we do useful stuff in the time not driving, productivity gains will add another $1 trillion.
As someone who has spent too much time in cars, ferrying children and commuting, this all sounds great, if optimistic, but from the point of view of investment portfolio construction it would represent a seemingly unprecedented risk.
Not only is this transformation supposed to happen on a much tighter timeline than the one from buggy and rail to automobile, but the sunk costs of the existing infrastructure, supply chains and jobs is a much bigger part of the economy. Many of those people who used to grow our food have seen their labor absorbed in the transport industry, broadly defined, which represents a staggering investment in existing capital.
“In the U.S., an estimated 65 percent of shale oil and tight oil — which under a “business as usual” scenario could make up over 70 percent of the U.S. supply in 2030 — would no longer be commercially viable,” according to the report.
Car manufacturing revenue will fall to less than 20 percent of 2015 levels by 2030, as those cars which are bought do more service thus leading to a need for fewer units. The impact on supply chains, natural resource use and commodity markets may make the crisis faced by the auto industry during the Great Recession look tame.
The insurance industry will be in the line of fire both as a provider of services and as a long-term investor in industries hurt by the changes. Automated cars will have far fewer accidents, the study argues, leading revenue to insurance companies from car travel to fall by more than 70 percent in the 15 years to 2030. Those same insurance companies also own a lot of the debt and equity of companies which will be hurt by this transformation.
Used car sales are forecast to fall from $111 billion a year in 2015 to nothing in 2030, which will certainly hurt the value of some asset-backed debt, to put it mildly.Think too about the entire travel hospitality ecosystem; fewer nights in roadside hotels, fewer nights perhaps in city-center hotels if travelers choose to return home via overnight trips.
Many of these assumptions will doubtless prove far off the mark, or even possibly wrong, but it strikes me that with the exception of some pie-in-sky valuations for companies like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the overall market is a long way from discounting the potential price and volatility effects of a positive, but hugely disruptive set of changes.
Winners there will be, but it looks as if the next couple of decades will not see the same downturn in volatility we’ve recently enjoyed.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for July delivery rose 59 cents to settle at $46.08 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 63 cents to trade at $48.37 a barrel.
Oil prices continued to advance on Thursday, despite a report from the International Energy Agency showing supply of oil rose by 720,000 barrels a day (bpd) in June, nearly half – 340,000 barrels per day – of the uptick in supply came from Opec countries. 
Saudi Arabia has increased its flows, the IEA said, as well as Libya and Nigeria who are not part of the production freeze.
""Higher output from members bound by the production pact knocked compliance to 78 percent in June, the lowest rate during the first six months of the agreement,"" the IEA said in the report.
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts of 1.8m bpd for a period of nine months until March, but allowed Nigeria and Libya to remained exempt from the cuts. 
The bearish data failed to derail upward momentum in oil prices, as investors cheered data pointing to an increase in demand for oil from China as imports increased 13.8% to 8.55m bpd during the first six months of the year, compared to the same period a year ago.

923,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2017 11:31AM ET</span>",Massive copper mine tests Trump's push to slash regulation,"By Emily Flitter
SUPERIOR, Arizona (Reuters) -  Rio Tinto 's proposed Resolution Copper Mine in Arizona would tunnel 7,000 feet underground, where rocks radiate heat from the earth’s molten core. It would suck up enough water to supply a city and leave a crater a mile and a half wide and 1,000 feet deep.
Planned for more than a decade, the project would be a prototype for a looming era of more invasive U.S. mines as companies run out of easy-to-reach deposits, geologists say. It is also the project President Donald Trump's Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, had in mind as he began crafting a ""hit list"" of regulations that should be killed to speed industrial permitting.
""A company shouldn't have to be hundreds of millions of dollars into risk money without knowing whether there is a real chance it is going to get approved,"" Ross told Reuters in a May 9 interview, referring to the mine.
The massive project - which would be among the world's largest copper mines - underscores the dangers of weakening America's rigorous permitting process at a time mining endeavors are becoming increasingly complex and environmentally risky. And Ross's citation of Resolution as a poster child for suffocating regulation reflects how far the Trump administration is willing to go to advance economic growth.
Sorting out the mine's potentially negative impacts is anything but simple, and many local residents, along with Native American and environmental groups, say Resolution is exactly the kind of development that cries out for intense public scrutiny - no matter how long it takes.
""The companies have to mitigate their risks - mitigate what people are losing,"" said Mila Besich-Lira, the mayor of Superior, the town closest to the project.
A federal government review of the project has drawn about 130,000 comments from concerned constituents - more than 10 times the number who gave input on the smaller Rosemont Copper Mine nearby.
The Resolution mine would also give the region a big economic boost, employing 1,400 people and injecting $20 billion into public coffers, Rio Tinto (L:RIO) estimates. It could supply the United States with a quarter of its copper, putting this small town at the epicenter of the global metals market.
Trump has vowed sweep away regulations he says cost America trillions of dollars with no public benefit.
The regulatory review by Ross, due for release as soon as this month, is one of several parallel efforts to slash red tape. Trump has also started dismantling Obama-era climate change regulations through executive orders, for example, and directed agencies to kill two rules for every one they create.
In the meantime, Congress could set the tone. A Republican bill introduced early this year - and supported by Rio Tinto - would set a two-and-a-half-year deadline on mine permitting, a standard similar to that seen in Australia and Canada.
DEEPER, HOTTER, BIGGER
Rio Tinto - along with the Australian mining company BHP Billiton (L:BLT), which owns a 45 percent stake in Resolution - says it has spent 16 years and $1.3 billion on the project, including a decade acquiring acreage in the Tonto National Forest overlying the copper deposit.
It is now four years into the federal regulatory review to approve new mines, a process that can take seven to 10 years. Victoria Peacey, a senior manager for environmental permitting at Rio Tinto, said the mine up probably won't begin operating for another decade.
Rio Tinto acknowledges the vast scope and sensitivity of its plans.
""There are mines this deep; there are mines this hot; and there are mines this big; but there are no other mines this deep, this hot and this big all together,"" said Carl Hehnke, a geologist for Resolution.
Resolution will take copper from a zone where temperatures run 180 degrees Fahrenheit. With help from remotely controlled machines, miners will set off explosions to shatter sections of the deposit.
The ore will be milled with a combination of sulfuric acid and as much as 6.5 billion gallons of water a year - enough to supply more than half the homes in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe.
It would eventually render more than 2,400 acres of what is now the Tonto National Forest off limits to visitors.
Under the forest, in a process called ""block cave mining,"" Rio Tinto will excavate material from underground, making the material above sink and creating the expected one-and-a-half-mile-wide crater.
That area will include a site considered sacred to the San Carlos Apache (NYSE:APA) Tribe, which has been holding annual protests against the project.
YEARS OF SCRUTINY
If Resolution's copper deposit had been discovered under private land – and not a national forest – Rio Tinto might have been spared the federal review and faced only state regulators. Instead, the U.S. Forest Service is leading the study, which will consider jobs, recreation, public health and wildlife.
Despite its substantial economic benefits to the nearby town of Superior, where many homes and businesses are boarded up, residents still have their concerns.
""What am I going to tell my great-grandkids - how this place was totally destroyed?"" said Anna Jeffries, a Superior resident, during an April 2016 public meeting with Forest Service officials at Superior High School.
Mining industry lobbyists counter that they are only seeking an efficient and reasonable approval process.
""We are not talking in any way, shape or form about any environmental rollbacks here,"" said Katie Sweeney, general counsel for the National Mining Association, a trade group. ""We're talking about bureaucracy.""
The NMA wants to see deadlines for permitting, along with rules requiring agencies to conduct studies simultaneously rather than consecutively.
The NMA and Rio Tinto back the bill - introduced in January by Republican Congressman Mark Amodei of Nevada - that would give regulators the two-and-a-half year deadline to approve or reject mining projects.
Mining companies in Canada and Australia applaud similar time limits in those countries, but a May 2016 report by a government watchdog in the Canadian province of British Columbia found Canada's mine regulation had ""major gaps in resources, planning and tools"" that led to ""inadequate"" inspections and ""increasing environmental risks.""
Commerce Secretary Ross told Reuters in a June 23 phone message he believed the U.S. Forest Service was doing ""a good job in terms of Rio Tinto."" But he added, ""The rest of the process has been so abysmal that Rio Tinto actually testified before the U.S. Congress [about] how bad the process was.""
Ross and his spokesman did not respond to additional questions seeking examples of problems that occurred between Resolution and permit-issuing agencies.
But his office said he was referring to Congressional testimony given by Rio Tinto’s Managing Director for Copper and Diamonds, Nigel Steward, in March. Steward called the U.S. permitting process ""inefficient"" and said it ""presents a major barrier to the domestic sector's ability to perform to its full potential.""
Rio Tinto is advocating for more certainty in permitting timelines and improved coordination among agencies involved - along with more money for agencies ""to ensure that experienced and highly skilled people are devoted to complex technical aspects of permitting,"" said Todd Malan, Rio Tinto's vice president for external affairs and communications for the Americas.
While the company supports permitting deadlines, at least one Rio Tinto official acknowledges that it would be hard to address the issues raised by the Resolution mine in less than years.
""I'm not necessarily saying time frames would not be helpful, but three years? ... That's a tight time frame,"" said Peacey.
While uncertain permitting timeframes raise financial risks for Rio Tinto, she said, the sometimes lengthy process also protects the public.
""Those are people's rights,"" she said.

Futures were down 0.1% at around $2.982 prior to the release of the supply data.
Thursday's reading compared with a build of 72 billion cubic feet (bcf) in the preceding week and represented a decline of 289 billion from a year earlier but was 172 bcf above the five-year average.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.945 trillion cubic feet, 8.9% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 6.2% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Before the report was released, natural gas had been seeing its second day of profit-taking Thursday as investors locked in gains from a rally earlier in the week as updated weather forecasting models continued to point to increased summer demand in the coming weeks.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.

926,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 13, 2017 08:40AM ET</span>",Oil slides as OPEC compliance with output cuts wanes,"Investing.com - Oil prices were lower in North American trade on Thursday, after the International Energy Agency said OPEC's compliance with production cuts fell in June to its lowest levels in six months, underling worries over a global supply glut.
OPEC's compliance with cuts slumped to 78% last month from 95% in May, according to the IEA's monthly market report released earlier, as several members pumped much more oil than allowed by their supply deal.
In May, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude August contract was at $45.42 a barrel by 8:35AM ET (1235GMT), down 8 cents, or around 0.2%, after being down by as much as 1% at $44.99 earlier.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for September delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London slipped 14 cents to $47.60 a barrel.
Oil ended higher on Wednesday after U.S. government data confirmed a sharp decline in domestic crude supplies for a second week in a row. Prices, however, ended off the best levels of the session, as rising production in the U.S. underlined concern over a supply glut.
Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed that crude oil inventories fell by 7.6 million barrels in the week ended July 7. There was additional support stemming from a decline in U.S. gasoline inventories.
But total domestic crude production edged up by 59,000 barrels a day to 9.397 million barrels a day last week, according to the EIA figures.
Oil prices have been under pressure in recent weeks as concern over rising U.S. shale output canceled out production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for August shed 0.2 cents to $1.515 a gallon, while August heating oil dipped 0.3 cents to $1.470 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for August delivery slipped 2.4 cents to $2.961 per million British thermal units, as traders looked ahead to weekly storage data due later in the global day.

927,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2017 07:51AM ET</span>",Oil falls as IEA sees waning compliance with OPEC cuts,"By Christopher Johnson and Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday after the International Energy Agency (IEA) said the oil market could stay oversupplied for longer than expected due to rising production and limited output cuts by some OPEC exporters.
The Paris-based IEA said rising consumption in Germany and the United States was helping boost oil demand but the world still faced a fuel glut. 
Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 40 cents at $47.34 a barrel by 1120 GMT. U.S. light crude (CLc1) was down 35 cents at $45.14.
Oil prices have dropped in recent weeks to levels not seen since the end of last year as investors have lost faith in a deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to reduce output, while U.S. shale oil production has risen sharply.
""Each month something seems to come along to raise doubts about the pace of the rebalancing process,"" the IEA report said. 
""This month, there are two hitches: a dramatic recovery in oil production from Libya and Nigeria and a lower rate of compliance by OPEC with its own output agreement.""
Oil inventories in industrialized nations remain high despite a modest drop in May. OECD stocks are still 266 million barrels above the five-year average, the IEA said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said on Wednesday the world would need only 32.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of its crude next year, down 60,000 bpd from this year and about 400,000 bpd less than it pumped in June. 
OPEC said its production rose by 393,000 bpd in June to 32.611 million bpd, thanks to extra output from Nigeria and Libya.
That came despite a pledge by OPEC to curb production by about 1.2 million bpd between January this year and March 2018, while Russia and other non-OPEC producers say they will hold back half as much.
OPEC's compliance with cuts slumped to 78 percent last month from 95 percent in May as higher-than-allowed output from Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Iraq, the UAE and Venezuela offset strong compliance from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Angola, the IEA said. 
The demand outlook was also boosted after data showed China imported 8.55 million bpd in the first six months of the year, up 13.8 percent on the same period in 2016, making it the world's biggest crude importer ahead of the United States.

""We are definitely seeing robust demand growth (in China),"" said Neil Beveridge, senior oil analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.

928,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2017 07:40AM ET</span>","First tech, now financing: U.S. shale firms get creative to pump more oil","By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers survived an oil price crash and confounded OPEC's efforts to drain a global glut by employing innovative drilling and production techniques. Now, some of these producers are turning to creative investments to pump more oil. 
Drilling joint ventures, called ""DrillCos"" for short, combine cash from investors like  Carlyle Group  LP (O:CG) with drillable-but-idle land already owned by producers. Investors get a pledge of double-digit returns within a few years, while producers can raise productivity without spending more of their own money.
The total raised by these ventures - at least $2 billion in the last 24 months - is a small part of overall shale financing. But they represent another way for Wall Street and shale producers to increase the flow of oil, and frustrate plans by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to prop up prices.
Private equity this year has showered more than $20 billion on U.S. energy ventures. Driven by shale expansion, U.S. oil production this year is forecast to increase by 570,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.9 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates. 
NO BALANCE-SHEET RISK
Drillcos take control of drillable land and generally turn over 100 percent of the cash flow from oil and gas production to investors until they earn a 15 percent return. At that point, control reverts to the producer, with the investor's stake shrinking to about 10 percent of remaining production. 
""It's a type of surgical, temporary capital,"" Mark Stoner a partner at private equity fund Bayou City Energy LP, said in an interview. Bayou City committed $256 million to an Oklahoma drillco with privately held Alta Mesa Holdings LP [ALMEH.UL] last year.
""We get exposure to great, prolific oil basins, but don't have to take on balance sheet risk."" 
Companies such as EOG Resources Inc (N:EOG), one of the financially strongest U.S. shale producers, are turning to drillcos. 
Two months ago, EOG struck a $400 million deal with Carlyle to finance wells in Oklahoma. The investment lets EOG focus its own cash on the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield, and lifts its production without increasing its spending.
The venture also allows EOG to double or triple the value of land it held on its books, Lloyd Helms, EOG's head of exploration and production, said an industry conference in May.
Legacy Reserves LP (O:LGCY), Exco Resources Inc (N:XCO), Alta Mesa and EOG are among 34 oil producers that since 2015 have formed drillcos worth more than $2.05 billion. The money has come from investors including Blackstone Group (N:BX), Carlyle, KKR & Co (N:KKR), and others, according to 1Derrick Ltd, which tracks oilfield land deals. 
PUTTING IDLE LAND TO USE
Historically, one way producers wrung more cash from financiers was to pledge future output for cash payments to finance drilling. There was no swap of land and no guaranteed return. Drillcos differ in that investors get control of land until a double-digit rate of return is met, providing insurance against a default. 
For producers, these ventures also help boost the total amount of oil they can eventually recover. Wall Street is rewarding those with strong production with share price gains at a time when OPEC and its allies have agreed to pull 1.8 million bpd off the global market.
""This helped us drill acreage that we wouldn't otherwise have been able to drill right away,"" Mike McCabe, Alta Mesa's chief financial officer, said in an interview. 
For investors, the potentially high rates of return, compared with commercial loan rates running about 5 percent to 7 percent, have spurred interest despite crude prices (CLc1) under $50 a barrel. 
""There's a lot of money seeking a home, especially in this low interest rate environment,"" Mingda Zhao of Vinson & Elkins LLP, a law firm that has negotiated drillco agreements, said in an interview.
Drillcos are not risk free. If oil prices tumble, investors' ability to grab high returns within a few years fades. Shale producers also must be willing to provide more information on the land than they would under more common loan agreements. 
Such detailed information ""gives us well-level insight into what's going on in a basin,"" said Bayou City's Stoner.
For Carlyle, one of the world's largest private equity funds, the drillco with EOG was a relatively low-risk way to invest in U.S. shale.
""We were looking for very specific types of assets and drilling deals to make the risk-return work for us,"" David Albert, co-head of Carlyle's Energy Mezzanine Opportunities funds, said in an interview. 
The funds, with more than $4 billion under management, can still make money on its drillco investment even after oil prices (CLc1) slipped below $45 per barrel this month on oversupply concerns. 

""Even with current oil prices, there are still economic opportunities to be had out there,"" Albert said.

LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC's compliance with production cuts fell in June to its lowest levels in six months as several members pumped much more oil than allowed by their supply deal, thus delaying market rebalancing, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday.
OPEC's compliance with cuts slumped to 78 percent last month from 95 percent in May as higher-than-allowed output from Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Iraq, the UAE and Venezuela offset strong compliance from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Angola.
""Each month something seems to come along to raise doubts about the pace of the rebalancing process. This month, there are two hitches: a dramatic recovery in oil production from Libya and Nigeria and a lower rate of compliance by OPEC with its own output agreement,"" the Paris-based IEA said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and several non-OPEC producers including Russia have agreed to cut production by around 1.8 million barrels per day until March 2018 to ease a global crude glut spurred by booming U.S. output.
OPEC members Libya and Nigeria were exempted from the cuts due to years of unrest that have sapped their output. The two countries have managed to increase their combined production by more than 700,000 bpd in recent months, the IEA said.
""For fellow OPEC members, who agreed to reduce production by 1.2 million bpd, to see their cut effectively diluted by nearly two-thirds must be very frustrating, especially as their pact has, hitherto, been well observed by historical standards,"" the IEA said.
The cuts have stabilized oil at around $45-50 per barrel, but prices have come under renewed pressure in recent weeks due to growing U.S. output and little evidence of global stocks falling from record highs above 3 billion barrels.
The IEA, which advises industrialized nations on energy policy, said strong demand growth in the second half of 2017 and in 2018 should nevertheless speed up market rebalancing.
It said demand for OPEC's crude was forecast to rise steadily through 2017 and reach 33.6 million bpd in the fourth quarter - up 1 million bpd on OPEC's June output.
""Provided there is strong compliance with OPEC's cuts, that would imply a hefty stock draw, even if Libya and Nigeria recover further,"" it said.
The IEA said stocks in industrialized nations in May were 266 million barrels above the five-year average, down from 300 million barrels in April. Preliminary data shows a further moderate reduction in stocks for June.
The agency also said that while non-OPEC producers such as the United States, Canada and Brazil were firmly back in growth mode, the recent decline in oil prices could force some U.S. producers to reassess their prospects.
""Financial data suggests that while output might be gushing, profits are not and recent press reports quoted leading company executives saying that oil prices need to be around $50 per barrel to maintain production growth,"" the IEA said.

Comex gold futures were at $1,222.49 a troy ounce by 3:18AM ET (0718GMT), up $3.40, or around 0.3%.
Prices tallied a third-straight gain Wednesday after Yellen sounded cautious on inflation and noted the Fed would not need to raise rates ""all that much further"" to reach current low estimates of the neutral funds rate.
She also said that the U.S. economy is healthy enough for the Fed to begin winding down its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet at some point this year.
The speech was seen as mainly dovish by market participants.
The dollar index traded down almost 0.3% at 95.31 in early trade, not far from the nine-month low of 95.22 plumbed in late June.
Yields of the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury fell to 2.32%, well off highs near 2.39% touched last week.
Investors now looked ahead to more comments from the Fed chair, will testify for a second day on the institution's monetary policy in front of the House Financial Services Committee at 10:00AM ET (1400GMT).
Besides Yellen, Thursday's calendar also features PPI inflation data and weekly jobless claims, both due at 8:30AM ET (1230GMT). Monthly CPI data is due Friday.
The Fed hiked rates at its June meeting and stuck to its forecast for one more rate hike this year, but the subdued inflation outlook has since raised doubts over whether the U.S. central bank will be able to stick to its planned tightening path.
Futures traders are pricing in around a 40% chance of a hike by the end of the year, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

LONDON (Reuters) - The United States is on track to have capacity to become the world's second largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by the end of 2022, just behind Australia and ahead of Qatar, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.
Overall, global LNG export capacity would reach 650 billion cubic meters (bcm) a year by the end of 2022, compared to less than 452 bcm a year in 2016, the IEA said in its annual report on gas markets.
Of that amount, Australia would have capacity to export 117.8 bcm a year of LNG, followed by the United States with 106.7 bcm a year and Qatar with 104.9 bcm a year, it said.
Australia would stay top by adding 30 bcm a year of capacity by the end of 2022 to its existing capacity, but the United States, which has seen shale gas output surge, would add about 90 bcm a year to its capacity of about 14 bcm a year now.
""By the end of our forecast period, the United States will be well on course to challenging Australia and Qatar for global leadership among LNG exporters,"" the report said.
However, the new LNG capacity is being added to an already well-supplied market, while demand is falling in some of the traditionally large importing nations, such as Japan, it said.
With demand expected to reach 460 bcm a year by 2022, the market would have 190 bcm a year in excess capacity, putting pressure on gas prices and discouraging new upstream investment.
Current low LNG prices are already making it tougher for exporters, and competition is loosening the typically rigid contracts that have dominated the long-distance trade.
""This change will be further accelerated by the expansion of U.S. exports, which are not tied to any particular destination and so will play a major role in increasing the liquidity and flexibility of LNG trade,"" the IEA said.
Qatar said last week it planned to raise its LNG output by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes a year (roughly 140 bcm a year) in the next five to seven years, in what was seen as a challenge to other exporters.
The IEA report did not assess the impact of Qatar's plans as the extra capacity was expected to be in place after the report's forecast period of 2016-2022, Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA's director of energy markets and security, told reporters.
Overall, the IEA said global gas production would grow faster than oil and coal in the next five years, helped by low price and ample supply, alongside a growing preference for gas because of its lower emissions compared to other fossil fuels.
Global gas demand was expected to rise by 1.6 percent a year to 4,000 bcm in 2022, slightly higher than last year's forecast of 1.5 percent, the IEA said. Most of the expected growth was expected to come from developing countries, led by China.
Most gas is transported by pipeline rather than on ships as LNG.
The United States, the world's largest gas producer, would increase output more than any other country in the next five years, the IEA. By 2022, U.S. production was expected to be 890 bcm, accounting for 22 percent of the total global gas output.

Natural gas jumped about 4% on Tuesday, adding to a gain of 2.3% on Monday, as updated weather forecasting models continued to point to increased summer demand in the coming weeks.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.888 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 9.0% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 6.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 51 and 61 billion cubic feet in the week ended July 7.
That compares with a gain of 72 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 64 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 72 billion cubic feet.

942,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2017 09:34AM ET</span>","OPEC sees lower demand for its oil in 2018, points to surplus","By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC said on Wednesday its oil production jumped in June and forecast world demand for its crude will decline next year as rivals pump more, pointing to a market surplus in 2018 despite an OPEC-led output cut.
Giving its first 2018 forecasts in a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said the world will need 32.20 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from its members next year, down 60,000 bpd from this year.
OPEC said its oil output in June rose above the demand forecast, led by gains in Libya and Nigeria, two members exempt from the cut aimed at eliminating excess supply. OPEC officials nonetheless remain upbeat on the outlook.
""We remain very optimistic ... (about) helping the market to rebalance itself,"" OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said at an industry conference in Istanbul.
Oil (LCOc1) rose above $48 a barrel on Wednesday as a U.S. report of falling inventories in the United States raised hopes that the glut is easing. OPEC referred to an ""ongoing rebalancing"" of the market.
Under the supply deal, OPEC is curbing output by about 1.2 million bpd, while Russia and other non-OPEC producers are cutting half as much, until March 2018.
OPEC production has increased in recent weeks, in part due to the recovery in Libya and Nigeria, which were exempted from the supply cut as domestic conflict had curbed their output.
OPEC said its output rose by 393,000 bpd in June to 32.611 million bpd, according to figures from secondary sources the organization uses to monitor supply. The gain was led by Nigeria and Libya, with extra barrels also from Saudi Arabia and Iraq. 
The figures mean OPEC has complied 96 percent with the cutback pledge, according to a Reuters calculation, down from more than 100 percent in May but still high by OPEC standards.
""We are fully satisfied that member countries are maintaining a very high level of conformity,"" Barkindo said.
SAUDI, OTHERS PUMP MORE
The report also said Saudi Arabia, which earlier this year voluntarily cut production to below its OPEC goal, boosted output to 10.07 million bpd in June, slightly above target. 
Supply is rising outside the group as well. OPEC estimated supply from all non-OPEC producers next year will rise by 1.14 million bpd, a sizeable increase from growth of 800,000 bpd this year led by the United States.
Next year's growth in non-OPEC supply is almost as much as the 1.26 million bpd rise that OPEC expects in global demand, and is even more if OPEC output of natural gas liquids - a type of supply not restricted by OPEC quotas - is included. 
The United States is expected to contribute the largest non-OPEC supply gain next year, OPEC said, even though cost inflation and a decline in well productivity will curb shale oil activity. Canada and Brazil are also expected to boost output.
Should OPEC keep pumping at similar levels to June, the market could remain in surplus next year, the report indicates. The Nigerian and Libyan recovery has prompted talk among producers about asking them to join the supply deal.
Barkindo downplayed expectations this would be addressed soon, saying a meeting on July 24 in Russia of some OPEC and non-OPEC ministers would discuss Nigerian and Libyan output only at a technical level.

OPEC production figures in the report are for the now 14-member group. Equatorial Guinea joined in late May.

Comex gold futures were at $1,223.24 a troy ounce by 9:05AM ET (1305GMT), up $8.90, or around 0.7%, after touching a session peak of $1,224.93. Prices settled with a modest gain for a second-straight session on Tuesday.
In prepared remarks released before her testimony to the House Financial Services committee, Yellen said the Fed remains on track to both raise interest rates and begin shrinking its balance sheet before the end of the year, despite low inflation.
She added that the rate increases and balance sheet reduction would be gradual.
The Fed hiked rates at its June meeting and stuck to its forecast for one more rate hike this year, but the subdued inflation outlook has since raised doubts over whether the U.S. central bank will be able to stick to its planned tightening path.
Futures traders are pricing in around a 40% chance of a hike by the end of the year, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, hit the lowest level of the day following the release of Yellen's comments, trading down 0.2% at 95.33, not far from the nine-month low of 95.22 plumbed in late June.
Besides the Fed, investors will be keeping a close eye on Washington, for any more political noise coming out of the White House as the Russia-linked scandal continues to rumble on.
Donald Trump Jr. released an email chain on Tuesday, which referred to a top Russian government prosecutor as offering the Trump campaign damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
The emails are the most concrete evidence yet that Trump campaign officials welcomed Russian help to win the election, a subject that has cast a cloud over Trump's presidency and spurred investigations by the Justice Department and Congress.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose above $48 a barrel on Wednesday in response to a fall in U.S. fuel inventories and a cut in the U.S. government's forecast for crude output and despite OPEC suggesting the oil market will see a surplus next year.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 8.1 million barrels, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday, much more than the forecast.
Official inventory data from the Energy Information Administration is due at 1430 GMT. 
Brent crude (LCOc1), the global benchmark, was up 62 cents, at $48.14 a barrel by 1130 GMT. U.S. crude (CLc1) gained 67 cents to $45.71.
""While further upside could be expected in the short term amid the speculations of a cut in U.S production, gains may be limited by the firm oversupply dynamics of the markets,"" FXTM analyst Lukman Otunuga said.
The U.S. crude stocks drop will raise hopes that a long-awaited market rebalancing is under way. A supply glut has stuck around for three years, despite an OPEC-led output cut in 2017, keeping oil at less than half its price of mid-2014.
Also supporting prices, the EIA said on Tuesday it expected U.S. crude oil production to rise by less than previously forecast next year due to a lower price outlook.
The lower 2018 forecast of 9.9 million barrels per day will ease concerns that the OPEC-led supply cut will lead to a flood of competing U.S. shale supplies, swamping the OPEC effort.
Still, output of 9.9 million bpd would be a record for U.S. production.
The supply cut led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has lent prices some support, but in recent weeks rising output from Libya and Nigeria - OPEC members exempt from the deal - has pushed supply higher.
In its monthly report, OPEC said its oil output rose by 393,000 bpd in June to 32.611 million bpd led by a rebound in Nigeria and Libya, plus extra barrels from Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
A Saudi industry source said on Wednesday that Riyadh planned to reduce shipments in August by more than 600,000 bpd, taking exports for that month to their lowest level this year, to balance a seasonal rise in domestic use. 

OPEC forecast the world will need 32.20 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from its members next year, down 60,000 bpd from this year.

MANILA (Reuters) - Drilling for oil and natural gas on the Reed Bank in the South China Sea may resume before the end of the year, a Philippine energy official said on Wednesday, as the government prepares to offer new blocks to investors in bidding in December.
The Philippines suspended exploration at the Reed Bank, which it calls Recto Bank, in late 2014, as it pursued international arbitration over territorial disputes.
The bank is in waters claimed by China.
Ismael Ocampo, director at the Department of Energy's Resource Development Bureau, told reporters the agency expected the suspension to be lifted in December.
He said a directive from the Department of Foreign Affairs directing the Department of Energy to resume oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea was already in the works.
China claims almost the entire South China Sea, where about $5 trillion worth of sea-borne goods pass every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan also have claims.
Exactly a year ago, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague invalidated China's claim to sovereignty over most of the South China Sea.
The ruling, which China refused to recognize, clarified Philippine sovereign rights in its 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone to access offshore oil and gas fields, including the Reed Bank, 85 nautical miles off its coast.
""We will try to conduct seismic activities,"" in the disputed waters, Ocampo said, hopeful that China would not complain and harass crews of survey ships to be deployed. 
In 2011, Chinese patrol vessels almost rammed a survey ship at the Reed Bank contracted by a PXP Energy Corp (PS:PXP) unit.
President Rodrigo Duterte, who took power shortly before the Hague ruled in favor of Manila, has said he would raise the landmark ruling with China eventually, but he first needed to strengthen relations between the two countries.
Duterte, who has been cool toward old ally the United States, hopes closer ties with China will yield billions of dollars in loans and investment in infrastructure, the backbone of his economic agenda.
PXP Energy Chairman Manuel Pangilinan said in March he was optimistic his company's exploration project at Reed Bank would soon resume, citing the warming ties with China.
The Philippines, which relies overwhelmingly on imports to fuel its fast-growing economy, is under pressure to develop indigenous energy resources. Its main source of natural gas, the Malampaya field near the disputed waters, is due to run out in less a decade.
PXP's Reed Bank prospect has indicated natural gas yield potential.
More than two dozen oil, gas and coal blocks, including additional areas in disputed waters, may be offered during the December bidding, Ocampo said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will cut crude oil shipments to its customers in August by more than 600,000 barrels per day to balance the rise in domestic consumption during the summer, while staying within its OPEC production commitment, a Saudi industry source said.
""There is strong demand for our crude but we are sticking to our OPEC commitments,"" the source, who is familiar with the kingdom's oil policy, said on Wednesday.
""In order to meet its OPEC quota and meet its domestic demand during summer, Saudi Arabia has made big cuts in allocations internationally by more than 600,000 bpd for the month of August,"" the source said.
Crude exports for August will fall to their lowest level this year at around 6.6 million bpd, the source added.
Crude allocations to Asia for August will be reduced by about 200,000 bpd to 3.5 million bpd, while allocations to Europe will be down by around 70,000 bpd at 520,000 bpd.
Oil majors were allocated some 200,000 bpd less in August at 780,000 bpd. 
Exports to the United States will be below 800,000 bpd in August, the source said.
Saudi Arabia told the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries its oil production in June rose to 10.07 million bpd, slightly above its OPEC target, mainly due to an increase in domestic crude burning for power during summer. 
The source also cited late May port closures as pushing some cargoes into June, which may have resulted in higher June exports. The source said July oil output would be lower than June, without providing details.
""Saudi Arabia is keen to see an improvement in the oil market and accelerate the balancing process, and expects other producers to do the same,"" the Saudi source said, adding that there are signs of improvement in market fundamentals.
""While supply is not increasing except from exempt countries such as Libya and Nigeria, demand is picking up and we are starting to see inventory draws in total petroleum stocks in recent weeks.
""Saudi Arabia will continue to work closely with other producers to monitor and stabilize the market by making sure that production cuts are continuing,"" the source said. 
A joint ministerial committee from OPEC and non-OPEC countries including Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world's biggest oil producers, will meet on July 24 to discuss compliance with a supply-cut pact and review the rise in output from Nigeria and Libya. Both countries were exempted from the production cuts. 
The Saudi source said ministers would discuss several ideas at the meeting and that the recent rise in output from Nigeria and Libya ""is not big in a way that should disturb the market"". 

He declined to comment on further steps OPEC could take to rebalance the market.

951,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 12, 2017 01:21AM ET</span>",Tariff fight roils Argentina’s shale patch as Macri opens trade,"By Luc Cohen
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina needs oil rigs to develop its vast shale oil and gas resources. The United States has plenty of idle equipment laying around after its own unconventional drilling boom cooled.
But moving that machinery from the plains of Texas to the windswept Patagonian desert is proving complex and costly for global oil majors who say Argentina's protectionist past is slowing efforts to spark its own shale revolution.
A move by Argentina's government to cut import taxes on used oil-field equipment has sparked fierce opposition from local manufacturers, who are lobbying the government to include protections for them in a measure they fear will destroy their livelihoods. 
Among them is Adrian Ramos, president of QM Equipment, a manufacturer of drilling and fracking equipment located in the Argentine coastal city of Mar del Plata. 
""We got in touch with [the Production Ministry] and let them know it was totally impossible for us to survive this,"" Ramos told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Negotiations with Ramos and others have slowed the rollout of tariff reductions. President Mauricio Macri in April had promised oil executives the changes would be coming within ""weeks.""
The previously unreported talks with local manufacturers underscore the challenges faced by Macri, who came to power in 2015 on a wave of popular discontent that ended 12 years of leftist rule. The market-friendly former businessman has pledged to revive Argentina's moribund, inflation-racked economy by reducing trade barriers and wooing foreign investment. 
But he has gotten blowback from industries and unions that have benefited from protectionist policies. With mid-term elections approaching in October, popular opposition to rising imports and factory layoffs has become a vulnerability for Macri's ""Let's Change"" coalition.
Big oil firms, meanwhile, are fuming too.
Vaca Muerta, a Belgium-sized shale formation located in the western Patagonian province of Neuquen, is seen as the most promising unconventional oil and gas field outside of North America, the birthplace of the shale revolution. 
Already burdened with pricey labor and transport costs in Argentina, companies have grown frustrated with delays in the equipment import reform.
Speaking at an industry event in Buenos Aires in late June, Richard Spies, chief executive of Pan America Energy, an Argentine subsidiary of  BP  (LON:BP) PLC, called on government officials to hit the accelerator.
""Get these things done,"" Spies said. ""We need that equipment that's idle in the United States moved down here to facilitate the developments that are coming in Vaca Muerta.""
In an emailed response to questions from Reuters, a Production Ministry spokesman said the import proposal was advancing and a decree would be passed by the executive branch in the coming weeks. It would not need congressional approval, the spokesman said.
BRINGING THE ""DEAD COW"" TO LIFE
Argentina is one of many resource-rich Latin American countries that have struggled to develop abundant oil and mineral reserves. Rules aimed at protecting domestic players and guaranteeing large revenues for government have chased away some foreign investors. 
New right-leaning governments in the region have introduced business-friendly policies to lure them back. Brazil's Congress in 2016 opened the nation's deepwater pre-salt fields to foreign operators. This year Peru lowered air-quality standards to attract mining investment.
Spurring development of Vaca Muerta - Spanish for 'Dead Cow' - is one of Macri's major priorities as he tries to unwind regulations put in place by his predecessor Cristina Fernandez.
Argentina holds the world's second-largest shale gas reserves, but it imports a quarter of its energy needs, one reason for the country's $7-billion current account deficit.
Macri has promised rail and pipeline projects to connect remote Vaca Muerta to markets and ports. Most crucially, he struck a deal with unions in January to reduce notoriously high labor costs.
Still, production costs remain well above those of global competitors. Prices at the Loma Campana field, jointly operated by state-run oil company YPF SA and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) exceed $43 per barrel, compared with $32 in the Niobrara in Colorado and Wyoming.
(For a look at Argentine shale activity, see http://tmsnrt.rs/2uPm98U) 
Used oil equipment can currently be imported at tariffs ranging from 7 percent to 28 percent, with imports of some types of machinery banned, the Energy Ministry said in an emailed statement to Reuters. 
The proposed change would eliminate the bans, lower tariffs to between 0 percent and 7 percent and provide a form of compensation for companies that buy locally produced equipment, the Ministry said. It added that it has been meeting with drillers, oil services companies and local manufacturers about the rule. 
""Evidently this dialogue process has taken time,"" a ministry spokesman wrote. ""We expect the decree to be signed soon."" 
COMPETE OR 'DISAPPEAR'
Local companies fear the changes could be devastating. 
Everaldo Santa Cruz is head of the oil and gas business at HTI SA, a maker of drilling and hydraulic fracturing equipment in Canuelas, Buenos Aires province. He said HTI has invested heavily in building frac pumps to supply drillers in Vaca Muerta, and that the $1.2 million price tag is comparable with that of U.S. manufacturers.
But Santa Cruz said he worries he will never get to fully develop that part of his business if the decree is passed. HTI doesn't stand a chance if his customers are allowed to import equipment they already own from the United States, paying only transport costs and the lowered tariffs, he said. 
""We understand that it can speed up production to an extent,"" Santa Cruz said. ""But there's a risk that companies like ours that try to develop local solutions to support the industry simply disappear.""

Gold futures for August delivery edged up 0.37% to $1,219.23 as of mid-morning.
Gold has been rebounding this week after stronger than expected economic data out of the U.S., a subdued inflation picture in China and a narrower than expected current account surplus in Japan. A strengthening in other commodity prices like oil and iron have also helped while political uncertainty in the U.S. has taken some of the shine off the US dollar. 
Gold and the dollar typically move in opposite directions, which means if the dollar goes down, gold futures, which are denominated in the U.S. currency, will rise. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenbackís strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.11% to 95.38 as of mid-morning. The gold U.S. dollar index was up 0.19% to 1,219.70.

Earlier, Japan reported its unadjusted current account surplus at •1.654 trillion, narrower than the •1.796 trillion expected, while core machinery orders fell 3.6% on year in May, compared to a gain of 7.7% seen. USD/JPY changed hands at 113.98, up 0.06%.
Investors are now looking forward to US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's testimony on monetary policy as well as U.S. data on inflation and retail sales, due out on Friday. Trade data from China on Thursday should also give markets some direction. 
The Fed hiked rates at its June meeting and stuck to its forecast for one more rate hike this year, but the subdued inflation outlook has raised doubts over whether officials will be able to stick to their planned tightening path. Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for August delivery rose 1.4% to settle at $45.04 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent rose by to trade at $47.62 a barrel.
The Energy Information Administration lowered its forecast for U.S. production to 9.9 million barrels per day for 2018, from last month’s forecast of about 10 million barrels per day, easing fears that rising U.S. crude production would derail Opec efforts to reduce excess supply. 
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year.
Adding to the positive sentiment on oil, was a report showing an uptick in demand for crude oil in June amid higher refining refinery activity in the region. 
The duo of upbeat economic reports came ahead of weekly data on U.S crude inventories expected to show a draw in crude stockpiles for a second week in a row.
Some analysts, however, warned that without further intervention from Opec and its allies’ or a drop in both U.S. crude oil stockpiles and drilling rigs, oil prices remained at risk from falling below key price levels. 
A failure for these shifts to materialize soon could push prices below $40/bbl as the market tests OPEC's and shale's reaction functions,"" Goldman analysts wrote in a research note. ""Importantly, we wouldn't expect such a move to be volatile, as it is not driven by storage concerns like last year ... but the ongoing search for a new equilibrium."""

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $2.45, or 0.20%, to $1,215.72 a troy ounce.
Brainard’s dovish comments dampened investor expectations of a Fed rate hike later this year, pressuring yields and the dollar, lifting demand for the precious metal. 
“I will want to monitor inflation developments carefully, and to move cautiously on further increases in the federal funds rate, so as to help guide inflation back up around our symmetric target."" Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said Tuesday.
Brainard also suggested that the Fed would unwind its balance sheet “soon” as long as economic growth remained robust. 
The U.S. dollar index fell to session lows against its rivals while the U.S. 10-year dipped to 2.362, down 0.37%. 
Gold is sensitive to moves in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A weaker dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency while a dip in U.S. rates, decreases the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
The upside in gold futures, however, remained capped, as investors look ahead to

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices surged almost 2 percent on Tuesday along with rising gasoline and heating oil futures after a report showed European product stockpiles fell despite an increase in refinery crude runs.
European refineries increased their crude oil intake in June, but stocks of oil products, particularly diesel, slid, Euroilstock data showed on Tuesday.
""That tells you demand globally is a lot stronger than people thought it was going to be and that is having a net positive effect on heating and gasoline prices,"" said Scott Shelton, energy specialist at energy brokerage ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Durham, North Carolina.
Benchmark Brent (LCOc1) futures were up 84 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $47.72 a barrel by 12:15 p.m. EDT (1615 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) was up 82 cents, or 1.9 percent, at $45.22 per barrel.
U.S. heating oil (HOc1) futures were also up almost 2 percent at midday. This boosted the products crack spread  measure of refinery margins to the highest since late May.
The European inventory report came ahead of weekly data on U.S. crude inventories. The American Petroleum Institute (API) reports on Tuesday afternoon and the U.S. Energy Information Administration reports Wednesday morning.
Analysts polled by Reuters forecast that U.S. crude inventories fell 3.2 million barrels while gasoline and distillate stocks each rose by 1.5 million barrels. [EIA/S] 
Crude prices had slipped in earlier trade, pressured by bank forecasts for declines this year and in 2018.
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) slashed its forecasts for Brent by $9 to $51 a barrel for 2017 and by $15 to $48 for 2018.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) cut its 2017 and 2018 Brent forecasts to $52 a barrel for both years from $55 for 2017 and $57 for 2018. 
Crude prices remain about 17 percent below 2017 opening levels despite a deal led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production from January.
OPEC agreed with Russia and some other major exporters to cut output about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018. But production elsewhere has risen as OPEC has held back.
U.S. oil production  has jumped more than 10 percent over the last year to 9.34 million bpd. Nigeria and Libya, OPEC members exempt from production limits, have also increased output.

Without a significant fall in oil inventories or a decline in U.S. drilling and production, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said U.S. crude could drop below $40 per barrel.

(Reuters) - OPEC oil output has risen in June by more than 300,000 barrels per day, (bpd) according to figures the exporter group uses to monitor its supply, as a recovery in two nations exempt from a supply cut deal countered high compliance by many others.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut output by about 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1 to reduce a glut and support prices (LCOc1). Russia and 10 other non-OPEC states agreed to cut half as much.
Including Nigeria and Libya, which are exempt from the deal, output by all 13 OPEC members in June rose to about 32.47 million bpd, according to the average assessments of secondary sources OPEC uses to monitor its output. The figures were seen by Reuters.
That would be up 330,000 bpd from OPEC's published May figure.
A jump in output in Nigeria and Libya, where output had been limited by conflict, has weighed on oil prices (LCOc1). The recovery has prompted more talk among producers about asking them to join the supply cut deal. 
Production from the 11 OPEC members with output targets under the agreement has averaged 29.840 million bpd in June, according to the secondary sources. Reuters also saw these figures.
That means compliance in June is 97 percent, according to an OPEC calculation. That is lower than in May, as OPEC's published figures for that month point to compliance above 100 percent. [nL8N1JA2SE]
OPEC is scheduled to publish the assessment of June output based on secondary sources in its monthly oil market report on Wednesday. The figures could be revised before publication as more secondary-source estimates are added, OPEC sources said.
OPEC uses two sets of figures to monitor its output -- figures provided by each country and those provided by secondary sources that include industry media. This is a legacy of old disputes over real production levels.
The production cut agreed last year was from levels as assessed by the secondary sources.
OPEC's report on Wednesday is also expected to show that Saudi Arabia told OPEC that it raised production to 10.07 million bpd in June, industry sources said, up from 9.88 million bpd in May.
The increase takes Saudi production slightly above its OPEC production target of 10.058 million bpd for the first month this year, although on average in 2017, output remains below the target, an OPEC source said.

The six secondary sources used by OPEC are the International Energy Agency, oil-pricing agencies Platts and Argus, ‎the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) and industry newsletter Petroleum Intelligence Weekly (PIW).

U.S. natural gas for August delivery was at $2.989 per million British thermal units by 9:25AM ET (1325GMT), up 6.1 cents, or around 2.1%. It touched its highest since July 5 at $2.992 earlier.
Natural gas jumped more than 2% on Monday amid bullish weather forecasts.
Updated weather forecasting models showed temperatures over most of the U.S. will warm back into the upper 90s to 100s Fahrenheit this week.
Longer-term models showed the western, central, and southern U.S. will be very warm to hot through July 23, as high pressure dominates.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.888 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 9.0% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 6.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 51 and 61 billion cubic feet in the week ended July 7.
That compares with a gain of 72 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 64 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 72 billion cubic feet.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The U.S. shale drilling boom is likely to ease next year as demand on the industry's service sector is unsustainable, Halliburton's (N:HAL) business development head said on Tuesday.
The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States rose to 763 last week, the highest in more than two years, showing that despite oil trading below $50 a barrel, shale oil explorers are still ramping up activity.
Halliburton's Mark Richard, senior vice president for global business development and marketing, sees that count rising above 1,000 by the end of the year, but not beyond that.
""I think it might level off then. If our customers put too much out there, it's costing too much and putting too much demand on service companies to provide equipment and people,"" he told Reuters at an industry event in Istanbul.
Oil services companies cut back dramatically when demand for their products fell oil prices started falling in 2014 and it has taken them longer to readjust their output.
Richard said he sees 800-900 rigs as a more sustainable level in the medium term.
The increase in shale activity has been a boon for companies like Halliburton which supply equipment to the sector and Richard said he had been able to raise prices in the U.S. because of rising demand, but declined to give details.
However, appetite for oil and gas equipment is still weak outside of the Americas, Richard said.
""We've hit the bottom in the first half of this year. Our customers are getting excited about things but we don't yet see a lot of activity increasing.""
Richard denied Halliburton was under additional pressure following the acquisition of rival  Baker Hughes , which it failed to buy last year after regulatory opposition, by GE Oil & Gas last week.
GE-Baker Hughes (N:BHGE) will leapfrog Halliburton to become the world's second-biggest oil services company after Schlumberger (N:SLB).

""We're number 1 or 2 in every product line we work in today. That hasn't changed because GE bought Baker,"" he said

Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (2030GMT) later on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of around 3.2 million barrels.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude August contract was at $43.94 a barrel by 7:45AM ET (1145GMT), down 45 cents, or around 1%. It touched its lowest since June 27 at $43.65 in the prior session.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for September delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 50 cents to $46.40 a barrel, after sliding a two-week low of $46.11 a day earlier.
Oil ended modestly higher Monday, bouncing back from the lowest level in around two weeks, amid reports that Libya and Nigeria may be asked to cap production in a bid to reduce a global supply glut.
The two countries had been exempted from the pact among major oil producers, led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, to limit global production and ease a glut of oil that has plagued the industry.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.
U.S. drillers added seven oil rigs last week, marking a 24th week of increases out of the last 25. That brings the total count up to 763, the most since April 2015, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for August declined 2.0 cents, or roughly 1.4%, to $1.481 a gallon, while August heating oil slumped 1.4 cents to $1.438 a gallon.

965,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2017 04:10AM ET</span>",China sets sights on oil benchmark after years of delays,"By Chen Aizhu and Florence Tan
BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China has opened more than 6,000 trading accounts for its long-awaited crude futures contract - with three-quarters coming from individual traders - as it pushes ahead with plans to compete with global pricing benchmarks.
China's oil majors and about 150 brokerages have also registered, but the strong interest by 'mom-and-pop' investors looks set to mark out China's crude futures from western counterparts, which are dominated by institutional investors.
Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), which will run China's contract, says it is finalizing technical issues. The contract has faced years of delays and there is still no set date, but INE and also trading participants now say a launch this year is almost certain.
""The INE is striving to launch the crude oil futures within this year,"" a spokeswoman said, adding that the exchange has conducted four trials to ensure it is technically ready.
Oil futures trading volume is small during Asian hours despite the region's role as the world's top consumer.
Shanghai's crude futures are aimed at giving China more clout in pricing crude in Asia and a share of the trillions of dollars in oil futures trade.
The INE hopes to attract foreign investors, and locally registered entities of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and UBS are among those registered, although international players have raised concerns, including denomination in yuan, that may dampen early take-up.
Most oil trades are priced off two crude derivatives, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and London's Brent, traded on the Intercontinental Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) owned by CME Group (NASDAQ:CME). 
Earlier attempts to establish an Asian derivative crude contract by Singapore and Tokyo foundered. The only liquid crude futures in the region is the Oman contract on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.
RETAIL INTEREST
Successful crude derivatives would be the jewel in the crown in China's push to ramp up futures trading on products from dates to steel to open up markets and offer new avenues for investors. 
While Chinese banks are barred from futures trading, the new market is expected to attract interest from deep-pocketed private equity firms and funds, while state-owned oil majors, like PetroChina and Sinopec will provide liquidity.
PetroChina is set to register two accounts and Sinopec is setting up a trading outfit in Shanghai dedicated to the contract, said senior company sources.
Independent refiners like Shandong Chambroad Group have also joined, while retail interest is strong.
Individuals already account for 80 percent of turnover on China's $8 trillion equity markets, and day traders have whipsawed commodities from eggs to iron ore in China over the past year.
Jin Changyi, a 40-year-old former hotel owner from eastern China, who began dabbling in Brent crude oil futures last year, has opened a 500,000-yuan ($75,000) account with a Shanghai-based brokerage and plans to act as a mini-broker for friends.
""The way it's designed it won't fluctuate wildly. Compared to trading Brent, the risks are more manageable,"" he told Reuters.
INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS
International interest at first may be more muted.
Executives at international banks and traders who have reviewed the contract rules and specifications warn of concerns including Beijing's clamp-down on capital outflows, unusually small price limits and China's heavy handed intervention in commodity markets last year.
""Everybody is staring at everybody else,"" said an official with a western investment bank who declined to be named due to company policy.
Reflecting a regulatory aim to stave off price volatility, the Shanghai contract has a 4 percent daily price fluctuation limit, half the limit for Chinese coking coal.
China's crude futures also do not have a mechanism to reset limits after a big price move, which means Shanghai trading could freeze while prices still move elsewhere. For WTI, for example, a $10 a barrel move activates circuit breakers to pause trade briefly until a new limit of another $10 is set.
Industry players also worry about delays in issuing rules over storage and grades for deliveries. 
The INE has yet to finalize details of warehouse tanks, including locations, rules over fuel blending and price differentials between grades, all key for helping industry participants decide on whether or not to take deliveries.
The INE spokeswoman said it is working on approved crude oil delivery points, which are located in the peninsulas of Liaodong and Shandong, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta.
Local traders hope the contract will take off.
""The contract will initially track Brent and WTI markets,"" said a derivatives trading manager with a Chinese state oil company, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media.
""It won't be an immediate success, but we're hopeful.""

Gold and the dollar typically move in opposite directions, which means if the dollar goes up, gold futures, which are denominated in the U.S. currency, will drop.
Last week, gold prices dropped to almost four-month lows on Friday after a stronger-than-forecast U.S. jobs report boosted the dollar against a basket of the other major currencies. The U.S. economy added 222,000 jobs last month the Labor Department reported, more than the 179,000 new jobs expected by economists. The rapid pace of jobs growth reassured investors that the economy is on a strong enough footing to justify the Federal Reserve's plans to raise interest rates once more this year.

Ahead of the meeting between Opec ministers and Russia on July 24, investors are expected to monitor comments from oil ministers for clues about current sentiment on further production cuts and introducing production caps for Nigeria and Libya.
Libya said on Monday it was ready for talks but added that its political, economic and humanitarian situation should be taken into account in talks on caps while Nigeria's oil minister was unable to attend the OPEC meeting because of a previous commitment, the Kuwait Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq told reporters."

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $1.49, or 0.12%, to $1,211.99 a troy ounce.
Gold eased from highs, as investors awaited testimony from Fed chair Janet Yellen on the state of the U.S. economy and the Fed’s monetary policy outlook amid growing expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates at least once more this year.
Yellen is scheduled to testify on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee at 10:00AM ET (14:00GMT) Wednesday. On Thursday, she will appear in front the House Financial Services Committee also at 10:00AM ET. 
The move lower in gold prices comes amid a rise in global bond yields, after the Bank of England and the European signalled that ultra-loose monetary measures may be nearing the end, leading many analysts to believe that upside for the yellow-metal remained limited. 
“Together with the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has been tightening since December 2015, the addition of these two central banks turning hawkish helped send bond yields sharply higher and metals lower,” Olen Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said. 
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Other precious metals shrugged off negative sentiment to trade higher, as silver futures added 0.88% to $15.560, a troy ounce while platinum futures fell 0.30% to $901.35.
Copper traded at $2.649, up 0.08%, while natural gas, rose by 2.41% to $2.933. "

ISTANBUL/LONDON (Reuters) - Libyan and Nigerian officials may attend a joint meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC nations later this month as oil producers look for ways to cap rising production to help support oil prices.
Both countries have boosted production since they were exempted from an OPEC-led deal to cut output, weighing on global prices (LCOc1). This has prompted more talk among producers about including them in the pact.
""We have spoken to (OPEC Secretary General Mohammad) Barkindo and in the next two weeks there will be conversations with them (Libya and Nigeria) and possibly we will invite them to the technical summit,"" Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference in Istanbul.
Six ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC nations including Kuwait, Venezuela, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Oman will meet on July 24 in St Petersburg, Russia, to discuss the current situation in the oil market. 
Nigeria's oil minister, Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, was invited to the meeting but is unable to attend due to another commitment, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq told reporters at the same Istanbul event.
Instead, the group will probably ask a technical committee involving the six OPEC and non-OPEC members, which is due to convene before the ministers hold their talks, to meet Nigerian and Libyan representatives to discuss their production plans, he said.
""We extended the invitation but unfortunately there is a previous commitment for the Nigerian oil minister,"" the minister said. ""We did not talk about capping, at least we can talk about production plans right now,"" he added.
The monitoring panel, called the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee which Kuwait chairs, could recommend expanding the pact to the wider group, which holds its next meeting in November. 
Both Nigeria and Libya were given exemptions to the supply cut, under which OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC producers are reducing their output by about 1.8 million barrels per day because their output has been curbed by conflict. 
OPEC delegates have said bringing Nigeria or Libya into the production pact would likely focus on capping their output, rather than asking them to cut their supply so soon after it had recovered from involuntary curbs.
Kachikwu has said that Nigeria was not opposed in principle to joining OPEC's production cap, but would have to wait and see if production returned to acceptable levels.
OPEC has not been in touch with Libya on the issue of capping the country's output, an OPEC delegate said. The Libyan government has not received an invitation to attend the ministerial meeting in Russia, he added.
In comments to Reuters on Monday, the head of Libya's National Oil Corporation did not indicate any willingness to cap output yet, saying Libya's humanitarian problems must be considered in any talks on the subject.

NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla added Libya could assist with efforts to stabilize the market by informing OPEC about its plans to restore production.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil dipped on Monday, paring some earlier losses triggered by rising drilling activity in the United States and no let-up in supply growth from both OPEC and non-OPEC exporters, but the outlook remained gloomy.
Brent crude futures were last down 11 cents on the day at $46.60 a barrel by 1430 GMT, while U.S. crude futures were last down 13 cents at $44.10 a barrel.
""The market is in trouble and looks very vulnerable to lower numbers,"" PVM brokerage said in a note.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has agreed with some non-OPEC members to curtail production until March 2018 but the move has failed to eliminate a global glut of crude.
Several key OPEC ministers will meet non-OPEC Russia on July 24 in St Petersburg, Russia, to discuss the situation in oil markets. 
Kuwait said on Sunday that Nigeria and Libya had been invited to the meeting and their production could be capped earlier than November, when OPEC is scheduled to hold formal talks, according to Bloomberg.
Libya said on Monday it was ready for dialogue but added that its political, economic and humanitarian situation should be taken into account in talks on caps.

""The simple truth is that OPEC and Russia have to contend with the fact is that there is output growth elsewhere diluting their efforts at reducing supply,"" the bank said in a note.
""We thus have made deep cuts to our crude oil price forecasts. We now see the price of WTI averaging $49/bbl in 2017 (-$8/bbl revision) and that of Brent $51/bbl (-$9/bbl revision).""

975,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2017 09:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Pakistan sees bigger LNG profile; imports to surge by 2022,"By Drazen Jorgic
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan says it could become one of the world's top-five buyers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with Petroleum Minister Shahid Abbasi predicting imports could jump more than fivefold as private companies build new LNG terminals.
Outlining Pakistan's ambitious plans - which, if fully implemented, could shake up the global LNG market - Abbasi told Reuters that imports could top 30 million tonnes by 2022, up from just 4.5 million tonnes currently.
Cheaper than fuel oil and cleaner burning than coal, LNG suits emerging economies seeking to bridge electricity shortfalls and support growth on tight budgets.
""Within five years, I don't see any reason why we should not be beyond 30 million tonnes (in annual LNG imports). We will be one of the top five markets in the world,"" Abbasi said.
That kind of jump would represent one of the fastest growth stories in the energy industry, comparable to what China has done in many commodities - but there are doubts whether Pakistan can achieve its ambitions, given the complexity and cost of expansion projects.
""It's always possible, but seems very difficult as they will need much more (regasification) capacity and downstream pipeline capacity,"" said Trevor Sikorski at Energy Aspects, a London-based industry market researcher. ""There are infrastructural issues and financial issues.""
""Still, it is one of the key LNG growth markets, and its demand will help tighten up the market that has threatened to lurch into over supply.""
Abbasi said no one took Pakistan seriously after a decade of botched attempts to bring LNG to the country, but this has changed with the construction of new LNG terminals and gas plants. He said foreign suppliers are now arriving in Pakistan - where energy shortages have prompted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to promise he'll end the country's frequent blackouts.
""Before, we used to go out to talk to LNG suppliers. Now they're coming to us,"" Abbasi said.
""(LNG) is really what has saved the whole energy system. It has been a huge success in Pakistan and it will continue,"" he said after Sharif on Friday inaugurated a new Chinese-built LNG power plant that uses  General Electric  (N:GE) turbines.
GETTING CONNECTED
Pakistan built its first LNG terminal in 2015 and, after some delays, a second terminal is due to come online in October, doubling annual import capacity to about 9 million tonnes.
A consortium of  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM),  Total  (PA:TOTF), Mitsubishi (T:8058), Qatar Petroleum and Norway's Hoegh (OL:HLNGH) is expected to decide by September whether to build a third LNG terminal for about $700 million, Abbasi said.
Pakistan has dropped plans to finance up to two more terminals, as private companies have said they would finance these themselves and use Pakistan's existing gas network to sell directly to consumers.
""That's been the real success and that's where the growth will come from,"" Abbasi said, adding that about 10 million homes are linked to gas connections in Pakistan - a nation of around 200 million.
""In the last four years, we would have added two million additional connections. We are really ramping that up.""
If Pakistan achieves its ambitious development goals, it could significantly erode market oversupply, which has helped pull down Asian LNG spot prices by more than 70 percent since 2014 to around $5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).
Abbasi said Pakistan is in talks with Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Oman about government-to-government deals for up to three monthly LNG cargoes for its second terminal, which can import 600 million cubic feet of gas per day, equal to six cargoes a month.
""We have a basic idea of what the market is. So if we are able to better those prices through negotiated procurement, we will go with that, otherwise we might float some more tenders,"" Abbasi said.
Tenders for two of the terminal's six cargoes have already been won by trading house Gunvor and Italy's Eni (MI:ENI), which have signed 5-year and 15-year deals, respectively. The contracts are worth about $5 billion over their lifetime.
Qatar supplies most of the gas for Pakistan's first LNG terminal.
Abbasi said Pakistan is considering inviting private investors to build small-scale gas power plants to add another 3,000-4,000 megawatts to the network, on top of the three new LNG plants that will contribute 3,600 MW.

977,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2017 09:16AM ET</span>","Eurofer ups EU steel demand forecast, warns on 'disastrous' U.S. tariff plan","By Maytaal Angel
LONDON (Reuters) - European steel association Eurofer raised its 2017 EU steel demand forecast on Monday but said isolationist measures such as a U.S. plan to levy steel tariffs on national security grounds could be disastrous for global trade flows.
Eurofer said apparent EU steel demand, which includes inventory changes, will rise 1.9 percent this year to 159 million tonnes. It previously forecast demand, seen as a gauge of regional economic health, would rise 1.3 percent in 2017.
Despite the raised forecast, the association issued its starkest warning yet about potential import distortions, saying regions mills could again fail to benefit from demand growth and instead lose market share to imports. 
""With no structural solutions for the underlying problem of global overcapacity in sight, the number of protectionist and even isolationist measures look set to increase,"" Eurofer director general Axel Eggert said in a statement. 
""In particular, measures potentially stemming from the U.S. section 232 investigation may lead to a proliferation of disastrous global trade flow distortions.""
The United States launched a ""section 232"" probe in April into whether imports of steel, the second biggest industry in the world after oil and gas, posed a risk to national security. 
Though the move is aimed primarily at top global steel producer China, Eurofer fears EU countries will bear the brunt of the measures because Chinese steel is already largely subject to U.S. restrictions.
It is also concerned that steel headed for U.S. shores will be re-routed to the EU.
Invoking national security in peacetime is seen by trade experts as a move that risks undermining the global rules-based trading system by sparking retaliatory action around the world in products beyond steel.
At a weekend summit in Germany, leaders from the world's 20 leading economies set an August deadline for an OECD-led global forum to compile information about steel overcapacity, with a report on potential solutions due in November.
Eurofer expects apparent EU steel demand to moderate to a 1 percent growth rate next year, as the impact of economic stimulus measures fade. The association previously forecast demand would grow 1.2 percent next year.
European steel prices     fell some 10 percent in the second quarter thanks to high inventories and increased import pressure. Prices rose some 50 percent in 2016.
Although China cut some 65 million tonnes of steel capacity in 2016 and aims to cut another 50 million tonnes this year, its trading partners say much of the cuts cover already idled capacity and that the problem of unfairly traded steel remains.
Chinese steel exports [MTL/CHINA3] fell 25.7 percent in the first five months of this year. However, the country still accounts for about a quarter of global steel exports and about half of the world's spare steelmaking capacity.

U.S. natural gas for August delivery was at $2.916 per million British thermal units by 9:11AM ET (1311GMT), up 5.0 cents, or around 1.8%.
Natural gas saw a loss of roughly 5.6% last week amid bearish weather forecasts.
Updated weather forecasting models released over the weekend showed temperatures over most of the country will warm back into the upper 90s to 100s Fahrenheit this week.
Longer-term models showed the western, central, and southern U.S. will be very warm to hot through July 23, as high pressure dominates.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.888 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 9.0% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 6.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 51 and 61 billion cubic feet in the week ended July 7.
That compares with a gain of 72 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 64 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 72 billion cubic feet.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The world might be heading for an oil supply shortage following a steep drop in investments and a lack of fresh conventional discoveries, Saudi Aramco's chief executive said on Monday.
Unconventional shale oil and alternative energy resources are an important factor to help meet future demand but it is premature to assume that they can be developed quickly to replace oil and gas, Amin Nasser told a conference in Istanbul.
""If we look at the long-term situation of oil supplies, for example, the picture is becoming increasingly worrying,"" Nasser said.
""Financial investors are shying away from making much needed large investments in oil exploration, long-term development and the related infrastructure.  Investments in smaller increments such as shale oil will just not cut it,"" Nasser said.
About $1 trillion in investments have already been lost since a decline in oil prices from 2014. Studies show that 20 million barrels per day of new production will be needed to meet demand growth and offset natural decline of developed fields over the next five years, he said. 
""New discoveries are also on a major downward trend. The volume of conventional oil discovered around the world over the past four years has more than halved compared with the previous four,"" Nasser said.
State oil giant Aramco, which is preparing to sell around 5 percent in itself next year in an initial public offering, is continuing to invest in maintaining its oil production capacity of 12 million barrels per day.
""We plan to invest more than $300 billion over the coming decade to reinforce our pre-eminent position in oil, maintain our spare oil production capacity, and pursue a large exploration and production program centering on conventional and unconventional gas resources,"" Nasser said.

Nasser said that one of Aramco's priorities was ""direct conversion of crude oil into petrochemicals"" while adding the company was also focusing on solar and wind projects.

The report came after U.S. government data revealed that total domestic crude production rose by 88,000 barrels a day to around 9.34 million barrels at the end of last week.
The increase in U.S. drilling activity and shale production has mostly offset efforts by OPEC and other producers to cut output in a move to prop up the market.
In May, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude August contract rose 0.86% to $44.61 a barrel. Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for September delivery was last quoted up 0.51% to $47.07 a barrel.
Fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Meanwhile, investors will keep an eye out for monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency to assess global supply and demand levels. In the week ahead, investors will focus on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's testimony on monetary policy as well as U.S. data on inflation and retail sales, due out on Friday, and trade data from China on Thursday.
Last week, oil prices fell sharply on Friday to log their sixth weekly loss in the past seven weeks, as concerns over a glut in the market continued to weigh on sentiment.
For the week, WTI lost $1.81, or about 3.9%, while Brent fell $2.06, or roughly 4.2%, their sixth such loss in seven weeks.
U.S. drillers added seven oil rigs in the week to July 7, energy services company Baker Hughes announced on Friday. This brings the total count up to 763, the most since April 2015.
The report came after U.S. government data revealed that total domestic crude production rose by 88,000 barrels a day to around 9.34 million barrels at the end of last week, underlining concern that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production is derailing efforts by other major producers to rebalance the market.
In May, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.
Russia, which is cooperating with OPEC in a deal to stem production, said it was ready to consider revising parameters of the deal if needed.
Oil ministers from five countries monitoring the deal plus Saudi Arabia will meet on July 24 in Russia, when they could recommend adjusting the pact.
OPEC officials have been talking about whether production by Libya and Nigeria should be capped, although such a step would face resistance from those countries.

Mohammad Barkindo, who was speaking to journalists in Istanbul before the World Petroleum Congress, said such discussions would be premature, Interfax reported.
The Joint OPEC-Non-OPEC Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), set up to monitor the global deal on oil output curbs, meets on July 24 in the Russian city of St Petersburg.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, such as Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from January 2017 until the end of March 2018 to reduce bloated inventories and prop up prices.
But oil prices (LCOc1) have fallen since May, as oil production from the United States and other producers not bound by the pact has risen. Oil output from two OPEC members, Nigeria and Libya, both exempt from the limits, has also climbed.
Energy ministers from Saudi Arabia, Russia and several other key producers have previously said there was no need for immediate extra measures to support oil prices.
But Russia's Energy Ministry said on Friday that Moscow was ready to consider proposals, including revising the deal, if needed.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told Reuters last week that the monitoring committee, which will discuss the deal implementation and market situation, had the authority to recommend ""any decisions"" to participants.

987,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2017 02:30PM ET</span>","Oil could hit $60 before year-end: Barron's, citing Citi analyst","(Reuters) - Accelerating world oil demand and reduced supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) could push crude prices up to $60 a barrel before the end of the year, according to a report from Barron's.
The report cites research from  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) senior energy analyst Eric Lee, who previously called for a bear market in oil when the price was above $100. The decline in recent weeks to a low of just over $44 for Brent crude (LCOc1), the international benchmark, has made Lee a short-term bull, Barron's notes.
Lee projects demand of 97.3 million barrels a day in 2017, a record high, up from 96 million in 2016, driven largely by emerging market countries such as China and India. Simultaneously, reduction in supply from OPEC of about 0.7 million barrels a day versus the 2016 average should drive the price up before the end of the fourth quarter.
A decline in global oil inventories began after the first quarter, and Lee projects that it will continue at an accelerated rate through the end of this year.
Oil prices settled nearly 3 percent lower on Friday as rising U.S. production and an increase in OPEC exports to a 2017 high cast doubt on efforts by producers to curb a persistent glut. [O/R] On Friday Reuters data showed that OPEC production is now at the highest level of the year.
Matt Smith, director of commodity research at Clipperdata, said OPEC exports were 2 million barrels per day (bpd) higher last month than in June 2016, despite the extension of OPEC's 1.8 million bpd production cut.
Lee notes that oil speculators ignored details of OPEC's agreement, which ordered cuts to begin at the end of 2016 rather than when the accord was announced. That allowed participants to ramp up production during negotiations, which meant the cuts were struck from a higher base.
As for supply from the United States, Lee says continued pumping by producers will keep prices from skyrocketing back towards $100 a barrel, but their presence is unlikely to prevent an upward move in oil for the remainder of the year.

Following the jump to $60 Lee expects prices to remain flat heading into 2018, as the supply side catches up with demand. Barring major political disruptions from petroleum-producing nations, he expects the price of crude probably will not rise much above $60.

988,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 09, 2017 06:52AM ET</span>",Gold / Silver / Copper futures - weekly outlook: July 10 - 14,"Investing.com - Gold prices dropped to almost four-month lows on Friday after a stronger-than-forecast U.S. jobs report boosted the dollar against a basket of the other major currencies.
Gold futures for August delivery ended down 0.93% at $1,211.98 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the lowest close since March 15.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.21% to 95.78 late Friday.
Gold and the dollar typically move in opposite directions, which means if the dollar goes down, gold futures, which are denominated in the U.S. currency, will rise.
The U.S. economy added 222,000 jobs last month the Labor Department reported, more than the 179,000 new jobs expected by economists.
Figures for April and May were also revised to show that 47,000 more jobs were created than previously reported.
The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% from a 16-year low of 4.3% in May, as more people looked for work, a sign of confidence in the labor market.
The rapid pace of jobs growth reassured investors that the economy is on a strong enough footing to justify the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates once more this year.
The Fed hiked rates at its June meeting and stuck to its forecast for one more rate hike this year, but the subdued inflation outlook has raised doubts over whether officials will be able to stick to their planned tightening path.
Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar.
Elsewhere in precious metals trading, silver futures fell 2.49% to $15.58 a troy ounce late Friday, its lowest close since April 1 2016.
The steep losses came after silver plunged almost 10% in a flash-crash late Thursday before reversing most of that decline.
Copper was down 0.39% to $2.651 a pound, platinum eased 0.14% to $909.00 and palladium rose 0.57% to $836.98 an ounce.

The field is being developed by state-run Maysan Oil Company which oversees the oil and natural gas industry in the namesake region, the ministry said in a statement.
OPEC's second largest producer, after Saudi Arabia, Iraq seeks to boost its production capacity to 5 million barrels per day by the end of the year, from about 4.7 million bpd now.
The country produces 4.3 million bpd, lower than its capacity, in line with an agreement between oil exporting countries to curb supply in order to support crude prices.
Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi attended the well drilling launch at Huwaiza and also a ceremony marking the beginning of the expansion work in the Halfaya oil field, also in Maysan, according to separate oil ministry statements on Sunday.
The expansion will double Halfaya's capacity in 2018 to 400,000 barrels per day. The field is operated by PetroChina.

 Colombia, the world's third largest coffee producer after Brazil and Vietnam, recorded a harvest of 14.2 million bags in 2016, the highest in the last 23 years. For this year, a harvest of at least 14.5 million bags was expected.
 ""I'm very afraid for the second half of the year,"" Roberto Velez, head of the National Coffee Growers Federation, told Reuters. ""I think we're going to be under 14 million bags.""
 Colombia's coffee harvest fell 3 percent in the first half compared with the same period in 2016, to 6.37 million bags, mainly due to rainfall and cloudiness in the producing areas.
 ""It's not the water, it's the cloudiness that prevents the sun getting in, without sunshine the plants don't bloom and don't bear fruit,"" he said.
 Between 2009 and 2012, Colombia, recognized for its mild and high quality coffees, failed to meet its coffee production target due to heavy rains and a fall in the harvest due to a coffee plantation renewal program.
 Colombia's coffee plantations cover some 930,000 hectares of land and about 560,000 families depend on coffee growing for their livelihood.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 2.5 percent on Friday after data showed U.S. production and rig counts rose last week just as OPEC exports hit a 2017 high, casting doubt over efforts by producers to curb global oversupply.
Benchmark Brent futures (LCOc1) were down $1.36, or 2.8 percent, to $46.75 a barrel at 1:35 p.m. EDT (1735 GMT), after falling to $46.28, the lowest in more than a week.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) traded down $1.28, or 2.8 percent, at $44.24 a barrel, after falling to $43.78. 
After rising earlier in the week, both benchmarks were headed to weekly drops of more than 2.5 percent, a sixth weekly decline in the past seven. 
""The stream of relentless supply continues,"" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at Clipperdata. 
He noted OPEC exports were 2 million barrels a day higher in June than in 2016, despite a May extension of a 1.8 million barrel a day production cut led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
""We’ve seen exports last month from OPEC much stronger than they were in April and May, seemingly indifferent to the OPEC production cut deal,"" Smith said.
Reuters oil data showed OPEC production is now at the highest level this year.
Russia, which is cooperating with OPEC in a deal to stem production, said it was ready to consider revising parameters of the deal if needed.
A group of oil-producing countries monitoring the deal will meet on July 24 in Russia, when they could recommend adjusting the pact.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for August delivery lost 2.8% to settle at $44.23 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent fell by 3.08% to trade at $46.65 a barrel.
The number of active U.S. oil rigs climbed by 7 to 763 rigs this week, according to data from Baker Hughes released Friday, confounding some expectations that the rig count would continue to fall, following last week’s decline, which was the first drop since January.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Adding to negative sentiment on oil, was a report from the Energy Information Administration showing that total U.S. production edged up by 88,000 barrels to 9.338 million barrels a day.
The slump in crude prices comes a day after investors’ hopes that Opec and its allies’ efforts to rein in excess supply were dashed, as the oil-cartel’s exports rose in May for the second month in row.
Despite the current production-cut agreement, Opec exported 25.92 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, 450,000 bpd more than in May and 1.9 million bpd more than a year earlier.
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year."

Average hourly earnings were up 2.5 per cent year-over-year missing economists’ forecasts for a 2.6 per cent increase.
The latest batch of mostly upbeat jobs data, fuelled expectations that the Fed would continue with its plan to hike rates later this year, spurring an uptick in both the dollar and bond yields while decreasing demand for the precious metal.

LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC delegates said on Friday they were encouraged by Russia's openness to talking about changes to an OPEC-led deal to cut oil supplies, opening the door to more steps being considered to clear a global supply glut. 
OPEC and allied non-OPEC producers such as Russia agreed to limit oil supply into 2018, but crude prices (LCOc1) have fallen since May, partly because of higher production from Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC members exempt from cutting output.
Key energy ministers, including those for Saudi Arabia and Russia, have previously said there was no immediate need for extra measures to support oil prices.
But on Friday, Russia's Energy Ministry said Moscow was ready to consider proposals, including revising the deal if need be.
OPEC delegates told Reuters that while no concrete discussions about further steps were talking place now, the Russian comments gave a positive basis for ideas, such as a larger cut, to be considered.
""Encouraging indications from Russia for such thoughts like deeper cuts give better justification to promote and develop such ideas to rebalance markets,"" one source close to OPEC said. ""It provides a good basis, but no discussion is there yet.""
Oil ministers from five countries monitoring the deal plus Saudi Arabia as OPEC president are scheduled to meet in Russia on July 24. They could recommend adjusting the pact to the wider group, which holds its next meeting in November.
OPEC officials have been talking about whether production by Libya and Nigeria should be capped, although such a step would face resistance from those countries.
In addition, OPEC also looked at a larger production cut at its last meeting held in May, only to reject it. Both ideas will probably be looked at again at the meeting this month in the form of scenarios, OPEC sources said.
But one OPEC delegate said additional steps were unlikely to win sufficient support now from enough of the 24 OPEC and non-OPEC countries participating because the existing agreement runs until March 2018.

""I don't think the member countries are ready to do anything more,"" the delegate said. ""Let's wait and see how the agreement works.""

1000,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2017 08:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Aztec golden wolf sacrifice yields rich trove in Mexico City,"By David Alire Garcia
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A sacrificial wolf elaborately adorned with some of the finest Aztec gold ever found and buried more than five centuries ago has come to light in the heart of downtown Mexico City, once home to the Aztec empire's holiest shrines.
The quality and number of golden ornaments is highly unusual and includes 22 complete pieces - such as symbol-laden pendants, a nose ring and a chest plate - all made from thin sheets of the precious metal, lead archaeologist Leonardo Lopez told Reuters. 
Held in a stone box, the cache was discovered in April near the capital city's bustling main square, the Zocalo, behind the colonial-era Roman Catholic cathedral and off the steps of what was once the most important Aztec ceremonial temple, now known as the Templo Mayor.
""These are, without a doubt, the largest and most refined pieces of gold discovered so far,"" said Lopez, referring to the 205 offerings discovered over nearly four decades of excavations around the site, 16 of which have contained some gold.
Not long after the roughly eight-month-old wolf was killed, it was likely dressed with golden ornaments as well as a belt of shells from the Atlantic Ocean, then carefully placed in a stone box by Aztec priests above a layer of flint knives, according to Lopez.
The west-facing wolf represented Huitzilopochtli, the Aztec war god and solar deity. Wolves were believed to help guide fallen warriors across a dangerous river in the netherworld.
The Templo Mayor would have been as high as a 15-story building before it was razed along with the rest of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan after the 1521 Spanish conquest of Mexico.
Measuring about 12-1/2 cubic feet, the trove was also filled with other layers of once-living offerings from the air, land and sea, all infused with spiritual meaning for the Aztecs.
""What they're doing is they're communicating with those levels of the environment that they live in because they know that they've been given the gift of life,"" said David Carrasco, a Harvard University historian of religion and Aztec scholar.
Excavations began in the densely-packed area after the demolition of two buildings that once covered the site.
The box was damaged in 1900 when a sewage line was laid down next to it, Lopez said, and city workers must have had no inkling of what lay inside if they even noticed it at the time.
""If they had seen the golden objects, they would have ransacked it right away,"" he said.
The Aztecs, who called themselves ""Mexica,"" prized gold, though nearly their entire supply was looted by the Spanish and melted into bars for easier transport to Europe. Objects made of jade and feathers of the quetzal were considered even more valuable.
Quetzal birds are native to Central America and the male grows a long, brilliant green tail feather that was especially valuable to the Aztecs.
The golden wolf was buried during the 1486-1502 reign of King Ahuitzotl, the most feared and powerful ruler of the Mexica, who extended the empire as far south as present-day Guatemala. The reign of Ahuitzotl was particularly brutal, which may also explain the fate of the young wolf.
Lopez said tests on its ribs will be needed to confirm his theory that the animal's heart was torn out as part of the sacrifice, just as captured warriors were ritually killed on blood-soaked platforms of Aztec temples.
But this was no ordinary violence, noted Carrasco.

""These people didn't just kill these things. They didn't just kill people and throw them away,"" he said. ""They took elaborate, symbolic care for them because they knew that the presence that they represented, the presence of god, had to be nurtured.""

On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the September Brent lost 2.95% to $46.71 a barrel, also the lowest since June 28.
 The Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories fell by 6.299 million barrels in the week ended June 30, compared to expectations for a drawdown of 2.28 million barrels.
However, the upbeat report was offset by news of a 1% increase in weekly U.S. oil production to 9.34 million barrels per day (bpd).
The data came a day after the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. crude inventories fell by 5.8 million barrels in the week ended June 30 to 503.7 million.
Oil markets remain oversupplied despite a pledge by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production from January of this year until March 2018 in a bid to support the market.
Data on Wednesday showed that exports by OPEC rose for a second month in June, adding to doubts over whether the group can do enough to tighten the market.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2017 07:33PM ET</span>","U.S. to speed approval for oil, gas exploration on federal land","By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Thursday signed an order to hold more lease sales and to speed up approving permits to explore for oil and gas on federal land, a process he said got bogged down under former President Barack Obama.
The order is the latest move by the administration of President Donald Trump to make it easier to drill and mine on federal land, which Zinke said is a source of income for the government.
The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management is supposed to take 30 days to review applications for permits to drill but Zinke said the average time for processing in 2016 was 257 days.
""I'm directing the BLM to conduct quarterly lease sales and address these permitting issues,"" Zinke said in a statement. ""We are also looking at opportunities to bring support to our front line offices who are facing the brunt of this workload.""
There were 2,802 permit applications pending as of Jan. 31, with three quarters of them filed in five field offices in Wyoming, Utah, North Dakota and New Mexico.
On a call with reporters, Zinke did not say how long this streamlining process would take.
""This is not going to be done overnight. What we don’t want is unintended consequences,"" he said.
Environmental groups criticized the announcement and said that companies have already leased vast amounts of public lands but have held off on drilling due to record low oil prices.
""With historically low gas prices, these companies aren’t using millions of acres of leases they already have, so there’s no reason to hand over even more,” said Chris Saeger, executive director of the Western Values Project.
The group pointed to Interior Department data that showed that oil production on federal land increased by 77 percent between 2008 and 2015.
The Independent Petroleum Association of America, a lobby group for independent drillers, welcomed the announcement, which came a week after Zinke met with its president, Barry Russell.

""Reinstating quarterly lease sales is vital as independent producers consider future American energy opportunities on federal lands,"" said Dan Naatz, the group's head of government relations.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for August delivery rose 39 cents to settle at $45.52 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent rose 16 cents to trade at $47.95 a barrel.
Crude prices eased from highs but ultimately settled higher, after an upbeat report from the Energy Information Administration on Thursday, spurred a recovery in oil prices from a 4% drop sustained in the previous session, as both gasoline and crude stocks piles fell more than expected.
Inventories of U.S. crude fell by roughly 6.3m barrels in the week ended June 30, confounding expectations  of draw of about only 2.3m barrels.
Gasoline inventories, one of the products that crude is refined into, unexpectedly fell by roughly 3.7m barrels against expectations of a rise of 1.067m barrels while distillate stockpiles  fell by 1.85m barrels, compared to expectations of a rise of 217,000 barrels.
Despite the larger-than-expected draw in gasoline inventories, investor sentiment on gasoline inventories remain bearish as weak gasoline demand has pushed stockpiles above seasonal averages.
Oil prices have dipped below $50 a barrel from recent highs amid growing investor doubts about Opec and its allies’ commitment to drain the glut in supply, as members of the oil-cartel have increased exports and production, despite the current deal to curb output.
Some analysts, however, expect oil prices to rally in the second half of the year, as demand is likely to outpace supply, causing a dent in global inventories. 
“My main view [the market has become too negative] is based on [a forecast] that supply growth will lag behind demand growth in the third quarter and that we should see large inventory declines,” UBS commodity analyst Giovanni Staunovo. said. “Historically we have seen a negative correlation between inventory dynamics and price dynamics.”"

Crude oil for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained $1.17, or 2.59%, to trade at $46.30 a barrel by 11:03AM ET (15:03GMT) compared to $45.87 ahead of the report.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 6.299 million barrels in the week ended June 30. Market analysts' had expected a crude-stock draw of 2.283 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Wednesday reported a supply draw of 5.674 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 1.334 million barrels last week, the EIA said. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 502.9 million barrels as of last week, according to press release, which the EIA considered to be “in the upper half of the average range for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories decreased by 3.669 million barrels, compared to expectations for a draw of 1.067 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles fell by 1.850 million barrels, compared to forecasts for an increase of 0.217 million.
The report came out one day later than usual due to Tuesday’s Independence Day holiday.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for September delivery traded up $1.29, or 2.70%, to $49.08 by 11:08AM ET (15:08GMT), compared to $48.52 before the release.
Meanwhile, Brent's premium to the WTI crude contract stood at $2.65 a barrel by 11:09AM ET (15:09GMT), compared to a gap of $2.66 by close of trade on Wednesday.
Thursday’s strong rebound came after oil tumbled around 4% in the prior session after data showing that exports by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose for a second month in June, adding to doubts over whether the group can do enough to tighten the market.
The Reuters’ report showed an uptick in OPEC exports for June to 25.92 million barrels per day (bpd), up 450,000 bpd from May, and 1.9 million bpd more than a year ago.
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year.
The group's efforts to rebalance the market have been undermined by rising production from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from the output-cut agreement and by increasing shale production in the U.S.
Adding to Wednesday’s bearish sentiment was a Bloomberg report saying that Russia doesn’t want to change the current deal because any further supply curbs would send the wrong message to the market, according to government officials."

1011,By Business Insider,"<span>Jul 06, 2017 09:37AM ET</span>","Oil, gas, and coal industries get a shocking amount of funding from the US government, a new report shows","A new report shows that the US government provided about $6 billion annually in financial support to the oil, gas, and coal industries between 2013 and 2015. That's over four times the amount that went to clean energy, which received $1.3 billion.
The report, released July 5, is the product of research conducted by Oil Change International, Friends of the Earth, the Sierra Club, and the World Wildlife Fund's European Policy Office. Their goal was to parse out the amount of public financing — defined as grants, equity, loans, guarantees, and insurance from majority government-owned financial institutions— that various G20 countries have given to domestic and international energy production.
Data came from Oil Change International's ""Shift the Subsidies Database,"" which tracks public financial flow to fossil fuel industries from 2008 until the present. According to that database, the US provided $832 million annually to coal and $5 billion to oil and gas. (It was not possible to determine the split between coal, oil, and gas for the remaining $160 million.)
The US also received $17.5 billion in fossil fuel financing from other G20 countries.
When ranked with the other countries, the US was fourth on the list in total dollars contributed to coal, oil and gas. The top contributors to fossil fuel industries were Japan (with $16.5 billion to fossil fuels and $2.7 to clean energy), China, and South Korea.
Germany, Canada and Brazil followed the US in the list. 
“Our research shows that the G20 still hasn’t put its money where its mouth is when it comes to the clean energy transition,"" Alex Doukas, a senior campaigner at Oil Change International and one of the report’s authors, said in a press release.
The environmental groups behind the report hope that drawing attention to this data will spur countries to transition to investing more in renewables and less in fossil fuels.
""The Paris Agreement should lead policymakers to refocus public finance on energy savings and sustainable renewable energy, which actually offer effective solutions to our future energy challenges,"" Sebastien Godinot, an economist with the WWF European Policy Office, said in a statement.
The study estimates that 85% of known fossil fuel reserves must remain in the ground for the world to meet the goals set in the Paris Agreement (to keep the Earth's temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages). However, the report found that of the total $71.8 billion that G20 countries provide to fossil fuel industries, $13.5 billion goes to activities that fund exploration for more reserves of oil, gas, and coal.
""The best climate science points to an urgent need to transition to clean energy, but public finance from G20 governments drags us in the opposite direction,"" Doukas said. ""We must stop funding fossils and shift these subsidies.""

U.S. natural gas for August delivery was at $2.883 per million British thermal units by 8:50AM ET (1250GMT), up 4.1 cents, or around 1.5%.
It sank almost 4% on Wednesday to notch its fourth losing session in a row after sliding to the lowest level since March 7 at $2.832.
Temperatures are likely to be mostly normal in the eastern third of the U.S. during the next two weeks, according to updated weather forecasting models, underlining concern over decreased summer demand in the weeks ahead.
Prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.816 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 6.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Friday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 57 and 69 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 30.
That compares with a gain of 46 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 39 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 66 billion cubic feet.
The report comes out one day later than usual due to the U.S. Independence Day holiday earlier this week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices retreated about 4 percent on Wednesday, ending their longest bull-run in more than five years, as climbing OPEC exports and a stronger dollar turned sentiment more bearish.
Brent crude futures ended the session down $1.82, or 3.7 percent, at $47.79 a barrel. Prices had climbed for eight straight sessions to Monday.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell $1.94, or 4.12 percent, to settle at $45.13 a barrel.

OPEC exported 25.92 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, up 450,000 bpd from May and 1.9 million bpd more than a year earlier. 
The rise in exports came despite OPEC's vow to rein in production until March 2018 and followed hot on the heels of Reuters' monthly OPEC production survey which found output jumped to a 2017 high last month as OPEC members Nigeria and Libya continued to pump more.
Nigeria and Libya are both exempt from the output pact.

Another analyst said the strong dollar provided less incentive to invest in greenback-denominated commodities such as crude oil. The dollar pared some of its early gains but was still up versus a basket of currencies ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve's minutes on its June policy meeting.
The head of the International Energy Agency told Reuters that rising output from key oil producers could hamper expectations that the oil market would rebalance in the second half of the year.
The bearish outlook also led Saxo Bank to cut its year-end Brent crude price forecast to $53 a barrel from $58.
However, some technical signs could lead to a recovery, traders and analysts said.
""The longer term moving average systems need stronger moves over $51.50 in Brent and $49 to $49.50 in WTI which is where the 100-day and 200-day moving averages are,"" said Scott Shelton, broker at ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Durham, North Carolina.
""Spending more time up here to get the shorter term moving averages to cross would also generate buying.""
Traders were also eyeing U.S. crude inventory data, delayed by a day due to the U.S. Fourth of July holiday, which is forecast to show a drop of 2.3 million barrels for last week.

U.S. oil traders are hoping the sweltering days of July are also hot ones for demand, and that the new month is the last best opportunity this year to see the overhang of inventories finally subside.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for August delivery fell 4.1% to settle at $45.13 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent dipped by 3.57% to trade at $47.84 a barrel. 
Investors' hopes of deeper production cuts were dashed, after a Bloomberg report said that Russia doesn’t want to change the current deal because any further supply curbs would send the wrong message to the market, according to government officials.
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year. 
Adding to bearish sentiment was data released from Reuters, showing an uptick in Opec exports for June to 25.92m barrels per day (bpd), up 450,000 bpd from May, and 1.9 million bpd more than a year ago. 
The slump in oil prices on Wednesday, ended their longest winning streak in five years and comes ahead of American Petroleum Institute’s oil inventory report due later on Wednesday and the Energy Information Administration’s weekly inventory report due Thursday.

1022,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2017 01:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Energy giants court Qatar for gas expansion role despite crisis,"By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - The West's three biggest energy corporations are lobbying Qatar to take part in a huge expansion of its gas production, handing Doha an unintended but timely boost in its bitter dispute with Gulf Arab neighbors.
The chief executives of ExxonMobil (N:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) all met the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, in Qatar before it announced a plan on Tuesday to raise output of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by 30 percent.
Company and industry sources told Reuters that the CEOs had expressed interest in helping Qatar with its ambition to produce 100 million tonnes of LNG annually - equivalent to a third of current global supplies - in the next five to seven years.
The companies already have large investments in countries on both sides of the dispute, and are keen to remain neutral after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Doha on June 5. [nL8N1JW0KM]
Spokespeople from all three firms declined comment. However, a top executive from one energy major looking into expanding in Qatar said the huge business opportunity was worth the considerable political risk.
""There is only one policy here – you have to behave like a commercial corporation,"" the executive told Reuters. ""You have to make your choices purely economically and be Qatari in Qatar, Emirati in the Emirates.""
Energy sales have powered Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player since the late 1990s, and the oil majors' interest in the LNG expansion underline its longer-term economic muscle during the political row with its neighbors.
Chief executives Darren Woods of Exxon and Ben van Beurden of Shell both met the emir after the four Arab countries imposed the sanctions. Total chief Patrick Pouyanne has also visited Doha in recent weeks.
Qatar, the world's largest LNG supplier and second biggest gas exporter after Russia, has some of the lowest production costs. The plan was seen as an opening shot in a price war as Doha tries to defend its market share, especially against supplies from U.S. shale deposits where costs are higher.
WILLINGNESS TO INVEST
The four Arab countries, which have demanded Qatar stop fostering terrorism and courting Iran, said after meeting on Wednesday that Doha's response to their grievances had been negative.
Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said the political and economic boycott would remain until Qatar improved its policies. Further steps would be taken at the appropriate time, he said. 
Doha denies aiding terrorism and its foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, accused the four of ""clear aggression"" while adding that Qatar continued to call for dialogue to settle the dispute. [nL8N1JW27A] [nL8N1JW1Y1]
Exxon, Shell and Total have already invested extensively in Qatar, particularly in projects to liquefy gas, allowing it to be shipped by tanker to consumer markets where transport by pipeline is not feasible. 
Woods met the emir on June 26, discussing ""cooperation"" with Qatar, where Exxon has been present since 1935, according to a statement carried by the state news agency. 
Industry sources close to the talks said that ""the Exxon CEO was very keen to join the new gas capacity expansion and expressed willingness to invest"".
Woods replaced Rex Tillerson, under whom Exxon helped to build Qatar's LNG industry until he left to become U.S. Secretary of State earlier this year. 
Exxon will be the largest foreign investor in Qatar in 2017, with most money going into LNG facilities, representing around seven percent of its global portfolio, according to consultancy WoodMackenzie.
Shell's Van Beurden was among the first foreign company leaders to visit Qatar after the crisis broke out, meeting the emir on June 14. This was followed several days later by a new deal under which Qatar will supply Shell, the world's largest LNG trader, with 1.1 million tonnes annually for five years starting in 2019.
Shell's operations in Qatar include Pearl GTL, the world's largest gas liquefaction plant. Its overall investments in the state represent around six percent of its global portfolio.
The three firms had been expecting Qatar to expand its LNG exports since it lifted a self-imposed moratorium on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field it shares with Iran, the sources said.
Oil and gas companies generally are no strangers to operating in risky areas. This week Total became the first Western energy firm to invest in Iran since the lifting of sanctions against the country. The project, phase 11 of Iran's South Pars development, draws gas from the same reservoir as Qatar's North Field.[nL8N1JU2W4] 
Total chief Pouyanne discussed new opportunities in the LNG sector as well as the company's plans to develop the Al-Shaheen oil field on his trip to Doha, according to a senior source.
Qatar's LNG capacity could be boosted by up to 10 million tonnes per year relatively quickly and cheaply by optimizing existing facilities and upgrading a small number of units, a process known as ""debottlenecking"", according to a senior industry source.
Beyond that, the expansion would require building new liquefaction terminals involving significant investments, which the energy giants can offer. 
""Qatar LNG is really an important part of their overall portfolio, especially for Exxon but Total and Shell are also material LNG players there,"" Tom Ellacott, analyst at WoodMackenzie said.

    ""Qatar LNG is very competitive. Debottlenecking will be a relatively cheap option to increase capacity, but with the industry at a low point in the cost cycle, it may also be a good time to install new terminals.""

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $2.77, or 0.23%, to $1221.95 a troy ounce.
Gold bounced off session lows, after both the dollar and U.S. 10-Year eased, following the release of downbeat economic data, fuelling concerns about the pace of U.S economic growth.
U.S. factory orders sank 0.8% in May following a smaller decline in April, below analysts’ expectations of a 0.5% decline.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
The report comes ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve’s minutes from its June 13-14 meeting, which many investors are expected to parse for clues about future monetary policy.
The Federal Reserve has previously signalled its intention to raise rates at least once more this year, after hiking rates for the second time this year in June.
Analysts, however, are expecting the minutes to show that Fed members are less hawkish about monetary policy tightening in the wake of a slowdown in inflation.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said they “expect the minutes from the June FOMC meeting to sound more cautious than the statement or press conference as it will likely show differing views on inflation.”
Other precious metals failed to capitalise on the decline in the dollar, as silver futures fell 0.88% to $15.893, a troy ounce while platinum futures lost 0.14% to $907.40.

Natural gas fell sharply on Monday to notch its third losing session in a row, as updated weather forecasting models pointed to decreased summer demand in the weeks ahead.
Prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.816 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 6.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Friday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 57 and 69 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 30.
That compares with a gain of 46 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 39 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 66 billion cubic feet.

1029,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2017 04:48AM ET</span>",Getting scrappy: China iron ore demand may falter as steel recycling grows,"By Manolo Serapio Jr and Muyu Xu
MANILA/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's supply of steel scrap is surging as aged buildings, bridges and cars produced over decades of rapid economic growth are knocked down, dismantled or crushed.
That should push Chinese steelmakers to use more of the material in coming years, potentially sapping demand for steel ingredient iron ore from the world's biggest metals consumer.
Faltering appetite for iron ore could hit a critical lifeline for international mining giants which have banked on China continuing to suck up hundreds of millions of tons of the most widely traded bulk commodity. 
""In the medium to long term, scrap is the real threat to iron ore, for sure,"" said Daniel Meng, an analyst at brokerage CLSA in Hong Kong. 
""We believe by 2020, replacement would become faster and the risk on iron ore from scrap would become more serious.""
China currently only produces around 11 percent of its steel from scrap, compared to over 70 percent in the United States, suggesting it may have plenty of room to grow in recycling the material.
The recent abundance of scrap in China followed Beijing's decision to shut mills churning out low-quality steel from induction furnaces - typically big users of scrap - as part of its drive against pollution and a glut in steel supply.
The closure of these mills, with a combined production capacity of 120 million tons, helped push the nation's scrap exports to an all-time high in May.
China last year generated a record 143 million tons of steel scrap, up nearly fourfold from 2002, data from the World Steel Association and CLSA showed. 
That could potentially replace around 200 million tons of iron ore, equivalent to about a fifth of China's imports of the commodity last year.
China's steel scrap generation should rise to 200 million tons by 2020, the China Association of Metal Scrap Utilization said.
ELECTRIFYING
The bulk of China's steel is produced via blast furnaces where iron ore is melted and later mixed with steel scrap. 
As domestic scrap prices  tumbled 20 percent in May from this year's peak, mills increased scrap use in these furnaces to 20 percent from 8 percent, Chinese traders and mills said. But as demand picked up in June, some scrap traders say profits have doubled.
And renewed interest in electric arc furnaces (EAFs), or mini-mills that use only scrap, could fire up demand for recycled steel.
EAFs emit far less carbon than blast furnaces, which use coal as fuel, suiting China's anti-pollution campaign.
""In the long term, I believe the authorities do support EAFs in China,"" said Wang Guangrui, vice-general manager at Xuzhou Jinhong Steel Group in Jiangsu province, which restarted a 1-million-ton EAF.
The company first launched its EAF in 2011, but was forced to shut it to switch to a much cheaper induction furnace. It moved back to the EAF after the closure of all the nation's induction furnaces.
Up to 20 million tons in EAF capacity may be installed this year, said CLSA's Meng. China's current EAF capacity is around 100 million tons and could grow by 10-20 million tons a year over the next three years, he said.
Over 60 EAFs will be running in August-October and 20 more next year, said Guo Xianzhen, vice general manager at Anyang Steel Group which plans to launch a 1-million-ton capacity EAF in September and another 1 million-ton plant in 2018.
But Australia's  Fortescue Metals  Group (AX:FMG), the world's No. 4 iron ore miner, believes China's iron ore appetite won't wane any time soon, as its scrap supply - usually tied to growth in car ownership - remains low compared to the size of its population.
""Currently, there are more than 700 vehicles per 1,000 people in the U.S. and Australia, with this figure at around 140 in China,"" Fortescue CEO Nev Power said by email.
""Given the high marginal cost of electricity, the level of scrap contribution will likely be lower overall in China than has been the case in the developed economies,"" he said. 
Top iron ore miners Vale (SA:VALE5),  Rio Tinto  (AX:RIO) (L:RIO) and BHP (AX:BHP) (L:BLT) declined to comment.

""Three percent is too much. I preferred to buy without receipts. The jeweler did not have any problem,"" said a middle-aged buyer, who declined to be identified after making purchases on Monday at the country's biggest bullion market, Zaveri Bazaar in Mumbai.
Smaller shops could be more inclined to sell without receipts, potentially hitting sales at big jewelers that keep to the rules, said Harshad Ajmera, the proprietor of JJ Gold House, a wholesaler in the eastern Indian city Kolkata. 
""Just to save 1 percent, some customers were earlier buying gold without receipts. With the 3-percent GST, now many more will be tempted to make unofficial purchases from small jewelers,"" Ajmera said.
The tax hike could also encourage more smuggling into the world's second biggest gold consumer, which buys almost all its bullion abroad.
Gold smuggling has been rife since India raised import duties on the metal to 10 percent in a series of hikes to August 2013, looking to curb demand to narrow a gaping current account deficit.
The World Gold Council estimates smuggling networks imported up to 120 tonnes of gold into India in 2016.
""The GST rate has increased the incentive to bring in smuggled gold. The government should reduce import duty and make smuggling unviable,"" said Aditya Pethe, a director at Waman Hari Pethe Jewellers in Mumbai.
The country's legal imports typically stand at around 800 tonnes a year, with the metal used in everything from investment to religious donations and wedding gifts.
""A lower import duty would increase legal imports and ultimately legal sales. Tax revenue would go up instead of going down,"" said Daman Prakash Rathod, director at wholesaler MNC Bullion in the southern city of Chennai.

1036,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2017 03:53PM ET</span>",Brent crude stabilizes near $50 a barrel,"By Ahmad Ghaddar
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices flirted with both positive and negative territory on Tuesday, hovering around $50 a barrel on tentative signs that a persistent rise in U.S. crude production may be slowing.
The international benchmark (LCOc1) settled down 7 cents at $49.61 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were trading up 1 cent at $47.08 a barrel.
Both contracts traded lower earlier in the session as many traders closed positions ahead of the U.S. Independence Day holiday on July 4, while Brent also faced technical resistance as it approached $50, traders said.
Despite this, the market's outlook has shifted somewhat.
Late May and most of June were overwhelmingly bearish as U.S. output rose and doubts grew over the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to hold back enough production to tighten the market.
But sentiment began to shift toward the end of June, when data showed a dip in U.S. oil output and a slight fall in drilling for new production.  
""The fact that prices have not come under any noticeable pressure of late points to a shift in sentiment,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said on Tuesday. 
""This may be related to the fact that most of the 'shaky hands' have withdrawn from the market by now,"" the bank added. 
Prices rose in recent days despite OPEC production hitting a 2017 high of 32.72 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, according to a Reuters survey.
The group's efforts to rebalance the market have been undermined by rising production from Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from an output-cutting agreement.
Libya is pumping around 1 million bpd of crude, a four-year high. 
OPEC exports rose for a second month in a row in June to 25.92 million bpd, up 1.9 million bpd from the same month last year, according to Thomson Reuters Oil Research.

""We see a recovery for oil prices in H2 2017 from current levels, with OPEC production cuts, a slowdown in global supply growth and seasonally firming demand driving up prices,"" BMI Research said, although it added that ""large-volume supply additions will keep price growth flat year on year in 2018"".

He said some key producers including Libya and Nigeria had significantly increased output in recent months.
""In the current context we see the market rebalancing in the second half of the year. But if production increases in some of the key producers this may change the picture,"" Birol told Reuters on the sidelines of an Energy Institute event.

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 04, 2017 07:11AM ET</span>",Trump to promote U.S. natgas exports in Russia's backyard,"By Roberta Rampton and Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will use fast-growing supplies of U.S. natural gas as a political tool when he meets in Warsaw on Thursday with leaders of a dozen countries that are captive to Russia for their energy needs.
In recent years, Moscow has cut off gas shipments during pricing disputes with neighboring countries in winter months. Exports from the United States would help reduce their dependence on Russia.
Trump will tell the group that Washington wants to help allies by making it as easy as possible for U.S. companies to ship more liquefied natural gas (LNG) to central and eastern Europe, the White House said.
Trump will attend the ""Three Seas"" summit - so named because several of its members surround the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Seas - before the Group of 20 leading economies meet in Germany, where he is slated to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time.
Among the aims of the Three Seas project is to expand regional energy infrastructure, including LNG import terminals and gas pipelines. Members of the initiative include Poland, Austria, Hungary and Russia's neighbors Latvia and Estonia. 
Trump's presence will give the project a lift, said James Jones, a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander.
Increased U.S. gas exports to the region would help weaken the impact of Russia using energy as a weapon or bargaining chip, said Jones. 
""I think the United States can show itself as a benevolent country by exporting energy and by helping countries that don’t have adequate supplies become more self-sufficient and less dependent and less threatened,"" he said.
Trump's Russia policy is still taking shape, a process made awkward by investigations into intelligence findings that Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Russia denies the allegations and Trump says his team did not collude with Moscow. 
Lawmakers in Trump's Republican Party, many of whom want to see him take a hard line on Russia because of its interference in the election and in crises in Ukraine and Syria, support using gas exports for political leverage.
""It undermines the strategies of Putin and other strong men who are trying to use the light switch as an element of strategic offense,"" said Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado who is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The Kremlin relies on oil and gas revenue to finance the state budget, so taking market share would hurt Moscow.
""In many ways, the LNG exports by the U.S. is the most threatening U.S. policy to Russia,"" said Michal Baranowski, director of the Warsaw office of think-tank the German Marshall Fund.
COMPETITIVE ARENA
The U.S. is expected to become the world's third-largest exporter of LNG in 2020, just four years after starting up its first export terminal. U.S. exporters have sold most of that gas in long-term contracts, but there are still some volumes on offer, and more export projects on the drawing board.
 Cheniere Energy  Inc (A:LNG), which opened the first U.S. LNG export terminal in 2016, delivered its first cargo to Poland in June. Five more terminals are expected to be online by 2020.
Tellurian Inc (O:TELL) has proposed a project with a price tag of as much as $16 billion that it hopes to complete by 2022, in time to compete for long-term contracts to supply Poland that expire the same year and are held by Russian gas giant Gazprom (MM:GAZP).
""We would like to be a supplier that competes for that market,"" Tellurian Chief Executive Meg Gentle told Reuters.
A global glut in supply may, however, limit U.S. LNG export growth, regardless of Trump's support.
The glut has depressed prices and made it difficult for LNG exporters to turn a profit, said Adam Sieminski, an energy analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Russia has the advantage in Europe due to its proximity and pipeline connections.
""Europe is going to be the great competitive arena between Russian gas and LNG,"" said Daniel Yergin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian and vice-chairman with IHS Markit analysis firm.
NORD STREAM
Europeans will be watching to see whether Trump clarifies his administration's position on a new pipeline to pump Russian gas to Germany, known as Nord Stream 2.
The U.S. Senate in June passed a package of sanctions on Russia, including provisions to penalize Western firms involved in the pipeline. The new sanctions have stalled in the House of Representatives.
The U.S. State Department has lobbied against the pipeline as a potential supply chokepoint that would make Europe more vulnerable to disruptions.

The threat of sanctions adds to tensions between Washington and Berlin. Germany's government supports the pipeline, and Trump's position on it is a concern for European diplomats.

Energy services firm Baker Hughes on Friday reported that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil fell by two, the first decline in six months.
Despite the drop in drilling the total rig count was still more than double the 341 rigs in the same week a year ago the firm said.
The report came after figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showing that output fell by 24,000 barrels per day in April, the first drop this year.
But oil markets remain oversupplied despite output cuts brokered by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
In May, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose more than 2 percent on Monday, resuming its longest stretch of daily gains in more than five years after data pointed to diminished U.S. output, though analysts said news of rising OPEC production could cap gains.
Brent crude futures closed up 91 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $49.68 a barrel. The price rose 5.2 percent last week for the first weekly gain in six.
U.S. crude futures closed up $1.03, or 2.2 percent, to $47.07 a barrel, an almost one-month high. U.S. crude futures trading volumes were low a day before the U.S. Independence Day holiday.
Crude was up for an eighth straight session, the longest stretch of gains since February 2012. 
""It’s all about market sentiment,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) senior oil analyst Carsten Fritsch. He cited a 100,000 barrel per day drop in U.S. production due to tropical storms and maintenance, as well as a decline in U.S. rig count. 
""These... (temporary) factors outweigh the sharp increase in OPEC oil production in June... and the continued increase in Libyan and Nigerian output, at least at the moment,"" he said.
Speculators in Brent crude futures and options raised their bets against a sustained price rise to the highest level on record in the latest week. In a note on Friday, Citibank wrote that the managed net long position was the smallest since January 2016. 
After 23 straight weeks of increased rigs, drilling activity for new oil production in the United States fell for the first time since January, dropping by two rigs, while U.S. government data showed crude output fell in April for the first time this year.

The oil price is down more than 12 percent this year, with strong global demand insufficient to absorb rising output from the United States, Nigeria, Brazil, the North Sea and Libya, which has risen to more than 1 million barrels per day.
Output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries hit a 2017 high. June OPEC production rose 280,000 bpd to 32.72 million bpd, a Reuters survey showed, despite the group's pledge to hold back output.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2017 01:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mexico's Pemex sees October selection of refinery coking plant partner - sources,"By Ana Isabel Martinez
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican state oil company Pemex plans to choose a partner at the end of October to finish the development and operate a $2 billion coking plant at its Tula refinery, government and Pemex sources told Reuters.
Pemex is looking for partners to improve the performance of its state-owned refineries, which currently process about 915,000 bpd of crude, well below their combined capacity of 1.6 million bpd.
Pemex had previously planned to select a partner before June but the process has fallen behind schedule ""because of the complexity and the investment needed,"" said a separate industry source with direct knowledge of the project. 
Since May, Pemex has invited 56 companies to bid but will not launch a tender as planned, a Pemex source said, calling the process ""open, competitive and transparent.""
Two years of sagging oil prices and mounting debt have forced the Mexican oil firm to seek equity partners to help fund key projects.
Asked about the partnership plan, a Pemex spokesman said the details provided by sources were correct. 
Japan's Mitsui & Co., Korea's SK Group, Italy's Eni, China's PetroChina and Sinopec, British-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc and U.S. oil major  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) are among the companies interested in the project, sources told Reuters in April.
Pemex has hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) to help in the search for a partner, the Pemex source said.
Tula, like two other Pemex refineries, lacks coking capacity, which boosts production of higher-value fuels like gasoline from Mexico's increasingly heavy crude production.
Interested companies are being asked to present their proposals by the third week of August and Pemex will draw up a shortlist by September, two Pemex sources said. 
The final selection ""will take place in the last week of October,"" the first Pemex source said.
Tula is Pemex's second largest refinery, with a capacity to process 315,000 barrels per day (bpd) but in May processed 228,126 bpd, company data showed.
The new plant will be located adjacent to Pemex's existing Tula refinery, in the central state of Hidalgo. 
In 2015, Pemex said it signed a contract with ICA Fluor for engineering, procurement and construction for an initial phase of projects to boost gasoline and diesel output and reduce fuel oil output by building a coking plant. Reuters was not able to confirm the status of the project with ICA Fluor, a joint venture between construction firm ICA and  Fluor Corp  (NYSE:FLR).

In 2016, the state-owned oil company presented a business plan that included the ""Tolling coker Tula Alliance"" project, as well as partnerships to improve operations and/or reconfigure the Tula, Salamanca and Salina Cruz refineries.

OPEC and allied non-OPEC producers agreed on May 25 to extend an existing supply cut into 2018, but oil has fallen sharply since then on rising production from the United States and from Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC members exempt from cutting output.
Oil ministers from five countries monitoring the deal plus Saudi Arabia as OPEC president are scheduled to meet in Russia on July 24. They could make a recommendation to the wider group, which holds its next meeting in November, on adjusting the pact.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - World No.1 oil exporter Saudi Arabia could raise prices for the heavy crude it sells to Asia in August to the highest in more than three years, trade sources said.
The move would come after refiner profits on churning out fuel oil from heavy crude hit record highs, with state oil giant Saudi Aramco cutting heavy crude production as part of a drive led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to rein in global output.
Saudi Aramco may lift the official selling price (OSP) for Arab Heavy crude to Asia by 20 cents a barrel to $1.65 below the average of Oman and Dubai quotes in August, its narrowest discount since December 2013, according to four Asian crude buyers. 
A fifth trade source surveyed by Reuters said the price for the grade would remain unchanged from this month.
A hike in prices for Saudi heavy crude could buoy demand for such oil from other Middle Eastern producers, as well as supplies from Russia, Angola and the Americas.
""Maybe they (Saudi Aramco) will cut Arab Heavy supplies for August because of the OPEC cut and summer demand for power generation,"" said a trader with a North Asian refiner.
Tighter heavy crude supplies have reduced fuel oil output and helped push profits on making that product in Asia to an all-time high of a 59 cents premium against Dubai crude on June 22.
Meanwhile, the four sources who expected a climb in Saudi heavy crude prices predicted that flagship Arab Light's OSP would fall to a two-month low for August, down 20 cents a barrel after the Dubai market weakened last month.
Saudi crude OSPs are usually released around the fifth of each month, and set the trend for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi prices, affecting more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude bound for Asia.
Saudi Aramco sets its crude prices based on recommendations from customers and after calculating the change in the value of its oil over the past month, based on yields and product prices.
Saudi Aramco officials as a matter of policy do not comment on the kingdom's monthly OSPs.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>",All eyes on July for U.S. oil demand to drain glut,"By Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. oil traders are hoping the sweltering days of July are also hot ones for demand, believing the new month is the last best opportunity this year to see the overhang of inventories finally subside.
Export opportunities to Asia and big U.S. summer driving demand - expected to hit a record this weekend - are seen as the primary drivers for a drawdown in stocks that have remained stubbornly above seasonal averages. 
July is usually a big month for drawdowns: Over the last five years, inventories of crude oil have dropped by an average of 2.9 million barrels per week in July, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
But analysts warn that if inventories do not draw down in earnest, it may dash the hopes of many in the industry of seeing higher prices by the end of this year. 
""Typically June/July represents the seasonal peak in refinery demand for crude,"" said David Thompson, executive vice-president at Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington. ""It gets tougher to use up all that crude as refinery utilization starts to ease off as we move past the peak of summer driving season.""
A record number of motorists are expected to hit the road for the Fourth of July holiday. U.S. gasoline demand was up 0.4 percent in April from the year-ago period, the first year-over-year increase since December, according to the latest U.S. government data.
In addition, a window has opened for U.S. crude exports to Asia, after prices made it uneconomical to send U.S. supplies offshore in recent months. Robust appetite from Japanese and South Korean buyers could help soak up excess supplies.
Investors came into this year optimistic, and indeed, U.S. crude prices (CLc1) topped out near $55 a barrel in February in the wake of the deal struck by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with other key producers to reduce supply by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) that began in January.
But OECD total oil inventories are still above 3 billion barrels due to an unexpected recovery in Libyan and Nigerian supplies and a rebound in U.S. shale production.
Several banks in the last week cut their oil price projections for the rest of the year, with analysts from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch on Friday saying the ""the much trumpeted OPEC output deal has been a complete flop."" 
U.S. crude futures have slumped about 15 percent so far this year to about $46 per barrel, and as of Friday, ended its worst half-year performance in 19 years. [O/R]
""We expect to get real clues in the next 4-5 weeks about second half 2017 oil market sentiment,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note on Thursday.

""If stocks do not fall much next month, at the very least we would worry that bearish sentiment again would come to the fore.""

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for August delivery added $1.11 to settle at $46.04 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained $0.53 flat at $48.60 a barrel. 
Oilfield services firm Barker Hughes reported its weekly U.S. rig count fell by 2 to a total of 756, ending a trend that has seen the number of U.S. rigs increase since for six-straight months. 
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
The surprise dip in the number of active U.S. drilling rigs comes amid a rebound oil prices, as investors seemed to take advantage of the recent slump in oil prices into bear market territory. 
Some commentators remained adamant, however, that the recent bounce in oil prices would be temporary, as Opec and its allies’ continue to struggle to tackle the underlying problem of oversupply in the industry, which has pressured prices for nearly three years. 
""There's a real problem out there in the crude oil market. You're going to get a rally and the market is rallying today. It's been rallying for the past 4 or 5 days. It is nothing but a dead cat bounce,"" the editor and publisher of The Gartman Letter said in an interview with cnbc.

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $3.07, or 0.25%, to $1,242.53 a troy ounce.
Gold is on course to post its first monthly loss this year, as better than expected manufacturing and consumer sentiment data underpinned a move higher in the greenback, lessening demand for dollar-dominated gold.
Manufacturing activity showed no signs of a slowdown, after The Chicago Purchasing Management Index, climbed to 65.7, its highest since May 2014, from 59.4 in May.
Analysts had forecast a figure of 58.0 for June.
The upbeat manufacturing report came ahead of a report showing U.S. consumer sentiment fell less than expected to 95.1 in June, from 97.1 in May.
Meanwhile, Core PCE, a key measure of inflation the Federal Reserve considers in its interest rate decisions, dipped to 1.4% year-over-year in May, from 1.5% in the previous month.
Gold has struggled to pare losses amid a flurry of comments from central banks signalling that ultra-low accommodative monetary policy measures may be nearing the end, resulting in an uptick in global bond yields, decreasing demand for non-interest bearing gold. 
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the September Brent gained 0.82% to $48.02 a barrel, just off the previous session’s two-week peak of $48.26.

 There was additional support stemming from a decline in U.S. gasoline inventories, which more than offset an unexpected rise in crude supplies.
Oil prices have been under pressure in recent weeks as concern over rising U.S. shale output canceled out production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
Last month, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
The cartel will not rush into making a further cut in oil output or end some countries' exemptions to output limits, OPEC delegates said earlier this week, although a meeting in Russia next month is likely to consider further steps to support the market."
1065,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2017 06:30AM ET</span>",Reuters poll: Booming U.S. output dents expectations of oil price recovery,"By Vijaykumar Vedala
(Reuters) - Analysts have cut their forecasts for oil prices this year and next as the prospect of a continued large rise in U.S. production will likely slow OPEC's efforts to cut its output to help supply match demand, according to a Reuters poll.
Crude prices slipped to the lowest in almost a year last week as concern grew about the persistence of a three-year old surplus of oil inventories.
""Rig counts in the (U.S.) shale basins, the metric most widely observed to gauge drilling activity and investments, have more than doubled from last year's lows,"" said Norbert Rucker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer. 
""There is a time lag of up to six months between drilling and production and thus, the market has yet to experience the supply surge originating from the past months' rig count increases. Growth in U.S. oil production should keep prices below $50 per barrel,"" Norbert added. 
    The survey of 36 economists and analysts predicted Brent crude (LCOc1) would average $53.96 per barrel in 2017, down from the $55.57 per barrel forecast in the previous poll, continuing the trend of gradually lower forecasts each month this year.     
    U.S. light crude (CLc1) was expected to average $51.92 a barrel this year, dipping from last month's forecast of $53.52.
Analysts have cut their forecasts for 2017 every month since February this year.
Forecasts for prices in 2018 were also lowered.
""Rising U.S. production will delay the market rebalancing until the end of the year, but the OPEC production cuts should be enough to bring stocks back to their five-year average, even with an increase in U.S. output,"" said Capital Economics analyst Thomas Pugh.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) settled up 19 cents at $44.93 a barrel on Thursday after hitting a two-week high of $45.45 in late-morning trading.
In the week to June 23, U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a record 23rd week in a row, bringing the total count up to 758, the most since April 2015, according to  Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI). 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) earlier this month boosted its forecast for U.S. crude oil production next year, saying it now expects output to top 10 million barrels per day, on track to reach its highest on record.
Last month, OPEC and allied non-OPEC producers agreed to extend an existing supply curb of about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018. 
""The nine-month extension should be enough to bring the market more into balance, provided that the rate of U.S. production growth does begin to slow in early 2018 and compliance by both OPEC and non-OPEC participants remains strong,"" said Cailin Birch, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
""However, this will only be enough to scratch the surface of ample global stocks. As a result, we expect the production-cut agreement to be tapered off slowly in the second half of 2018, as an abrupt return to previous OPEC production levels would flood the market once again, driving down prices.""
Rising production in Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC members that have been excluded from the supply deal, as well as the diplomatic tensions between Qatar and some of its neighbours including Saudi Arabia were among other factors that could determine the medium-term course of the oil price, analysts said.

1066,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 30, 2017 03:06AM ET</span>",Gold prices edge lower but downside seen limited,"Investing.com - Gold prices edged lower on Friday, still weighed by the previous session’s upbeat U.S. economic growth data, although hawkish comments by several central banks limited the greenback’s gains.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for August delivery eased 0.08% to $1,244.91.
The August contract ended Thursday’s session 0.26% lower at $1,245.80 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,236.50, the of low June 26 and resistance at $1,255.70, the high from June 28.
Official data on Thursday showed that U.S. gross domestic product rose 1.4% in the first quarter, revised up from the previous reading of a 1.2% expansion. Analysts had expected growth to remain unchanged from the prior revision.
The upbeat data added to expectations for additional U.S. rate hikes this year.
The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates earlier this month and left the door open for further increases later in the year, though a batch of mixed economic data recently has had investors wondering whether the Fed would be able to stay on its planned tightening path.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
However, the U.S. dollar’s gains were limited after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi indicated on Tuesday that the bank could soon start to unwind its quantitative easing program.
In addition, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said Wednesday that some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary as spare capacity in the economy erodes.
A weaker dollar makes gold less expensive for holders of foreign currency.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Crude oil futures on Friday were on track for their biggest weekly gain since mid-May, ending five weeks of losses with prices underpinned by a decline in U.S. output.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) have added 5.1 percent this week, while benchmark Brent (LCOc1) has gained 4.8 percent, marking the biggest rise for both markets since the week ending May 19.
U.S. crude was trading up 0.6 percent, or 27 cents, at $45.20 a barrel at 0646 GMT on Friday, with Brent climbing 0.6 percent, or 30 cents, to $47.72 a barrel.
""Oil prices received momentum from Wednesday's U.S. data and the market rejected the lows that we saw. It has been a bullish week for the oil market,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at Sydney's CMC Markets.
""There are two key drivers. One is U.S supply side response to low oil prices. We could see more gains if there is a further drop in oil output, and the other factor is a weaker U.S. dollar.""
Data indicating a fall in U.S. production bolstered markets this week after crude prices hit a 10-month low last week in the face of a mounting supply glut.
U.S. crude output fell 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.3 million bpd last week, the steepest weekly fall since July 2016.
Meanwhile, the North Sea crude oil market is showing signs of long-lost strength, suggesting that some of the pessimism that has driven down oil futures and created a record bet against a price rise may be unjustified.
On Thursday, about 6 million barrels of North Sea Brent crude were being stored on ships, down from four-month highs of as many as 9 million last week, and trading sources said it seemed now refineries were starting to take in more cargoes. 
In recent weeks, funds have been unloading long speculative positions, reducing bets on higher prices, while brokerages including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) have cut their 2017 forecasts for crude prices.
SocGen on Thursday estimated U.S. crude futures would average $47.50 a barrel in the third quarter, down from previous expectations for $55.
Global oil supplies remain ample despite output cuts of 1.8 million bpd by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers since January.
""The market's calls for further cuts from OPEC continue to be rejected by the oil group,"" ANZ said in a note. 

OPEC has exempted Nigeria and Libya from the curbs, leaving them free to ramp up output following local unrest, with Libyan oil production nearing 1 million bpd.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2017 06:36PM ET</span>",Trump seeks to project global power through energy exports,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday promoted a ""golden era"" of the U.S. energy business by seeking to assert power abroad through a boost in natural gas, coal and petroleum exports. 
In what he called a policy of ""energy dominance,"" Trump re-branded efforts to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to markets in Eastern Europe and Asia that had been set in motion during the previous presidential administration.
The United States also will offer to export coal to Ukraine, where energy consumers often have suffered from cuts in natural gas supply by Russia.
""We are here today to unleash a new American energy policy,"" Trump said at an event at the Department of Energy attended by oil and coal executives and union members who build pipelines. ""We will export American energy all around the world.""
Trump plans to promote U.S. LNG exports at a meeting next week in Warsaw with a dozen leaders from central and eastern Europe, a region heavily reliant on Russian supplies. Trump then will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Germany, in the first meeting between the two leaders, coming amid rising tensions over interference in the 2016 U.S. election. 
After decades of being a major importer of natural gas, the United States is set to become a net exporter of gas later this year or in 2018 thanks to the boom in fracking in states such as Texas and Pennsylvania. 
There is currently one operating U.S. LNG exporting facility in Sabine Pass, Louisiana, with four others currently under construction that are expected to become operational between 2018 and 2020.
As the United States aims to boost LNG exports, it will compete for markets with Australia, Qatar and Russia, other major gas producers.
U.S. crude oil exports have also risen after former president Barack Obama signed a law in 2015 allowing the shipments.
'HELL OF A LOT MORE FRIENDS'
While many of Trump's opponents have said his plan to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate has the potential to harm the country's relations around the world, Energy Secretary Rick Perry said at the event that energy exports will strengthen ties with allies. 
The United States is in a position ""to be able to clearly create a hell of a lot more friends by being able to deliver to them energy and not being held hostage by some countries, Russia in particular,"" Perry said.
Whether it is sending LNG to Poland or Ukraine, ""the entirety of the EU totally get it that if we can lay in American LNG ... we can be able to have an alternative to Russia,"" for natural gas sales to Europe, Perry said.
Earlier this month,  Cheniere Energy  Inc (A:LNG) delivered the first U.S. cargoes of LNG to Poland and the Netherlands.
The Energy Department on Thursday approved additional LNG exports from the Lake Charles project in Louisiana, which is under development.
Trump announced plans to offer coal exports to Ukraine, as well as lift restrictions on U.S. lending for coal projects overseas.
""Ukraine already tells us they need millions and millions of metric tons (of coal),"" he said. ""Right now, there are many other places that need it too and we want to sell it to them and to everyone else all over the globe who need it.""
The Trump administration will launch a review of the ailing nuclear power industry, which has experienced a slew of closures due to stagnant electricity demand and low natural gas prices. Trump's 2018 budget included $120 million for addressing nuclear waste at Nevada's Yucca Mountain and other projects, but most of the state's politicians oppose that project.
In addition, the State Department issued a permit for a NuStar Logistics LP for its New Burgos Pipeline oil product pipeline from the United States to Mexico with a capacity of up to 180,000 barrels per day. 

In 2016, the United States exported about 879,000 barrels of petroleum products daily to Mexico, more than any other country, according to the Energy Department. For the year, the United States exported 4.7 million barrels a day of products – including gasoline, diesel and other refined products – around the world, making it the world’s largest exporter of refined petroleum products.

1069,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2017 05:17PM ET</span>",Trump to demand G20 take stronger action on steel overcapacity: adviser,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will use the premise of a national security review of the U.S. steel industry to demand action by the Group of 20 leaders to reduce excess capacity and other distortions in the global steel market, the top White House economic adviser said on Thursday.
Trump is attending a G20 leaders summit in Hamburg, Germany on July 7-8.
National Economic Council director Gary Cohn told reporters that it was unclear when the Commerce Department will submit its ""Section 232"" report on the steel industry and potential new import restrictions to the White House.
""It's in the final drafting form. They will be delivering it to the White House at some point,"" Cohn said. ""But the premise of that report we will use as an opportunity to talk with many of our trading partners around the world about what's going on in steel.""
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said he intended to complete the study by the end of June, but congressional aides and steel industry officials say the timing could slip. The study invokes a Cold War-era trade law that allows the president to restrict imports of goods deemed critical to national defense.
Ross has said he believes there is a ""genuine"" national security concern over the steel industry's health and one possible remedy is to impose import quotas on certain products coupled with tariffs on any amounts that exceed the quotas.
Ross told a German economic conference that such measures might have to be ""broad-scale"" but would be aimed at provoking a collective solution to deal with global steel excess capacity.
Cohn told the news briefing on Thursday that Trump would engage in discussions with G20 counterparts about promoting ""free and fair trade"".
""The United States stands firm against all unfair trading practices, including massive distortions in the global steel market and other non-market practices that harm U.S. workers. We ask the G20 economies to join us in this effort and to take concrete actions to solve these problems.""

But Cohn added that the Trump administration ""will act to ensure a level playing field for all.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil futures ended slightly higher on Thursday, extending crude's rally to a sixth straight session after a decline in weekly U.S. crude production temporarily eased concerns about deepening oversupply.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) settled up 19 cents at $44.93 a barrel after hitting a two-week high of $45.45 in late-morning trading. The market retreated from highs after  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) became the third investment bank to cut its outlook for oil prices in the last week.
Crude prices hit a 10-month low last week but have rebounded more than 5 percent, stretching their bull run to the longest since April. Brent crude futures (LCOc1) ended up 11 cents at $47.42 a barrel, after touching a two-week high of $48.03 earlier in the session.
""After the steep drop in oil prices of recent weeks, I believe that especially hedge funds saw nice buying momentum and lower U.S. crude production was the trigger to act,"" said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.
Analysts were not sure whether bearish sentiment had abated in the oil market, given larger-than-usual inventories in the United States for both crude oil and key products like gasoline.
""It does feel as if a wave of selling has ebbed for now,"" wrote analysts at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). They added, however, that the rebound in prices reflected technical buying rather than a change in fundamentals. 
In recent weeks, funds have been unloading long speculative positions, reducing bets on higher prices while brokerages including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Societe Generale have cut their 2017 forecasts for crude prices.
SocGen on Thursday estimated U.S. crude futures would average $47.50 a barrel in the third quarter, down from previous expectations for $55.
U.S. crude production dropped 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.3 million bpd last week, the steepest weekly fall since July 2016. But analysts said the decline was related to temporary factors, including production shut as a precaution in the Gulf of Mexico due to Tropical Storm Cindy, along with maintenance in Alaska.
Global oil supplies remain ample despite output cuts of 1.8 million bpd by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers since January. 
OPEC and its allies, trying to reduce a crude glut, agreed in May to extend the supply cut through March 2018. OPEC has exempted Nigeria and Libya from the curbs, leaving them free to ramp up output that had been sapped by local unrest.
""That's going to increase pressure on OPEC cuts,"" said Tony Scott, managing director of analytics at BTU Analytics in Denver. ""As long as Libya and Nigeria can remain stable - Libya has ramped up several times over last couple of years and then the violence has come back."" 
Libyan oil production is nearing 1 million bpd, a Libyan source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) on Wednesday lifted force majeure on Nigerian Bonny Light crude exports after pipeline repairs.

Investing.com – Crude futures eased from highs on Thursday but settled higher for the session, as investors continued to cheer mostly upbeat U.S. inventory data showing a dip in gasoline inventories. 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for June delivery added 19 cents to settle at $44.93 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent trade flat at $47.47 a barrel. 
An upbeat report from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday, showing a rebound in refining activity, as gasoline stockpiles fell more than expected boosting sentiment on oil. 
Gasoline inventories, one of the products that crude is refined into, unexpectedly fell by roughly 578,000 barrels against expectations of a rise of 443,000 barrels.
Some analysts have been quick to downplay the notion of a rebound in oil prices suggesting that selling pressure may resume in the near future, as crude futures trickled into bear-market territory last week. 
 “Oil is in a downtrend and risks trending into the $30's,” Paul Ciana, a technical strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a note on last week.
Market participants are expected to monitor the Baker Hughes report on Friday to gauge U.S. drilling activity amid concerns that a boom in shale oil output may derail Opec and its allies’ efforts to stem the glut in the supply. 
OPEC and its allies agreed in May to extend the supply cut through March 2018, however, the recent selloff in oil prices suggested that traders are not entirely convinced that Opec’s current efforts can rebalance supply and demand in the market. "

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $3.08, or 0.25%, to $1,245.01 a troy ounce.
Global bond yields have ticked higher during the week, after The European Central Bank, Bank of England, and Bank of Canada signaled that measures to tighten monetary policy could be adopted relatively soon. 
Comments concerning tighter monetary policy measures were expected from the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank but it was the change in tone from Bank of England governor Mark Carney that caught investors off guard. 
Bank of England governor Mark Carney, appeared to reverse his recent assertion that there “was no need to raise rates soon”, after he said on Wednesday that “some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to become necessary”.
In a rising interest rate environment, investor appetite for gold weakens as the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal increases relative to other interest-bearing assets such as bonds.
Investor expectations concerning monetary tightening has weighed on the dollar, which continued to hover around eight-month lows this week, offsetting the potential for deeper losses in the precious metal. 
Gold remained on track to end the second-quarter less than $1 an ounce from where it began. 
Dollar-denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar – A dip in the dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency and thus, increases demand.
Other precious metals failed to capitalize on a slump in the dollar, as silver futures fell 0.53% to $16.638, a troy ounce while platinum futures lost 0.33% to $920.95.

Natural gas edged higher on Tuesday to notch its fourth wining session in a row on Wednesday.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 46 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 23, below forecasts for a build of 52 billion.
That compared with a gain of 61 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 37 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 72 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.816 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 6.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, updated weather forecasting models continued to point to increased summer demand in the weeks ahead.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.

The new Canadian protocols involve full inspection - including tests for pathogens and chemical residues - of all Brazilian meat imports on five consecutive shipments from each approved plant and for each product category, CFIA spokeswoman Maria Kubacki said. 
Previously, CFIA conducted one full inspection randomly out of 10 consecutive shipments from each Brazilian plant. 
The tougher reviews highlight concerns about the safety of Brazilian meat even among countries that still accept its products. The United States last week banned imports of fresh Brazilian beef after a high percentage of shipments failed safety checks. 
Brazilian police raided the premises of global meatpacking companies JBS SA (SA:JBSS3) and BRF SA (SA:BRFS3) in March, as well as dozens of smaller rivals, over suspected bribery of health officials..
Since then, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has re-inspected shipments of raw beef and ready-to-eat food products from Brazil and tested them for pathogens. All beef trimmings are now tested for salmonella and E. coli.
The checks have uncovered problems in fresh beef, including abscesses, blood clots, bones and lymphoid tissue, according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service
Re-inspections at U.S. ports are directed by a centralized computer database that stores past inspection results from each foreign establishment. Better-performing foreign plants are subject to less frequent re-inspections, according to the USDA.
To meet the stiffer inspection requirements from importers, Brazil has raised its own standards for meat exported from the country.
Meat-processing plants in Brazil are now blocked from shipping the front part of a cow as a whole piece, and must instead process it into cuts, a step that makes it easier to detect defects but adds cost for packers, Luis Rangel, Brazil's plant and animal health secretary, said in an interview on Tuesday.
“We had to raise the bar because of the United States, and ... you do not raise the bar for only one export market, you raise it for all of them,"" Rangel said. ""Processing costs will rise, but that is necessary to preserve the markets.""
Enforcing the higher standards is complicated, however, by a shortage of inspectors in Brazil.
In Europe, authorities now conduct physical checks of all animal-related shipments from Brazil, and perform laboratory tests on 20 percent of them, at the importers' cost, according to a document issued by the Council of the European Union on June 9.
The EU requires Brazil to conduct microbiological checks on poultry and other meats before they are shipped. 

Hong Kong has since March boosted surveillance on Brazil's meat and poultry, including sampling for meat deterioration and other food safety concerns, a spokesman for Hong Kong's Center for Food Safety said. As of June 23, a total of 369 samples were tested and all were satisfactory, he said.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for August delivery rose 1.1% to settle at $44.74 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 1.34% to trade at $47.55 a barrel.
Investors mulled over a mixed weekly inventory report from the Energy Information Administration, showing a surprise build in crude stockpiles while gasoline inventories fell by more than expected.
Inventories of U.S. crude unexpectedly rose by roughly 118,000 barrels in the week ended June 23, below expectations of draw of about 2.5m barrels.
Gasoline inventories, one of the products that crude is refined into, fell by 894,000 barrels against expectations of a draw of 583,000 barrels while distillate stockpiles  declined by 223,000 barrels, compared to expectations of a rise of 453,000 barrels.
The bigger-than-expected draw in gasoline stockpiles eased investor concerns about a slowdown in demand for refined products, after data in June showed stockpiles of gasoline rose back above 2016 levels and well above their five-year average.
Crude prices extended gains for a six-straight day, after falling into bear-market territory last week amid fears that an uptick in output by Nigeria and Libya were undermining Opec and its allies’ efforts to curb oversupply.

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $3.67, or 0.29%, to $1,250.57 a troy ounce.
A slump in the dollar to eight-month lows against its rivals boosted demand for dollar-denominated gold, as traders sought safe haven protection from U.S. political uncertainty, after the Senate delayed a vote on a healthcare bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.
President Donald Trump has reiterated several times that healthcare reform would need to be passed before his administration moves ahead with tax reform, which is widely viewed as a pro-economic growth measure.
Dollar-denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar – A dip in the dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency and thus, increases demand.
Gains in gold, however, remained stifled by expectations that the Federal Reserve will deliver a third rate hike later this year, after hiking rates for the second time earlier in June, despite a slowdown in inflation.
Some analysts believe that the next set of inflation data slated for Friday, June 30, will be key in determining if the Fed can deliver on its promise of three hikes this year.
“…the FOMC does not take the recent inflation developments lightly, and though it believes the near-term weakness will prove to be transitory, inflation data is front and center and will be key in determining if the Fed can deliver on its promise of three hikes this year.” Morgan Stanley said in research note to clients.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 118,000 barrels in the week ended June 23.
Market analysts' expected a crude-stock decline of around 2.5 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply-gain of 851,000 barrels.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 509.2 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be at the upper half of the average range for this time of year.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories decreased by 894,000 barrels, compared to expectations for a drop of 583,000 barrels.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a fall of 223,000 barrels.
Oil prices have been under pressure in recent weeks as concern over rising U.S. shale output offset production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 23rd week in a row, according to data from energy services company Baker Hughes, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The increase in U.S. drilling activity and shale production has mostly offset efforts by OPEC and other producers to cut output in a move to prop up the market.
Last month, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.

1086,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2017 09:34AM ET</span>","Despite weak oil prices, OPEC still pockets more dollars","By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - With world oil inventories swelling despite a global pact on cutting output and crude prices falling by a fifth in the past month, OPEC appears to be losing its battle to balance the market.
But there is one crucial fight the oil-exporting group has been winning so far: its members have earned more money this year than last and the prospect of higher revenues is likely to motivate OPEC to stick with output cuts or even deepen them.
OPEC's first output cut in eight years has earned the group $1.64 billion a day so far this year, up more than 10 percent from the second half of 2016, according to Reuters calculations based on OPEC figures for average production and its crude basket price up until June 20.
Compared with the first half of 2016, when oil prices sank to a 12-year low near $27 a barrel, the increase in income is a dramatic 43 percent, even though production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was little changed.
Income could rise in the rest of the year if, as OPEC hopes, a supply glut is banished. OPEC plus Russia and other non-OPEC producers agreed on May 25 to extend supply cuts to March, after an initial deal to keep them in place for the first half of 2017.
""I expect the gains for OPEC to be higher during the second semester 2017 due to a tight market in the third and fourth quarter, despite an oversupply from non-OPEC not tied to the OPEC agreement and higher-than-expected production from Libya and Nigeria,"" said Chakib Khelil, Algeria's former oil minister.
He estimated OPEC revenues rose about 8 percent in the first half of 2017, following its move at the end of 2016 to cut overall output by about 4 percent.
""The overall gain in revenues for OPEC would be in the 9 to 10 percent range for the whole of 2017 compared to 2016,"" the former minister said.
OPEC's decision in late 2016 to return to a policy of limiting supply, in cooperation with Russia and other non-members, marked the end of a two-year period in which the group pumped at will in a Saudi-led shift to curb rival output and boost market share, which accelerated a drop in prices.
""I think the extent to which Saudi Arabia bled revenue during 2014-2016 forced them back to the OPEC table before the job of really turning the screw on U.S. shale and other non-OPEC supply was completed,"" said David Fyfe, chief economist at trading firm Gunvor. 
""However, the production deal has at least staunched the cash hemorrhage for now,"" he said.
The Reuters calculation is based on data from the International Energy Agency and figures published by OPEC about its production according to estimates by six secondary sources.
For the price, Reuters used the OPEC basket, an index of the crudes sold by the member countries.
It is intended to illustrate the general trend for oil revenues and does not aim to give exact estimates of countries' oil export earnings. 
STICK WITH IT
OPEC and non-OPEC allies led by Russia initially agreed to cut about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017. But with the supply glut proving slow to shift, they agreed on May 25 to prolong the deal to the first quarter of 2018.
A drop in prices since then has prompted some OPEC delegates to question whether the deal is enough, but the group is in no rush to deepen its output cut.
Rising U.S. production has undermined some of the impact of the OPEC-led cuts. In addition, Libya and Nigeria, two OPEC members exempted from the curbs, have increased output although not by enough to alter the overall picture of lower OPEC output in the six-month period.
While OPEC states will welcome the extra revenue, it has not yet plugged budget deficits that have opened up. To balance its books, Saudi Arabia needs oil closer to $75 a barrel, asset management firm AB Bernstein estimates.
However, Fyfe of Gunvor said the higher earnings during the first half of this year will probably give producers sufficient motivation to keep going and even consider further measures. 
Taking Dubai oil as a benchmark, prices so far in 2017 are 25 percent above last year's $41 average, while OPEC production in the same time is 2 percent, or 700,000 bpd, below 2016's average, he said.
""That arithmetic ought to persuade OPEC and Russia of the value of sticking with it, maybe cutting sufficient extra barrels to offset Libya and Nigeria increases and reaping the reward of higher overall 2017 revenues,"" said Fyfe.
""But the politics of apportioning further cuts will get messy,"" he added.
Khelil also said he thought OPEC needed to keep on with supply restraint beyond the expiry of the current deal to protect the increase in income earned this year. 

""It would be in the best interest of OPEC to plan on continuing curtailing production after the end of March 2018 so as to maintain the 9 to 10 percent gain in revenues achieved in 2017,"" he said.

U.S. natural gas for August delivery was at $3.099 per million British thermal units by 9:05AM ET (1305GMT), up 3.4 cents, or around 1.1%. It rose to its highest since June 1 at $3.117 earlier.
Natural gas edged higher on Tuesday to notch its third wining session in a row, as updated weather forecasting models pointed to increased summer demand in the weeks ahead.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.770 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.4% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 7.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 50 and 61 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 23.
That compares with a gain of 61 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 37 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 72 billion cubic feet.

1090,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2017 06:04AM ET</span>","Oil pipeline firms' discounts rile clients, roil markets","By Catherine Ngai
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. pipeline operators are selling their underused space at steep discounts to keep crude flowing - angering shippers and distorting an already opaque market for oil trading.
Pipeline firms such as Plains All American (N:PAA) and  TransCanada Corp  (TO:TRP) move about 10 million barrels of crude around the United States every day.
For pipeline operators to secure financing to build pipelines and storage facilities, they need oil producers, refiners and traders to sign long-term contracts to use space on the pipelines.
Pipeline firms can then use the guaranteed revenue from those contracts as collateral. Firms shipping on the pipeline have historically benefited from the long-term deals because they offered a discount compared to the price of buying space occasionally.
But now, in the wake of a two-year oil price crash, pipeline firms are still struggling to keep their lines full. So their marketing arms are offering steep discounts to ad-hoc buyers of pipeline capacity - which irritates customers whose long-term contracts are now more expensive than spot purchases.
""If I were a producer with a long-term contract, I would be very unhappy at the present time,” said Rick Smead, managing director of advisory services at RBN Energy in Houston. “But, the reality is that when they (signed contracts), they were trapped.”
Eight pipeline operators contacted by Reuters for this story declined to comment on their discounted spot pricing or the secondary market for pipeline capacity.
Some of those pipeline firms are offering prices as low as 25 percent of federally regulated rates, creating a secondary market that undercuts shippers with long-term contracts, according to four sources at companies that regularly ship on the pipelines.
For a graphic detailing how the discount deals work, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2sJwW5E
The discounts emerged after a global glut and crashing oil prices caused many shippers to let their pipeline contracts lapse or declare bankruptcy.
More than a dozen producers, traders and refiners told Reuters they were angry and frustrated that these discount deals have become a mainstay. They declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
The contract and regulatory framework of the industry makes it difficult for them to bargain down their own long-term contracts, leaving them paying more for the pipeline space than occasional shippers competing to send oil through the same lines.
This gives the occasional shippers the edge in delivering cheaper crude to potential buyers at the end of the line.
DEEP DISCOUNTS
TransCanada's 700,000 barrel-per-day Cushing-Marketlink pipeline - which carries oil from Cushing, Oklahoma, to Texas refineries - has long-term rates of between $1.63 and $2.93 a barrel to transport heavy crude, while occasional shippers typically paid $3.
The industry downturn since 2014 has reduced demand from occasional shippers to use the line at that price.
Earlier this year, TransCanada's marketing arm offered customers the right to send crude through the line at a tariff of between 80 to 90 cents, traders using the line said.
At the end of 2016, the rate offered was as low 30 to 40 cents. Even with the discounts, the line rarely reached 70 percent capacity.
TransCanada declined to comment.
Pipeline operators agree to charge specific tariffs for sending oil through the lines when they sign long-term contracts with oil shippers.
Those rates are known as committed tariffs, and are subject to approval by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The FERC also reviews the rates paid by occasional shippers, known as uncommitted tariffs.
The FERC declined to comment on the secondary market and on the tariffs that the marketing arms of pipeline operators are charging in that market.
AGGRESSIVE MARKETING
Most of the 10 largest U.S. pipeline operators - such as  Enbridge  (TO:ENB) and Enterprise Products Partners (N:EPD) - have established their own marketing or trading arms that are reselling space.
Last year, TransCanada - which operates the massive Keystone pipeline system - became the most recent player to open a unit to trade oil and resell pipeline space.
A few, such as Plains, have had marketing arms for more than a decade, but in the past they had mostly just sold or traded space that went unused by major producers who had committed to long-term contracts.
On lines such as TransCanada’s, big producers such as ExxonMobil (N:XOM) and Suncor Energy (N:SU) account for up to 90 percent of the flow in a pipeline. The remaining 10 percent is sold to occasional shippers.
Suncor and ExxonMobil declined to comment.
With the three-year rout in oil, the volume accounted for in long-term contracts has fallen, and the marketing arms have gone from simply selling occasional space to needing to make big deals to fill the lines.
The practice has become so widespread that even pipeline operators who had previously said they disliked the emergence of the secondary market have now joined the fray.
Magellan Midstream Partners (N:MMP), for instance, in November applied to the FERC to establish a marketing arm, citing the more favorable terms other firms can offer customers. The move came after Magellan had declined for years to run its own operation out of fear that it would compete with its own customers.
The secondary market is formed by marketing firms signing up to long-term contracts with their parent companies, the pipeline owners. The marketing firms become like committed customers to the line, and pay the same rates for the space as the firms with long-term contracts.
Those marketing firms book a paper loss for shipping the volumes at a discount. But the sales keep the pipelines more full - which makes the parent firm look better to investors, who use pipeline volume as a key metric to judge those firms.
Some companies have felt the pinch of the paper losses.  Genesis Energy LP  (N:GEL) - a Houston-based midstream firm with a market cap of $3.6 billion - said its supply and logistics unit saw fourth-quarter revenues fall by 15 percent from a year earlier.
The company’s Chief Executive Grant Sims, during a recent earnings call, cited ""volume cannibalization"" for the decline, saying that it was forced to compete in a market in which participants were willing to lose money.
Genesis declined to comment further to Reuters.
Ed Longanecker president of the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association, said tensions between producers and midstream firms become more strained in a low-price environment, with producers ""at the mercy of an extremely competitive market.""

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2017 04:27AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's CNPC suspends fuel sales to North Korea as risks mount - sources,"By Chen Aizhu
BEIJING (Reuters) - China National Petroleum Corp has suspended sales of fuel to North Korea over concerns the state-owned oil company won't get paid, as pressure mounts on Pyongyang to rein in its nuclear and missile programmes, three sources told Reuters.    
It's unclear how long the suspension will last. A prolonged cut would threaten critical supplies of fuel and force North Korea to find alternatives to its main supplier of diesel and gasoline, as scrutiny of China's close commercial ties with its increasingly isolated neighbour intensifies.    
CNPC and the Ministry of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment. North Korea's embassy in Beijing declined to comment. 
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked about the sale suspension and whether the Chinese government put pressure on CNPC to make this decision, said: ""I do not understand this situation you are talking about"" and declined to elaborate.
A source with direct knowledge of the matter said CNPC decided to put fuel sales on hold ""over the last month or two"" and described it as a ""commercial decision"". 
""It's no longer worth the risks,"" said the source. Chinese and international banks are stepping up compliance checks on companies dealing with countries on the U.S. sanctions list, such as North Korea, he said.
The North Korean agents who mostly buy the diesel and gasoline have been unable recently to pay for the supplies -- CNPC normally requires upfront payments, the source said. 
Reuters was unable to determine if the agents have started facing credit problems with Chinese and international banks worried about sanctions compliance issues.
Two other sources briefed about CNPC's decision confirmed the suspension of diesel sales, but did not know directly about the gasoline move. The three people declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter and are not authorised to speak to the media.
    
PRICES SURGE IN NORTH       
Last year, China shipped just over 96,000 tonnes of gasoline and almost 45,000 tonnes of diesel worth a combined $64 million to North Korea, where it is used across the economy from fishermen and farmers to truckers and the military.[O/CHINA4]       
Most of that was sold by CNPC, which has grown over the past two decades to dominate China's energy trade with Pyongyang. 
Data for May released on Friday showed China supplied significantly lower volumes of diesel and gasoline compared with a month earlier, although monthly tonnages can vary widely. June data will be released in late July.    
Fuel prices in North Korea, meanwhile, have sharply risen in recent months, suggesting a tightening in supply.
A Reuters analysis of data collected by Daily NK showed the price of gasoline sold by private dealers in Pyongyang and the northern border cities of Sinuiju and Hyesan had hit $1.46 per kg on June 21, up almost 50 percent from April 21. Until then, they had remained relatively stable since late last year.
Diesel prices averaged $1.20 per kg as of June 21, more than double over the same period, according to Daily NK, a website run by defectors who collect prices via phone calls with North Korean fuel traders.
   
U.S SCRUTINY
North Korea's unprecedented pace of nuclear and ballistic missile tests has prompted China, which handles 90 percent of North Korea's trade, to start squeezing Pyongyang. 
In February, Beijing suspended coal purchases until the end of the year, cutting off North Korea's main export revenue source. In 2016, North Korea sold 22.5 million tonnes of coal to China, worth about $1.9 billion, according to Chinese customs.
The United States has pressed China to exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea, but Beijing has said its influence on North Korea is limited and it is doing all it can.
President Donald Trump, frustrated over Beijing's inaction on North Korea and bilateral trade issues, is now considering possible trade actions against China, three senior administration officials told Reuters on Tuesday.
The sources in China saw no sign yet that Beijing is cutting crude oil to Pyongyang. China has not disclosed its crude exports to North Korea for several years, but industry sources say it supplies via an aging pipeline about 520,000 tonnes of crude a year to North Korea, worth about $170 million at current market prices. 

North Korea imports all its oil needs, mostly from China and a much smaller amount from Russia.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report at 10:30AM ET (1430GMT).
Analysts expect crude oil inventories dropped by around 2.5 million barrels at the end of last week, while gasoline supplies are seen decreasing by 583,000 barrels and distillates are forecast to gain about 453,000 barrels.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories rose by 851,000 barrels in the week ended June 23.

There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA.
Oil prices have been under pressure in recent weeks as concern over rising U.S. shale output offset production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 23rd week in a row, according to data from energy services company Baker Hughes, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The increase in U.S. drilling activity and shale production has mostly offset efforts by OPEC and other producers to cut output in a move to prop up the market.
Last month, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil markets were steady to lower on Wednesday after a report of rising U.S. fuel and crude inventories underscored concerns that a three-year supply glut is far from over. 
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $46.67 per barrel at 0329 GMT, close to their last close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were down 8 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $44.16 per barrel.
Oil had recovered some ground over the past week after falling nearly 20 percent since mid-May, but a report by the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed that U.S. crude inventories rose by 851,000 barrels in the week to June 23 to 509.5 million, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 2.6 million barrels. 
Gasoline stocks rose by 1.4 million barrels even though the U.S. summer driving season began a few weeks ago. [API/S]
The U.S. inventory gains show global supplies are still ample despite the effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) between January 2017 and March 2018. 
Ian Taylor, head of the world's largest independent oil trader Vitol, says Brent crude prices will stay in a range of $40-$55 a barrel for the next few quarters as higher U.S. production slows a rebalancing of the market. 
""Everybody was positioned for a market rebalancing and a stocks draw to happen in the second quarter. And if you look at the macro analysis, that should start happening,"" Taylor said in an interview with Reuters.
""But so far it hasn't happened and everyone has made the same mistake. Nobody has distinguished themselves,"" he said.
Some analysts said that crude prices had likely bottomed out and would rise.

""We believe that the selloff in crude is overdone ... Brent is primed for a recovery,"" BMI Research said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The United States might have no choice but to resort to ""broad-scale"" measures to fight steel dumping should its partners fail to help find a common solution to the problem, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Tuesday.
Ross, speaking via live stream to an economic event in Berlin attended by Chancellor Angela Merkel, said that even countries that were not direct sources of dumping could face difficulties under these circumstances.
He did not specify what kind of measures President Donald Trump would take to tackle overcapacity in the steel sector, a major issue for an administration that says it wants to make U.S. trade ties fairer.
""If President Trump takes action on dumping it will be in the hope of provoking a collective solution by importing nations,"" Ross told members of Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union.
""Lacking strong action in conjunction with our partners we may have no alternative but to engage in self help,"" he said. ""If we do so it might have to be on a broad scale.""
Ross has previously said he hoped to complete by the end of June a national security study of the U.S. steel industry that could result in broad new steel import restrictions.
The commerce department is invoking a Cold War-era trade law that allows the president to limit imports of certain products and materials deemed critical for national defense.
Timing of the review's results and any subsequent actions are uncertain.
Trump administration officials told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that new steel tariffs were among trade options under consideration against China for Beijing's inaction on reining in North Korea and on international trade issues. 
Chinese steel already is subject to dozens of U.S. anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties, sharply limiting China's direct share of the U.S. steel market. New restrictions under the defense review could have a larger impact on steel imported from U.S. allies such as Germany, Japan and South Korea. 
In his remarks to the conference, Ross also mentioned pharmaceuticals, chemicals and transportation as other sectors in which the United States ran a particularly large deficit with the European Union, but said the two blocs should work together to tackle dumping by third countries.

Taking the floor after Ross had spoken, Merkel welcomed Ross's calls for resumed work on a U.S.-EU trade agreement but stressed that Germany's investments in the United States were major job creators for the country.

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by $4.18, or 0.34%, to $1,250.68 a troy ounce.
The dollar fell sharply, boosting demand for the precious metal, as traders digested comments from Fed chair Janet.
Fed chair Janet Yellen offered relatively little on monetary policy but reiterated that it was appropriate to raise interest rates “very gradually to a level that [is] likely to remain quite low by historical standards for a long time”.
Yellen noted that inflation expectations “has continued to run below our [the fed’s] objective”, asserting that the central bank wanted to avoid a scenario in which inflation expectations continued to slip.
Yellen speech came ahead of comments from Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, who downplayed the recent dip in inflation as transitory and remained adamant that the Federal Reserve is on the right path concerning monetary policy.
In a rising interest rate environment, investor appetite for gold weakens as the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal increases relative to other interest-bearing assets such as bonds.

""If we get another sizable draw-down this week, that could be supportive,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund. ""We’ve got some very important weekly inventory numbers coming up.""
Despite the higher settlement of crude futures for the fourth-straight day, overall sentiment remained fairly negative, as non-Opec output is expected to swell, reducing the effectiveness of Opec and its allies’ efforts to rebalance supply and demand in the market.
Earlier in June, the International Energy Agency predicted oil supplies from producers outside OPEC will grow by 1.5 million barrels a day in 2018, while the U.S. Energy Department said Monday, U.S. domestic crude oil output will increase to a record in 2018, surpassing 10 million barrels per day."

U.S. natural gas for August delivery was at $3.058 per million British thermal units by 9:25AM ET (1325GMT), up 0.9 cents, or around 0.3%. It rose to its highest since June 16 at $3.080 in overnight trade.
Natural gas rallied almost 10.0 cents, or roughly 3.3%, on Monday, the biggest one-day gain since late February, as updated weather forecasting models pointed to increased summer demand in the weeks ahead.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.770 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.4% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 7.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 50 and 61 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 23.
That compares with a gain of 61 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 37 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 72 billion cubic feet.

LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC will not rush into making a further cut in oil output or end some countries' exemptions to output limits, OPEC delegates said, although a meeting in Russia next month is likely to consider further steps to support the market.
OPEC and allied non-OPEC producers agreed on May 25 to extend an existing supply cut into 2018, but oil has fallen sharply then on rising production from the United States and from Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC members exempt from cutting output. [O/R]
""I doubt it will be considered soon,"" said an OPEC delegate, referring to the chance of a larger cut. ""They will look at this issue most probably in the upcoming meeting in Russia in July.""
Oil ministers from five countries monitoring the deal plus Saudi Arabia as OPEC president are scheduled to meet in Russia on July 24. They could make a recommendation to the wider group, which holds its next meeting in November, on adjusting the pact.
""A larger cut could be an option,"" said another OPEC delegate, adding that further steps could be to place caps on further growth in Nigerian and Libyan output, rather than requiring them to cut back their supply.
A third source familiar with the matter agreed that removing more crude from the market was an option but said it was not being actively considered.
""It is possible but there are no real discussions now,"" this source said, and added that a drawback of the current supply-limiting deal was Nigeria and Libya being exempt.
Comments from key oil ministers also suggest the OPEC-led group is in no rush.
Iran said last week OPEC was considering further cuts but should wait until the effect of the current reduced level of production became clear.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih was quoted on June 19 as saying the market was heading in the right direction, while Russia said on June 11 there was no need to review the deal.
Falih also said it would be ""inappropriate"" to pressure Libya to slow its output recovery. 
OUTPUT RISING
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers initially agreed to cut production by 1.8 million bpd for six months starting on Jan. 1.
Nigeria and Libya were exempted from the cut because of production losses caused by unrest. Iran was given a small increase so it could recover market share lost while under Western sanctions.
While the participating countries have delivered high compliance with their cut pledges, OPEC output has been rising led by recovering output in Libya and Nigeria. In May, this tipped the global market back into surplus according to OPEC's monthly report. [OPEC/M] 
Nigeria has said it would be willing to join OPEC cuts if production rose to around 1.8 million barrels per day. The country is nearing that rate and planned exports in August imply production of at least 2 million bpd. 

Libya is targeting production of 1 million bpd by the end of July, up from an average of 650,000 bpd in the first quarter.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose for a fourth consecutive session on Tuesday boosted by a weaker dollar and investors covering short positions, but worries over persistent oversupply capped gains.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were up 23 cents at $43.61 per barrel.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners have been trying to reduce a global crude glut with production cuts. OPEC nations and 11 other exporters agreed in May to extend cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018.
Despite the cuts, which started in January, markets remain well supplied due to rising output elsewhere. 
OPEC members Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the cuts and have raised production. OPEC member Iran was also allowed a small increase to recover market share lost under Western sanctions over its nuclear programme. 
Libya's oil production rose to 935,000 bpd, up from 885,000 bpd last week, a Libyan oil source said on Tuesday.
Meanwhile Nigeria's projected August exports are at their highest since March 2016 at around 2 million bpd. 
Adding to the bearish supply outlook is an apparent glut in U.S. East Coast product supplies. 
Colonial Pipeline Co said that demand on its main distillate line fell below capacity for the first time in nearly six years as the East Coast remained awash in fuel. 
Meanwhile, U.S. shale oil output has risen about 10 percent since last year to 9.4 million bpd , with the number of U.S. oil rigs in operation at the highest in more than three years. [RIG/U] 
""Traders are also looking ahead to the EIA Energy Conference in Washington, where U.S. shale oil producers are expected to give their view of current market conditions,"" ANZ bank said.
Analysts at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said demand was not growing quickly enough to absorb output, especially since imports in Asia are stuttering. 

A fuel glut in China, a hangover from demonetisation in India, and an ageing, declining population in Japan are holding back crude oil demand growth in three of the world's top four oil buyers.

Seven years after its Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, BP is betting tens of billions of dollars on the prospect that it can slash the costs of offshore drilling by half or more - just as shale oil producers have done onshore.
The firm says it can do that while it continues to pay an estimated $61 billion in total costs and damages from the worst spill in history - and without compromising safety.
BP's Gulf platforms are key to a global strategy calling for up to $17 billion in annual investments through 2021 to increase production by about 5 percent each year, Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley recently told investors.
""Our strategy is to take this investment that we spent so much money building, and keep it full"" to the platform's capacity, Richard Morrison, BP's regional president for the Gulf of Mexico, told Reuters during the first tour of a BP Gulf drilling platform since the disaster. ""We're also exploring for larger pools of oil.""
BP's deepwater double-down is all the more striking for the contrast to its chief competitors, who have cooled on offshore investments in light of the lower costs and quicker returns of onshore shale plays.
While BP has some onshore U.S. developments, the firm is notably absent from the industry's rush into shale oil fields of the West Texas Permian Basin.
Majors including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) have maintained Gulf operations but focused expansions on U.S. shale. Exxon Mobil doubled its acreage in the Permian in a deal earlier this year.
Freeport-McMoRan (N:FCX) and  Devon Energy  Corp (N:DVN) have pulled out of Gulf drilling entirely in recent years. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (N:APC) took a $435-million dollar write-down in May on its Shenandoah project in the Gulf, deciding it could not profit with oil prices hovering at about $50 a barrel.
""In a $50 to $60 world, we always felt like greenfield development, in the Gulf in particular, was fairly challenged,"" Anadarko CEO Al Walker told investors last month.
Oil prices dropped steeply last week, settling in the low $40s per barrel.
BP says its next Gulf development - the $9 billion Mad Dog phase two - would be profitable even at $40 a barrel. As recently as 2013, BP reported that it could not start new deepwater Gulf projects at prices lower than $100 a barrel.
A BILLION BARRELS
In time, BP's offshore expansion could produce a huge payoff. The firm announced last month that it had discovered an additional billion barrels of oil below its four audaciously named Gulf platforms - Thunder Horse, Atlantis, Na Kika and Mad Dog.
The find - worth more than $40 billion at today's market prices - amounts to more than three times the proven reserves at the Na Kika field, or the equivalent of three new fields in the Gulf.
""It seems like every ten years there's another breakthrough"" that unlocks more Gulf oil, Morrison said on the deck of Thunder Horse.
Over his shoulder, a drillship three miles away tapped a new well that will feed production into the massive platform.
In the wake of the 2010 BP disaster, deepwater production was curtailed by a six-month U.S. government moratorium on drilling and a longer period of uncertainty about regulation. But output has rebounded to new record highs as projects sanctioned years ago start operations and existing hubs such as Thunder Horse expand.
BP's big new discovery is key to its slashing of estimated per-barrel costs, as are a host of drilling innovations and more favorable deals with service providers.
For eight decades, geologists have used seismic imaging to estimate oil and gas reserves beneath the rocky undersea terrain.
BP used its own new technology for the billion-barrel discovery. Called full waveform inversion, the technique uses massive amounts of data to create a high-resolution model of reserves that were previously hidden beneath salt deposits.
The firm also aims to tap those reserves without building new multi-billion-dollar platforms.
At Thunder Horse and other platforms, BP is installing wellheads on the seabed and connecting them to pipelines that rise up to existing platforms, like the legs of a spider.
These ""tiebacks"" allow producers to feed oil from remote regions of fields that previously went untapped.
Other design changes helped BP hold down the investment in Mad Dog's second phase from an initially estimated $20 billion to just $9 billion, the company said. Such savings are part of the equation BP uses to estimate the platform's profitability at oil prices of $40 a barrel. 
The struggles of deepwater oil service firms - who were forced to cut prices after per-barrel prices tanked in 2014 - are also keeping BP's expansion costs low.
""If you're going to be building an offshore Gulf of Mexico platform, now is the time to be doing it,"" said Norm MacDonald, portfolio manager for Invesco's energy fund, which has increased its stake in BP, its second-largest holding.
Other funds remain leery of offshore investments because of the longer wait for a return in a volatile industry.
Shale has a ""liquidity premium"" because producers can make smaller investments and recoup them sooner, within two or three years, said Michael Roomberg, a portfolio analyst at Miller-Howard Investments.
Tie-backs and other advances, however, could accelerate deepwater returns and help narrow the liquidity gap with shale, MacDonald said. 
COST CUTTING, SAFETY CONCERNS
BP's growing deepwater investments irk some environmentalists, who say the company has fought paying what it owes to restore shorelines and communities damaged by its massive spill.
They also see the threat of another disaster.
""They never really fulfilled those promises, and people are very skeptical about them expanding drilling,"" said Raleigh Hoke, campaign director at Gulf Restoration Network in New Orleans.
Richard Sears - who served as chief scientist on the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling - said such projects can be managed safely at low oil prices. 
The causes of the BP disaster had more to do with poor decision-making and slipshod safety systems than cost-cutting, said Sears, who previously managed production projects at Shell.
BP said it has bolstered safety operations globally since the spill, introducing a safety and operational risk staff with 800 positions and an internal global wells organization to standardize drilling practices, among other measures. The company says it cannot precisely estimate new spending on safety since the spill because its efforts are integrated into many parts of the company.
In a glassed-in drilling shack on the Thunder Horse platform, operators stay connected to a new onshore command center in Houston that BP designed to monitor data from offshore wells.
On the deck below sits a blowout preventer, a room-sized piece of equipment that would soon be fitted on the wellhead of a drilling site, two miles under water. 

But first it would need a safety inspection - unlike the blowout preventer that infamously failed to contain the 2010 spill, which federal regulators have said had not been inspected in years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Escalating a trade dispute with Canada in the run-up to talks on renegotiating NAFTA, the U.S. Commerce Department on Monday imposed preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber of up to 7.72 percent.
When combined with preliminary anti-subsidy duties issued in April, the new measures will bring total duties on Canadian lumber to between 17.41 percent and 30.88 percent.
The announcement, which was largely expected, prompted an angry reaction from the Canadian government against what it called unfair and punitive duties.
""We will vigorously defend Canada's softwood lumber industry, including through litigation,"" the government said in a statement.
The bilateral dispute is the fifth over lumber in less than 40 years.
U.S. producers asked the Commerce Department last November to investigate what they viewed as unfair subsidies to Canadian competitors, many of whom procure their timber from government lands at cheaper rates.
U.S. lumber producers generally cut timber grown on private land. Canada, which denies it subsidizes producers, said earlier this month it would give C$867 million ($654 million) in aid to the domestic industry.
Earlier on Monday, the Commerce Department said it made a preliminary decision to exclude Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island from its investigation into whether Canada is dumping or unfairly subsidizing softwood lumber.
Until the decision is confirmed, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the duties would still be collected on lumber from the three provinces. The exclusion does not include New Brunswick, an Atlantic province bordering Maine that is also a major producer of softwood lumber. 
The U.S. anti-subsidy and anti-dumping probes affect about $5.66 billion worth of imports of the construction material, and they show the United States taking a tough stance on trade with Canada as the two countries and Mexico prepare to renegotiate the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.
Much of the wood in the excluded Canadian provinces is also harvested from private land, and the three provinces had argued they operate under more of a free-market model.
Commerce said it is scheduled to announce a final decision on the anti-dumping duties on Sept. 7. Its preliminary duties were 7.72 percent for Canfor Corp and related firms, 4.59 percent for Resolute FP Canada, 7.53 percent for Tolko Industries, 6.76 percent for West Fraser Mills and 6.87 percent for all others. 

NAFTA talks are expected to begin around Aug. 16.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday will lay out his plan for reducing regulations to boost already-abundant U.S. production of oil, natural gas and coal and export it around the world, creating American jobs and helping allies.
Trump will deliver an address on his administration's new mantra of ""energy dominance"" at the Energy Department, officials told reporters. They declined to give details on how he would tweak existing regulations that have not stopped a surge in exports.
""We’ve gone from the age of scarcity now to the age of abundance when it comes to American energy,"" Mike Catanzaro, a White House energy policy aide, told reporters.
""We want to use those abundant resources for good here at home and for good abroad as well,"" Catanzaro said.
Trump's speech comes a week before he meets in Warsaw with leaders of a dozen central and eastern European nations who are eager to see more U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) in their markets as an alternative to Russian gas.
Trump is stopping at the summit on his way to the G20 in Hamburg, Germany, where he is expected to meet face-to-face for the first time in his presidency with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Shipments of LNG will play a big part in the ""energy dominance"" strategy, Energy Secretary Rick Perry told reporters, but so will exports of coal and U.S. technology that helps reduce emissions from coal-fired plants, he said.
Perry said he discussed the potential for U.S. coal exports to Ukraine with President Petro Poroshenko during his visit to Washington last week.
The Trump administration believes in an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to energy, Perry said - borrowing the energy catch-phrase of the Obama administration.
U.S. domestic energy prices have plunged in recent years because of the natural gas boom, crowding out competing sources of power, including coal and nuclear. Dozens of nuclear power reactors are in danger of shutting down over the next several years as a result.
The Trump administration wants to make sure the United States remains ""technologically and economically engaged"" in the nuclear industry, Perry said. ""If we do not, then China and Russia will fill that void,"" he said.
But he said the administration would not be ""wildly supportive"" of subsidizing any sectors of the energy industry. Perry said energy supports in the tax code would be examined as the administration and Congress look at tax reform later this year.

""I think we’ll have a good healthy conversation about the energy sector and tax incentives, subsidies - all of that needs to be on the table and we need to have a conversation about it,"" Perry said.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for August delivery added 37 cents to settle at $43.38 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 34 cents to trade at $46.09 a barrel.
Crude prices rebounded from lows shrugging off data from the U.S. Energy Departing showing that shale firms are now on pace to take domestic crude oil output to a record in 2018, surpassing 10 million barrels per day.
Meanwhile, energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc. said in a report on Friday that U.S. drillers added 11 oil rigs in the week to June 23, bringing the total count up to 758, the most since April 2015.
Some analysts remained pessimistic about the rebound in oil prices, as the move higher was not supported by fundamental data or production disruptions.
""I'm seeing little to convince me that this is anything other than a dead cat bounce,"" OANDA senior market analyst Craig Erlam said.
Oil prices are currently in a bear market, falling 20% since the start of the year, despite numerous pledges from Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih, who said that the oil market is moving in the right direction but rebalancing will take time owing to the large surplus in stockpiles.
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year."

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by $10.06, or 0.81%, to $1,246.22 a troy ounce.
Gold failed to capitalize on the release of weaker than expected data as new orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May suggesting a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, increasing investor fears that second-quarter economic growth may not be as robust as previously expected.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that overall orders for durable goods, fell 1.1% in May, the biggest decline since November.
Analysts had forecast durable goods orders to decline -0.6%.
The precious metal has held firm in recent sessions but is expected to come under pressure later this week, as several Fed officials are expected to make a public address.
After raising rates for the second time this year in June, the Federal Reserve indicated that three total rate hikes remained appropriate.
Some analysts, however, continued to questioned whether the Fed would tighten monetary policy again before the year-end.
""The US central bank said they will keep tightening their monetary policy, but traders are not yet convinced that they will be as hawkish as they are letting on."" David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK said.
In a rising interest rate environment, investor appetite for gold weakens as the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal increases relative to other interest-bearing assets such as bonds.

U.S. crude was up 15 cents, or 0.35%, at $43.16 at 08:45 ET. Brent added 12 cents, or 0.26%, to $45.87. Oil received some support from a weaker dollar as prospects for a further U.S. rate hike dimmed. A weaker dollar underpins demand for oil. Investors noted a further increase in U.S. drilling activity. Baker Hughes Friday reported a rise in the U.S. rig count of 11 to 758 in the latest week. That was the highest level since April 2014. Higher U.S. output has undermined output cuts by major producers in an attempt to re-balance supply and demand. OPEC and non-OPEC producers have agreed to curb output by 1.8 million barrels a day. The accord has been extended for another nine months to March of next year."
1116,By Business Insider,"<span>Jun 26, 2017 09:12AM ET</span>",There are several 'red flags' in the oil market right now,"Last November, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries tried to solve this by agreeing to lower production. But this was not enough, and Libya, Nigeria and Iran — three members that weren't part of the agreement — have raised their production.
So have US shale-oil producers, who this week extended a record-long streak of adding drilling rigs.
And so, the supply side failed to avert a 4% slide in oil prices this week to the cheapest levels since OPEC agreed to cut output in November.
Strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) are skeptical that higher demand would be the solution.
""It is hard not to notice some cyclical red flags"" that risk counteracting higher oil prices, said Sabine Schels, a commodity strategist, in a note with colleagues on Friday.
""While most investors blame supply for today's low oil prices, demand has also failed to improve at the speed required to rebalance the global oil market. Looking into 2H17, we now doubt that demand growth will accelerate sufficiently and see downside risks to our forecasts of 1.3 million b/d in both 2H17 and 2018. In the absence of a mirroring supply response, softer consumption could push 2018 balances into surplus. Put differently, demand will not break the current downward price momentum for now.""
Oil demand in the first quarter slowed and was weaker than expected, Schels said, after examining demand growth by region.
The strategists initially pointed to a number of temporary factors like a warmer-than-usual winter in the US and India's decision to void the highest denominations of its currency. But as demand weakness extended into the second quarter, it became clear that these weren't the only reasons.
Worse still, Schels said, is that the demand weakness is spreading to markets that are usually strong including the US and China. ""This suggests that cyclical, rather than solely transient, factors are perhaps also at play here.""
One exception is that air transport has been stronger.
Beyond that, the global economic picture doesn't suggest that countries are going to be demanding more oil soon.
""Clearly, the uncertainty around tax reform has started to dampen sentiment and confidence, with negative consequences for investment and hiring decisions,"" Schels said. ""In Asia Pacific and Japan, economic data and inflation has also started to roll over. In Latin America, the situation in Brazil is unstable leading us to halve our GDP growth expectations for next year to 1.5%.""
China provides the clearest example of a cyclical slowdown, Schels said, amid a softening in industrial production and electricity generation.
BofAML forecasts a slowdown in China's economic growth and thinks that could lead to a slowdown in imports of crude oil.
Central banks could also be complicit in keeping oil demand by forging ahead with raising interest rates. Schels noted that it becomes harder to finance consumption of oil when interest rates rise. Also, if higher rates lead to a stronger dollar, emerging-market countries that are big consumers of energy products could face higher costs.
""Tighter money at a time of weaker activity poses deflationary risks and spillover to the real economy,"" Schels wrote.

1117,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 26, 2017 08:51AM ET</span>",Oil edges higher to start the week but glut concerns hang over market,"Investing.com - Oil prices were higher in North American trade on Monday, albeit off the best levels of the session as concerns over booming shale output growth in the U.S. remained in focus.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude August contract was at $43.30 a barrel by 8:50AM ET (1250GMT), up 29 cents, or around 0.7%. It touched its lowest since August 11 at $42.05 on Wednesday last week.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for September delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London tacked on 26 cents to $46.01 a barrel, after hitting $44.35 last Wednesday, a level not seen since November 14.
WTI lost $1.73, or about 3.9%, last week, while Brent fell $1.67, or roughly 3.8%. Both have now posted losses five weeks in a row, which marks the longest weekly losing streak since August 2015.
Crude reached bear-market territory last week amid concern that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production is derailing efforts by other major producers to rebalance the market.
U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 23rd week in a row, according to data from energy services company Baker Hughes, the longest such streak on record.
The U.S. rig count rose by 11 to 758, extending a year-long drilling recovery to the highest level since April 2014, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The increase in U.S. drilling activity and shale production has mostly offset efforts by OPEC and other producers to cut output in a move to prop up the market.
In May, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Meanwhile, traders will also continue to pay close attention to comments from global oil producers for evidence that they are complying with their agreement to reduce output this year.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for August inched up 0.7 cents, or 0.6%, to $1.430 a gallon, while August heating oil gained 1.1 cents to $1.390 a gallon.

U.S. natural gas for August delivery was at $2.997 per million British thermal units by 8:40AM ET (1240GMT), up 4.6 cents, or around 1.6%. It fell to its lowest since March 8 at $2.875 on Thursday of last week.
Natural gas saw a loss of roughly 3.6% last week.
Temperatures will warm back into the upper 80s to 90s Fahrenheit late in the week over the southern and eastern U.S. as high pressure returns.
Longer-term models showed the western, central, and southern U.S. will be very warm to hot through July 9, as high pressure dominates.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.770 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.4% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 7.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 50 and 61 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 23.
That compares with a gain of 61 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 37 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 72 billion cubic feet.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil edged up for a third straight session on Monday, climbing off last week's seven-month lows but with gains capped by the relentless rise in U.S. supply and bloated global inventories.
Investors in U.S. crude futures and options increased their bets against a further rise in prices, as the number of U.S. oil rigs in operation hit its highest in over three years. [CFTC/] [RIG/U]
U.S. shale oil output is up around 10 percent since last year, while places like Brazil have also hiked output.
The rise in supplies threatens to scupper efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners to reduce global oil inventories with production cuts.
Brent crude futures were up 11 cents at $46.65 per barrel by 1133 GMT, on track for a near 20 percent drop in the first half of the year. It hit a trough of $44.35 on June 21, its lowest level since November. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 17 cents at $43.18 per barrel.
""We saw this continued big rise in oil rigs last week and in our view we don’t need a single additional rig for the next 12 months in the U.S. space if we look at balance for 2018,"" SEB strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said.
""I don’t think OPEC is going to cut deeper, at least not for now. I think it’s keeping its fingers crossed and looking forward to Q3 and Q4 and hoping their medicine will do the trick,"" he added.
OPEC states and 11 other exporters agreed in May to extend cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018, in the hope that it would force global supply and demand to align.
Traders and analysts said there was little fundamental news to justify more of a bounce in oil prices. 
""It is just the fact that the oil market stopped falling ... I suspect short-covering,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. 
Analysts at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch said demand had not grown quickly enough to mop up any excess output.

1120,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2017 07:43AM ET</span>",Clogged oil arteries slow U.S. shale rush to record output,"By David Gaffen
GUERNSEY, WYOMING (Reuters) - A gallon of gasoline that allows a driver on the U.S. East Coast to travel about 25 miles has already navigated thousands of miles from an oil field to one of the world's largest fuel markets.
If its last stop is one of the region's struggling refineries - an increasingly unlikely prospect - the crude used to produce the gas would have probably arrived by tanker from West Africa. That's because the region's five plants have no pipeline access to U.S. shale fields or Canada's oil sands.
Or the journey to an East Coast gas pump might start instead in North Dakota's Bakken shale fields - which means it could take up to three months, including a stop at a Gulf Coast refinery. The same trip would have been even longer a month ago, before the opening of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. 
That line was nearly derailed last year by protesters. Its arduous path to approval provides one case study in the oil industry's struggle to open up a bottleneck holding back resurgent domestic oil production - an outmoded U.S. distribution system.
The equally divisive Keystone XL pipeline provides a more poignant example: First proposed in 2008 to connect Canada's oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries, the line may now never get built - despite the enthusiastic backing of U.S. President Donald Trump.
As permitting dragged on for years, oil prices crashed, dimming the prospects for investment in the oil sands. Top firms have since written down or sold off billions of dollars in Canadian production assets and decamped for U.S. shale fields.
Pipeline construction often lags production booms by years - if proposed lines are built at all - because of opposition from environmentalists and landowners, topographic obstacles, and permitting and construction challenges. That forces drillers to limit output or ship oil domestically, usually by rail - which is more costly and arguably less safe.
The crimped production, in turn, costs the economy jobs, keeps prices higher for consumers and stymies the nation's long-held geopolitical goal of reducing dependence on foreign oil.
Obstacles to pipeline construction are coming into sharp focus as resurgent shale firms, after a two-year downturn, are now on pace to take domestic crude oil output to a record in 2018, surpassing 10 million barrels per day (bpd), according to the U.S. Energy Department.
That would top the previous peak in the early 1970s and challenge Russia and Saudi Arabia for the title of top global producer.
OBSTACLE TO 'ENERGY INDEPENDENCE'
To transport all that oil from central shale regions such as Texas and North Dakota to the East Coast, the U.S. relies largely on pipelines built decades ago. The industry has retooled many old oil arteries, and the resulting patchwork often offers a convoluted route. 
""It's a hodge-podge way of doing it,"" said Tricia Curtis, oil analyst at Petronerds, a consultancy based in Denver.
U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke wants the nation to become the dominant global energy player, and is considering opening more federal lands - such as national parks and Native American reservations - to fossil fuel development. He also aims to lift restrictions on offshore drilling.
That's a new twist on achieving ""energy independence,"" an elusive, almost mythical goal that's been a standby of U.S. political dialogue over the half century since Richard Nixon was president.
Surging shale has reduced import dependence, but achieving anything approaching ""independence"" would require an overhaul of the nation's pipeline network - including construction of the kind of projects that face bleak prospects because of political opposition and geographic realities.
About half of U.S. petroleum consumption is on the East and West Coasts, while the large expanse in the middle of the country accounts for 93 percent of crude output in the lower 48 states.
The challenges to building new pipelines are likely to keep the East and West Coast markets - where most Americans live - dependent on imported oil, said Doug Johnson, vice president at Tallgrass Energy Partners (N:TEP), which operates pipelines and storage facilities in the central and western United States.
The Rocky Mountains makes construction to much of the West Coast impossible, as does difficult topography and dense population on the East Coast.
""Moving new pipelines through those areas is very, very challenging,"" Johnson said.
Tallgrass's Pony Express line kicks off in Guernsey, Wyoming, a small town of 1,000 near the historic Oregon Trail Ruts. It's one small example of the industry's history of repurposing old lines. Originally built as a crude line in 1954, it was converted to a natural gas line in 1997, then changed back into a crude line in 2014.
""This thing is like the cat with nine lives,"" Johnson said. 
NO DIRECT LINE
Building pipelines from faraway oil fields such as the Bakken directly to the densely populated East Coast would be a boon to energy firms and consumers. But it won't happen, said Sandy Fielden, an analyst at Morningstar.
""That flies in the face of NIMBY,"" he said, referring to the 'not in my backyard' political resistance to construction. ""Pipelines being built across New Jersey is not considered to be a practical proposition.""
Resistance to new pipelines in the Northeast has led firms to battle for control of existing lines.
Midwest refiners are clashing with East Coast refiners over a proposal to reverse the flow of fuels on a Pennsylvania pipeline that transports refined products from east to west. Midwest refiners - who can access Dakota and Canada crudes, unlike their East Coast competitors - want that flow reversed to give them access to gasoline markets further east.
In at least one case, pipeline protesters are demanding the removal of an existing line. A 60-year-old Enbridge Line in Wisconsin and Michigan, an essential artery of oil from Canada, has come under fire from opponents of varying political stripes.
Environmentalists call the current pipeline network strong enough. They argue the country needs to look toward renewable energy sources rather than expanding climate-damaging oil-and-gas development.
Another environmental threat comes from an irony of the patchwork of U.S. pipelines - that the network is both over-subscribed and yet, in places, underused. Because many arteries travel similar routes, they duplicate one another and often can't operate at full capacity.
That raises the prospect of damaging leaks that go unnoticed by automated detection systems that require highly pressurized lines to function, said Anthony Swift, a director at the National Resources Defense Council.
One bright spot for firms that already own pipelines: It's far easier, politically and logistically, to expand a line than to build a new one - making existing lines increasingly valuable.
But in the long term, the U.S. will struggle to boost production without new pipelines that serve key consumer markets, said Tad True, president and CEO of Casper, Wyoming-based True Companies, a private pipeline owner.

""One of the successes of this country was based on access to cheap energy,"" he said. ""The continued success of the United States depends on continued access to cheap energy.""

Elsewhere, Brent oil for September delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London climbed 59 cents to $46.34 a barrel, after hitting $44.35 last Wednesday, a level not seen since November 14.
WTI lost $1.73, or about 3.9%, last week, while Brent fell $1.67, or roughly 3.8%. Both have now posted losses five weeks in a row, which marks the longest weekly losing streak since August 2015.
Crude reached bear-market territory last week amid concern that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production is derailing efforts by other major producers to rebalance the market.
U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 23rd week in a row, according to data from energy services company Baker Hughes, the longest such streak on record.
The U.S. rig count rose by 11 to 758, extending a year-long drilling recovery to the highest level since April 2014, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The increase in U.S. drilling activity and shale production has mostly offset efforts by OPEC and other producers to cut output in a move to prop up the market.
In May, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.

Gold for August delivery closed up 0.71% at $1,258.31 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, after rising as high as $1,260.00 earlier.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.37% at 96.98 late Friday, posting its largest one day decline in three weeks.
St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Friday that the Fed should hold off on any further rate increases to see how the economy is progressing.
""Recent inflation data have surprised to the downside and call into question the idea that U.S. inflation is reliably returning toward target,"" he said. ""The Fed can wait and see how the economy develops before making any further adjustments.""
At its meeting the previous week the Fed stuck to its projection for one more rate hike this year despite recent weak inflation data.
The dollar had risen earlier in the week boosted by comments by New York Fed President William Dudley, who said a tightening labor market would push up wages and cause inflation to reverse from its current pullback.
Gold and the dollar typically move in opposite directions, which means if the dollar goes down, gold futures, which are denominated in the U.S. currency, will rise.
Gold is also highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar.

1127,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2017 03:14PM ET</span>","Oil creeps up from 10-month low, down nearly 4 percent on week","By Scott DiSavino
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil futures edged higher on Friday with a lift from a weaker dollar, but finished a fifth straight week lower as OPEC-led production cuts have failed to substantially reduce a global crude glut.
Brent futures (LCOc1) settled up 32 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $45.54 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) (CLc1) ended up 27 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $43.01 per barrel. 
For the week, both benchmarks lost 3.9 percent, and oil currently sits just off 10-month lows, beset by ongoing worries about rising production. The five-week slide represents the longest stretch of weekly declines for the front-month contracts since August 2015.
Prices pared earlier gains after oil services firm  Baker Hughes  (N:BHI) showed U.S. drillers added 11 oil rigs this week, the biggest increase in three weeks. 
""The higher rig count this week reflects decisions made a couple of months ago when oil prices were higher,"" said James Williams, president of WTRG Economics in Arkansas. He said he expects the current low prices to cause the count to fall in some weeks over the next month or two.
The U.S. dollar (DXY) was down 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies, on track for its biggest daily percentage decline since early June after weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data. This boosted greenback-denominated oil.
Still, oil prices remain down about 20 percent this year despite an effort led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd).
It puts the market on course for its biggest first-half percentage fall since the late 1990s, when rising output and the Asian financial crisis led to sharp losses. 
""We doubt that demand growth will accelerate sufficiently to break the current downward price momentum,"" analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) said in a note on Friday, citing surprisingly weak recent economic data in the United States, China and Asia.
OPEC-led efforts to reduce production and end the oil glut have been frustrated by soaring output from the United States and OPEC members Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from the cuts.
Thanks to shale drillers, U.S. oil production  has risen more than 10 percent in the past year to 9.35 million bpd, close to the level of top exporter Saudi Arabia.

""Rising U.S. output continues to stress markets, with increasing evidence that improved efficiency and technology makes many of the shale plays profitable below $40 a barrel,"" analysts at Cenkos Securities wrote.

The report from Baker Hughes comes in the wake of growing fears that the oversupply problem in the market will continue despite Opec and its allies’ high compliance with the global deal to curb production. 
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2017 06:51AM ET</span>",Big Oil turns to big data to save big money on drilling,"By Swetha Gopinath and Liz Hampton
(Reuters) - In today's U.S. shale fields, tiny sensors attached to production gear harvest data on everything from pumping pressure to the heat and rotational speed of drill bits boring into the rocky earth.
The sensors are leading Big Oil's mining of so-called big data, with some firms envisioning billions of dollars in savings over time by avoiding outages, managing supplies and identifying safety hazards.
The industry has long used sophisticated technologies to find oil and gas. But only recently have oil firms pooled data from across the company for wider operating efficiencies - one of many cost-cutting efforts spurred by the two-year downturn in crude oil (CLc1) prices.
ConocoPhillips (N:COP) says that sensors scattered across its well fields helped it halve the time it once took to drill new wells in Eagle Ford shale basin of South Texas.
By comparing data from hundreds of sensors, its program automatically adjusts the weight placed on a drill bit and its speed, accelerating the extraction of oil, said Matt Fox, ConocoPhillips' executive vice president for strategy, exploration and technology.
It is just one application, but if applied to the more than 3,000 wells ConocoPhillips hopes to drill in the Texas basin, those small sensors could lead to ""billions and billions of dollars"" in savings, Fox said in an interview.
""We started using data analytics in our Eagle Ford business,"" he said. ""And everywhere we look there are applications for this.""
The cost and complexity of such systems vary widely. Oil giants such as ConocoPhillips buy a mix of off-the-shelf and custom programs, along with data repositories. The Houston-based producer's employees use Tibco Software Inc's Spotfire data visualization package to analyze information from well sites.
Tibco declined to discuss its pricing.
Services firms including Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) and  General Electric  Co (N:GE) oil and gas unit sell sensor-equipped gear, data repositories and software to improve producers' decision-making. 
Back when oil traded at more than $100 a barrel - before the price crash in 2014 - data analysis was an ""afterthought"" for most oil firms, said Binu Mathew, who oversees digital products at GE Oil & Gas.
Now - with prices at about $43 a barrel after recovering from a low of about $26 in early 2016 - ""the efficiency aspect is far, far more important,"" Mathew said.
FINDING HIDDEN VALUE
A survey by Ernst & Young last year examined 75 large oil and gas companies and found that 68 percent of them had invested more than $100 million each in data analytics during the past two years. Nearly three quarters of those firms planned to allocate between 6 and 10 percent of their capital budgets to digital technology, the survey found.
Effectively mining large data sets could lead to supplanting workers with artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, according to firms selling and buying data-driven technology.
Simple sensors already increase safety and savings by eliminating the need to send workers to rigs or production facilities to gather data. Automating drilling decisions can produce more consistent results by cutting out human errors, said Duane Cuku, vice president of sales for rig technology at  Precision Drilling  Corp (TO:PD).
""The driller is now able to focus his attention on the well - and the performance and safety of his crews - as opposed to the manual manipulation of controls,"" Cuku said.
Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) also uses an analytical tool to find the best design for hydraulic fracturing wells. A new version of the software analyzes data on well completions and geology to recommend whether injecting steam or water would produce more oil.
Abhishek Gaurav, a petroleum engineer for closely-held Texas Standard Oil, said he uses big-data analytics to help his company choose which properties to explore. 
Using Spotfire, the same program utilized by Conoco, Standard applies a combination of data science and petroleum engineering to rank asking prices for land based on a variety of completion, production and geological variables - such as the amount of sand that likely would be required to complete a well in a given formation.
The technique, Gaurav said, has reduced the time needed for evaluating land parcels from weeks to hours - and resulted in better decisions.
""We found value in properties when many other teams did not,"" he said.
RECRUITING IN CALIFORNIA Some of the information craved by oil firms isn't so easy to gather or analyze. 
Surveys and maps that companies use to acquire acreage for drilling, for instance, are often not digitized. Older company data on wells may be unstructured or spread among suppliers using different storage formats, making integration and analysis a challenge. 
General Electric and its oil-and-gas unit are moving aggressively into the business of digitizing industrial equipment for other firms, and have invested in large data processing centers for energy clients. 
GE sees huge potential for market growth: A company study estimated that only 3 percent to 5 percent of oil and gas equipment is connected digitally, and less than one percent of the data collected gets used for decision-making, the study found.
Getting the industry more fully connected will take time.
""There is a huge amount of data prep, data sanitization and data extraction needed for big data to be totally disruptive,"" said Kate Richard, chief executive at private equity investor Warwick Energy. 
She projects a major payoff from the technology is still five or ten years away.
Oklahoma City-based Warwick - which manages interests in thousands of wells across Oklahoma and Texas - is preparing for that payoff by hiring people from tech hubs in California, Richard said.

""They all have computer programming and data science backgrounds,"" she said.

 The EIA report also showed that domestic crude supplies fell by 2.5 million barrels for the week ended June 16, while gasoline stockpiles declined by 600,000 barrels.
Oil prices have been under pressure in recent weeks as concerns over rising U.S. shale output could offset production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC members.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - As the global oil market frets about a stubborn supply glut, faltering demand growth in key Asian crude importers is further hampering efforts to restore market balance. 
A fuel glut in China, a hangover from demonetization in India, and an ageing, declining population in Japan are holding back crude oil demand growth in three of the world's top four oil buyers. 
The three countries make up a fifth of 97 million barrels per day (bpd) in global oil consumption, and any hiccups among them will mean lower-than-expected oil demand growth in Asia, helping to undercut the OPEC-led effort to support prices. 
""We are indeed seeing lower demand from more than a few clients - air, marine, road, industrial ... They are actually consuming less fuel than anticipated,"" said Michael Corley, managing director of Mercatus Energy Advisors.
In China, vying with the United States as the world's biggest oil importer, imports in May were still at a near record of 9 million bpd, but a looming cut in refinery operations is set to hit demand for crude oil in the third quarter. 
In India, which overtook Japan as the world's third-biggest oil importer last year, crude imports fell by more than 4 percent between April and May to around 4.2 million bpd , as after-effects of the country's recent demonetization program hit consumption. 
For the first five months of the year, India's imports are about flat to the same period last year, following an annual rise of 7.4 percent last year. 
In Japan, Asia's most advanced economy, oil demand has been in structural decline for years due to a declining, ageing population, and the rise of cars with better mileage or that use alternative fuels.
Japan in April imported around 3.5 million bpd , down from a peak of 5.9 million bpd hit in 2005. 
Coupled with plentiful supplies, the stuttering demand in Asia has contributed to a 20 percent price fall for Brent crude oil (LCOc1) to around $45 per barrel, in what is the biggest slump in a first half of a year since 1997. 
FLOATING STORAGE
In the latest indicator of a supply overhang, traders said that five very large crude carriers (VLCCs) have been chartered in recent days to store unsold oil. 
Each VLCC can hold around 2 million barrels of oil, and the five chartered for storage add to around 25 supertankers already sitting in southern Malaysian waters. 
In a market condition known as contango, where spot crude oil prices are cheaper than those for future delivery, it is profitable to store oil for a later sales.
Currently, spot Brent is almost $1.50 a barrel cheaper than that for delivery in early 2018. <0#LCO:>
""If oil prices head lower, floating storage will get more traction,"" said Ashok Sharma, managing director of ship broker BRS Baxi in Singapore. 
The cheap spot price comes despite the effort led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production by 1.8 bpd that has been in place since January.
Doubts over OPEC's compliance with its own targets and soaring U.S. output have led to scepticism that markets will re-balance soon. 

""The slide in oil prices continues ... as markets remain skeptical of OPEC's ability to balance supplies,"" ANZ bank said on Friday.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2017 07:23PM ET</span>",U.S. bans fresh Brazil beef imports over safety concerns,"By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The United States halted imports of fresh Brazilian beef on Thursday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said, after a high percentage of shipments failed to pass safety checks.
The USDA had ""recurring concerns about the safety of the products intended for the American market,"" after increasing tests on Brazilian beef in March, according to a statement.
The agency raised scrutiny on Brazilian beef and ready-to-eat products as a precaution following an investigation into corruption involving Brazil's health inspectors that targeted meat companies JBS SA (SA:JBSS3) and BRF SA (SA:BRFS3).
JBS, the world's largest meat packer, declined to comment on the U.S. ban.
The USDA's action threatens the reputation of meat from Brazil, the world's top exporter of beef and poultry, even though the United States is not a top customer. It also could boost domestic sales in the United States.
""Product was already on the water and that's not going to be allowed in,"" Altin Kalo, a U.S. livestock analyst at Steiner Consulting Group, said about shipments headed to the United States from Brazil via boat.
Since March, the USDA has rejected 11 percent of Brazilian fresh beef products, compared to the rejection rate of 1 percent for shipments from the rest of the world, the agency said. The shipments, totaling about 1.9 million pounds, raised concerns about public health, animal health and sanitation, according to the USDA.
The agency said none of the rejected lots made it into the U.S. market.
The move to block Brazilian meat is a turnaround for Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who warned in March that Brazil might retaliate if the United States halted beef imports.
On Thursday, he said in a statement that ""although international trade is an important part of what we do at USDA, and Brazil has long been one of our partners, my first priority is to protect American consumers.""
The U.S. suspension will remain in place until Brazil's Agriculture Ministry ""takes corrective action which the USDA finds satisfactory,"" according to the agency.
A slew of global buyers, including China, Egypt and Chile, curtailed imports of Brazilian meat after Brazilian federal police unveiled an investigation into alleged corruption in the sector on March 17.
Brazilian authorities said at the time that meat companies made payments to government health officials to forego inspections and cover up health violations.
The United States began allowing shipments of fresh beef from Brazil last year after banning them due to concerns about foot and mouth disease in cattle.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose on Thursday, a day after hitting 10-month lows, but market sentiment remained negative because the global crude glut has persisted despite OPEC-led output cuts.
Brent crude futures ended 40 cents higher to $45.22 a barrel, after falling as low as $44.53. Brent fell 2.6 percent the previous session to $44.35, lowest since November.
U.S. crude futures ended up 21 cents a barrel at $42.74 a barrel. On Wednesday, they hit a low of $42.05, their lowest intraday level since August 2016. 
Crude has dropped around 20 percent since late February, erasing gains after OPEC and other countries agreed to cut crude output 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first six months of 2017. 
Last month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers extended the output cut deal for nine months. But the global crude glut has persisted, with output rising in Libya and Nigeria, OPEC members exempt from the cuts.
The price slide has tested OPEC's pledge to do ""whatever it takes"" to support oil prices.
""We think it is lower for longer and rallies should be sold,"" said Tariq Zahir, crude trader and managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.
In the United States, heavy oversupply in gasoline stocks has caused demand on the Colonial pipeline to hit a six-year low.

BASRA, Iraq, (Reuters) - Iraq's oil exports from fields owned by the central government in Baghdad are at around 3.27 million barrels per day (bpd) so far in June, about the same level as in May, Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Thursday.
Total exports for all fields in Iraq, those of Baghdad and the Kurdish region in the north, have averaged 3.8 million bpd so far in June, he told Reuters in the southern oil city of Basra. The country as a whole is producing about 4.315 million bpd, he said.
Kurdish exports are running at about 520,000 to 530,000 bpd so far this month, he said.
Iraq is in ""quiet negotiations"" with foreign oil companies operating in Iraq to amend their services contract, he said, declining to give more details.
The country wants to change the terms of the contracts it deems no longer in its favor after oil prices collapsed three years ago, when they were in excess of $100 per barrel, to about $45 per barrel now.

Iraq is the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' second oil producer, after Saudi Arabia. The group in May rolled over an agreement to cut oil production with other exporting nations, until March, in order to support oil prices.
""Iraq supports the agreement that we reached; if developments happen contrary to OPEC's interests, the (OPEC) ministers will hold an extraordinary meeting,"" he said.
Iraq will continue developing its production capacity and will start executing a sea water injection project in its oilfields at the end of the year, even without an agreement with Exxon (N:XOM), he said.

U.S. natural gas for July delivery was at $2.898 per million British thermal units by 10:40AM ET (1440GMT), up 0.5 cents, or around 0.2%. Futures were at around $2.918 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 61 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 16, above forecasts for a build of 58 billion.
That compared with a gain of 78 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 62 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 82 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.770 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.4% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 7.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, warm to hot conditions will return over the Great Lakes and East with highs back into the 80s to lower 90s in the next three-to-five days.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Traders also watched for any disruptions to energy production in the Gulf of Mexico from tropical storm Cindy. The storm prompted the shut in of 17.2% of oil production and 0.3% of natural-gas output in the Gulf Wednesday, according to the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

1145,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2017 10:00AM ET</span>",Traders test OPEC 'whatever it takes' resolve to defend oil price,"By Henning Gloystein and Dmitry Zhdannikov
SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - When OPEC leader Saudi Arabia pledged in May to do ""whatever it takes"" to defend world oil prices, it didn't expect the market to be testing its resolve just one month later.
As the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended oil production cuts, oil prices fell 18 percent in just 20 days. OPEC members appear determined not to rush into deeper output curbs despite market pressure.
Oil traders have chosen to ignore bullish news for prices - including a long-awaited decline in U.S. oil stocks on Wednesday - and focused instead on negative factors such as a stubborn global glut. [O/R]
As a result, the oil market posted its worst performance in the first six months in two decades effectively signaling its refusal to accept the effectiveness of the OPEC statement and its desire for further production cuts.
The ""whatever it takes"" pledge was made by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in early May, echoing a promise by European central banker Mario Draghi five years ago during his successful fight to defend the euro.
""You cannot fight the Federal Reserve but you can fight OPEC,"" said Bob McNally, President of the Rapidan Group, a Washington-based energy market and policy consultant. ""Somebody at OPEC has to cut further but no one is willing.""
The oil price decline and Saudi's ability to defend prices also puts in the spotlight Saudi Arabia's future king, 31-year-old Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who on Wednesday was made next in line to the throne by his father King Salman.
Prince Mohammed has been the ultimate Saudi energy decision-maker in the last two years and his strategy has shifted from orders to raise oil production to defend OPEC market share to curbing output to prop up prices. 
WAITING IT OUT
Falih and other OPEC ministers and officials have said the cartel would not rush to deepen production cuts from the current four percent to arrest the price decline.
They said the group would rather wait until existing joint cuts with non-OPEC Russia finally result in a global stocks decline during the third quarter when demand for crude oil is usually strong.
OPEC and Russian sources also told Reuters there were few signs the group is preparing any extraordinary action ahead of a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Russia at the end of July.
""We are in discussions with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,"" Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday. ""But making decisions in this organization is very difficult because any decision will mean production cuts for the members,"" he added. 
An oil price surge at the end of the last decade and the start of this one spurred multiple oil production projects around the world, including from U.S. shale formations, resulting in global oversupply which sent prices tumbling from $120 per barrel in 2014 to below $30 per barrel last year.
OPEC and Russia tried to stabilize prices with cuts at around $50-$60 per barrel, but this week Brent prices fell toward $44 per barrel on persistent oversupply worries.
Traders and investors have raised their bets that the oil price will remain under pressure. The U.S. crude options market shows that the largest change since the OPEC meeting in holdings of derivatives maturing in December this year is in put, or sell, options at $45 a barrel. 
Open interest, which shows the number of contracts that are open that have been traded but not yet liquidated, has risen by more than 5,000 lots in the last month to nearly 38,000 lots, equivalent to 38 million barrels of oil. 
SHALE RETURNS AT FULL FORCE
""Global supply outages have fallen to a new low not seen in years. U.S. shale is returning at full force ... (and there are) high storage levels afloat and on land,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum.
The United States is not part of any supply reduction deals and is expected to increase production from shale formations by up to one million barrels per day or almost 10 percent of the country's total crude output.
Berentsen said that unless OPEC deepened cuts or there was a large, unexpected production stoppage, prices will remain low.
""A deeper cut could arrest the price decline but OPEC needs to actually do it rather than just talk about it,"" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.
OPEC sources have said that one of the options could be to include sooner rather than later OPEC members Nigeria and Libya in output cuts after their production grew steeply in recent months from levels previously depressed by unrest. At the moment Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the production cuts agreement.
MISTAKES OF THE PAST
Saudi Arabia, which has the cheapest production costs in the world, has repeatedly said it had learned from its mistakes of the past, when it drastically cut production in the 1980s to prop up prices but lost market share to rivals.
Earlier this year, Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting they should not assume OPEC would extend curbs to offset rising U.S. output.
Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, said OPEC's other choice would be to allow oil prices to drop to levels at which even ""the newly slimline U.S. shale industry struggles to break even at"".
That may not be far off as prices approach cost levels for U.S. shale drillers, who are responsible for a rise in production that has undermined OPEC efforts. 
""For the (Bakken shale), wells completed in 2016-2017, wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel,"" said consultancy Rystad Energy, which specialises in exploration and production.
Besides closely following production patterns of its rivals, OPEC needs to keep a keen eye on global demand.

While major forecasters including the International Energy Agency sees global oil demand growing by a healthy 1.5 percent next year, there are signs growth is slowing in major Asian hubs China and India, the engines of demand growth in recent years.

1147,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 22, 2017 08:45AM ET</span>",Weekly Comic: Booming U.S. shale production sends oil into bear market territory despite OPEC efforts,"Investing.com - Oil prices recovered slightly on Thursday morning, after falling to their lowest level in around ten months a day earlier amid lingering concerns over strong shale output growth in the U.S.
U.S. crude was at $42.89 a barrel in New York trade, up 36 cents, or around 0.9%, after touching its lowest since August 11 at $42.05 in the prior session.
Brent oil tacked on 52 cents to $45.34 a barrel. The global benchmark hit $44.35 on Wednesday, a level not seen since November 14.
Since peaking in late February, oil has dropped around 20%, meeting the technical definition of a bear market.
Crude prices have been under pressure in recent weeks as concerns over a steady increase in U.S. production added to fears over a glut in the market.
U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 22nd week in a row, according to data from energy services company Baker Hughes, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, domestic output climbed by 20,000 barrels to 9.35 million barrels a day last week, almost 8% higher than the same period last year.
The increase in U.S. drilling activity and shale production has mostly offset efforts by OPEC and other producers to cut output in a move to prop up the market.
Last month, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels, prompting market analysts to downgrade their oil price forecast for this year to as low as $20.

1161,By Business Insider,"<span>Jun 21, 2017 09:33AM ET</span>",'A lot of inconsistencies' are driving oil prices through the floor,"Crude oil has fallen back into a bear market. 
The US benchmark of prices — West Texas Intermediate crude — on Tuesday logged a  greater than 20% decline from its most recent high in May. 
It may seem counterintuitive to be bullish on oil when the immediate problem is that there's too much of it. 
But for Neil Dwane, the global strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, oil is going to remain a key ingredient that fuels the global economy. 
""If you're bullish on global growth, then you should be bullish on oil,"" Dwane told Business Insider on Tuesday. ""Oil makes the world go round. If you're bearish on global growth, why is the S&P trading above 2,400? Give me a clue. There's a lot of inconsistencies here.""
At the core of this argument is a disagreement with those who have called for the death of oil. As tech giants like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) invest in green, autonomous transportation, Dwane only sees this as transformative about a quarter of a century from now.
There are ""so many industries where electric vehicles and Tesla might be interesting, but they're just not for the foreseeable future,"" Dwane said, pointing to a five-year horizon. ""We just can't change how we fly around the world or, arguably, how our trade is promoted on ships sailing across the seas. There's an element of hype that needs to be stripped out."" 
So, it's a longer-term view of oil that's a little different from what day traders react to tick-by-tick, such as headlines about OPEC meetings. 
The most immediate issue that weighs on traders minds is that there simply is too much oil being produced and in storage.  Bloomberg reported on Monday that oil-tanker storage rose to a 2017 high of 111.9 million barrels earlier in May, according to the tracking company Kpler. 
That happened even though the Organization of Petroleum of Exporting Countries agreed to cut production from six months from January and extended the deal in May. And so, judging by the price action, traders don't see OPEC's cuts as being effective. 
However, that should not change a bullish longer-term view on oil and the stocks of large producers, Dwane said. 
If Asian demand for oil continues to be the fastest growing in the world, it could help balance the market, he said. Oil demand should look ""fairly robust"" to an investor who is even slightly bullish on China's economy because the country would be needing more oil if it grows at about a 4%-6% pace. 
""If you can get your brain around Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at $1,000 ... certainly you can get your brain around oil at $45,"" Dwane said. The August contract for WTI futures on Wednesday traded little changed, near $43.73 per barrel.
But a fair oil price that would incentivize investment in oilfields to produce the supply that's needed within four years is nearer to the $65 to $74 per barrel range, Dwane said."
1162,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 21, 2017 09:27AM ET</span>",Gold lingers near 5-week lows as Fed seen adopting hawkish stance,"Investing.com - Gold prices were relatively flat in North American morning trade on Wednesday, staying near the lowest level in around five weeks amid expectations for more U.S. interest rate hikes this year.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Comex gold futures were steady at $1,243.55 a troy ounce by 9:25AM ET (1325GMT). Prices of the yellow metal notched a second-straight decline on Tuesday after falling to its lowest since May 17 at $1,242.40.
Also on the Comex, silver futures were down 5.0 cents, or roughly 0.3%, to $16.36 a troy ounce, its lowest since May 12.
Market expectations for another Fed rate hike later this year have improved in wake of hawkish comments made by influential New York Fed Chief William Dudley earlier this week.
Dudley gave an upbeat assessment of the economy on Monday and warned against the central bank taking a pause in the tightening cycle. He added that U.S. inflation is a bit low but should rise alongside wages as the labor market continues to improve, allowing the Fed to continue gradually tightening U.S. monetary policy.
The remarks echoed similar comments made by Fed Chair Janet Yellen in last week’s press conference after the central bank hiked rates for the second time this year and maintained plans to go ahead with another rate hike by year-end.
The Fed also provided greater detail about how it plans to reduce its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet.

U.S. natural gas for July delivery was at $2.931 per million British thermal units by 8:55AM ET (1255GMT), up 2.4 cents, or around 0.8%.
Prices of the fuel ended higher on Tuesday, snapping a two-session losing streak after sliding to the lowest since March 17 at $2.877 at the start of the week.
Wednesday marks the official start of summer and with it brings impressive heat over the Southwest, while far from impressive conditions over the Midwest and East.
Late in the week, warm to hot conditions will return over the Great Lakes and East with highs back into the 80s to lower 90s. Although, yet another cool shot will push into the north-central U.S. this weekend and then across the East next week.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Meanwhile, a tropical system continues to gradually strengthen over the Gulf of Mexico, but still far from ominous.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 49 and 60 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 16.
That compares with a gain of 78 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 62 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 82 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.709 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.6% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 8.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.

1165,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 21, 2017 08:24AM ET</span>",OPEC considers deeper output cuts due to U.S. shale production –Zanganeh,"Investing.com – The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) were mulling over the possibility of increasing their production cuts due to the larger-than-expected output coming from the U.S., Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday.
""The U.S. oil production increase was unpredictable and this increase is more than what OPEC members had foreseen,"" Zanganeh admitted, according to a report from Iranian state broadcaster IRIB.
“We are in consultation with OPEC members to prepare ourselves for a new decision,” he said. 
Oil prices have been under pressure in recent weeks as concern over rising U.S. shale output offset production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 22nd week in a row, extending a year-long drilling recovery to the highest level since April 2015, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The increase in U.S. drilling activity and shale production has mostly offset efforts by OPEC and other producers to cut output in a move to prop up the market.
Last month, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers that are exempt from the deal, such as Libya and Nigeria.
So far this year, oil has lost 20% in value, effectively entering a bear market on Tuesday and also registering its worst performance for the first six months of the year since 1997, according to Reuters’ data. 
Zanganeh admitted that reaching any agreement among the cartel was “very difficult”.
He gave no indication on the possible timing of a decision, though the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee that oversees compliance with the production cut agreement was expected to meet in late July.
U.S. crude futures gained 0.37% to $43.67 by 8:23AM ET (12:23GMT), while Brent oil rose 0.24% to $46.13."

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil steadied on Wednesday, paring earlier losses, but was set for its largest price slide in the first half of any year for the past two decades, as investors discounted evidence of strong compliance by major producers with a deal to cut global output.
August Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were flat at $46.02 a barrel by 1107 GMT, having fallen earlier to seven-month lows.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) for August delivery were up 4 cents at $43.55, having hit their lowest since September on Tuesday.
So far this year, oil has lost 20 percent in value, its worst performance for the first six months of the year since 1997.
Compliance with an agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day from January reached its highest in May since the curbs were agreed last year. 
""The slide in oil prices seems to be unstoppable,"" said Julius Baer commodities research analyst Carsten Menke.
""The supply deal’s effectiveness is increasingly questioned. We believe that downside risks to oil prices from a (disorderly) and early unwinding have risen ... we still see prices trading sideways, spending more time in the high 40s than the low 50s as growing shale output and stagnant western-world oil demand undermine the Middle East's restriction efforts.""

A government report on inventories is due at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday and the official figures often differ sharply from those of the industry group. 
OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers' compliance with the output deal reached 106 percent in May, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. That means they cut output by more than they were required to do.
OPEC compliance with the curbs was 108 percent, while non-OPEC compliance was 100 percent, the source said. Another source confirmed compliance by all producers in May was 106 percent. 
While compliance is high, it is what went on before the production cut that counts, BMI Research said in a note. 

""A number of producers - notably Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Russia - aggressively ramped up output in the run-up to the deal, fast-tracking projects, expanding drilling programs and deploying spare capacity,"" BMI said.

Market expectations for another Fed rate hike later this year have improved in wake of hawkish comments made by influential New York Fed Chief William Dudley earlier this week.
Dudley gave an upbeat assessment of the economy on Monday and warned against the central bank taking a pause in the tightening cycle. He added that U.S. inflation is a bit low but should rise alongside wages as the labor market continues to improve, allowing the Fed to continue gradually tightening U.S. monetary policy.
The remarks echoed similar comments made by Fed Chair Janet Yellen in last week’s press conference after the central bank hiked rates for the second time this year and maintained plans to go ahead with another rate hike by year-end.
The Fed also provided greater detail about how it plans to reduce its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet.

1174,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2017 07:20PM ET</span>",Oil firms could waste trillions if climate targets reached: report,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil giants including  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) risk spending more than a third of their budgets by 2025 on oil and gas projects that will not be feasible if international climate targets are to be met, a thinktank says.
More than $2 trillion of planned investments in oil and gas projects by 2025 risk becoming redundant if governments stick to targets to lower carbon emissions to limit global warming to 2 degrees celsius, according to a report by the Carbon Tracker thinktank and a group of institutional investors.
The report analyzed the costs of oil and gas projects planned for approval by 69 companies into 2025. It then compared their carbon intensity to targets needed to meet the 2 degree limit set by the 2015 Paris agreement, which would lead to a decline in fossil fuel consumption.
According to the report, Exxon, the world's top publicly-traded oil and gas company, risks spending up to half its budget on new fields that will not be needed. Shell and France's Total would see up to 40 percent of their budgets outside the limits.
Fossil fuel companies have come under growing pressure from investors to reduce carbon emissions and increase transparency over future investments. 
Sweden's largest national pension fund, AP7, one of the authors of the report, said last week it had wound down investments in six companies, including Exxon, that it says violate the Paris climate agreement.
The world's top fossil fuel companies have voiced support for the Paris agreement reached by nearly 200 countries. Many of them have urged governments to impose a tax on carbon emissions to support cleaner sources of energy such as gas.
President Donald Trump said this month he would withdraw the United States from the Paris accord which he said would undermine the U.S. economy and weaken American national sovereignty.
The report gave the example of five of the most expensive projects, including the extension of the giant Kashagan field in Kazakhstan and the Bonga Southwest and Bonga North in Nigeria, which will not be needed within the 2 degree scenario.
Around two thirds of the potential oil and gas production which is surplus to requirements under the 2 degree scenario is controlled by the private sector, ""demonstrating how the risk is skewed towards listed companies rather than national oil companies,"" the report said.
On the other hand, Saudi Arabia's national oil company Aramco, widely considered the lowest cost oil producer in the world, would only see up to 10 percent of its production uneconomical under the carbon emissions scenario, the report said.
The report's authors said their discussions with oil companies had shown they wanted to remain flexible to respond to future developments and possible changes in the oil price.

International oil companies including Shell and  BP  (LON:BP) have rejected the idea that some of their assets could end up redundant, saying the reserves they hold are too small to be affected by any long-term decline in demand.

The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the largest privately owned crude storage terminal in the United States, suspended vessel offloading operations early on Tuesday morning ahead of the storm, but said it expected no interruptions to deliveries from its hub in Clovelly, Louisiana. [nFWN1JH0MO]
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), and Motiva Enterprises have said the potential storm has not yet impacted operations at its facilities. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) on Tuesday said some offshore well operations had been suspended but production was currently unaffected.
The weather system in the Gulf of Mexico has a 90 percent chance of becoming a tropical storm in the next day or two, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in its latest advisory.
Currently located about 265 miles (430 km) south of Morgan City, Louisiana, the weather system is expected to approach the southwest Louisiana coast late on Wednesday and move inland over western Louisiana and eastern Texas on Thursday, the hurricane center said.
The storm could strengthen slightly before it reaches the coast, the NHC said. It extended warnings for the storm westward to High Island, Texas, and for heavy rainfall across most portions of the Gulf Coast.
The weather system now has maximum sustained winds of 40 miles per hour (65 kilometers per hour), the Miami-based forecaster said.
""Satellite imagery shows that the center of the disturbance is gradually becoming better defined, and it is likely that the system will become a tropical or subtropical cyclone later today,"" the NHC said on Tuesday.
The storm, currently designated as ""Potential Tropical Cyclone Three,"" could also cause tornados later on Tuesday from south-central Louisiana to the western Florida Panhandle.
Crude oil prices for physical delivery along the U.S. Gulf Coast were relatively stable on Tuesday morning, but cash gasoline prices rose as traders expected refineries along the Gulf Coast to get hit with heavy rains, which may result in flooding. 
Mars Sour crude was last discussed around a $1.60 a barrel discount to U.S. crude futures, little changed from Monday, while Louisiana Light Sweet crude, the light sweet benchmark, was unchanged at a $1.95 a barrel premium to West Texas Intermediate (WTI). 
Meanwhile, prompt U.S. Gulf Coast conventional gasoline traded at a 2 cents per gallon discount to the RBOB futures contract, its strongest level in four months. 
Meanwhile, southeast of the Gulf of Mexico, tropical storm Bret is expected to begin weakening later Tuesday and dissipate on Thursday. 
That storm, located about 315 miles (505 km) east of Curacao and packing maximum sustained winds of 45 miles (75 km) per hour is moving west-northwest and will continue to proceed across the southeastern Caribbean Sea, the hurricane center said.
The Gulf of Mexico is home to about 17 percent of U.S. crude output and 5 percent of dry natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of the nation's refining capacity is located along the U.S. Gulf Coast, which also is home to 51 percent of total U.S. natural gas processing capability. 
WeatherBell Analytics LLC forecast 11 to 13 named tropical storms in the 2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season, according to a May outlook issued by the company.

The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30, and has an average of 9.6 named storms, 5.9 hurricanes and 2.3 intense hurricanes every year. The median number of named storms between 1981 and 2010 was 12 per year, according to Colorado State University's Tropical Meteorology Project.

U.S. natural gas for July delivery was at $2.889 per million British thermal units by 9:25AM ET (1325GMT), down half a cent. It fell to its lowest since March 17 at $2.877 in the prior session.
Natural gas prices lost 14.3 cents, or around 4.7%, on Monday, their worst one-day drop since January.
A cool front will sweep across the eastern U.S. the next few days with heavy showers and powerful thunderstorms, thereby dropping highs into the upper 60s and 70s with little demand for heating or cooling.
Longer-term models showed considerably cooler temperatures for late next weekend into the following week as weather systems over southern Canada advance more aggressively into the northern and eastern U.S.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.709 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.6% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 8.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 49 and 60 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 16.
That compares with a gain of 78 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 62 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 82 billion cubic feet.

Also on the Comex, silver futures were down 4.2 cents, or roughly 0.3%, to $16.46 a troy ounce, its lowest since May 18.
Market expectations for another Fed rate hike later this year have improved in wake of hawkish comments made by influential New York Fed Chief William Dudley on Monday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil markets held around seven-month lows on Tuesday as investors focused on persistent signs of rising supply that are undermining attempts by OPEC and other producers to support prices.
Brent futures were up 4 cents at $46.95 at 0214 GMT. On Monday, they fell 46 cents, or 1 percent, to settle at $46.91 a barrel.
That was their lowest since Nov. 29, the day before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers agreed to cut output for six months from January.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 1 cent at $44.19 a barrel. They declined 54 cents, or 1.2 percent in the previous session, to settle at $44.20 per barrel, the lowest close since Nov. 14. The July contract will expire on Tuesday and August will become the front-month.
Both benchmarks are down around 15 percent since late May, when OPEC, Russia and other producers extended by nine months the cut in output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd).
""Recent data points are not encouraging,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a research note. ""Identifiable oil inventories - both crude and product in the OECD, China and selected other non-OECD countries - increased at a rate of (about) 1 (million bpd) in 1Q."" 
OPEC supplies jumped in May as output recovered in Libya and Nigeria, two countries exempt from the production cut agreement. 
Libya's oil production has risen more than 50,000 bpd after the state oil company settled a dispute with Germany's Wintershall, a Libyan source told Reuters. 
Analysts said rising U.S. crude production has fed the global glut. Data on Friday showed a record 22nd consecutive week of increases in U.S. oil rig numbers.
Still, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih remained confident OPEC's cuts were working. The oil market is heading in the right direction but still needs time to rebalance, al-Falih told the London-based newspaper Asharq al-Awsat.

""In my opinion, market fundamentals are going in the right direction, but in light of the large surplus in stockpiles over the past years, the cut needs time to take effect.""

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for August delivery edged up 0.05% to $44.55 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent rose 0.06% to $46.94 a barrel.
The American Petroleum Institute (API) will release its weekly inventory estimates after the U.S. market close on Tuesday, followed by more-closely watched figures from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday. The API and EIA figures often diverge.
Initial forecasts expect a drop of 2.180 million barrels in crude oil and a build of 600,000 barrels for distillates. Gasoline inventoires which rose an unexpected 2.096 million barrels last week had so far not seen expectations listed.
Overnight, crude futures settled lower on Monday, despite Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih downplaying the impact of rising output from Libya, Nigeria and the United States, insisting that the oil market is expected to balance in the fourth quarter.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih set out to reassure market participants that rising output from U.S. shale, Nigeria and Libya would not derail OPEC’s plan to reduce crude output, and insisted that the oil market would rebalance soon.
“The forecasts that the oil market will re-balance in the fourth quarter have taken into consideration the rise in shale oil production,” he said. The rise in crude output from Libya and Nigeria is posing no threat as “the level of increase from these two countries is still within the limits set by the Algeria agreement of 500,000 barrels a day,” he told the Saudi-owned daily.
The Saudi Energy minister’s comments came ahead of data on Monday showing Libya's oil production has risen by over 50,000 bpd to 885,000 bpd after the state oil firm settled a dispute with Germany's Wintershal.
Rising output from Libya and Nigeria has weighed on OPEC’s pact to reduce production, as both nations are exempt from making production cuts.
Last week, OPEC revealed that output from the group rose by 336,000 barrels per day in May to 32.14m barrels per day.
In recent weeks, analysts have slashed their forecasts for oil prices on the back of growing concerns that OPEC and its allies’ efforts may not stem the glut in supply, which has pressured prices for nearly three years.
JP Morgan scaled back its 2018 WTI forecast by $11—from $53.50 to $42. The price projection for Brent was also slashed, by $10, from $55.50 to $45.

1189,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2017 07:20PM ET</span>","China's pork demand hits a peak, shocking producers, as diets get healthier","By Dominique Patton
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's frozen dumpling makers are finding there's a quick route to winning new sales - increase the vegetable content, and cut down on the meat.
This departure from traditional pork-rich dumplings is a hit with busy, young urbanites, trying to reduce the fat in diets often heavy on fast food.
""They like to try to eat more healthy products once a week or fortnight. It's a big trend for mainland China consumers, especially those aged 20 to 35,"" said Ellis Wang, Shanghai-based marketing manager at U.S. food giant  General Mills  (N:GIS), which owns top dumpling brand Wanchai Ferry.
For pig farmers in China and abroad, it is a difficult trend to stomach. The producers and other market experts had expected the growth to continue until at least 2026.
Chinese hog farmers are on a building spree, constructing huge modern farms to capture a bigger share of the world's biggest pork market, while leading producers overseas have been changing the way they raise their pigs to meet Chinese standards for imports. Some have, for example, stopped using growth hormones banned in China.
China still consumes a lot more meat than any other country. People here will eat about 74 million tonnes of pork, beef and poultry this year, around twice as much as the United States, according to U.S. agriculture department estimates. More than half of that is pork and for foreign producers it has been a big growth market, especially for Western-style packaged meats.
But pork demand has hit a ceiling, well ahead of most official forecasts. Sales of pork have now fallen for the past three years, according to data from research firm Euromonitor. Last year they hit three-year lows of 40.85 million tonnes from 42.49 million tonnes in 2014, and Euromonitor predicts they will also fall slightly in 2017.
Chinese hog prices are down around 25 percent since January, even though official numbers suggest supply is lower compared with last year.

RARE LUXURY
Since China began opening up to the world in the late 1970s, pork demand expanded by an average 5.7 percent every year, until 2014 as the booming economy allowed hundreds of millions of people to afford to eat meat more often. During Mao Zedong's reign as Chinese leader from 1949-76 meat had, for many, been a rare luxury.
Now, growing concerns about obesity and heart health shape shopping habits too, fuelling sales of everything from avocados to fruit juices and sportswear. [http://reut.rs/2rpFDhp] [http://reut.rs/2tis0Tg]
""Market demand remains very weak. I think one factor behind this is people believe less meat is healthier. This is a new trend,"" said Pan Chenjun, executive director of food and agriculture research at Rabobank in Hong Kong.
Sales of vegetable-only dumplings grew 30 percent last year, compared with around 7 percent for all frozen dumplings, Nielsen research also shows.
""Demand for vegetable products keeps rising, giving us large room for growth,"" said Zhou Wei, product manager at number two dumpling producer Synear Food.
Guangzhou-based Harmony Catering says health is the key to reduced servings of meat to the roughly 1 million workers eating at its 300 canteens each day.
Staff at the technology companies, banks and oil majors that are Harmony's clients will consume about 10 percent less meat today than they did five years ago, but around 10 percent more green vegetables, according to Harmony vice president Li Huang. ""It's mainly because of media, the concept of health has entered popular consciousness,"" he said.
For now, it's mostly urban and white-collar workers paying closer attention to their diets. There's been, for example, a sharp rise in vegetarian food stations at university campuses. But the government wants a nationwide shift in eating habits.
Childhood obesity in China is rocketing, and the country also faces an epidemic of heart disease, Harvard researchers warned last year. Among the problems, they blamed growing consumption of red meat and high salt intake.
In April, the health ministry kicked off its second 10-year healthy lifestyle campaign, urging citizens to consume less fat, salt and sugar, and aim for a 'healthy diet, healthy weight and healthy bones'.
By 2030, Beijing wants to see a marked increase in nutritional awareness, a 20 percent cut in the per capita consumption of salt, and slower growth in the rate of obesity, it said in its recently published 'Healthy China 2030' pamphlet.
Meat consumption by type and country: http://reut.rs/2s3F00J
Some companies have been urgently changing the mix of products they sell, going for higher-margin pork meats rather than volume. Sales of traditionally less popular lamb and beef have also been increasing.
Li of Harmony Catering says although servings of pork are down, the firm is including more beef and lamb in meals.
""People usually eat lean beef or lamb, like beef brisket, while with pork it's both fatty and lean parts, like in 'hong shao rou',"" said Beijing-based nutritionist Chen Zhikun, referring to the widely consumed braised pork dish.
China's top pork producer WH Group has been going up market, selling Western-style products in China, such as sausages and ham. A lot of this is imported from Smithfield, the largest U.S. pork producer, which was acquired by WH in 2013.
Some producers say that the recent drop in pork consumption can be partly explained by sharply lower output. A prolonged period of losses during 2013 to 2015 forced farmers to cull millions of hogs, hitting supply and sending pork prices to record levels in 2016.
But for a growing portion of Chinese consumers, price tags on food items are less and less important. A spate of safety scandals in recent years, many related to meat, have made urban Chinese highly sensitive to food quality.
More than 80 percent of people in China surveyed by Nielsen last year said they were willing to pay more for foods without undesirable ingredients, much higher than the global average of 68 percent.
""China is in a new stage where consumption of pork and other foods is no longer a simple matter of 'more is better',"" said Fred Gale, senior economist at the United States agriculture department.

A Commerce Department investigation found that exporters from China had sold hardwood plywoods used for wall panels, kitchen cabinets, tabletops and flooring in the United States for as much as 114.72 percent below fair value, the department said in a statement.
The department preliminarily set an anti-dumping margin of 114.72 percent for Shandong Dongfang Bayley Wood Co Ltd and a margin of 57.36 percent for other respondents eligible for a separate rate.
A rate of 114.72 percent was set for other Chinese producers who belong to a China-wide entity, the Commerce Department said in a statement. 
Mandatory respondent Linyi Chengen Import and Export Co Ltd was determined not to be dumping and was not assessed an anti-dumping margin, the department said.
As a result of the decision, the Commerce Department will instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to require cash deposits from the firms based on those preliminary rates. Linyi Chengen will not be subject to a cash deposit rate.
The Commerce Department said a final determination in the case was expected around Aug. 31.
The investigation was launched after the Coalition for Fair Trade in Hardwood Plywood initiated a complaint on behalf of itself and its members, six private firms in Oregon, New York and North Carolina.
The Commerce Department issued a preliminary finding in April that the plywood firms were being subsidized by Beijing and should be subjected to countervailing duties ranging from 9.89 percent to 111.09 percent.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2017 05:30PM ET</span>",U.S. sees possible legal challenges to crackdown on steel imports,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration expects U.S. and World Trade Organization-related legal challenges in response to a possible crackdown on foreign imports of steel or aluminum, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said on Monday.
President Donald Trump ordered the investigation in April under the rarely used section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. It allows the president to impose restrictions on imports for reasons of national security. 
Ross is expected to announce within days the outcome of the steel inquiry. 
""We assume that if there is any affirmative action that comes out of either one, there probably will be either a domestic legal challenge and, or, a WTO challenge, so we have that very much in mind,"" Ross told a news conference on the sidelines of the SelectUSA investment summit.
The administration says the lack of domestic producers could impede U.S. defense procurement for its armed forces as well as for strategically important infrastructure. Foreign steel companies have been concerned the probe may be aimed at shoring up American producers and cutting out foreign competition
While the investigation has mainly been aimed at cheap imports from China, European steel exporters worry they will be targeted by the U.S. measures.
European steel association (Eurofer) chief Axel Eggert told Reuters last week his group was exploring options, including submitting a complaint to the World Trade Organization, in response to U.S. tougher measures.
Speaking during the investment conference, Ross said he expects the outcome of the investigations to be concluded this month. Trump would move swiftly to act on the recommendations of the report, he added.
""The president being the president I don't think he will dilly dally very long on making his decision whatever it turns out to be,"" Ross said. ""I would expect this to come to a head during the month of June.""
Steel stocks gained broadly on Monday after four steel companies were upgraded following a Reuters report on Friday that the investigation was nearly done.
 Nucor  (NYSE:NUE), Steel Dynamics, U.S. Steel, and AK Steel were all upgraded to buy by Longbow Research.
The S&P 1500 steel sector .SPCOMSTEEL was up 2.5 per cent. U.S. Steel was up 3.9 per cent, AK Steel was up 4.0 per cent, Nucor was up 3.1 pct and Steel Dynamics was up 1.6 pct.
Asked during a panel discussion on Monday with UK trade minister Liam Fox whether European concerns over a potential U.S. crackdown steel were overblown, Ross said: ""There have been a number of European companies against whom we have had trade cases and so the problem of overcapacity is not unique to one segments over the world, it happens to be very concentrated in China.""
""Since we are the world's largest importer of steel, we're the main victim of the overcapacity, so that is the issue we have to grapple with,"" he added.
Fox acknowledged that Britain had concerns over possible U.S. actions on steel imports because the two countries traded steel for military projects. The two countries had a ""shared view"" on national security as NATO allies, he added. 

""We will wait to see what the report says. It's in our interest that global overcapacity is dealt with ... but we have unique US-UK security concerns which we have raised,"" he added.

1192,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2017 04:57PM ET</span>","Trump's coal plan sends U.S. energy ""back to the past"": Vatican","By Alister Doyle
OSLO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is sending U.S. energy production ""back to the past"" with disastrous decisions to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and to promote the coal industry, a senior Vatican official said on Friday.
Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, said Pope Francis was concerned that any harm to the environment will be like a ""boomerang that will come back ... especially to poor people"" with ever worsening effects. 
Trump said on June 1 he was pulling the United States out of the 195-nation Paris climate agreement, the first to oblige all nations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, saying he wanted to create jobs in the U.S. fossil fuel industry.
Trump said participating in the pact would undermine the U.S. economy, wipe out jobs, weaken national sovereignty and put his country at a permanent disadvantage.
""This is to go back to the past and not to see the future,"" Sanchez Sorondo, an Argentine like the pope, told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said future energy jobs would be in renewables, such as wind or solar power, rather than coal.
Withdrawal from the Paris Agreement ""is a disaster for this country (the United States) and also for all the world"", he said, echoing remarks he made to an Italian newspaper just before Trump's announcement.
Many other leaders have expressed dismay and anger at Trump's withdrawal and pledged to push ahead with the Paris accord. Among them, German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged action to protect ""Mother Earth"".
SCIENCE TEACHING
The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to phase out greenhouse gas emissions this century to limit a rise in average temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.
The pope has urged Trump to be a peacemaker and gave him a signed copy of a 2015 encyclical about the environment in a meeting in the Vatican last month. Sanchez Sorondo said he had not heard if Trump had read the document.
Sanchez Sorondo criticized what he called the poor level of teaching of science in the United States, compared to many European countries such as Germany. ""The German people are more educated in sciences and believe in science,"" he said. 
""The real situation of the Earth today, of the planet, is described by scientists,"" he said. To anyone on the surface the Earth can seem flat but scientific findings mean ""it's difficult to say the Earth is not round,"" he said.
The Vatican has embraced climate change science in recent years, a quicker acceptance than in some other areas. Pope John Paul acknowledged only in 1996, for instance, that Charles Darwin's 1859 theory of evolution was ""more than a hypothesis"".
During his campaign, Trump dismissed man-made climate change as a hoax. By contrast, a U.N. panel of climate scientists says it is at least 95 percent probable that most warming since the 1950s is caused by human activities.
Sanchez Sorondo will attend a meeting in Oslo on Monday of faith leaders to discuss how to protect tropical rainforests such as in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Congo basins.

Protecting forests fits into religious traditions that humans are stewards of the planet, not just exploiting nature, he said. ""This was an idea of the Bible but also an idea of the Greeks and all civilizations,"" he said.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for August delivery was last quoted at $44.34 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent was last quoted at $46.88 a barrel.
The American Petroleum Institute (API) will release its weekly inventory estimates after the U.S. market close on Tuesday, followed by more-closely watched figures from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday. The API and EIA figures often diverge.
Overnight, crude futures settled lower on Monday, despite Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih downplaying the impact of rising output from Libya, Nigeria and the United States, insisting that the oil market is expected to balance in the fourth quarter.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih set out to reassure market participants that rising output from U.S. shale, Nigeria and Libya would not derail OPEC’s plan to reduce crude output, and insisted that the oil market would rebalance soon.
“The forecasts that the oil market will re-balance in the fourth quarter have taken into consideration the rise in shale oil production,” he said. The rise in crude output from Libya and Nigeria is posing no threat as “the level of increase from these two countries is still within the limits set by the Algeria agreement of 500,000 barrels a day,” he told the Saudi-owned daily.
The Saudi Energy minister’s comments came ahead of data on Monday showing Libya's oil production has risen by over 50,000 bpd to 885,000 bpd after the state oil firm settled a dispute with Germany's Wintershal.
Rising output from Libya and Nigeria has weighed on OPEC’s pact to reduce production, as both nations are exempt from making production cuts.
Last week, OPEC revealed that output from the group rose by 336,000 barrels per day in May to 32.14m barrels per day.
In recent weeks, analysts have slashed their forecasts for oil prices on the back of growing concerns that OPEC and its allies’ efforts may not stem the glut in supply, which has pressured prices for nearly three years.
JP Morgan scaled back its 2018 WTI forecast by $11—from $53.50 to $42. The price projection for Brent was also slashed, by $10, from $55.50 to $45.

An investigation by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration into whether foreign-made steel imports pose a risk to U.S. national security is nearly done, a senior U.S. official said on Friday. The probe's findings are expected to be released later this week.

She added: ""We've also heard that duties or quotas are due to be imposed to reduce imports.""
From Germany's perspective there are no indications that European or German steel imports could threaten or adversely affect U.S. national security, Zypries wrote.
She also warned that other countries could understand the U.S.'s course of action as an ""invitation"", adding: ""That would open the door to protectionist measures.""

1198,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2017 11:58AM ET</span>",Oil prices flat after weeks of steep declines,"By Scott DiSavino
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were flat on Monday after diving 13 percent since late May as rising production in the United States, Libya and Nigeria have foiled an OPEC-led effort to support the market by cutting production. 
Brent (LCOc1) futures for August were down 4 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $47.33 a barrel by 11:39 a.m. EDT (1539 GMT), while U.S. crude (CLc1) for July was down 9 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $44.65 per barrel the day before the July contract expires.
The premium of the Brent front-month over the same month for WTI  is now at its highest since late May, when producers led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended by nine months its pledge to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day.
""Lack of major upside price response to the OPEC output cuts upping the odds of reduced compliance to the agreement in our opinion,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note.
OPEC supplies actually jumped in May as output recovered in Libya and also Nigeria, two countries exempt from the production cut agreement.
Analysts also said a steady rise in U.S. crude production has also fed the global crude glut. Data on Friday showed a record 22nd consecutive week of increases in the number of U.S. oil rigs, bringing the count to 747, the most since April 2015.
""There is no reason to be overly optimistic at the moment,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Carsten Fritsch. 
Libya's oil production has risen more than 50,000 bpd to 885,000 bpd after the state oil company settled a dispute with Germany's Wintershall, a Libyan oil source told Reuters.
Investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said if the U.S. rig count holds, fourth-quarter domestic oil production would rise 770,000 bpd from the same period last year in the Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Niobrara shale oilfields. 
There are also indicators that demand growth is stalling in Asia, the world's biggest oil-consuming region, even though China increased the 2017 oil import quotas for its refineries.
Japan's customs-cleared crude imports fell 13.5 percent in May from a year earlier. India took in 4.2 percent less crude in May than the year before. 

Saudi Arabia's crude exports in April fell to 7 million bpd, official data showed. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the oil market needed time to rebalance.

Comex gold futures were at $1,251.20 a troy ounce by 9:05AM ET (1305GMT), down $5.30, or around 0.4%. Prices fell to $1,249.80 earlier in the session, a level not seen since May 24.
Gold prices lost $13.20, or roughly 1.2%, last week, the second weekly decline in a row, after the Fed raised interest rates and kept the door open for another hike in 2017.
Also on the Comex, silver futures were down 7.5 cents, or around 0.5%, to $16.59 a troy ounce, after hitting its lowest since May 19 at $16.56.
In a business roundtable held in Plattsburg, New York, Dudley said U.S. inflation is a bit low but should rise alongside wages as the labor market continues to improve, allowing the Fed to continue gradually tightening U.S. monetary policy.
The remarks echoed similar comments made by Fed Chair Janet Yellen in last week’s press conference after the central bank hiked rates for the second time this year.
Later in the global day, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak about current economic conditions and monetary policy at an event in New York City.
They are the first of a slew of Fed appearances scheduled for this week including Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer and Governor Jerome Powell.
Last week, the Fed raised interest rates as widely expected and maintained plans to go ahead with another rate hike by year-end. The central bank also provided greater detail about how it plans to reduce its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet.
Despite the Fed's relatively hawkish message, market players remained doubtful over its ability to raise rates as much as it would like before the end of the year due to a recent run of disappointing U.S. economic data.
Futures traders are pricing in less than a 20% chance of a hike at the Fed's September meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Odds of a December increase was seen at about 40%.

The increase in U.S. drilling activity and shale production has mostly offset efforts by OPEC and other producers to cut output in a move to prop up the market.

U.S. natural gas for July delivery was at $2.898 per million British thermal units by 8:40AM ET (1240GMT), down 14.0 cents, or around 4.6%. It fell to its lowest since March 17 at $2.884 earlier in the session.
A cool front will sweep across the eastern U.S. the next few days with heavy showers and powerful thunderstorms, thereby dropping highs into the upper 60s and 70s with little demand for heating or cooling.
Longer-term models showed considerably cooler temperatures for late next weekend into the following week as weather systems over southern Canada advance more aggressively into the northern and eastern U.S.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.709 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.6% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 8.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 49 and 60 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 16.
That compares with a gain of 78 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 62 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 82 billion cubic feet.

His comments underscore growing government backing for derivatives markets for commodities ranging from copper to oil to fruits in a bid to support the real economy, as Beijing ramps up regulation of equities markets and tries to tame its red-hot property market.
However, any major push by wealth managers into the futures sector could also increase volatility in prices of raw materials, like iron ore, which have been whipsawed by speculative and institutional investors in recent years.
""Commodities are indispensable resources for the industrial economy,"" Fang said. 
While securities and futures institutions had developed derivatives-based products for commodities, the overall size was still small, he said.
Exchanges must continue to develop futures and options contracts to add to the 54 existing agricultural, metals, energy and financial products, while regulators will accelerate efforts to open up commodity markets to foreign investors, he said.
To illustrate the vast size of China's personal wealth, Fang referred to a report by Boston Consulting Group, which showed assets held by individuals reached 1.2 trillion yuan ($176 billion) last year, behind only the United States.
About 40 percent of that is in bank savings and wealth management, another 40 percent is in real estate, 10 percent in the stock market and another 10 percent in trusts and other products, the report showed.

1206,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 18, 2017 04:30PM ET</span>",Crude Oil Futures - Weekly Outlook: June 19 - 23,"Investing.com - Oil futures settled a bit higher on Friday, but prices still suffered their fourth straight weekly loss as the market weighed rising U.S. drilling against ongoing efforts by major producers to cut output to reduce a global glut.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude July contract inched up 28 cents, or around 0.6%, to end at $44.74 a barrel by close of trade Friday. It touched its lowest since May 5 at $44.22 on Thursday.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for August delivery advanced 45 cents to settle at $48.15 a barrel by close of trade, after hitting a daily trough of $47.40, a level not seen since May 5.
For the week, WTI lost $1.13, or about 2.4%, while Brent fell 78 cents, or roughly 1.6%. Both have now posted losses four weeks in a row, which marks the longest weekly losing streak since August 2015 for WTI.
Concern that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production is derailing efforts by other major producers to rebalance the market remained in focus.
Data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed on Friday that U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 22nd week in a row, the longest such streak on record, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The U.S. rig count rose by six to 747, extending a year-long drilling recovery to the highest level since April 2015.
The increase in U.S. drilling activity and shale production has mostly offset efforts by OPEC and other producers to cut output in a move to prop up the market.
Last month, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for July tacked on 1.9 cents, or about 1.3% to end at $1.454 on Friday. It still closed down around 3.1% for the week.
July heating oil added 1.2 cents to finish at $1.427 a gallon. For the week, the fuel declined roughly 0.3%.
Natural gas futures for July delivery shed 1.9 cents to settle at $3.037 per million British thermal units. It saw a weekly loss of less than 0.1%.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Meanwhile, traders will also continue to pay close attention to comments from global oil producers for evidence that they are complying with their agreement to reduce output this year.

The Fed raised interest rates as widely expected on Wednesday and maintained plans to go ahead with another rate hike by year-end. The central bank also provided greater detail about how it plans to reduce its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet.
Despite the Fed's relatively hawkish message, market players remained doubtful over the Fed's ability to raise rates as much as it would like before the end of the year due to a recent run of disappointing U.S. economic data.

Meanwhile, copper lost less than half a cent on Friday to settle at $2.564 a pound, ending about 3.2% lower for the week.
Following a busy week packed with central bank meetings, market players will focus on a handful of Federal Reserve speakers in the week ahead, as they look for more clues on future monetary policy moves.
Traders will also keep an eye out on more U.S. housing data to gauge if a recent downtick in consumer spending and inflation is translating into lower home prices and slack in sales.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for July delivery rose 28 cents to settle at $44.74 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 32 cents to trade at $47.24 a barrel.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported on Friday that the number of U.S. oil drilling rigs in operation rose by 6 to 747 in the week to June 16, stoking fears that the rising U.S. production could derail Opec’s efforts to reduce global inventories to the five-year average.
“[But] even by the end of the year, it looks to us that there will still be 150m-200m barrels of surplus inventories.” Gary Ross, head of oil at Pira Energy Group, a unit of S&P Global Platts.
The Baker Hughes report came after a duo of inventory updates from both Opec and the International Energy Agency earlier in the week, showing that production remained elevated while stockpiles continued to swell.
Opec said Tuesday, that output from the group rose by 336,000 barrels per day in May to 32.14m barrels per day while the International Energy Agency said it expects production to grow by 700,000 bpd this year.
In May, Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year."

U.S. crude futures for July delivery were up 0.54% at $44.70 a barrel, just off Thursday’s six-week lows of $44.22.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the August Brent advanced 0.90% to $47.34 a barrel, not far from the previous session’s six-week trough of $46.70 a barrel.
Oil prices tumbled after the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday said that crude oil inventories fell by 1.7 million barrels in the week ended June 9, disappointing expectations for a decline of around 2.8 million barrels.
 The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 2.1 million barrels, compared to forecasts for a drop of 457,000 barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a rise of 328,000 barrels.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Friday but remained near six-month lows, held down by an ongoing supply overhang that persists despite an OPEC-led effort to cut production and prop up crude markets.
Brent crude futures were at $47.12 per barrel at 0656 GMT, 20 cents, or 0.4 percent, above their last settlement.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $44.56 per barrel, up 10 cents, or 0.2 percent.
Traders said the slight increases were a result of the threat of a partial export halt in Libya.
However, prices for both benchmarks are still down by around 13 percent since late May, when producers led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) extended a pledge to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) by an extra nine months until the end of the first quarter of 2018. 
Rising U.S. oil output, particularly from shale drillers, is contributing to the ineffectiveness of the OPEC-led cuts. 
""Oil is unlikely to find solace into the weekend either, with tonight's Baker Hughes Rig Count expected to deliver its now weekly increase of operational rigs,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore.
U.S. investment bank Jefferies said the low prices were due to ""a relentless build in the U.S. rig count, weekly builds in U.S. inventories, rising production in Nigeria and Libya, and weak compliance by key OPEC members Iraq and the UAE.""
High exports and production from Russia is also contributing to the ongoing glut.
Top producer Russia, not an OPEC member but participating in the deal, is expected to export 61.2 million tonnes of oil via pipelines in the third quarter (around 5 million bpd), against 60.5 million tonnes in the second quarter, according to industry sources and Reuters calculations. 
Add in Russia's tanker shipments and its total exports are likely more than 9 million bpd. 
In the United States, which is not participating in any deal to hold back production, oil output has risen more than 10 percent over the past year to 9.3 million bpd, and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects that figure to rise above 10 million bpd in 2018. 
In a sign of the continuing supply overhang, traders are again hiring oil tankers to store unsold crude while they wait for higher prices.

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2017 02:41AM ET</span>",Funds pull back from Permian as U.S. shale oil firms go into overdrive,"By Julia Simon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cash, people and equipment are pouring into the prolific Permian shale basin in Texas as business booms in the largest U.S. oilfield. But one group of investors is heading the other way - concerned that shale may become a victim of its own success.
The speed of the recovery in the U.S. shale industry in the past year has surprised oil investors after a global supply glut led to a two-year crude price slump and bankrupted many shale firms.
Eight prominent hedge funds have reduced the size of their positions in ten of the top shale firms by over $400 million, concerned producers are pumping oil so fast they will undo the nascent recovery in the industry after OPEC and some non-OPEC producers agreed to cut supply in November. 
The funds, with assets of $286 billion and substantial energy holdings, cut exposure to firms that are either pure-play Permian companies or that derive significant revenues from the region, according to an analysis of their investments based on Reuters data.
The Permian, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico, produces about 2.5 million barrels of oil per day (bpd), accounting for more than a quarter of overall U.S. crude production.
""We'll have to see if these U.S. producers have the discipline to not go crazy and keep prices where they keep making money,"" said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Dallas-based investment firm Hodges Capital Management.
Hodges Capital owns shares of Permian play firms including  Diamondback Energy Inc  (O:FANG), RSP Permian Inc (N:RSPP) and Callon Petroleum Co (N:CPE). Bradshaw's firm has maintained its exposure to the Permian.
There is no sign that shale producers will restrain production. They redeployed rigs and personnel quickly since prices began strengthening in 2016 and made shale profitable again; rig counts have risen by 40 percent this year in the Permian, which accounts for about half of all U.S. onshore oil rigs. 
Hedge funds pulled back in the first quarter, according to the most recently available regulatory filings, and the stocks have continued to struggle as oil prices have come under renewed pressure.
The value of these funds' positions in the 10 Permian companies declined by 14 percent, to $2.66 billion in the first quarter, the most recent data available, from $3.08 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Hedge funds have continued to reduce their exposure to energy stocks in the second quarter, said Mark Connors, global head of portfolio and risk advisory at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), though he could not provide figures specific to shale companies.
MARGINS SQUEEZED
Fund managers interviewed expressed concern that volatile oil prices along with rising service costs and acreage prices are not reflected in overly optimistic projections for the Permian. 
The funds analyzed include Pointstate Capital LP, a $25 billion fund with 16 percent in energy shares, and Arosa Capital Management, a $2.1 billion fund with more than 90 percent of assets in energy stocks. Pointstate and Arosa declined comment.
""Margins will continue to be squeezed by a 15 to 20 percent increase in service costs in the Permian basin,"" said Michael Roomberg, portfolio manager of the Miller/Howard Drill Bit to Burner Tip Fund.
A Reuters analysis of 10 Permian producers, including several that almost exclusively operate in Texas, carry an average price-to-earnings ratio of about 35, compared with the overall energy sector's P/E ratio of about 17.8. 
""These are not great returns, but the problem is the market is rewarding them,"" said an analyst at one of the hedge funds on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorized to speak to the press.
Concerns about lofty land prices are driving some of the pullback by hedge funds, according to two fund analysts who could not speak on the record. Values for Permian acreage have increased 30 percent from two years ago, according to Detring Energy Advisors in Houston. 
The 10 Permian stocks analyzed have, on average, dropped 18 percent so year, compared with the broader S&P 500 energy sector's 13 percent fall. 
Permian production is expected to reach 2.47 million bpd by July, a 330,000 bpd increase from the beginning of the year, according to the U.S. Energy Department. 
Last month the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other key producers, including Russia, extended a historic output cut agreement to combat a global glut. 
However, production from non-OPEC countries, especially the U.S., continues to rise and weigh on prices. U.S. crude prices (CLc1) on Wednesday hit a six-month low just above $44 per barrel. 
Reuters analysis shows many shale companies reduced hedges in the first quarter, leaving them vulnerable to falling oil prices.
Still, fund managers say compared to other U.S. plays, the Permian still has the lowest break-even costs.

""In terms of the time horizon, the economics of the Permian are so good they’re going to keep on drilling,"" said Colin Davies, senior analyst at oil services company AB Bernstein.

The deal, which was reworked from a 2014 pact, averts large duties on U.S. sugar imports of Mexican sugar and addresses industry demand for protection from cheap, subsidized sugar from its foreign supplier.
""I am glad all parties have agreed that the new sugar agreement is fair and addresses the shortcomings of the original deal,"" Ross said in a statement.
""I am hopeful that we can successfully implement this new agreement with the support and cooperation of all stakeholders.""
The deal was agreed by the two governments on Wednesday and opened for public comments for seven days. Last week Ross and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo announced an agreement in principle, but said U.S. producers did not support the deal.
In its first comments since the deal was initialed, the American Sugar Alliance, whose members include sugar farmers and producers, said it supported the ""tightened"" agreement.

""For too long Mexico was allowed to sidestep our trade law, but those days are over,"" the alliance's spokesman Phillip Hayes said in a statement, adding that stakeholders looked forward to ensuring the pact was ""strongly enforced.""

On the manufacturing front, investors cheered a pair of upbeat economic reports on manufacturing activity in the states of New York and Philadelphia.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for July delivery fell 0.04% to $44.44 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent was last quoted at $46.91 a barrel.
Energy services company Baker Hughes said last Friday that U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 21st week in a row, the longest such streak on record. The U.S. rig count rose by 8 to 741, extending a year-long drilling recovery to the highest level since April 2015.
Overnight, crude futures settled lower on Thursday, amid growing investor skepticism in OPEC and its allies’ ability to reduce the glut in supply, as both OPEC and non-OPEC output remained elevated.
Crude futures extended losses for a second straight day, as investors continued to fret about growing US production after recent data showed an unexpected surge in gasoline inventories, pointing to a period of potential weak demand.
The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that gasoline inventories, one of the products that crude is refined into, unexpectedly rose by roughly 2m barrels against expectations for a decline of 457,000 barrels.
The bearish inventory report added to the current negative sentiment on oil, after the International Energy Agency said Wednesday that non-Opec output was set to increase over the near term.
""For total non-OPEC production, we expect production to grow by 700,000 bpd this year, but our first outlook for 2018 makes sobering reading for those producers looking to restrain supply,"" the IEA said in its monthly oil market report.
Rising non-Opec output has dented Opec and its allies’ global pact to reduce oversupply in the market, which has pressured prices for nearly three years.
Investors, however, have started to question whether Opec would continue to remain compliant with its pledge to cut production by 1.2m barrels per day until March 2018, after the oil-cartel revealed an unexpected increase in output in May.
OPEC said Tuesday, that output from the group rose by 336,000 barrels per day in May to 32.14m barrels per day.

1218,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2017 05:59PM ET</span>","Greece, Israel, Cyprus to speed up Mediterranean pipeline efforts","By Karolina Tagaris 
THESSALONIKI, Greece (Reuters) - Greece, Israel and Cyprus said on Thursday they would speed up plans for the development of a pipeline channeling gas to Europe from newly discovered east Mediterranean reserves.
European governments and Israel agreed in April to move forward with a Mediterranean pipeline project to carry natural gas from Israel to Europe, setting a target date of 2025 for completion.
Europe is keen to diversify its energy supplies, and Greece wants to promote itself as a hub for the transit of gas from the eastern Mediterranean to the continent.
""We agreed to expedite our joint actions concerning our agreement on the construction of a large project which will offer new prospects of economic cooperation in the eastern Mediterranean,"" Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told a news conference in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki.
He was flanked by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Nicos Anastasiades, the president of Cyprus.
The planned 2,000-km (1,250-mile) pipeline aims to link gas fields off the coasts of Israel and Cyprus with Greece and possibly Italy, at a cost of up to 6 billion euros ($6.7 billion). 
Netanyahu said the so-called East-Med Pipeline ""would be a revolution"".
""We've had preliminary studies of it and it seems promising and we're going to look further into it. It's something we're very excited about,"" he said.
Israel and to a lesser extent Cyprus are thought to be sitting on vast quantities of natural gas wealth given the significant finds reported in the past decade.
Israel has discovered more than 900 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas offshore, with some studies pointing to another 2,200 bcm waiting to be tapped. Along with the European market, it is exploring options to export to Turkey, Egypt and Jordan.
Cyprus' Aphrodite gas field holds an additional 128 bcm, and Cypriot waters are expected to hold more reserves.
Delivery options have included a pipeline linking the three countries, a pipeline to Turkey, and use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage in Egypt for shipment to Europe.
The three leaders said they would also pursue the development of an electricity cable linking their countries.
The EuroAsia Interconnector will carry electricity generated in Israel and sent via Cyprus, the Greek island of Crete and mainland Greece to European grids.
A Greek government official said Greece had proposed adding fiber optic cables estimated to boost the cost by 10 percent. It has secured funding of 1.5 billion euros from the European Union and viability studies have been completed.

""It's in a mature phase and we must now move on to the establishment of a consortium of investors and its implementation,"" the official said.

1219,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2017 04:22PM ET</span>","Oil slides, hits six-month low on rising global production","By Julia Simon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled more than half a percent lower on Thursday after hitting a six-month lows, as high global inventories fed fears that rising crude production in Nigeria, Libya and the United States will feed the global supply glut despite output cuts from OPEC and other producing countries .
The dollar (DXY) rose to its highest in more than two weeks, further weighing on oil by making it more expensive for buyers using other currencies. 
Saudi Arabia's oil exports are expected to fall below 7 million barrels per day this summer, according to industry sources familiar with the matter, and Russian oil exports were seen as broadly flat in the third quarter.
Still, Brent crude (LCOc1) fell to a session low of $46.70 a barrel, its weakest since May 5 and near six-month lows. It settled down 8 cents at $46.92 a barrel.
U.S. crude (CLc1) settled down 27 cents at $44.46, after touching a six-month low of $44.32 a barrel.
Oil has slumped despite output cuts of 1.8 million barrels a day by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers including Russia. On May 25, the countries said they agreed to extend the cuts nine months through next March. Yet crude prices have slid about 12 percent since that day as other countries have boosted output.
""Libya and Nigeria have brought more oil online and that’s really hindering"" OPEC's efforts, said Tariq Zahir, crude trader and managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York. 
Libya has seen major supply disruptions from protests and contract disputes, but this week the National Oil Company said production was resuming at key fields. 
U.S. production is up 10 percent over the past year to 9.33 million bpd, close to top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.  
On Wednesday, crude prices fell nearly 4 percent after U.S. gasoline inventories rose unexpectedly and the International Energy Agency said growth in oil supply next year is expected to outpace demand even as global consumption exceeds 100 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time. 
Summer boosts gasoline demand from U.S. drivers, yet gasoline inventories rose 2.1 million barrels last week, 9 percent over the five-year average for this time of year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). 
Both Brent and U.S. crude have given up all the gains since the initial OPEC agreement in late November.

""I definitely think we're in a new trading range,"" said Tyche's Zahir, ""Unless you get some supply disruption, I think it’s going to be lower for longer.""

Gold futures for August delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $18.80 or 1.47%, to $1,257.11 a troy ounce.
A raft of better than expected economic reports tapered fears the US economy was set for a slowdown in the second quarter, stoking expectations of an additional rate hike, after the Federal Reserve maintained its outlook of three total rate hikes on Wednesday.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims decreased by 5,000 to 237,000 in the week ended June 4, beating forecasts of a 3,000 decline.
On the manufacturing front, investors cheered a pair of upbeat economic reports on manufacturing activity in the states of New York and Philadelphia.
The Philly Fed said its index for current manufacturing activity in the region decreased to 27.6 in June from 38.8 in May. Analysts had expected a reading of 24.
Whereas, in New York, the Empire State manufacturing index climbed to 19.8, after falling to minus-1 in May.
Gold has fallen from yesterday’s high of $1284.20, as dollar has rebounded from its recent slump, following the Federal Reserve decision to hike rates for the second time this year, and maintain its view that a gradual increase in interest rates remained appropriate.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both U.S. rates and the dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for July delivery lost 27 cents to settle at $44.46 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent dipped 5 cents to trade at $46.95 a barrel.
Crude futures extended losses for a second straight day, as investors continued to fret about growing US production after recent data showed an unexpected surge in gasoline inventories, pointing to a period of potential weak demand.
The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that gasoline inventories, one of the products that crude is refined into, unexpectedly rose by roughly 2m barrels against expectations for a decline of 457,000 barrels.
The bearish inventory report added to the current negative sentiment on oil, after the International Energy Agency said Wednesday that non-Opec output was set to increase over the near term.
""For total non-Opec production, we expect production to grow by 700,000 bpd this year, but our first outlook for 2018 makes sobering reading for those producers looking to restrain supply,"" the IEA said in its monthly oil market report.
Rising non-Opec output has dented Opec and its allies’ global pact to reduce oversupply in the market, which has pressured prices for nearly three years.
Investors, however, have started to question whether Opec would continue to remain compliant with its pledge to cut production by 1.2m barrels per day until March 2018, after the oil-cartel revealed an unexpected increase in output in May.
Opec said Tuesday, that output from the group rose by 336,000 barrels per day in May to 32.14m barrels per day."

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 78 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 9, below forecasts for a build of 86 billion.
That compared with a gain of 106 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 69 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 87 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.709 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.6% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 8.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Prices of the fuel notched a third-straight decline on Wednesday after falling to its lowest since March 20 at $2.916, as forecasts for below-normal temperatures across most parts of the U.S. over the next two weeks weighed.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States and Mexico on Wednesday finalized terms of a sugar trade pact that seeks to resolve a years-long dispute between the governments before a North American trade deal is renegotiated. 
The sugar deal, which was reworked from a 2014 pact, averts imposition of large duties on U.S. imports of Mexican sugar while also addressing U.S. industry demands for protection from cheap, subsidized sugar from its top foreign supplier. 
The agreement was initialed by the two governments on Wednesday and opened for public comments for seven days, the U.S. Commerce Department said in a statement. 
The news comes a week after U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo announced an agreement in principle.
""Taken together, these amendments provide a significant improvement and are designed to address the concerns raised by the U.S. sugar industry with the operation of the suspension agreements,"" the department said in an emailed statement.
The agreement's key terms were little-changed from the deal last week, though they appeared to address U.S. producer concerns and called for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to first determine what kind of sugar the market needed for any additional imports, according to documents published online.
A spokesman for the American Sugar Alliance said in an emailed statement the group was reviewing the terms of the deal.
The agreement reduces the risk of retaliation from Mexico just as the two countries and Canada ready to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement this year.
The U.S. government was expected to move ahead with the deal even without the support of U.S. sugar producers.
The two countries have been embroiled in a sugar trade war since U.S. farmers and a cane refiner petitioned the U.S. government in 2014 to protect them from dumping of sugar from Mexico. The group said the previous agreement, which set prices and quotas for imports, had not removed harm to the U.S. industry.

Mexico said on Wednesday that Agricultural Minister Jose Calzada will travel to the United States next week to meet with U.S. and Canadian counterparts to begin preparatory talks ahead of the NAFTA negotiation, which is expected to begin in August.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil prices slumped nearly 4 percent to their lowest close in seven months on Wednesday, hit by an unexpected large build in gasoline inventories and an international outlook that suggests a big increase in supply in the coming year.
The news underscored the market's ongoing struggles with weak gasoline demand in the United States, the world's top consumer of the motor fuel, and rising production, especially from U.S. shale drillers. 
Despite nearly six months of OPEC-led efforts to reduce a global glut, oil prices have not stabilized at higher levels as many had anticipated when the group agreed with other producers to cut supply back.
""We need to see a sign that the OPEC cuts are having an impact on world oil supplies and it's clearly not, at least not yet,"" said Tamar Essner, lead energy analyst at Nasdaq.
After rising for three consecutive days, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) fell $1.73, or 3.7 percent, to settle at $44.73 per barrel, its lowest close since Nov. 14. WTI has dropped 18 percent since its closing high of $54.45 in late February.
Brent (LCOc1) also slumped, losing $1.72, or 3.5 percent, to settle at $47 a barrel. That was the lowest close for Brent since Nov. 29, the day before OPEC agreed to cut output.
Analysts said both benchmarks were dragged lower by a bigger than 4 percent drop in U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) after the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a 2.1 million-barrel increase in gasoline inventories last week.
At 242.4 million, U.S. gasoline inventories were 9 percent higher than the five-year average as demand was down 1.2 percent over the last four weeks when compared with a year ago, according to EIA. 
The bearish gasoline data overshadowed a 1.7 million-barrel drawdown in U.S. crude stocks, analysts said.
""Persistent weakness in gasoline demand has taken center stage among market participants as this could result in further builds in U.S. crude stockpiles,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters such as Russia have agreed to keep production almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) below the levels pumped at the end of last year and not to increase output until the end of the first quarter of 2018.
But adherence to the cuts is under scrutiny. The producer group said this week its output rose by 336,000 bpd in May to 32.14 million bpd. Nigeria and Libya are responsible for much of that rise, and they are exempt from cuts.
Producers outside the OPEC deal are increasing output, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. The West's energy watchdog expects growth in supply of 1.5 million bpd in 2018, driven by non-OPEC producers like Brazil, Canada and the United States; that level would exceed expected demand growth of 1.4 million bpd.

""Our first outlook for 2018 makes sobering reading for those producers looking to restrain supply,"" the IEA said in its monthly oil market report.

LONDON (Reuters) - An unregulated benchmark used to set the price of plastics in Europe has veered above the true cost in recent years, because of secret rebates chemical companies give each other that disguise the price of the main precursor, four sources familiar with the industry say.
Ethylene, a flammable gas, is the main feedstock used to synthesize the most commonly used plastics, found in the vast majority of all manufactured goods. It is produced in refineries from natural gas or crude oil, as one of the main products of the $400 billion global petrochemicals industry.
When manufacturers buy and sell plastic, a benchmark of the ethylene price is often written into their purchase contracts, to reflect the raw material cost.
But the European index is unregulated and, the sources said, has overstated the actual price for the past four years because it does not take into account the now common practice of firms negotiating rebates.
The sources include one person at a petrochemical company and three people who research the industry.
The actual price companies charge each other for the chemical is secret, and companies tend to offer big clients discounts from the benchmark to reflect economies of scale, local market conditions, or other factors. But those discounts have grown, making the benchmark a less accurate reflection of the real costs.
Companies do not have to pass the rebates on to their customers further down the supply chain, who are contractually obliged to pay prices based on the higher benchmark.
Reuters was unable to assess the degree to which the practice has hurt manufacturers of goods made from plastics. More than 10 companies that buy or sell ethylene, contacted by Reuters, declined to discuss their pricing, including any rebates they offer or receive.
Most of the sources that spoke to Reuters said they did not believe rebates had made the market unfair. But they say the lack of transparency, and the divergence between the published benchmark and the true price, could create the potential for suppliers to overcharge customers who may be unaware of the practice.
""There's an understanding that this is not a perfect process,"" said Matthew Thoelke, senior director of olefins and derivatives at analysis firm IHS.
The sources said the petrochemical companies that participate in setting the ethylene contract price while giving or receiving rebates include Europe's biggest, such as BASF, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), Total and LyondellBasell. BASF, Shell and Total declined to comment on their pricing. LyondellBasell did not respond to Reuters request for comment.
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD
The benchmark for the price of ethylene used in nearly all European contracts is produced by the Independent Chemical Information Service, or ICIS, which has published its ""ethylene contract price"" since 1980.
ICIS is now a unit of Reed Business Information. Thomson Reuters, parent company of Reuters, competes with Reed as a supplier of benchmark prices for other commodities but does not publish a rival index price for ethylene.
ICIS senior editor Nel Weddle said the benchmark, published after confirming agreements with at least four companies who buy and sell ethylene, allows everyone to start on a ""level playing field"" with knowledge of prices.
However, the figures it uses to compile the index do not include rebates off the benchmark price. ICIS said it is not responsible for collecting information about such rebates, which it called ""a common part of any supply or purchase contract"".
Although ICIS is the most widely used benchmark in Europe, it is not the only one. A competitor, Argus, publishes a rival index, which also does not take rebates into account. It declined to comment.
Another competitor, Platts, has launched a new rival index which it says will better reflect the true market price by taking into account the rebates.
The sources familiar with the practice said refineries began offering substantial rebates in 2013 to clear their stocks during a period of oversupply of ethylene. But instead of being a temporary measure to deal with local market conditions, the rebates grew after oil and gas prices tumbled in 2014, and have continued to widen since.
The contract price of ethylene has hovered around 850-1,050 euros per tonne over the past year, down from a range of 1,200-1,300 euros before oil and gas prices fell in 2014. Rebates now run at more than 100 euros a tonne, the sources said.
One of the sources, at a major research consultancy, said his firm's staff use their own contacts at chemical companies to get a sense of the secret rebates. The rebates are now a key to understanding the profitability of businesses in the sector, which is therefore harder to forecast solely from public data.
Weddle of ICIS said the company was not aware of complaints from users of its benchmark about its omission of the rebates.
However, last year ICIS conducted a review of its methodology and posted feedback online from some users of the index. One of three respondents whose views ICIS posted wrote that the published prices should begin to reflect rebates.
""Otherwise, the reported contract prices do not reflect the real market situation and especially smaller suppliers and consumers are left in the dark,"" the respondent wrote. ICIS confirmed that the response was genuine but declined to identify who had written it.
Some in the industry who spoke to Reuters sought to play down the significance of the disparity between the index and the price after rebates, saying the market is competitive enough to prevent customers who rely on the benchmark being overcharged.
While Europe's benchmarks have their problems, ""the situation in general is fair"", said Jose Manuel Martinez, the chief executive of the Spanish oil company Cepsa's petrochemicals business.
NO REGULATION
Unlike benchmarks for crude oil or the major refined fuel products like diesel and gasoline, the ICIS benchmark for ethylene is not formally scrutinized by regulators, as ethylene contracts are not typically traded on securities exchanges.
In the marketing materials for the rival Platts benchmark intended to address the problem by adjusting for rebates, Platts includes a graph comparing the contract price to what it says is its own assessment of the true price, based on the cost of raw materials, economic conditions and other fundamentals.
The graph shows the ICIS contract price consistently higher than Platts' estimate from 2013 on, with the gap growing wider last year, when Platts estimates the true cost of ethylene bottomed out as low as 650 euros a tonne.
Platts says the early indications from its new index have shown large buyers typically receiving rebates of 14-18 percent.
The issue appears mostly confined to Europe, rather than the United States or Asia, which have more liquid markets with higher volumes of spot trade of ethylene, making prices relatively transparent.

""As long as a market is liquid, the players know how to behave,"" said Cepsa's Martinez.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude July contract was at $45.76 a barrel by 10:35AM ET (1435GMT), down 70 cents, or around 1.5%. Prices were at around $46.30 prior to the release of the inventory data.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for August delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London shed 70 cents to $48.02 a barrel.
Oil prices tallied a gain for a third-straight session Tuesday.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 1.7 million barrels in the week ended June 9.
Market analysts' expected a crude-stock decline of around 2.8 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply-gain of about 2.7 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 1.2 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 511.5 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be at the upper half of the average range for this time of year.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 2.1 million barrels, disappointing expectations for a decline of 457,000 barrels.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a rise of 328,000 barrels.
Oil prices have been under pressure in recent weeks as concern over rising U.S. shale output offset production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
The International Energy Agency said Wednesday that the world’s oil oversupply will remain in place through 2017, as efforts led by OPEC to restrain petroleum production have hit a wall in the U.S.
The IEA also said the global levels of stored oil, viewed as a proxy for the global oversupply, grew by 18.6 million barrels in April in industrialized nations.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for July inched down 0.9 cents, or about 0.7%, to $1.475 a gallon, while July heating oil dipped 0.4 cents to $1.443 a gallon.

U.S. natural gas for July delivery was at $2.939 per million British thermal units by 9:35AM ET (1335GMT), down 2.8 cents, or around 1%. It fell to its lowest since March 20 at $2.916 earlier.
Prices of the fuel notched a second-straight decline on Tuesday.
Updated weather forecasting models showed that cooling will fan out across the northern and east central U.S. this weekend into early next week.
Looking further out, the east-central U.S., including the Northeast will be near to slightly cooler than normal from June 20-27, as weather systems track through.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.631 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 11.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 9.0% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 79 and 89 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 9.
That compares with a gain of 106 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 69 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 87 billion cubic feet.

And while investment is finally picking up after being a drag on growth for many quarters, it has yet to offset the flagging consumer.” Said Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for July delivery rose 38 cents to settle at $46.46 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 81 cents to trade at $48.67 a barrel.
Crude futures started the day on the front foot, as Saudi Arabia pledged to reduce exports to customers in July, in an effort to help curb the glut in supply.
Sentiment, turned negative, however, later during the session, following Opec’s monthly report, showing that output from the group rose by 336,000 barrels a day in May to 32.14m barrels per day (bdp).
An uptick in production from both Nigeria and Libya, was singled out as the reason the market was rebalancing at a “slower pace”, as both nations are exempt from supply cuts.
Investor disappointment from the Opec report eased later during the session, as investor focus shifted to weekly inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) expected to show that crude stockpiles fell by more than 2m barrels for the week ended June 2.
Despite expectations of a drop in U.S. crude stockpiles, fears of rising U.S. shale production are expected to continue to weigh on Opec and its allies’ efforts to rebalance supply and demand in the market.
The EIA released its monthly report on drilling activity Monday, showing that oil production from seven major U.S. shale plays is projected to rise by 127,000 barrels a day to 5.475 million barrels a day in July from June."
1249,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2017 11:40AM ET</span>","Exclusive: PDVSA leaves Bahamas oil terminal, expands in St Eustatius - sources","By Marianna Parraga
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA is moving millions of barrels of oil from a Bahamas storage facility after terminating a contract with the owner, U.S. Buckeye Partners LP, according to internal data and sources close to the decision.
Buckeye and PDVSA had tried to resolve payment delays and other frequent problems that stalled some shipments, the sources said. But PDVSA decided to shift its oil to the Statia terminal, operated by U.S. NuStar Energy LP, in the neighboring island of St. Eustatius.
The termination is another sign of how PDVSA's deteriorating finances have strained its relationship with business partners. The state-owned company has struggled to maintain its tanker fleet on the water and to keep operations running to maximize income for the country's most important export: oil.
PDVSA's contract with Buckeye had included storage for up to 6 million barrels of crude and fuel oil. The contract was due to expire in December, but PDVSA decided to end the lease in advance and seek some $10 million in overpayments, according to a source from the Venezuelan company.
Buckeye and PDVSA did not respond to requests for comment. NuStar said it would not discuss customer activities at its terminals.
Since 2016 Buckeye had intermittently suspended PDVSA from moving its stored oil out of the terminal - the Caribbean's largest - over monthly payment delays, according to sources from the companies and Thomson Reuters Trade Flows data.
In late August, PDVSA renewed a 2014 contract with NuStar to secure its presence in Statia for three more years starting in March. The state-run company is now paying some $2.3 million per month to lease 5 million barrels of crude storage excluding extra charges, according to a document seen by Reuters.
PDVSA's supply and trade department last year also approved an option to lease a single buoy mooring in St. Eustatius and extra storage capacity for up to 4.3 million barrels of refined products.
""We are now consolidating blending and storage operations in St. Eustatius,"" the PDVSA source said.
NuStar's Statia terminal has capacity to store up to 13.03 million barrels of crude and products. It also has six mooring locations, blending and transshipment facilities.
In 2011, PDVSA announced a plan to increase storage capacity nearly fourfold in three years to handle new production of blends made from the Orinoco Belt's crudes. Since then, it has rented facilities in the Caribbean, but payment problems have recently affected its operations in several islands.
PDVSA operates the 335,000-barrel-per-day Isla refinery in Curacao and an adjacent terminal. It also owns the BOPEC storage terminal in Bonaire, leases the Aruba refinery and its terminal through its subsidiary Citgo, and has stakes in refineries in the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Cuba.
Buckeye's Bahamas terminal was owned by PDVSA until 2008, when it was sold to investment firm First Reserve Corp. In 2010, Buckeye bought 80 percent of the facility, which can store up to 26.2 million barrels of oil.
Buckeye also owns terminals in St. Lucia and Puerto Rico.

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2017 09:39AM ET</span>","OPEC sees oil market rebalancing at slower pace, says output rises","By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC said on Tuesday a long-awaited rebalancing of the oil market was under way at a ""slower pace"" and reported that its own output in May jumped due to gains in nations exempt from a pact to reduce supply.
In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said its output rose by 336,000 barrels per day (bpd) in May to 32.14 million bpd led by a rebound in Nigeria and Libya, which were exempted from supply cuts because unrest had curbed their output.
The boost means OPEC is pumping more than its forecast of average global demand for its crude this year, hindering efforts to reduce a glut. But Libyan and Nigerian output remains volatile, meaning the gain may not last.
OPEC said oil inventories in industrialized countries dropped in April and would fall further in the rest of the year, but a recovery in U.S. production was slowing efforts to get rid of excess supply.
""The rebalancing of the market is under way, but at a slower pace, given the changes in fundamentals since December, especially the shift in U.S. supply from an expected contraction to positive growth,"" OPEC said in the report.
Oil prices gave up gains on Tuesday after the release of the report to trade toward $48 a barrel (LCOc1), below the $60 level that top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia would like to see and less than half the level of mid-2014.
Under the deal to support the market, OPEC is curbing output by about 1.2 million bpd while Russia and other non-OPEC producers are cutting half as much. With the glut slow to shift, producers agreed in May to prolong the accord until March 2018.
In the report, OPEC pointed to continued high compliance by its members with the supply deal and said oil stocks in industrialized nations fell in April - although they are still 251 million barrels above the five-year average.
Supply from 11 OPEC members with production targets under the accord - all except Libya and Nigeria - averaged 29.729 million bpd last month, according to figures from secondary sources that OPEC uses to monitor output. 
That means OPEC has again complied more than 100 percent with the plan, according to a Reuters calculation. OPEC did not publish a compliance number.
SAUDI REPORTS LOWER OUTPUT
Saudi Arabia, which has voluntarily cut production below its OPEC target, told OPEC it lowered output further by about 66,000 bpd in May to 9.88 million bpd.
OPEC cut its estimate of oil supply growth from producers outside the group this year to 840,000 bpd from 950,000 bpd, following the decision to extend the curbs.
It even trimmed its forecast for growth in the United States, where shale producers have gained impetus from the higher prices brought about by the OPEC-led cut. 
U.S. output is still expected to rise by 800,000 bpd in 2017, contributing almost all the non-OPEC gain.
Due to the lower supply now expected from all outside producers, OPEC raised the forecast demand for its crude this year by 100,000 bpd to 32.02 million bpd - below its May output.
Should the recovery in Nigeria and Libya prove sustainable and others not cut more, the market could remain in surplus. This could lead to calls for Nigeria and Libya's output to be capped - a step OPEC says is too early for now.

The OPEC production figures are for 13 members and do not yet include Equatorial Guinea, which joined last month.

U.S. natural gas for July delivery was at $3.030 per million British thermal units by 9:20AM ET (1320GMT), up 0.6 cents, or around 0.2%.
Prices of the fuel fell for the first time in three sessions on Monday.
Warm to hot conditions will dominate the eastern half of the country this week, as strong high pressure continues to spread.
Over the West, an unseasonably cold weather systems continues to bring heavy showers, including high elevation snowfall.
Late in the week, brief cooling will spill across the Northwest and Northeast, while the rest of the country remains very warm to hot.
Looking further out, the east-central U.S., including the Northeast will be near to slightly cooler than normal from June 20-27, as weather systems track through.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.631 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 11.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 9.0% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 79 and 89 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 9.
That compares with a gain of 106 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 69 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 87 billion cubic feet.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices edged down on Tuesday after OPEC reported an increase in its production for May despite a supply cut agreement and said the oil market was rebalancing more slowly than expected.
Benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) was 17 cents lower at $48.12 per barrel by 1236 GMT, reversing gains made earlier in the session when it edged up to $48.67. U.S. light crude (CLc1) was at $45.86 per barrel, down 22 cents.
Prices initially nudged higher after the world's top exporter Saudi Arabia outlined cuts to customers in July that included a reduction of 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) to Asia.
Riyadh is leading an effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers to cut output by almost 1.8 million bpd until March in a bid to curb oversupply and prop up prices.
But OPEC's monthly report showed output from the group rose by 336,000 bpd in May to 32.14 million bpd, led by a recovery in Nigeria and Libya which are exempt from supply cuts. The report said the market was rebalancing at a ""slower pace"".
""Crude oil is still struggling to rebound,"" said Olivier Jakob, strategist at Petromatrix, adding that OPEC's gradual approach to rebalancing was giving U.S. producers time to drill new wells that were undermining the impact of the group's cuts.
He said Saudi cuts had to continue beyond the northern hemisphere's summer months to have a significant impact
""They're making a lot of headlines about reducing supplies but that's also right in their seasonal pattern of lowering exports in July, August because of domestic needs,"" he said. 
Trade data show OPEC shipments to customers averaged around 26 million bpd in the last six months of 2016 and are set to average around 25.3 million bpd in the first half of this year.
Meanwhile, U.S. drilling activity has continued apace , driving up U.S. output  by more than 10 percent since mid-2016 to above 9.3 million bpd.
U.S. crude inventories remain stubbornly high. Traders will be watching figures on last week's U.S. stockpiles to be released later on Tuesday by industry group the American Petroleum Institute.
Traders said market intelligence firm Genscape had forecast a draw down of more than 1.8 million barrels at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for U.S. crude futures.

""Where oil prices go will be determined by the flow of inventory data,"" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at Australian futures brokerage AxiTrader.

1256,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2017 07:39AM ET</span>",U.S. shale firms more exposed to falling oil prices as hedges expire,"By Catherine Ngai and Swetha Gopinath
(Reuters) - Cash-strapped U.S. shale firms scaled back their hedging programs in the first quarter, leaving them more vulnerable to tumbling spot market prices just after OPEC reached a landmark deal to curb global supply.
The pullback in hedging was driven by rising service costs and expectations that prices would continue to rally after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries extended those cuts in May, analysts said.
However, rising U.S. production has stymied OPEC's efforts to rebalance markets. Crude oil futures (LCOc1) have lost 15 percent of their value since February, raising the risk that unhedged companies are more exposed to market weakness. 
The market peaked at $55 a barrel in January as cuts got under way, but has struggled since, and closed Monday at $48.29 a barrel [O/R], barely changed from the end of November, when OPEC agreed with nonmembers to cut 1.8 million barrels a day in supply.
For oil traders, hedging data serves as a leading indicator of future supplies. With so little hedged, dealers say producers are now looking to hedge at the next chance possible, a move that will pressure prices in coming months.
Producers hedge by buying a variety of financial options to secure a minimum price for crude and safeguard future production. 
According to a Reuters analysis of hedging disclosures by the 30 largest U.S. shale firms, most stayed on the sidelines in the first three months of 2017, a stark contrast from a year ago when firms rushed to lock in prices, even though oil was trading $15 a barrel lower. 
In total, 18 companies reduced outstanding oil options, swaps or other derivatives positions by a total of 49 million barrels from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, the data shows. Another 10 companies increased their hedging positions by 91 million barrels; two others did not hedge at all.
(GRAPHIC: http://tmsnrt.rs/2rolpok) 
Compared with a year ago, the group is more exposed to falling oil prices, with one-fifth fewer barrels hedged, or the equivalent of 28 million barrels, and three times more barrels rolling off, or the equivalent of 38 million barrels. 
    ""A lot of producers held back on locking in hedges in the first quarter because OPEC cut their historic deal and they thought there would be a linear shift higher in prices. But then, we saw several pullbacks,"" said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.
    Prices are too low now for producers to lock in large volumes of future production, Tran said. In addition, pent-up demand for hedging will pressure any moves higher in the oil market, he said.
UNDERHEDGED ANXIETIES
Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that producers are hedged at around 12 percent of their 2018 output and 40 percent for their current 2017 output.
The increases were driven by  Hess Corp  (N:HES) and  Apache Corp  (N:APA), which had previously remained unhedged. They added a combined 54 million barrels.
Analysts expect U.S. oil drilling to taper off as old hedge positions wind down, leaving smaller producers exposed to market prices at below break-even levels. 
""I think companies are a little bit nervous that they are underhedged right now and they will try to take advantage of any hedging opportunity they get at about $50 per barrel,"" said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group.
SOME NEW PLAYERS
In total, the 30 companies held hedged positions equivalent to about 483 million barrels at the end of March, compared with 441 million at the end of 2016. Excluding Hess and Apache, the two highest hedgers, the group held only 428 million barrels. 
Some large players refrained from building a larger buffer. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (N:APC) - which held 33.2 million barrels hedged for 2017 in the fourth quarter - had 8 million barrels roll off through the first quarter. EOG Resources (N:EOG) had nearly 6 million barrels unwind after terminating its hedges. 
Analysts said much of the hesitation has to do with rising service costs. Firms that supply rigs and crews are clamoring to take back discounts extended during the height of the slump early last year, in some cases boosting prices by 10 to 15 percent.
""Producers are working in an environment where they see service cost increases on the horizon. They see their expenses going up, but their revenues are not going up correspondingly, which is why they do not want to hedge and compress their margins,"" said Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors LLC.

A duo of oil reports expected from OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively will set the tone. For the OPEC report, the comparison to May will be key when it pointed to continued high compliance by its members with the supply deal and said oil stocks in industrialised nations fell in March - although they are still 276 million barrels above the five-year average. Supply from the 11 OPEC members with production targets under the accord - all except Libya and Nigeria - fell to 29.674 million bpd last month, according to figures from secondary sources that OPEC uses to monitor output.
That means OPEC has complied 111% with the plan, according to analyst estimates, up from an estimate in March of 104%. OPEC did not publish a compliance number.
The reports will include an update on the state of global crude stockpiles, providing investors with the opportunity to establish whether OPEC and its allies' efforts to drain the glut in supply is starting to take shape.
OPEC and non-OPEC allies last month agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March last week, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year.
Overnight, crude futures settled higher on Monday, after Saudi Arabia and Russia attempted to quell investor fears concerning the glut in supply, insisting that declines in inventories will accelerate over the near term.
Sentiment on oil prices turned positive, after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said inventories are declining and reductions will accelerate in the next three to four months.
Crude futures, however, pared gains in the mid-afternoon U.S. session, after the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) released its monthly report on drilling activity.
The EIA revealed that oil production from seven major U.S. shale plays is projected to rise by 127,000 barrels a day to 5.475 million barrels a day in July from June.
Rising shale output has been one the catalysts contributing to the recent slump in oil prices as investors fear that a ramp up in U.S. production could derail the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies' efforts to restore balance in crude markets.

UBS last week cut its 2017 price forecast by more than 6% for WTI oil to $53 a barrel.

In comments to the U.S. Trade Representative ahead of NAFTA negotiations in August, the head of the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), Thomas Gibson, urged updates to NAFTA's rules of origin - how much of a product is made in North American - new measures to curb steel dumped on the market by non-NAFTA countries, and steps to improve customs procedures.
""The American steel industry views NAFTA as a successful agreement but after 23 years, one that can also be modernized and strengthened,"" Gibson said in a letter to Edward Gresser, chairman of USTR's Trade Policy Staff Committee.
The U.S. Trade Representative office asked businesses and industry groups to submit recommendations this week ahead of the NAFTA talks. AISI members include ArcelorMittal USA,  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE), U.S. Steel and AK Steel Holding Corp (N:AKS).
Gibson also said ""enforceable currency disciplines"" should be added to the new NAFTA to avoid trade-distorting currency misalignments or competitive currency depreciation, a complaint often heard by U.S. manufacturers against such countries as China and Japan.
He said while Mexico and Canada did not manipulate their currencies, a currency clause would be a useful precedent for other trade agreements where it might be more relevant.
NAFTA should also help level the playing field for North American steel producers, which are disadvantaged by enterprises that are owned or financed by governments, Gibson added.
After calling NAFTA ""the worst trade deal"" ever during the presidential election campaign, U.S. President Donald Trump has since softened his stance toward the agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Instead of dismantling NAFTA, most U.S. industries and businesses have called for it to be updated and modernized. Like U.S. automakers, the U.S. steel industry has expressed concerns that changes could interfere with existing supply networks.
In other comments sent to USTR ahead of the NAFTA talks, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called on the Trump administration to ensure that the negotiations ""be conducted in a manner that does not put millions of American jobs at risk."" 
""The chamber supports this effort to modernize the NAFTA, taking into account technological, economic, and other changes in the U.S., North American, and global economies in recent years,"" the chamber's senior vice president for international policy, John Murphy, said.

Meanwhile, the National Foreign Trade Council said the talks should create more open markets and better rules, not new restrictions.

Gold is sensitive to moves higher in U.S. interest rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

U.S. natural gas for July delivery was at $3.078 per million British thermal units by 9:15AM ET (1315GMT), up 4.0 cents, or around 1.3%.
Prices of the fuel rose on Friday to notch a second-straight gain and log an increase of 1.3% for the week.
Warm to hot conditions will dominate the eastern half of the U.S. through June 17, as strong high pressure continues to spread.
Over the West, an unseasonably cold weather systems will bring heavy showers, including high elevation snowfall.
Late in the week, modest cooling will spill across the Northwest and Northeast, while the rest of the country remains very warm to hot.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.631 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 11.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 9.0% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 79 and 89 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 9.
That compares with a gain of 106 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 69 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 87 billion cubic feet.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday as futures traders bet the market may have bottomed after recent falls, even as physical markets remain bloated, especially from a relentless rise in U.S. drilling.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were at $48.29 per barrel at 0651 GMT, up 14 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $45.95 per barrel, up 12 cents, or 0.3 percent.
Traders said that the price rises came on the back of speculative traders upping their investment into crude futures, by taking on large volumes of long positions.
The rise in long positions comes after Brent and WTI crude fell by around 10 percent below their openings of May 25, when an OPEC-led policy to cut output was extended to cover the first quarter of 2018.
""Oil bulls have reset for a technical bounce,"" said Stephen Schork, author of the Schork Report.
While financial traders have confidence in rising prices, the physical market remains bloated, especially due to a rise in U.S. drilling for new oil production.
U.S. drillers added eight oil rigs in the week to June 9 , bringing the total count up to 741, the most since April 2015, energy services firm  Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI) said on Friday.
This drive to find new oil has pushed up U.S. output by over 10 percent since mid-2016, to 9.3 million bpd, a figure the U.S. Energy Information Administration says will likely rise above 10 million bpd by next year, challenging top exporter Saudi Arabia.
Soaring U.S. output undermines an effort led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut almost 1.8 million bpd of production until the first quarter of 2018 in order to prop up prices.
Despite this, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Sunday there was no need to review the agreement on reducing oil output as it was too early to make any decisions.
Russia, not a member of OPEC, is the world's biggest oil producer but it is participating in the production cuts.
Saudi energy minister Khalid Al-Falih made similar statements over the weekend.
On the demand side,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said on Monday that consumption by U.S. oil refineries was strong, but that there was a risk they were overproducing.

""Refinery utilization (at 94.1 percent)... remains seasonally high and above the historical range... (but) we see risk of an oversupplied domestic product market with worries that domestic demand... won't be able to absorb it,"" the bank said.

1284,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2017 01:20PM ET</span>",Wilbur Ross seen imposing Mexico sugar deal over industry objections,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is likely to impose a new sugar trade deal with Mexico even if final revisions to it fail to win support from the U.S. industry, trade lawyers and experts say.
After announcing a deal this week that would dramatically cut the amount of refined sugar that Mexico ships to the United States, officials from the two countries are working with their industries on final language that would govern its operation.
At issue is a new right of first refusal granted to Mexico to supply all U.S. sugar needs not met by domestic suppliers or other foreign quota holders.
A coalition of American sugar cane and beet farmers and a major refiner want a more explicit guarantee that the U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Mexican producers, will dictate what type of sugar fills that gap. They are worried that a flood of refined sugar will pour in, rather than the raw sugar needed to keep U.S. mills running.
The final sticking point stands in the way of resolving a years-long dispute over Mexican access to the highly regulated U.S. sugar market, which is protected by a complex web of subsidies and rationed quotas for foreign producers.
The sugar industry is known for its sway in Washington. But its point of view on Mexican imports is not shared by sugar users such as confectioners and soda makers. 
The Trump administration wants to clear away the sugar dispute and a lumber trade row with Canada before starting full-scale negotiations to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement.
An industry rarely objects to a government-negotiated settlement of its anti-dumping case, and U.S. sugar producers could do little to stop the Commerce Department from implementing a final deal after a two-week comment period, said Seattle-based trade lawyer William Perry, who previously worked at Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission.
While the industry could ask the International Trade Commission to overturn the settlement that suspends anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duty orders issued in 2014, chances for success look slim. The panel in 2015 rejected a challenge by two sugar refiners to the previous U.S.-Mexico pact.
""Petitioners are never entirely happy with suspension agreements like this,"" Perry said. ""They would rather have anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders with rates high enough to shut out imports.""
A Commerce spokesman said that Ross hoped the U.S. sugar industry would ultimately endorse the final agreement.
Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the administration was probably willing to compromise on some industry-specific concerns to help reach its larger NAFTA goals of reducing U.S. trade deficits.
The U.S. sugar industry must probably present evidence of new Mexican dumping before going back to Commerce for more changes to the deal, said Daniel  Pearson  (LON:PSON), a senior fellow of the libertarian Cato Institute and former International Trade Commission chairman.
""They would do well to take this agreement and run with it and see how it works,"" Pearson said, noting that it raises prices and keeps U.S. refiners well-supplied with raw sugar.
Mexico made major concessions to maintain its access to the lucrative U.S. market, agreeing to ship no less than 70 percent of its quota volume as raw sugar to U.S. refineries. It gave ground on nearly all of the U.S. producers' demands. 
American Sugar Alliance spokesman Phillip Hayes said the final hurdle should be easy to address by making clear that the USDA, not Mexico, can dictate the type and purity level of any additional imports.

But Juan Cortina, head of Mexico's main sugar trade group, said there was no problem with the language because any additional needs would filled with raw sugar, as Mexican producers would have to keep higher inventories of that grade.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2017 12:00PM ET</span>","After oil drop, some OPEC delegates question if supply cut deal enough","By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - Two weeks after an OPEC-led deal to extend oil output cuts until March, some OPEC delegates are questioning whether the agreement will be enough to reduce a glut in supplies and lift prices.
Prices have fallen more than 10 percent to below $50 a barrel since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies agreed on May 25 to prolong a deal to cut about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of March. The deal was initially due to run during the first half of 2017.
Even a political dispute between Gulf states, the source for most of OPEC's crude, has failed to drive prices higher.
Instead, eyes are trained on Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC states that were excluded from the regime of cuts to help them recover from years of unrest that had hurt production. Both now report rising output.
This is adding to concerns among some in OPEC about the effectiveness of the accord to reduce output, whose impact is already being eroded by surging U.S. shale production.
One OPEC delegate told Reuters that a deal to curb production ""without freezing Libya and Nigeria is useless.""
Nigeria's exports are expected to reach a 15-month high in June of about 1.75 million bpd. Libyan output has hit its highest since October 2014, rising above 800,000 bpd.
At the May meeting, OPEC discussed whether to assign output caps to Nigeria and Libya but agreed not to. The group also considered a larger production cut, an idea that it could revive in future, delegates have told Reuters.
A second OPEC delegate also said on Friday that it was not clear that the level of existing cuts was enough.
""It's difficult to say. We hope so,"" the delegate said. ""We need to wait another month to see how it develops. There are a lot of factors involved.""
A third delegate said oil-market fundamentals were improving, indicating the current drop in prices was not driven by supply and demand but rather by speculators.
However, two other delegates said the oil price drop was temporary and the current supply cut pact was enough.
""It is not a cause for alarm - it is normal,"" one of them said of the price fall, adding that he believed the market would still rebalance in the second half of the year.

Oil prices have recovered from below $30 a barrel in 2016, helped by the pact. But with the price hovering below $50 now, it is half its level of mid-2014 and less than the $60 top exporter Saudi Arabia has said it would like to see.

1286,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2017 10:52AM ET</span>","Iran raises oil exports to West, almost on par with Asia","By Nidhi Verma
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Iran's oil exports to the West surged in May to their highest level since the lifting of sanctions in early 2016 and almost caught up with volumes exported to Asia, a source familiar with Iranian oil exports said.
Iran, which used to be OPEC's second biggest oil exporter, has been raising output since 2016 to recoup market share lost to regional rivals including Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
While many Asian nations continued to purchase oil from Iran during sanctions, Western nations halted imports, halving Iran's overall exports to as little as one million barrels per day (bpd).
Last month, Iran exported about 1.1 million bpd to Europe including Turkey, almost reaching pre-sanction levels and only slightly below the 1.2 million bpd supplied to Asia, the source told Reuters.
Iran's exports to Asia last month were the lowest since February 2016, Reuters' calculations showed.
Oil exports to Asia fell as South Korea and Japan stepped up oil condensate purchases and bought less oil, said the source, who asked not to be identified as the information is confidential.
""Iran's condensate parked in floating storage has almost been exhausted because of higher purchases by Japan and Korea,"" the source said.
Exports to Asia were also hit by India's decision to cut annual purchases from Iran by a fifth for the fiscal year to March 2018.
After the lifting of sanctions, Tehran added new clients such as Litasco and Lotos and won back customers such as  Total  (PA:TOTF),  ENI  (MI:ENI), Tupras (L:RDSa), Repsol (MC:REP), Cepsa (GQ:CPF) and Hellenic Petroleum (AT:HEPr).
OPEC member Iran was allowed a small production increase under a December deal to limit output.
Iran's overall May oil production totaled 3.9 million bpd, the source said. 
Iran is currently producing about 200,000 bpd of West Karoun grade, which the nation blends with other Iranian heavy grades for export, he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Friday after steep falls earlier in the week under pressure from widespread evidence of a fuel glut despite efforts led by OPEC to tighten the market.
Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was up 5 cents at $47.91 a barrel by 1315 GMT (9:15 a.m. ET), but still 12 percent below its opening level on May 25, when an OPEC promise to restrict production was extended into 2018. U.S. crude (CLc1) was 5 cents higher at $45.69.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other big producers have agreed to pump almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) less than they supplied at the end of last year, and hold output there until the first quarter of 2018.
But world markets are still awash with oil.
""The challenge OPEC is facing is bigger than anyone thought a few weeks ago,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
U.S. data this week showed a surprise 3.3-million-barrel build in commercial crude oil stocks to 513.2 million. [EIA/S] 
Inventories of refined products were also up, despite the start of the peak-demand summer season.
""Crude oil prices are testing lows last seen in (the fourth quarter of) 2016,"" analysts at U.S. bank Jefferies wrote, pointing to the United States as the main pressure on prices.
U.S. refined oil product inventories are now back above 2016 levels and well above their five-year range, reflecting an unexpected slowdown in U.S. demand for gasoline and distillate fuels, Jefferies said.
Asian markets are also oversupplied, with traders putting excess crude into floating storage, an indicator of a glut.
The Brent forward curve shows a clear ""contango"" shape, with oil for use now at deep discounts to future prices. This typically indicates a well-supplied market.
Brent for January 2018 is worth around $1.50 a barrel more than Brent for August 2017 <0#LCO:>, making it profitable for some traders to put oil into tankers and wait for a later sale.
Thomson Reuters Eikon shipping figures show at least 25 supertankers sitting in the Strait of Malacca and the Singapore Strait, holding unsold fuel.
Those are similar amounts to May and April, indicating that even in Asia, with its strong demand growth, traders are struggling to clear inventories.

And more production is coming. Libya's 270,000-bpd Sharara oilfield has reopened after a workers' protest and should return to normal production within three days, the National Oil Corp said on Friday.

1289,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2017 08:41AM ET</span>",Oil comeback for cut-exempt producers threatens to swamp OPEC,"By Ahmad Ghaddar and Libby George
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC's battle against an oil glut is under threat as unsold crude from members Nigeria and Libya, which are exempt from a global production-cutting deal, is swamping the Atlantic Basin. 
Nigeria has more than 60 million barrels of unsold crude, traders of its oil said, surpassing the level reached when global oversupply peaked two years ago. More export plans are a week away, likely bringing more than 50 million extra barrels. 
Libya, meanwhile, is pouring nearly triple the amount of crude into global markets compared with last year.
Few expected the two nations' output to rebound so quickly, and it could scupper OPEC's plans to lift oil prices out of a nearly three-year-long slump. 
The 14-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries two weeks ago extended a deal struck in December with several non-member oil producers to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from levels seen late last year.
But OPEC also renewed exemptions for Libya and Nigeria, which have struggled with output-sapping internal conflict. Those struggles, however, are abating. 
""They've added 600,000 barrels per day between the two of them"" since the original deal was struck, said Amrita Sen of consultancy Energy Aspects. ""And that's half the OPEC cuts.""
Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) this week lifted force majeure on Nigeria's Forcados crude, bringing the country's oil exports fully online for the first time in 16 months and cementing the addition of some 250,000 bpd to world markets. 
Libyan oil production hit its highest since October 2014 at 835,000 bpd this month, despite the brief shutdown of Sharara, the country's largest oilfield, due to protests. 
Despite this, OPEC sources said calls to bring Libya or Nigeria into the cuts never garnered enough support. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said this month it was too early for those countries to be considered for output curbs.
But the excess is palpable – and it's pouring straight into the Atlantic Basin, home of the physical crude grades that underpin the global Brent benchmark. 
""In a physical sense, it's pretty dire,"" one West African oil trader said. ""Everything is on offer, and everything is pumping.""
Traders said some Mediterranean refiners - typically reliable consumers - were reselling their oil. 
A Mediterranean trader said that while Libya ""is not a totally reliable source"", its production was ""running high on several fields"".
There are doubts over whether the two nations will maintain their run, particularly given Libya's political problems. 
But Brent futures (LCOc1) are trading nearly 20 percent below their 2017 high, and more than 10 percent below the level before the May OPEC meeting. 
""The biggest issue is light, sweet crude,"" Sen said, adding the Atlantic Basin is ""awash"" with it. ""This is where OPEC isn't light enough on its feet ... the benchmarks are all light sweet. And the cuts are medium and sour.""
Even barrels from the United States are sailing east, looking for homes in Europe and Asia and further undermining the global benchmark. The dynamic, traders and analysts said, pointed to a need for more from OPEC.
""This means the rest of the group will see the call on their crude falling - it's very simple,"" FGE analyst James Davis said. ""They need to cut deeper in order to maintain the status quo.""

U.S. crude futures for July delivery were up 0.44% at $45.84 a barrel, not far from Thursday’s five-week low of $45.20.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the August Brent gained 0.48% to $48.09 a barrel, just off the five-week trough of $47.44 hit overnight.
Crude prices remained under pressure after data on Wednesday showed that U.S. crude stockpiles unexpectedly climbed last week for the first time in nine weeks.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude oil inventories rose by 3.3 million barrels in the week ended June 2, disappointing expectations for a crude-stock decline of 3.4 million barrels.
Meanwhile, investors continued to weigh the impact of diplomatic tensions between Qatar and other Middle Eastern nations, including Saudi Arabia, on an OPEC-led push to tighten the market.
With oil production of about 620,000 barrels per day, Qatar's crude output ranks as one of the smallest among OPEC producers, but tension within the cartel could weaken an agreement to hold back production in order to prop up prices.
Last month, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
Concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand remained in focus."
1292,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2017 06:04AM ET</span>",Growing supply glut threatens worse to come for restive Indian farmers,"By Rajendra Jadhav
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Bountiful monsoon rains are unlikely to lift India's rural economy this year, and may instead compound the woes of millions of debt-ridden farmers who are struggling with low prices amid a glut of produce such as lentils, oilseeds and cereals.
The South Asian nation is still carrying a huge inventory of food grains from last year's record harvest as exports were hit by an appreciating rupee, falling global prices and restrictions on overseas shipments.
Another bumper harvest could accelerate the price slide and stoke discontent among farmers that has triggered protests in the big agrarian states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, where police shot dead five protesting farmers this week.
Three years into his term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains popular and has no credible challenger. Yet unrest has flared in states ruled by his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), catching regional leaders flat-footed and providing a reality check on Modi's promise to double farmers' incomes over the next five years.
""The next year will be challenging for the government in ensuring farmers get decent realization,"" said Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai.
Farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are demanding better prices for their produce and billions of dollars in debt relief after the new BJP government in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, recently announced a $5.6 billion loan write-off for farmers.
Yet experts say such loan waivers amount to quick fixes that cannot compensate for flaws in farm policies, which have encouraged higher production of crops previously in short supply but offered scant protection on prices.
Many farm commodities are trading below support prices set by the government. That is because the government only commits serious sums to buying wheat and rice, but not other crops that enrich the diet of India's 1.3 billion people.
Prices will fall further unless exports are revived, said Galipelli, adding ""production has jumped but local demand hasn't risen in the same proportion"". Ample world supply is likely to persist, predicts agribusiness giant Cargill Inc.
""There is no export parity right now. Even after the recent correction in oilmeal prices, Indian supplies are expensive,"" said B.V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association (SEA), a Mumbai-based trade body.
Indian grains production reached an all-time high of 273.38 million tonnes in the latest crop year, on record output of rice, wheat, oilseeds and pulses. But exports failed to revive, depressing local prices of corn < NMZc1>, wheat , soybean  and turmeric .
Exports of key farm commodities fell by a quarter in 2015/16 to $16.07 billion due to drought, and failed to revive in 2016/17 despite the recovery in output.
RURAL DISTRESS
A rising population, shrinking farm plots and increasing indebtedness among farmers have all hit India's vast rural hinterlands. Farming accounts for 14 percent of gross domestic product - down from 47 percent at independence 70 years ago.
Nearly a third of rural households are in debt, owing an average of more than 100,000 rupees ($1,560). Many farmers lack access to formal credit, forcing them to borrow dearly from money lenders or relatives.
To mitigate this distress, state and central governments have ramped up purchases of red chili, turmeric, corn, onion, sunflower, pigeon peas and groundnut from farmers.
Still, farmers such as Sanjay Shinde from Maharashtra's Nashik district are unhappy. ""If Uttar Pradesh can waive all farmers' debts, then why not Maharashtra?"" he asked.
Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has warned that such loan waivers - forecast by BofA Merrill Lynch to reach $40 billion - would weaken already-strained state finances. ""It is a path that we need to tread very carefully,"" he said this week.
Analysts and traders say good monsoon rains - forecast at 98 percent of the long-term average - will only complicate matters unless supplies are adequately managed.
""There is an urgent need to restrict imports and promote exports. That's how one can bring down the inventory level of food grains,"" says Nitin Kalantri, a miller at Latur in Maharashtra.
""Otherwise in the next season we will have much a bigger problem. And much bigger farmers' protests.""

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for August delivery were down 0.31% at $1,275.51.
The August contract ended Thursday’s session 1.06% lower at $1,279.50 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,261.30, the low of June 2 and resistance at $1,291.50, Thursday’s high.
The greenback gained ground after former FBI director James Comey in testimony on Thursday accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine his investigation into possible collusion by the Trump campaign team with Russia's alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.29% at 97.22, just off a one-and-a-half week high of 97.36.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it weakens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Markets were also still digesting the European Central Bank’s decision on Thursday to cut its forecast for inflation this year to 1.5%, down from 1.7% in March.
The forecast came after the central bank left interest rates unchanged in a widely expected move.
But gold’s losses were limited after U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority in Thursday’s general election, potentially disrupting Brexit negotiations.
May faced calls to leave the government on Friday after the election left no single party with a clear claim to power just 10 days ahead of the start of Brexit negotiations.

Meanwhile in Europe, the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered Eurozone inflation expectations for the next two years, and said policymakers had not discussed tapering its massive bond buying program.
At a press conference after the ECB issued its decision to keep interest unchanged, ECB President Mario Draghi said interest rates were likely to remain at current levels for “an extended period of time.""

1296,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2017 06:21PM ET</span>","Qatar Gulf row roils LNG market, Shell tanker diverted","By Oleg Vukmanovic 
LONDON (Reuters) - The escalating diplomatic conflict between Qatar and several of its Middle East neighbors has roiled the liquefied natural gas trade, causing at least one tanker to change course and UK gas prices to spike.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and others this week severed diplomatic and transport links with Qatar, the world's biggest LNG producer, accusing it of sponsoring terrorism.
In one of the earliest signs of the effect on the LNG market, Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) sent an LNG cargo from the United States to Dubai, shipping data shows, after the United Arab Emirates banned Qatari ships from entering UAE ports.
A cluster of 17 LNG tankers are now moored off the coast of the Qatari LNG export facility at Ras Laffan, up from seven on Monday.
Gas prices in the United Kingdom spiked on Thursday, with the UK National Balancing Point (NBP) price for July  up over 4.5 percent after two Qatari tankers that were likely bound for the UK changed course, according to Reuters shipping data. 
It is unclear why those tankers shifted movements, though traders said they may be diverted around the continent of Africa rather than transit the Suez Canal, which is where they were expected to go. Traders worry that Egypt might bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal, though it is bound by international treaties not to block the canal.
Analysts still do not see an interruption in supply in the LNG market, even with Qatar's role as the world's largest producer.
""Only Egypt and the UAE are boycotting Qatari cargos so they are the only countries that might see U.S. volume replace Qatari,"" said Theodore Michael, senior LNG analyst at energy data provider Genscape in Boulder, Colorado.
Egypt, however, continues to buy LNG from Qatar brought in by Swiss commodity trade houses, like Trafigura,  Glencore  (L:GLEN) and Vitol, which take ownership of the cargoes at the Qatari port and do not use Qatari ships, analysts and traders said. One source said four tankers were expected to deliver Qatari LNG to Egypt over the next two weeks.
Qatar's foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, said the UAE was ""exploiting a trading position as a political tool,"" noting that about 40 percent of UAE power depends on natural gas from Qatar.
As exclusion zones took effect, Qatar's fleet of LNG vessels anchored off the UAE's port in Fujairah prior to the diplomatic cut-off has moved out. 
Shell has a deal to supply the Dubai Supply Authority (DUSUP) with LNG which it typically sources from Qatar. But the ban meant it had to source the LNG from elsewhere. 
Shell's Maran Gas Amphipolis tanker, carrying around 163,500 cubic meters of LNG from Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG export terminal in Louisiana, was initially headed toward Kuwait's port of Mina Al-Ahmadi but rerouted Wednesday for Dubai's port of Jebel Ali.
The tanker is currently unloading at DUSUP's floating import terminal at Jebel Ali, data showed. 
""Shell, as the largest LNG trader, would have a high probability of managing some of this,"" said Robert Ineson, managing director, global LNG, at IHS Markit in the Houston area.
""A shutdown of Qatar's exports, either by pipeline or via LNG, would be highly disruptive to global gas markets. We think this is not likely,"" he said.

Eben Burnham-Snyder, spokesman at  Cheniere Energy  Inc (A:LNG), said earlier this week that the company - currently the only supplier of U.S. LNG - will keep sending cargoes around the world. U.S. cargoes can be rerouted based on market conditions.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2017 01:05PM ET</span>",Wilbur Ross sees 'genuine' national security concern on steel,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Thursday that a national security review of the U.S. steel industry will be completed ""very shortly"" and will seek to protect the interests of both domestic steel producers and consumers.
Ross told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing that he believes there is ""a genuine national security issue that must be considered in this case,"" the second major signal in two days that the Trump administration is preparing new steel import restrictions. 
In a speech in Cincinnati on Wednesday, Trump said: ""Wait until you see what I'm going to do for steel and for your steel companies. We're going to stop the dumping, and stop all of these wonderful other countries from coming in and killing our companies and our workers. You'll be seeing that very soon.""
The steel review under a Cold War-era trade law would result in a ""thoughtful"" set of recommendations for Trump to consider for action, Ross said. He has previously said he expected to complete the study by the end of June.
Ross identified three kinds of actions that could be recommended: imposing tariffs above the current, country-specific anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on steel products; imposing quotas limiting the volume of steel imports; and a hybrid ""tariff-rate quota"" option that would include quotas on specific products with new tariffs for imports above those levels.
Choosing the latter option would help mitigate concerns over steel price inflation from tariffs, Ross said. Some steel users have voiced concerns that import limits would cause price increases that would make them more vulnerable to foreign competitors.

""The overall impact on inflation, were that to be the route, should be relatively modest,"" Ross said. ""So we're very mindful of the need both to protect the domestic steel producers from inappropriate behavior on the part of foreign dumpers, but also to protect the steel consumers, the steel fabricators, the auto companies and everybody else who uses steel.""

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2017 11:52AM ET</span>",Oil shrugs off geopolitical tensions but some see red flags,"By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - The oil price has ignored rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, as a three-year old crude surplus has wiped out any real fear over supply, but one of the world's largest security consultants says there are red flags the market cannot ignore. 
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and several other countries cut ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their arch-enemy Iran - charges Doha says are baseless. 
In Tehran, Islamic militants attacked the Iranian Parliament on Wednesday, killing at least 13 in an assault that Iran's Revolutionary Guards blamed on regional rival Saudi Arabia.
Around a third of the roughly 97 million barrels per day of oil that the world needs comes from the Middle East and yet as tensions have flared, the price has fallen to its lowest in a month, to below $49 a barrel.
Qatar is the world's largest producer of liquefied natural gas, but one of the smallest members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which on May 25 agreed with 11 of its rivals to extend an oil supply cut of 1.8 million barrels per day into 2018 to try to drain a multi-billion barrel global overhang of unused crude.
Control Risks, a security consultancy covering issues ranging from advice for its clients on regional politics to resolving kidnappings, says it has increased its assessment of operational and political risk in Qatar.
""Qatar stopping flow of gas ... to the UAE would be a significant escalation in the conflict and, at that point, I would start to get concerned,"" Allison Wood, a consultant for Control Risks, said.
""Obviously if you see Saudi troops mobilizing and heading toward to the Saudi/Qatari border that is another point of concern. Those are the two potential red flags that I'd be looking at."" 
Volatility, a measure of investor nervousness in the oil market , has risen from January's two-year lows, but at around 30 percent, is still half what it was in January 2016, when Saudi Arabia cut ties with Iran when its embassy in Tehran was stormed over Riyadh's execution of a Shi'ite Muslim cleric.
""In 15 years, I've never known a time when regional tensions in the Middle East were absent in the oil price in the way that they are today,"" said Investec portfolio manager Tom Nelson, who helps manage a part of the company's $114 billion in assets.
""The view is really that the oil market is oversupplied and will remain oversupplied for a long time,"" he said, adding that he believed global inventories would gradually start to drop over the second half of this year. 
MIDDLE EAST INSTABILITY
The United States weighed in on Tuesday, after President Donald Trump praised the Gulf states' action against Qatar, even though the country hosts the largest U.S. air base in the region. 
""For me (the Qatari conflict) serves to remind us that the Middle East is not a stable place ... ultimately, there are always going to be these tensions,"" Rohan Murphy, an energy analyst at asset manager Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors.
""Everyone is analyzing the supply-side risk and not worrying about the risk of somewhere like Iran and you couple that with Libya output going down instead of up and then you could start seeing the signs in 2018 of the underinvestment of the last couple of years,"" he said, referring to the resurgence of oil output in Libya after years of disruptions from violence.
Even though global demand has been strong, the oil market is struggling with a third year in a row with sky-high inventories that seemingly refuse to drain, even though OPEC and non-members such as Russia, Oman and Kazakhstan have cut output.
The roughly 3 billion barrels of oil in storage across the world's richest nations equate to around a month of demand and this cushion has insulated investors from disruption to supply.
""Until the inventory overhang is clearly running down and much smaller than it is today, that sensitivity will remain relatively low,"" said Richard Mallinson, an analyst for consultants Energy Aspects.

""Geopolitics will matter but it's unlikely to be the overriding topic of market interest.""

U.S. natural gas for July shed 2.5 cents, or around 0.8%, to $2.995 per million British thermal units by 10:35AM ET (1435GMT). Futures were at around $3.010 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 106 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 2, above forecasts for a build of 98 billion.
That compared with a gain of 81 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 65 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 94 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.631 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 11.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 9.0% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural gas futures settled lower for seventh time in the past eight sessions on Wednesday after falling to its lowest since March 20 at $2.935 at the start of the week.
Prices of the commodity have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.

Comey is expected to be asked about conversations in which President Donald Trump is reported to have pressured him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, whose ties to Russia are under scrutiny.
In written testimony released on Wednesday, Comey quoted Trump as telling him the Russia investigation was a ""cloud"" impairing his ability to operate as president.

Meanwhile, Britons will head to the polls on Thursday, with voters set to elect 650 members to the Lower House of Parliament from which a government will be formed. Results are expected late in the evening after the market closes.
A final flurry of opinion polls on Wednesday gave Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party a lead between 5 and 12 percentage points over the main opposition Labour Party, suggesting she would increase her majority.
However, British opinion polls have had a relatively poor track record recently, raising expectations that the election outcome could again spring a surprise.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude July contract was at $45.52 a barrel by 7:30AM ET (1130GMT), down 21 cents, or around 0.5%, after hitting its lowest since May 5 at $45.34.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for August delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 22 cents to $47.84 a barrel. The global benchmark touched $47.65 earlier in session, a level not seen since May 5.
Oil prices plunged on Wednesday after data showed that U.S. crude stockpiles unexpectedly climbed for the first time in nine weeks.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 3.3 million barrels in the week ended June 2, disappointing expectations for a crude-stock decline of 3.4 million barrels.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 3.3 million barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a rise of 4.4 million barrels.
Meanwhile, investors continued to weigh the impact of diplomatic tensions between Qatar and other Middle Eastern nations, including Saudi Arabia, on an OPEC-led push to tighten the market.
With oil production of about 620,000 barrels per day, Qatar's crude output ranks as one of the smallest among OPEC producers, but tension within the cartel could weaken an agreement to hold back production in order to prop up prices.
Last month, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
Concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand remained in focus.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil edged up on Thursday, having hit one-month lows the previous day after an unexpected surge in U.S. inventories and the return of more Nigerian crude to an already oversupplied market.
The oil price has slipped below $50 a barrel despite a pledge by the world's largest exporters to extend an existing output cut of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) into next year in an effort to reduce bulging global inventories.
Adding to concern about supply outstripping demand, Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) on Wednesday lifted force majeure on exports of Nigeria's Forcados crude, bringing all the country's oil grades fully online for the first time in 16 months.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 43 cents by 0900 GMT at $48.49 a barrel, having fallen 4 percent the day before, while U.S. crude futures (CLc1) rose 38 cents to $46.10 a barrel.
The market has also come under pressure from news of rising output from Libya, which together with Nigeria is exempt from the production cut made by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its 11 partners. 
""I've been quite bullish for the second half of this year, based on supply and demand balances and I would still not give up on that idea, that rebalancing is going to start in the second half,"" PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said.
""But if Nigerian and Libyan production is picking up as well as they are now, then slowly, I am probably going to have to start changing my mind.""
In the United States, stocks of crude oil and gasoline surprisingly rose last week as refinery runs declined and exports fell, official data showed on Wednesday. 
Nervousness also pervaded the broader financial markets. 
Former FBI director James Comey's U.S. congressional appearance, a European Central Bank (ECB) policy meeting and the British general election take place on Thursday. 
Many investors are wary ahead of Comey's Senate appearance as they look for any hints that U.S. President Donald Trump may have been engaged in obstruction of justice - an offense that could lead to impeachment hearings.
ECB policymakers are set to take a more benign view of the economy and will even discuss dropping some of their pledges to ramp up stimulus if needed, sources with direct knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.

None of those events ""are directly related to oil but all of them could have an impact on the dollar and risk attitudes generally"", said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at OptionsXpress in Sydney.

Comey was leading the FBI's probe into the allegations, and his firing sparked a political uproar last month.

A weekly report from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday showed U.S. crude, gasoline and distillates stocks swelled in the week ended May 26.
Inventories of U.S. crude rose by roughly 3.3m barrels in the week ended May 26, confounding expectations of draw of around 3.5m barrels.

The sugar lobby last month said it had asked the Mexican economy ministry to investigate U.S. high-fructose corn syrup imports, saying there was ""solid"" evidence of dumping. 
Mexico on Tuesday conceded to U.S. demands for changes in the terms of Mexican access to the lucrative U.S. sugar market, but U.S. sugar producers refused to endorse the deal.
The agreement would avert possible steep U.S. import duties on Mexican sugar and had been seen as lowering the risk of Mexico slapping its own import duties on U.S. high-fructose corn syrup as a retaliatory measure. 
""This issue with the U.S. sugar industry is not over,"" Juan Cortina, the head of Mexican sugar industry group (CNIAA), told reporters at an event in Mexico City where he said the group would keep pressing for a fructose probe in Mexico.

Abu Dhabi Petroleum Ports Authority issued a new circular on Wednesday removing previous restrictions on non-Qatar owned, flagged or operated vessels sailing to and from Qatar.
This effectively allows direct trade between the two ports and co-loading of crude cargoes, a Singapore-based shipbroker said.
A Middle East-based industry source said there had been no official notification on halting the co-loading of crude cargoes.
The ban on vessels carrying the Qatari flag and vessels owned or operated by Qatar is still in place, according to the circular.
But given there are few Qatari-flagged or owned vessels, this is unlikely to have as big an impact on the market as the previous circular, the shipbroker added.
Reuters reported on Wednesday two very large crude carriers (VLCCs), which can each carry up to 2 million barrels of oil, loaded Abu Dhabi grades on Wednesday, despite having taken Qatari crude in an earlier leg of the voyage.
On Monday, Saudi Arabia's Ports Authority told shipping agents not to accept vessels flying the Qatari flag or ships owned by Qatari companies or individuals, it said on its Twitter account, adding that Qatari goods would be barred from unloading in Saudi ports.
On Wednesday, Saudi's Ras Tanura oil port issued a notice stressing the restrictions issued earlier by the Saudi Ports Authority, according to a copy seen by Reuters.
Another industry source said the notice indicated co-loading of crude cargoes at Saudi ports would be allowed.

On Monday, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed ties including all air, land and sea transport links with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Doha denies the accusation.

U.S. natural gas for July tacked on 3.0 cents, or around 1%, to $3.072 per million British thermal units by 9:15AM ET (1315GMT).
It settled higher for the first time in seven sessions on Tuesday after falling to its lowest since March 20 at $2.935 at the start of the week.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on summer heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.525 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 12.8% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 8.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 88 and 98 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 2.
That compares with a gain of 81 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 65 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 94 billion cubic feet.

In the nearer term, with fuel production and consumption largely balanced according to the EIA, the market is focused on inventories which remain bloated. 
In the United States, official inventory data from the EIA will be published on Wednesday, with expectations of a fall in stockpiles.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has pledged to cut almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to help reduce global inventories to their five-year average.
""The market just has to be patient,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets, adding that a gradual reduction in inventories would support prices without the kind of price spike that would drive U.S. shale production higher.
""We think inventories are going to be close to normal by the end of the year,"" he added. 
But analysts saw a risk that rivalries between OPEC members could weaken the production cut agreement. Some Arab states, including OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar, a small producer.
The spat adds to other lingering doubts about whether the agreement will be enough to support prices, including rising production from countries exempt from the agreement - Libya and Nigeria. 
Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) has lifted force majeure on exports of Nigeria's Forcados crude oil, bringing all of the country's oil exports fully online for the first time in 16 months. 
But Qatar's isolation has also caused trade disruptions that offered some short-term support for oil prices, analysts said.

""Port restrictions on Qatari flagged vessels are going to cause loading disruptions,"" said Jeffrey Halley, analyst at brokerage OANDA, adding this could ""put a floor on crude in the short-term rather than starting a panic rally.""

Gold prices scored a third-straight session of gains Tuesday after hitting its highest level since November 9 at $1,298.80, as investors sought safe-haven assets ahead of potentially market-moving events later this week.
Also on the Comex, silver futures slumped 16.9 cents, or about 1%, to $17.54 a troy ounce. It rose to $17.74 in the prior session, a level not seen since April 25.
The euro hit intraday lows as a report surfaced that the ECB will cut its inflation forecast through 2019 because of weaker energy prices, according to officials familiar with the matter.
A downgrade to the inflation outlook would support the view of top policymakers, including President Mario Draghi, that they must be extremely cautious in communicating and implementing any exit from monetary stimulus.
The report sparked speculation that the euro area monetary authority will maintain its dovish stance. The ECB will release its official updated projections at the monetary policy announcement on Thursday.
The euro sold off as the news hit the wires, hitting an intraday low of 1.1206 against the dollar.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.4% at 96.91 in New York morning trade. It fell to 96.46 on Tuesday, the weakest level since November 9.

Investors are fearful that the Trump administration may be further damaged by any revelations that could emerge when Comey testifies about Russia’s alleged involvement in the U.S. election.
Traders were also wary ahead of Britain's general election, which is also set for Thursday.

Oil prices finished higher for the first time in three sessions on Tuesday as tension in the Middle East lent some support.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories fell by 4.62 million barrels in the week ended June 2.
The API report also showed a sizable gain of 4.1 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks rose by 1.8 million barrels.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report at 10:30AM ET (1430GMT) Wednesday.
Analysts expect crude oil inventories dropped by around 3.4 million barrels at the end of last week, while gasoline supplies are seen increasing by 580,000 barrels and distillates are forecast to gain about 281,000 barrels.
There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA.
Meanwhile, investors continued to weigh the impact of diplomatic tensions between Qatar and other Middle Eastern nations, including Saudi Arabia, on an OPEC-led push to tighten the market.
With oil production of about 620,000 barrels per day, Qatar's crude output ranks as one of the smallest among OPEC producers, but tension within the cartel could weaken an agreement to hold back production in order to prop up prices.
Last month, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
Concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand remained in focus.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for July inched up 0.3 cents, or about 0.2%, to $1.529 a gallon, while July heating oil slipped 0.8 cents to $1.457 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for July delivery rose 1.4 cents to $3.056 per million British thermal units.

The risk-off mood was further compounded by escalating tensions in the Middle East, where Saudi Arabia and three other Arab nations severed their ties with Qatar earlier in the week, accusing it of supporting terrorism.
Gold is often seen as an alternative currency in times of global economic uncertainty and a refuge from financial risk.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2017 08:22PM ET</span>","U.S., Mexico reach sugar pact despite U.S. producer resistance","By David Lawder and Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mexico on Tuesday conceded to U.S. demands for changes in the terms of Mexican access to the lucrative U.S. sugar market, striking a deal with Washington that will likely lift prices of the sweetener to U.S. food processors and consumers.
Sugar producers in the United States refused to endorse the agreement in principle between the two governments after pushing for even more concessions from Mexico, raising the possibility that the deal could collapse.
The agreement in principle between U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo aims to resolve a long-standing trade dispute between the two countries.
Without it, the United States could have reimposed steep import duties on its southern neigbour and risked the prospect of a retaliation from Mexico just as the two countries and Canada prepare to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement this year.
Under the deal, Mexico would sharply reduce the share of refined sugar it exports to the United States and increase raw sugar exports.
""We have gotten the Mexican side to agree to nearly every request made by U.S. industry to address flaws in the current system and ensure fair treatment of American sugar growers and refiners,"" Ross told a news conference.
Still, Ross said the U.S. sugar producers had told him that they could not accept the deal in its current form, but he hoped that they would agree to some changes in a final drafting of the agreement in the next several days. 
He did not elaborate on what action the Commerce Department would take if there were no final agreement with the U.S. producers. It was unclear if Ross would impose the settlement if U.S. producers did not sign onto it.
The agreement lifts the minimum prices for Mexican imports, which will likely be passed on by U.S. sugar refiners to food companies and beverage and confectionary producers and ultimately to consumers.
A trade group that represents a coalition of U.S. sugar buyers and other firms that are critics of the U.S. program said the deal favored the interests of U.S. sugar producers, and estimated the cost to the consumers in higher prices for food, drinks and confectionary at around $1 billion.
""Today's announcement is a bad deal for hardworking Americans, and exemplifies the worst form of crony capitalism,"" the U.S. Coalition for Sugar Reform said in a statement.
The negotiations were an attempt to settle an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy case brought by a coalition of cane and beet farming groups and ASR Group, the maker of Domino Sugar that is owned by the politically well-connected Fanjul family of Florida.
While the limits on refined sugar from Mexico at 30 percent were significantly below the previous 53 percent limit, these groups had initially pushed for a 15 percent limit.
Sources on both sides of the border had said on Monday that the U.S. sugar industry had added new demands outside of the terms agreed on earlier yesterday by the two governments. 
The American Sugar Alliance said it objected to the new deal because Mexico would still be able to ship in refined sugar to meet additional U.S. demand above quota. The alliance wants the U.S. Department of Agriculture to have the final say on the type of sugar to be imported.
LONG-STANDING FEUD, NAFTA LOOMS
The agreement, if finalized, was expected to avert potential retaliation from Mexico on imports of U.S. high-fructose corn syrup which had worried corn growers and refiners.
The potential for an escalation in the dispute would have soured the relations between the two countries ahead of NAFTA renegotiations. Agriculture is typically one of the most sensitive areas in trade negotiations.
Representatives of some of the world's biggest grain traders, Archer Daniels Midland Co and Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) joined Cocal-Cola Co and others to lobby against the U.S. sugar producers in the dispute.
""Avoiding a trade war will benefit everyone, and I'm glad that this years-long trade dispute is finally reaching its end,"" said Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, adding that Ross balanced all interests in the negotiations.
U.S. refiners wanted even more stringent terms on imports from Mexico. They have complained that high-quality Mexican raw sugar was going straight to sugar consumers, rather than passing through U.S. refineries. Mexican producers would have been happy with a rollover of existing terms.
The deal would mark the culmination of a multi-year dispute between the countries over sugar, after U.S. groups in 2014 asked the government for protection from subsidized exports from Mexico. In 2014, the U.S. government slapped large duties on Mexican sugar but hammered out a deal with Mexico that suspended those levies. Factions of the U.S. industry have said that the deal failed to eliminate harm to U.S. producers from Mexican imports.
ASR Group and fellow cane refiner Imperial Sugar, owned by commodities firm Louis Dreyfus Company BV [AKIRAU.UL], have said they are being starved of raw supplies under the current deal. They have asked the U.S. government to terminate the pact.
The latest talks began in March, two months after U.S. President Donald Trump took office vowing a tougher line on trade to protect U.S. industry and jobs.

(Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) said on Tuesday that production and exports of liquefied natural gas from Qatar have not been affected by rising diplomatic tensions in the Middle East.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt on Monday cut ties with Qatar, accusing the country of supporting extremism. Qatar denies the allegations.
The growing diplomatic rift has raised concerns about global access to Qatar's LNG, especially after some regional ports in the Persian Gulf said they would not accept Qatari-flagged vessels.
Commodities traders have grown concerned Qatar's LNG could be barred from Saudi Arabia or from traversing Egypt's Suez Canal, though so far no limitations have been imposed.
Maersk (CO:MAERSKb), the world's biggest container shipping line, said on Tuesday it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar in the wake of the diplomatic rift.
Qatar and Exxon have had development agreements for more than a decade, with Exxon helping Qatar to become the world's largest LNG exporter. Exxon, working with government-controlled energy company Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL], has invested in LNG-processing plants, transport ships and related infrastructure.
The pair, which earlier this year were awarded a contract to explore for gas off the coast of Cyprus, also control the Golden Pass LNG facility in the United States with ConocoPhillips (N:COP).
Despite the diplomatic tension with other Arab States, a key Qatari gas export pipeline to the United Arab Emirates is still operating. Exxon said its production and export of LNG from Qatar have not been affected.
""As a matter of practice, we don't comment on matters between governments,"" Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in a statement to Reuters.
Exxon has said that a large portion of its Qatari LNG production is under long-term supply contracts, meaning the company must supply gas from Qatar or some other source. Exxon does have a large LNG operation in Papua New Guinea.
Qatar has reassured clients in Japan and India that LNG shipments will not be affected by the tension.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged upward Tuesday, finding technical support after sliding below $47 a barrel on pressure from a diplomatic rift in the Middle East and sustained high crude inventories in the United States.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) was up 52 cents at $47.92 by 1:15 p.m. EST. It fell in early trade, then bounced off technical support between $46.75 and $46.95 and edged upward.

Oil prices remain about 8 percent lower than they stood before OPEC and its non-OPEC allies said they were extending output cuts until March 2018. The initial six-month deal to curb output had been due to run till the end of this month. 
Leading Arab powers including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates cut ties with Qatar on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and Iran. Ships coming from or going to Qatar were barred from docking at Fujairah, in the UAE.

Some investors fear tension within the cartel could weaken Qatar's commitment to hold back production to prop up prices. But several analysts said these fears were exaggerated.

SINGAPORE/LONDON (Reuters) - A campaign by leading Arab powers to isolate Qatar is disrupting trade in commodities from crude oil to metals and food, and deepening fears of a possible jolt to the global gas market, where the tiny Gulf state is a major player.
Just a day after Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies severed transport links with Qatar over a diplomatic row, bans on Doha's fleet using regional ports and anchorages threatened to halt some of its exports and disrupt those of liquefied natural gas (LNG). 
Traders worried that Riyadh's allies would refuse to accept LNG shipments from the Gulf state, and that Egypt might even bar tankers carrying Qatari cargoes from using the Suez Canal as they head to Europe and beyond - although Cairo is bound by an international agreement to let them use the waterway.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain severed relations with Qatar and closed their airspace to commercial flights on Monday, in the worst split between powerful Arab states in decades.
U.S. President Donald Trump joined in the dispute on Tuesday, saying leaders he met on a Middle East trip had warned him that Doha was funding ""radical ideology"". Qatar vehemently denies the accusations made against it.
Qatar is now unable to load crude oil onto supertankers together with other Gulf-based grades, and price agency S&P Global Platts said it would not automatically include the country in its Middle East price benchmark.
The agency noted that tankers usually combine Qatari shipments with crude from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Oman before heading from the Gulf. ""Restrictions on vessels calling into Qatar and associated uncertainty could impact the inherent value of crude loading from Qatar,"" it said. 
More worryingly, food imports are affected as Saudi Arabia closed its land border with Qatar, stranding thousands of trucks carrying supplies. Sources said the UAE and Saudi Arabia have already cut exports of white sugar to Qatar. Consumption is traditionally higher during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is currently being observed.
Qatar, which largely depends on food imports for its population of 2.5 million, has assured residents it has taken measures to assure that normal life continues.
However, Maersk (CO:MAERSKb), the world's biggest container shipping line, said it can no longer transport goods in or out of Qatar.
Containers carrying food and other consumer goods are usually shipped to Qatar via the UAE port of Jebel Ali. A Maersk Line spokesman said: ""We have confirmation that we will not be able to move Qatar cargo in and out of Jebel Ali.""
Shoppers packed stores in Doha on Monday to stock up. On Tuesday, fresh poultry and some types of milk were in short supply at two supermarkets visited by a Reuters reporter. However, plenty of fruit and vegetables remained on the shelves.
EXCLUSION ZONES
With exclusion zones sweeping into effect, vessels from Qatar are no longer able to dock in the UAE or Saudi Arabia as planned. According to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, around half a dozen oil, chemical and LNG tankers have had to leave UAE waters or have halted in the open ocean. 
Bans on Qatar-linked oil and LNG vessels refueling at the UAE's port of Fujairah have added to chaos, pushing shippers to find new refueling points at extra cost, industry sources said.
Lying near the Strait of Hormuz, through which ships pass on their way to customers in Asia, the United States or Europe, Fujairah is one of the world's most important ports for the global energy market. 
Qatar, the world's biggest LNG seller, is moving to send a first batch of LNG tankers as far afield as Singapore and Gibraltar to refuel with Fujairah now off limits. Some trade sources said this could increase costs and delay deliveries to its clients globally. 
The UAE's ban also effectively halts deliveries of LNG produced in Qatar to the Gulf state, trade sources said. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) has a deal with the Dubai Supply Authority to deliver up to three LNG cargoes per month, typically sourced from Qatar. 
""This shouldn't affect the spot market though. Shell will simply need to go into its global portfolio and find LNG from elsewhere to send to Dubai. It's a minor inconvenience,"" one LNG trader said.
LNG traders are on high alert for signs of disruption through the Suez Canal. They are tracking the Al Ruwais LNG tanker, which is nearing the waterway and plans to become the first Qatari cargo to pass through since the row erupted.
Cairo has made no official statement. However, a Suez Canal Authority official said that under an international agreement, Cairo allows all ships to pass through except for those from countries at war with Egypt. The Suez Canal does not have the power to prevent Qatari ships from passing, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Any tanker barred from using the canal would have to sail around Africa, adding a month to shipping times. Such disruption could boost demand for Russian gas, just as Europe is trying to reduce its reliance on such supplies due to disputes with Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.
Another test will be a batch of LNG shipments of Qatari origin being brought by commodity trader Trafigura to Egypt. These are due to arrive at the country's Ain Sokhna port over the coming days and weeks, trade sources said. 
Any sign that state-run importer Egyptian Natural Gas Holding would bar LNG of Qatari origin would probably push up spot prices sharply as middlemen seek alterative supplies. 
Last year Qatar produced 60 percent of all LNG imported by Egypt, all of which was brought in by third-party traders such as Trafigura,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) and Vitol. 
""The biggest impact will be if Egypt tries to restrict vessels coming through the canal or if they ban Qatari LNG from local ports,"" a trading source said.
The rift has also hit aluminum exports from a Qatari plant part-owned by Norway's Norsk Hydro (OL:NHY) as it has lost access to the Jebel Ali port, through which it typically runs exports operations.

Circumventing barriers to customers in Asia, Europe and the United States will take some time, the company said, showing how the diplomatic face-off is inflicting havoc on global supply chains.

U.S. natural gas for July tacked on 6.8 cents, or around 2.3%, to $3.050 per million British thermal units by 8:55AM ET (1255GMT).
It settled lower for the sixth session in a row on Monday after falling to its lowest since March 20 at $2.935 after the latest U.S. weather model called for mild temperatures over the next two weeks, which should reduce heating demand during that time.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.525 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 12.8% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 8.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 88 and 98 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 2.
That compares with a gain of 81 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 65 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 94 billion cubic feet.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude July contract was at $47.30 a barrel by 8:30AM ET (12300GMT), down 10 cents, or around 0.2%.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for August delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 16 cents to $49.31 a barrel.
Oil prices finished lower for the second straight session on Monday as a political rift between Qatar and several Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, sparked concern that it would undermine an OPEC-led push to tighten the market.
With oil production of about 620,000 barrels per day, Qatar's crude output ranks as one of the smallest among OPEC producers, but tension within the cartel could weaken an agreement to hold back production in order to prop up prices.
Last month, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
Concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand remained in focus.
The U.S. rig count rose for the 20th week in a row to the highest level since April 2015 last week, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.

1344,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2017 05:31PM ET</span>",U.S. asks Canada to end 'underhanded' dairy pricing class,"By Rod Nickel
(Reuters) - The United States has asked Canada to eliminate a new ""underhanded"" dairy-pricing class that has undercut sales by U.S. dairies to Canadian processors, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said on Monday.
Perdue was speaking to reporters after he met with Canadian Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay in Toronto.
Canada's dairy farmers last year struck a new pricing deal, known as Class 7, with processors including Saputo Inc and Parmalat Canada [PLTPRC.UL]. Foreign industry groups said the deal priced domestic milk ingredients used to make cheese and yogurt below cost.
""I made it very clear that the Class 7 designation we felt was unfair, undercutting this (U.S.) industry that grew up south of the border,"" Perdue said. ""... The quick win would be to do away with Class 7 milk, which we think is a very unfair, underhanded circumvention of WTO (World Trade Organization).""
Perdue's comments come as the United States has signalled it wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico. They illustrate possible obstacles to a new deal, even as the United States and Mexico went into overtime on Monday on sugar trade talks.
In a statement, MacAulay said he and Perdue discussed ""shared priorities.""
Perdue said that Class 7, which took effect in February, enabled Canadian farmers to overproduce milk, contributing to depressed world prices. Canada protects its dairy sector from foreign competition with high tariffs on imports above a quota and controls domestic production to support prices.
Canada's dairy system drew criticism in April from U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he would ""stand up for our dairy farmers"" against Canada's ""unfair"" practices. He did not give details about his concerns.
Dairy Farmers of Canada, an influential lobby group that was closely involved in creating Class 7, could not be reached for comment. In the past, the group has stressed that Class 7 is a domestic policy, and allows Canadian processors to continue choosing their suppliers.
Perdue said he also raised concerns about how U.S. wheat is priced in Canada, and about how U.S. wines are displayed for sale in some provinces. 
Under Canadian legislation, U.S. wheat automatically receives the lowest quality designation and price in Canada under the country's grading system. Perdue said the wheat-grading issue seems to be less of a concern to Canada and its farmers and could be resolved quickly.
Bilateral trade in agriculture and food was worth C$62 billion ($46 billion) in 2016, according to the Canadian government.

The rules of origin, which stipulate that products must meet minimum NAFTA-wide content requirements to be tariff-free, are seen as a sensitive area of discussion once negotiations to revamp the trilateral treaty kick off in August.
""The three countries should agree to updated rules of origin and regional value content requirements that incentivize investment and job growth in the region,"" lobby groups representing the North American steel industry said in a joint letter.
""In particular, rules of origin and regional value content provisions for steel-containing goods should ensure that North American manufactured goods are built with North American steel,"" said the letter.
Under rules of origin, manufacturers must obtain a minimum percentage of components for their products from the three NAFTA members.
Mexican officials have said that stricter rules of origin in some industries could be one way for companies in North America to use more regional content, supporting President Donald Trump's plan to create more U.S. manufacturing jobs.
Mexico sends the vast majority of its exports north to the United States, and local officials view the trade agreement as a lynchpin of their economy.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The U.S. and Mexican governments reached a deal in a dispute over trade in sugar on Monday, sources said, averting steep U.S. duties and Mexican retaliation by Mexico on imports of American high-fructose corn syrup ahead of the renegotiation of NAFTA.
Two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two sides were working on final details of a deal in Washington that would end a year of wrangling. The latest talks began in March, two months after President Donald Trump took power vowing a tougher line on trade to protect U.S. industry and jobs. 
They are seen as a precursor as well as significant hurdle to the more complex discussions on the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada, which are expected to start in August. 
One source said the sugar deal would benefit both the United States and Mexico, with another saying Mexico will agree to export less refined sugar and send a lower quality of crude sugar to the United States than it previously did.
Both sides also would avoid potentially inflammatory tariffs that could have kicked in if a deal was not reached.
Some members of the U.S. sugar industry, however, are not happy with the reported deal and were pressuring the Trump administration to stop it, one source said. Some of their Mexican counterparts also expressed anger at what they see as unfavorable terms.
ICE U.S. domestic raw sugar futures for July delivery  finished down 2.9 percent at 27.66 cents per lb, in the largest one-day loss in over a year.
The risk that failure to reach a deal would a trigger a rapidly escalating tariff battle ahead of the NAFTA talks added pressure to Mexico to reach a deal.
""If it had melted down, the NAFTA conversation would have been more difficult,"" said Daniel  Pearson  (LON:PSON), a senior fellow at the conservative think-tank Cato Institute and a former chairman of the U.S. International Trade Commission.
""The fact that an agreement could be reached on a sensitive topic like (sugar) bodes well for dealing with sensitive talks in NAFTA,"" he said. 
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross came close to hammering out a compromise deal before an earlier deadline in May, but it fell through as the U.S. sugar lobby upped its pressure on U.S. lawmakers, said two sources familiar with the talks.
The powerful lobby includes the politically connected Fanjul family, Imperial Sugar Co [LOUDRI.UL], owned by Louis Dreyfus Co, and U.S. cane and beet growers.
Mexico had free access to the U.S. sugar market under NAFTA, but U.S. sugar refiners accused it of dumping subsidized sugar, undercutting their businesses. In retaliation, the United States slapped large duties on the Mexican sweetener, but a 2014 agreement suspended the tariffs in return for quotas and price floors for Mexican sugar.
The new deal would lower the proportion of refined sugar Mexico can export to the United States to 30 percent of total exports, from 53 percent, one source said. It also cuts the quality of Mexico's crude sugar exports to 99.2 percent, from 99.5 percent, the source said, tackling a key complaint of U.S. refiners, who said Mexican crude sugar was close to refined and going straight to consumers.

The U.S. sugar market is protected by a complex web of price supports and import quotas, which confection makers and other critics say artificially inflates domestic prices. NAFTA opened the doors to Mexican sugar in 2008.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for July delivery fell 0.55% to settle at $47.40 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent dipped by 1% to trade at $49.44 a barrel.
Crude futures initially rose, as investors anticipated that supply disruptions could support oil prices following news that a group of Arab nations, led by Saudi Arabia, severed diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of fuelling terrorism.
Gains, however, were short-lived, as fears grew that geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could threatened the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (Opec) accord to tackle oversupply in the industry, which has pressured prices over the last three years.
Qatar with a production capacity of about 600,000 barrels per day (bdp) is one of Opec’s smaller oil producing nations.
Investors fear that should geopolitical tensions in the Middle East escalate, Qatar may abandon its production quota previously agreed under the Opec deal, which could derail the global pact to extend production curbs until March.
“This means Qatar may have little reason to keep the production quota and if that happens, it might encourage other OPEC members to cheat too.” Phin Zibell, ‎Senior Analyst at National Australia Bank said.
The turmoil in the Middle East comes amid concerns that rising U.S output could exacerbate the oversupply problem, as U.S. crude production has averaged more than 9.3 million bpd for four straight weeks, and is expected to reach nearly 10 million bpd by next year.

Should the rising tensions escalate further, we might witness a surge of tens of percent in the price of crude.The latest Gulf War in the early 1990s saw crude prices rise by 230% in three short months, a scenario which could replay itself with the disruption of oil production by armed conflict."
1350,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 05, 2017 10:10AM ET</span>",U.S. natural gas futures fall to lowest since March on weather outlook,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures slid to the lowest level since mid-March on Monday, after the latest U.S. weather model called for mild temperatures over the next two weeks, which should reduce heating demand during that time.
U.S. natural gas for July delivery fell to a session low of $2.935 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since March 20. It was last at $2.999 by 10:10AM ET (1410GMT), little changed on the day.
Prices of the fuel dropped about 7% last week, the biggest weekly loss since the end of January.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.525 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 12.8% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 8.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 88 and 98 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 2.
That compares with a gain of 81 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 65 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 94 billion cubic feet.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2017 09:41AM ET</span>",Oil prices dip on fears Middle East rift could harm OPEC cuts,"By Stephen Eisenhammer
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 1 percent on Monday on concerns that the cutting of ties with Qatar by top crude exporter Saudi Arabia and other Arab states could hamper a global deal to reduce oil production.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain closed transport links with top liquefied natural gas (LNG) and condensate shipper Qatar, accusing it of supporting extremism and undermining regional stability.
The move initially pushed Brent crude prices up as much as 1 percent as geopolitical fears rippled through the market. But Brent later reversed gains, trading down 59 cents at $49.36 a barrel by 1322 GMT (9:22 a.m. ET).
U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were at $47.14 a barrel, down 52 cents. 
With production capacity of about 600,000 barrels per day (bpd), Qatar's crude output is one of OPEC's smallest but tension within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries could weaken the supply deal, aimed at supporting prices. 
""I think it's still going to be a bit of a debate on the true impact it can have on the oil market,"" said Olivier Jakob, strategist at Petromatrix. 
""In terms of oil flows it doesn't change very much but there is a wider geopolitical impact one needs to consider,"" Jakob added, explaining that a breakdown in relations between Qatar and Saudi Arabia could make the OPEC-led agreement on production cuts less effective. 
There are already doubts the effort to curb production by almost 1.8 million bpd is seriously denting exports.
While there was a dip in OPEC supplies between February and April, a report on Monday by Thomson Reuters Oil Research said OPEC shipments likely jumped to 25.18 million bpd in May, up over 1 million bpd from April.
Brent futures are down about 7 percent from their open on May 25, when OPEC opted to extend production cuts into 2018. 
Crude output in the United States, which is not participating in the cuts, has jumped more than 10 percent since mid-2016 to 9.34 million bpd, close to levels of top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia.
The rise in U.S. production has been driven by a record 20th straight weekly climb in oil drilling, with the rig count climbing by 11 in the week to June 2, to 733, the most since April 2015.
""Investors continue to doubt the ability of OPEC to rebalance the oil market, with crude oil prices remaining under pressure amid further signs of rising U.S. oil production,"" ANZ bank said.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2017 09:06AM ET</span>","Big oil, small U.S. towns see new reward in old production technique","By Ernest Scheyder
HOBBS, New Mexico (Reuters) - Amid the frenetic activity of American shale oilfields recovering from a two-year recession sit a handful of oil towns that seemed impervious as many producers went into bankruptcy and the economy around them sank.
Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) and a few other oil producers with wells near this town on New Mexico's border with Texas steadily pumped low-cost oil through the downturn, using a technique that has been heralded worldwide as a way to reduce carbon emissions and boost oil output.
""When everyone else in the oil industry was going down, Oxy kept working,"" said Joshua Grassham, vice president of Lea County State Bank and a Hobbs Chamber of Commerce board member. The city of 35,000 rests on the Permian oilfield, the largest oilfield in the United States.
This way of drilling brings with it a sweetener for the oil industry to keep crude flowing: a tax credit that helps insulate these wells in a downturn, and could triple in size if Congress approves a new measure this summer. 
Such a move could extend by decades the producing life of hundreds more wells, increasing oil supply which would be a drag on prices. To date, the technique has been employed only at conventional oilfields, rather than on shale deposits. Some firms are studying how to put the technique to work in shale drilling, too.
The drilling method harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil or from power plants, and forces it back into the fields. That boosts the pressure underground and drives more oil to the surface. 
Their success could be replicated in oilfields across the United States if Congress approves the measure, which already enjoys broad bipartisan support. While the Trump administration has yet to say whether it supports the tax credit increase, the measure could also be a boon to the coal industry, which Trump wants to revitalize.
The technique, one of several so-called enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategies used to prolong the productive lifespan of oilfields and increase output, underpins around five percent of U.S. oil output, or about 450,000 barrels per day, according to energy consultancy Advanced Resources International. 
EOR can help firms to produce between 30 percent and 60 percent of all the oil held in a reservoir. That's far more than the 10 percent usually recovered from initial traditional drilling, according to the Department of Energy.
The existing credit has provided a financial lift for Occidental,  Denbury Resources Inc  (N:DNR) and oil producers with ready access to the gas.  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) also use the technique on some of their oil fields. None detail their tax savings from the credit, but since the it was first offered in 2008, companies have collected at least $350 million in the credits, according to Internal Revenue Service figures. 
In Hobbs, Occidental not only kept a 200-person workforce intact during the oil-price downturn - when tens of thousands of workers were laid off in the shale patch - it also invested $250 million to expand operations during that period, according to its public filings.
That meant Hobbs and nearby Seminole, Texas, where  Hess Corp  (N:HES) has its own carbon dioxide injection facility, didn't suffer the extreme financial pain felt by shale towns, such as Williston, North Dakota, and other shale producing communities in 2015 and 2016.
""Oxy's investment in the carbon project was a huge economic boost to our area,"" Grassham said. 
Some of the carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, comes from naturally occurring reservoirs that are a low-cost source for Occidental. Others get the gas piped from power plants that burn coal. Power companies hope the technique can help them avoid higher carbon emissions.
The company spends about $18 to $25 per barrel to collect oil from its enhanced oil recovery operations. In contrast, its shale-focused well costs are lower - $16 to $19 per barrel. But because EOR wells pump consistently for decades, their value to the company over time exceeds shale wells, whose production quickly tapers off.
Across Texas and New Mexico, Occidental runs one of the world's largest fleet of enhanced oil recovery projects, injecting 2 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide each day into wells that first produced oil nearly a century ago. 
""We had a very large, stable carbon dioxide EOR business in our portfolio during the downturn,"" said Jody Elliott, president of Occidental's American operations. ""That helped."" 
Partly because of its carbon facilities, Occidental was able to raise its dividend during the downturn. Today, executives are using the profits from the carbon business to grow its shale business across the Permian, the largest acreage holding in the region.
""These two businesses play very well off of each other,"" Elliott said. 
TAX CHANGE?
Congress is expected this summer to debate extending an existing tax credit that could pave way for wider use. The proposed Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Act would boost the credit to $35 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, up from $10 per ton today.
The legislation failed to move forward during last year's heated presidential campaign, but supporters say it will be reintroduced soon. ""We want to make sure that we show a strong commitment so we continue to develop these technologies,"" said North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat and the bill's lead sponsor.
Electricity generator  NRG Energy Inc  (N:NRG) earlier this year opened a $1.04 billion carbon capture facility at a Texas coal-fired power plant, using its carbon dioxide emissions to extract crude from a 1930s-era oilfield.
Expanding the credit could, supporters hope, encourage more coal-fired power plants to follow NRG's lead by capturing and selling carbon to oil producers. Most oilfields are not located near carbon dioxide supplies, so the tax credit also could spur the build-out of carbon pipelines. 
Environmentalists, including the Sierra Club, like the process because it traps carbon underground, preventing it from contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.
""You'll put more carbon in the ground than oil that is produced,"" said Vello Kuuskraa, president of consultancy Advanced Resources International, which studies enhanced oil recovery and carbon storage.
Oxy is considering investing another $550 million in its Hobbs operation in the next several years to further expand its carbon facilities.

""During all these oil industry downturns, those carbon wells keep people working,"" said Grassham.

On Sunday, U.K. police said they arrested 12 people in east London in connection with the attack. Islamic State has claimed responsibility.
The attack came days ahead of Thursday's U.K. election, in which polls show British Prime Minister Theresa May's lead over the opposition Labour Party has narrowed but is still intact.
Gold is often seen as an alternative currency in times of global economic uncertainty and a refuge from financial risk.

The coordinated move dramatically escalates a dispute over Qatar's support of the Muslim Brotherhood, the world's oldest Islamist movement, and adds accusations that Doha even backs the agenda of regional arch-rival Iran.
Market participants are sensitive to Middle East tensions because they worry about supply disruptions from the region. However, the latest developments do not appear to have a direct impact on oil production and exports from the region.
Concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand pressured crude prices.
Oil suffered its largest weekly loss in a month last week, dropping more than 4%, amid growing concern over rising shale production in the U.S.
Data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed on Friday that U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 20th week in a row, the longest such streak on record, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The U.S. rig count rose by 11 to 733, extending a year-long drilling recovery to the highest level since April 2015.
The increase in U.S. drilling activity and shale production has mostly offset efforts by OPEC and other producers to cut output in a move to prop up the market.
Last month, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.

1356,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2017 06:21AM ET</span>","Canada beats U.S. in pork sales to China - feet, elbows and all","By Rod Nickel, Michael Hirtzer and Dominique Patton
WINNIPEG/CHICAGO/BEIJING (Reuters) - Canada has overtaken the United States as the top North American supplier of pork to China as farmers and meat packers in both nations battle for lucrative shares of the biggest global market.
Canada's pork sales to China, after a sharp rise last year, exceeded those of the United States in the first quarter of 2017. That's only happened a handful of times in two decades, according to U.S. and Canadian government data.
Rising affluence is driving China's voracious appetite for pork, including parts of the pig - feet, elbows, innards - which command little value in most countries. At the same time, tightened environmental standards in China have forced farm closures and boosted demand for cheaper imports.
That's a bonanza for Canadian farmers, who have almost completely removed the growth drug ractopamine from their pigs' diet - largely because it is banned in China, which consumes half the world's pork.
U.S. exports to China, by contrast, are limited because only about half of the nation's herd has been weaned off the drug, according to U.S. hog producers, meat packers and animal feed dealers.
But major U.S.-based firms are now moving to produce more ractopamine-free hogs - including the three biggest pork producers, Smithfield Foods [SFII.UL]; Seaboard Foods, a division of  Seaboard Corp  (A:SEB); and Triumph Foods, a hog farmer cooperative.
The ascension of Canada's pork exports underscores the power of the gargantuan Chinese market to influence agricultural practices and profits in supplier countries worldwide.
As recently as 2013, annual U.S. pork sales to China, some 333,000 tonnes, more than doubled Canada's shipments of 161,000 tonnes.
That's the same year Canada's hog industry started to remove ractopamine, best known as Eli Lilly & Co (N:LLY) product Paylean.
In the first quarter of this year, Canada shipped nearly 93,000 tonnes of pork to China, on pace to hit 372,000 tonnes annually. That eclipsed the 87,500 tonnes that the United States shipped, according to data from both governments.
For a graphic on United States and Canada pork sales to China, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2r80PeW
The European Union, which has long banned ractopamine, is China's top foreign pork supplier, sending 393,365 tonnes there in the first quarter.
Chinese authorities banned the use of ractopamine in livestock in 2002. They say meat raised with the drug can cause nausea and diarrhea in people and be life-threatening to sufferers of heart disease.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, however, did not see the same dangers when it approved ractopamine in 1999, concluding that it would ""not have a significant impact on the human environment.""
The FDA's stance has drawn some criticism, including a 2014 lawsuit by environmental groups alleging the agency has not fully examined the drug's impact. The suit was later dismissed on technical grounds but is being appealed.
Hog farmer and rancher groups defend ractopamine use, saying it allows them to grow livestock more efficiently, with less feed, said Dave Warner, spokesman for National Pork Producers Council. Canadian health authorities also allow consumption of pork from hogs raised with the drug.
SELLING ELBOWS ONLINE
The China market is so lucrative that Canada's HyLife started selling pork online directly to Chinese consumers last year. 
The small Manitoba processor hawks pig feet and elbows on e-commerce site JD.com Inc (O:JD), a competitor of  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA).
""They're big online buyers,"" said Claude Vielfaure, HyLife's chief operating officer. ""You try to move your pork all kinds of ways.""
Rising Chinese pork demand has driven up prices for by-products including pigs' feet, kidneys and livers.
Pigs feet sell for more than C$2.50 ($1.85) per kilogram - about double their value two years ago, said Richard Davies, executive vice-president of sales and marketing at Olymel, one of Canada's biggest pork packers.
Selling by-products can squeeze another $10 per pig from a carcass that otherwise earns packers about $180, said Ray Price, president of Alberta-based processor Sunterra Meats.
China is the biggest byproduct market, followed by Taiwan and Philippines.
Stewed pigs feet with white beans is a famous dish from Sichuan province, one of China’s culinary capitals, while blood sausage, made from intestines and cooked with pickled vegetables, is a traditional winter dish in the northeast.
Chinese consumers enjoy the strong flavor of offal - internal organs and entrails. In Beijing, stir-fried pig’s liver with vegetables is common on dinner tables and known for its nutritional value.
In all, China consumed 55 million tonnes of pork last year. Although that is the lowest total in four years, imports are rising fast because millions of China’s small-scale farmers have left the pork business in recent years because of falling prices and rising environmental standards.
The government forced thousands of farms to close because of severe water pollution.
China became Quebec-based Olymel's biggest export market last year, vaulting over the United States and Japan. It plans to open a sales office there as early as next year.
""Just a tweak in that market can change the game for anyone in the world,"" Davies said.
GETTING PIGS OFF DRUGS
U.S. pork producers have moved more slowly than their Canadian competitors to raise ractopamine-free pigs, primarily because the United States is the world's third-biggest domestic market for pork.
 Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) and  Hormel Foods Corp  (N:HRL) continue to process hogs that were fed ractopamine in part because they do not raise their own pigs.
Hormel's hog supply ""comes from more than 500 family farms,"" a Hormel spokesman said, many of which use the growth drug.
U.S. firms can also send pork from ractopamine-fed hogs to Mexico and Japan, the top U.S. pork export markets.
But many U.S.-based suppliers are nonetheless scrambling to take advantage of Chinese demand for ractopamine-free pork.
Smithfield - the world's biggest pork producer and a subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed WH Group (HK:0288) - has raised most of its hogs without the drug for more than two years, a spokeswoman said. As the top exporter of pork to China, Smithfield firm shipped 300,000 tonnes there from the United States and Europe last year.
The second- and third-biggest U.S. pork producers - Seaboard and Triumph - are jointly opening a pork processing plant next month in Sioux City, Iowa, where nearly all hogs slaughtered will be ractopamine-free, according to local hog producers and animal feed mills.
Building dedicated ractopamine-free pork plants allows processors to limit risk of China rejecting shipments that contain trace amounts of the drug.
Seaboard declined to comment about ractopamine. Triumph did not respond to requests for comment.
The Cooperative Farmers Elevator in Ocheydan, Iowa, is constructing a new feed mill that by 2018 will produce only ractopamine-free animal feed.
""It was requested from some of the customers we deal with,"" said Steve Peterson, the cooperative's vice-president of feed. ""The one that is pushing the hardest is Seaboard.""
U.S. hog producer Prestage Farms also is planning a new Iowa slaughterhouse for as many as 10,000 ractopamine-free hogs annually by 2018, president Ron Prestage told Reuters.
With the U.S. hogs in record supply, foreign demand is essential to profits, Prestage said.
""When we have plentiful hogs, as we do today, packers prefer not to have ractopamine,"" Prestage said. ""They want to be able to export as much product as they can.""

Oil suffered its largest weekly loss in a month last week, dropping more than 4%, amid growing concern over rising shale production in the U.S.
Data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed on Friday that U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 20th week in a row, the longest such streak on record, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The U.S. rig count rose by 11 to 733, extending a year-long drilling recovery to the highest level since April 2015.
The increase in U.S. drilling activity and shale production has mostly offset efforts by OPEC and other producers to cut output in a move to prop up the market.
Last month, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million barrels per day in supply until March 2018.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2017 02:40PM ET</span>","Anger in Mexican sugar cane fields, harbinger of NAFTA risks","By Adriana Barrera
ZACATEPEC, Mexico (Reuters) - Anger is simmering across a lush swathe of Mexico among poor sugar cane farmers who face a major blow from trade talks in Washington on Monday, in an ominous preview of the high-stakes re-negotiation of the NAFTA agreement set to begin in August. 
The United States and Mexico have until Monday to modify a 2014 agreement that set quotas and a price floor on Mexican sugar. U.S. sugar refiners say Mexico's exports are subsidized, undercutting their business and that the agreement failed to stop dumping.
A new deal could significantly reduce access to the lucrative U.S. market for some 190,000 Mexican farmers, a fifth of whose sugar last year was sold to U.S. buyers, and risks triggering tit-for-tat tariffs that could hurt U.S. corn. 
With 2.4 million people estimated to earn livelihoods from sugar across 15 states in Mexico, the spat may also serve as an example of the political minefield the government will face in a broader trade talks later this year that could affect jobs in the thriving manufacturing sector.
U.S. President Donald Trump triggered the 90-day start to NAFTA re-negotiations last month, following up on his longstanding criticism of the 23-year-old free trade pact between the United States, Mexico and Canada, arguing it is unfair to American workers and must be reworked.
Feeling used by the government, Mexican cane farmers are fuming, further eroding already flagging support for Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, ahead of a 2018 presidential vote, just as a leftist nationalist is making inroads into its traditional bastions.
Cane growers have been strong supporters of the PRI and its forefathers since revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata helped sweep away the hacienda system in the early 20th century, replacing it with small holdings and land collectives.
But the farmers now accuse the government of bowing to U.S. pressure. On Friday the cane growers association, traditionally a staunch PRI ally, published a rare open letter in national newspapers accusing the government of using sugar as a ""bargaining chip"" in the wider trade negotiations.
""We don't believe anything the PRI says anymore. We just don't,"" said Narciso Hernandez, a 74-year-old farmer standing beside a field of swaying cane in Zacatepec, a village about 80 miles (130 km) south of the Mexican capital.
Corruption scandals, lackluster economic growth and surging violence have also cratered the popularity of President Enrique Pena Nieto and the once-dominant PRI ahead of elections in four states on Sunday.
The marquee contest is a governor's race in the country's most populous state that has always been governed by the PRI but could be captured by the hand-picked candidate of leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the early presidential front-runner who has a strong following among poor Mexicans.
DEEP CUTS
Cane farmers fear loss of income if an impasse leads to tariffs as high as 80 percent on some sugar exports, or a deal leads to a deep cut in the amount of high value refined sugar exported to the United States. Mills pay for cane according to a formula based on the market value of sugar.
Under NAFTA, Mexico and the United States gradually liberalized sugar trade and by 2008 it was tariff-free.
However, since late 2014 the trade has been governed by a so-called suspension agreement that sets minimum prices and export quotas on Mexican producers, after the U.S. threatened to impose stiff antidumping and antisubsidy duties.
U.S. negotiators are seeking to reduce volumes of refined Mexican sugar from 53 percent to as low as 15 percent of the annual export quota, Mexican industry sources say, which would push Mexican producers toward lower-value raw sugar sales.
In the same vein, U.S. industry is also seeking to lower Mexican sugar's polarity, a measure of quality, from 99.5 percent to 99.2 percent.
""All companies want to reach the final consumer because that's where you get the best price. So it's only fair that (Mexican) companies also sell their sugar to final consumers,” said Pedro Ocampo, head of the Zacatepec cane farmer union.
U.S. demand reached some 12 million tonnes of refined sugar last year, and prices for raw sugar average about 6 cents per pound, the highest price anywhere in the world.
Last year, Mexico exported 1.13 million tonnes to the United States, 93 percent of Mexico's sugar exports, according to the economy ministry.
This year, about 870,700 tonnes were expected to be sold to U.S. buyers. 
Stemming from a recent case before the World Trade Organization, Mexico could respond to U.S. tariffs with $163 million in sanctions on U.S. fructose exports that currently have unfettered access to the Mexican market. 
According to the U.S. Corn Refiners Association, representing manufacturers including Archer Daniels Midland Co and Cargill Inc., about a third of U.S. fructose exports would be affected.

""If we meet our sugar import needs from elsewhere, we don't gain any jobs,"" said John Bode, head of the association. ""But if we lose our corn syrup market in Mexico, that's irreplaceable.""

State oil giant Saudi Aramco said on Sunday it raised the July price for its Arab Light grade for Asian customers by $0.60 a barrel versus June to a discount of $0.25 a barrel to the Oman/Dubai average.
The hike was bigger than anticipated by Asian refiners and traders surveyed by Reuters. Saudi Aramco was expected to increase the price of its flagship Arab Light crude by 20-50 cents a barrel in July, as the contango in Middle East crude benchmarks narrowed last month.
A contango market refers to prompt prices that are lower than those in future months, while narrowing contango signals increased demand or tightening supply.
Aramco also raised its Arab Light OSP to Northwest Europe by 35 cents a barrel for July from the previous month to a discount of $3.10 a barrel to the ICE Brent Settlement.
The Arab Light OSP to the United States was set at a premium of $1.10 a barrel to the Argus Sour Crude Index (ASCI) for July, up $0.50 a barrel from the previous month.
OPEC, Russia and other oil producers agreed on May 25 to extend cuts in oil output by nine months to March 2018 as they battle a global glut of crude after seeing prices halve and revenues drop sharply in the past three years.
Saudi crude OSPs set the trend for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi prices, affecting more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude bound for Asia.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. considers possible sanctions against Venezuela oil sector - officials,"By Girish Gupta and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering possible sanctions on Venezuela’s vital energy sector, including state oil company PDVSA, senior White House officials said, in what would be a major escalation of U.S. efforts to pressure the country’s embattled leftist government amid a crackdown on the opposition.
The idea of striking at the core of Venezuela’s economy, which relies on oil for some 95 percent of export revenues, has been discussed at high levels of the administration as part of a wide-ranging review of U.S. options, but officials said it remains under debate and action is not imminent.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the United States could hit PDVSA as part of a “sectoral” sanctions package that would take aim at the OPEC nation’s entire energy industry for the first time.
But they made clear that the administration is moving cautiously, mindful that if such an unprecedented step is taken it could deepen the country’s economic and social crisis, in which millions suffer food shortages and soaring inflation. Two months of anti-government unrest has left more than 60 people dead.
Another complicating factor would be the potential impact on oil shipments to the United States, for which Venezuela is the third largest oil supplier after Canada and Saudi Arabia. It accounted for 8 percent of U.S. oil imports in March, according to U.S. government figures.
“It’s being considered,” one of the officials told Reuters, saying aides to President Donald Trump have been tasked to have a recommendation on oil sector sanctions ready if needed.
“I don’t think we’re at a point to make a decision on it. But all options are on the table. We want to see the bad actors held to account.”
The U.S. deliberations on new sanctions come against the backdrop of the worst protests faced yet by socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who critics accuse of human rights abuses in a clampdown on the opposition. 
Since Trump took office in January, he has stepped up targeted sanctions on Venezuela, including on the vice president, the chief judge and seven other Supreme Court justices. He has pressed the Organization of American States to do more to help resolve the crisis.
While Trump has taken a more active approach to Venezuela than his predecessor Barack Obama, he has so far stopped short of drastic economic moves that could hurt the Venezuelan people and give Maduro ammunition to accuse Washington of meddling.
The two administration officials said the United States is also prepared to impose further sanctions on senior officials it accuses of corruption, drug trafficking ties and involvement in what critics see as a campaign of political repression aimed at consolidating Maduro’s rule.
But broad measures against the country’s vital oil sector – for which the United States is the biggest customer - would significantly ratchet up Washington’s response. The United States has imposed sectoral sanctions against Russia’s energy, banking and defense industries over Moscow’s involvement in Ukraine’s separatist conflict.
The officials declined to specify the mechanisms under consideration and said the timing of any decision would depend heavily on developments on the ground in Venezuela.
Possibilities could include a blanket ban on Venezuelan oil imports and preventing PDVSA from trading and doing business in the United States, which would have a severe impact on PDVSA's U.S. refining subsidiary Citgo.
A more modest approach, however, could be to bar PDVSA only from bidding on U.S. government contracts, as the Obama administration did in 2011 to punish the company for doing business with Iran. Those limited sanctions were rolled back after the 2015 international nuclear deal with Tehran.
The Venezuelan government and PDVSA did not respond to requests for comment.
    
'WE HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY'
The grounds for possibly sanctioning PDVSA would  be “to claim that they’re corrupt, for example, or that they’re abusers of human rights indirectly,” said one of the officials, without giving further details.
“That’s enough. We have the legal authority to do that right now if we like,” the official said.
PDVSA has long been under scrutiny. In perhaps the most damning case to date, U.S. authorities in 2015 arrested two Venezuelan oil magnates alleging they took part in a billion-dollar conspiracy to pay bribes to secure PDVSA contracts. Both men pleaded guilty. 
U.S. officials recognize, however, that oil sanctions on Venezuela could exacerbate the suffering of the Venezuelan people without any guarantee of success against Maduro, who accuses Washington and Venezuelan opposition of fomenting an attempted coup.
Given the potential for regional spillover, any decision on oil sanctions would require consultation with Venezuela’s neighbors, the officials said.
“The concern we have is that it will be a very serious escalation,” one official said. “We’d have to be prepared to deal with the humanitarian consequences of essentially collapsing the  government.”
Maduro’s government has been hit hard by its heavy reliance on oil, whose price has collapsed in recent years, and is accused by the opposition of severely mismanaging the economy.
Nevertheless, the U.S. officials said the Venezuela policy review was moving forward.

“Our function is to be ready in the event something escalates in the country and the president and secretary of state and (U.S. national security adviser) H.R. McMaster turn to us and say ‘OK, what do you got?’ It’s not like we’re going to do this tomorrow, but we are responsible for being prepared,” one official said.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other nations led by Russia agreed last week to extend a deal to limit global oil output for a further nine months, until March 2018.
A committee set up to monitor the cuts is set to meet in Russia in July. Falih, who has been on a visit to Russia this week, said it would then be able to judge if the cuts had been effective in supporting oil prices which have halved in the last three years on the back of a global oversupply glut.
""We have to see the market and I think by the end of June, in July we will see that the action we have taken has a big impact,"" TASS quoted him as saying. ""If for some reason we need to do more, we will consider doing more including ... bigger cuts.""
""Nothing is off the table but today nothing is on the table either. We made a deal,"" he added.
Russia and Saudi Arabia have recently reached a detente in a long-running rivalry that has seen the world's two biggest oil exporters spearhead the global pact to cut output.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for July delivery fell 70 cents to settle at $47.66 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent dipped by 47 cents to trade at $50.16 a barrel.
The selloff in oil prices sustained during the later hours of the U.S. session yesterday, continued on Friday, as investors mulled over the prospect of a ramp-up in U.S. output, after Trump announced that the U.S. is withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
The Paris Agreement laid out a framework for countries to adopt clean energy and phase out fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes on Friday reported its weekly count of oil rigs rose by 11 to a total 733. It was the 20th straight weekly increase in the number of active U.S. oil rigs.
Sentiment on oil has turned soar, despite data from the Energy Information Administration on Thursday, showing that inventories of US crude fell for an eighth-straight week in the week ended May 19, as investors continued to worry about the impact rising U.S. oil production could have on Opec and its allies’ efforts to reduce the glut in global inventories.
U.S crude production rose nearly 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) last week from year-earlier levels.
Opec and non-Opec members last week agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude fell more than 1 percent on Friday, heading for a second straight week of losses, on worries that U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from an international climate accord will spur further domestic production and contribute to a persistent global oversupply.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were down 61 cents at $50.02 per barrel by 2:00 p.m. (1800 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) futures fell 62 cents to $47.74 per barrel.
Both contracts were on track for a weekly loss of about 4 percent.
Market analysts are troubled by a growth in U.S. crude production that is straining efforts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce global oversupply. 
U.S. drillers this week added 11 rigs, in a record stretch of 20 straight weeks of additions, data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed. [RIG/U] 
Trump's withdrawal from the Paris agreement, the landmark 2015 global pact to fight climate change, drew condemnation from Washington's allies and many in the energy industry - and sparked fears that U.S. oil production could expand more rapidly than it is currently.
“Trump seems to be removing any barriers he can find that would obstruct growth of crude oil or natural gas,” said Stewart Glickman, energy equity analyst at CFRA in New York.
""It’s kind of ironic because by doing that you’re encouraging more volumes to come out of the ground.""
U.S. crude production last week was up by nearly 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) from year-earlier levels and hit 9.34 million bpd, its highest since August 2015.[EIA/S] 
U.S. output is expected to keep rising, as the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts production of about 10 million bpd next year. 
Igor Sechin, chief of Russia's largest oil producer, Rosneft, said U.S. producers could add up to 1.5 million bpd to world oil output next year.
Last week OPEC and some non-OPEC producers extended a deal to cut 1.8 million bpd in supply until March 2018. Oil prices are down around 10 percent since the extension, and OPEC officials have since suggested they may deepen the cuts.

Investors have been edgy due to the slow decline in inventories worldwide. U.S. inventories, however, fell 6.4 million barrels last week, their eighth straight weekly drawdown. ""That's relatively higher than the average draws we’ve seen, so you would have thought that crude would have fared a little better,"" said CFRA's Glickman.

Gold futures for June delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $9.94 or 0.79%, to $1,276.92 a troy ounce.
Gold hit a session high of $1,278.95 just shy of six-week highs, as an unexpected dip in U.S. job growth, fuelled concerns about the strength of the U.S. economy, increasing demand for gold, which is traditionally used as a safe haven against economic uncertainty and volatility.
The U.S. economy added 138,000 jobs in May, well below forecasts of 185,000 new jobs while the unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low of 4.3%, the Labor Department said on Friday.
Gains in gold were capped, however, as the soft headline jobs number did little to derail expectations that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would hike its benchmark rate in June.
According to investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool nearly 90% of traders expect the Fed to hike its benchmark rate in June from 0.75-1% to 1-1.25%.

The consensus forecast is that the data will show jobs growth of 185,000 in May, following an increase of 211,000 in the previous month, while the unemployment rate is forecast to hold steady at 4.4%, its lowest level since 2007.
Average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.2% from April after gaining 0.3% a month earlier, while the annualized rate is estimated to rise to 2.6%, from the prior 2.5%.
Most experts believe that only a truly “catastrophic” report would stop the Fed from raising rates in two weeks’ time, while markets put the odds at around 87%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

1373,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2017 06:36AM ET</span>",Pennsylvania pipeline fight could upend international oil flows,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Refiners from the Midwest United States are fighting for access to a vital Pennsylvania pipeline – a move that could cripple their East Coast competitors and redraw the map for international flows of crude and fuel into coveted coastal markets.
The regulatory dispute centers on a proposal by pipeline operator Buckeye Partners’ to that state's Public Utilities Commission. The plan would reverse the flow of fuels on a section of Buckeye’s 350-mile Laurel Pipeline, which currently flows from the East Coast to Pittsburgh.
Because pipelines only flow in one direction, the change would effectively block five East Coast refineries from serving Pittsburgh – with Midwest refiners picking up their market share.
The commission will decide on whether to allow Buckeye to reverse the flow from Pittsburgh, near the state’s western border, to Altoona, a small city about a hundred miles to the east.
For a map detailing the proposal, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2qk72Ep
Initially, such a reversal would cost East Coast refiners about $10 million annually, according to a study gasoline marketer Gulf Operating commissioned to include in its objections to the Buckeye proposal. Piping gasoline to Pittsburgh yields some of their highest per-barrel profits.
But opponents, including East Coast refiners and some state lawmakers, are far more worried that such a decision would presage a reversal of the entire pipeline. That would take Midwest fuels all the way to Philadelphia on the state's eastern border, where it connects to distribution networks serving the entire eastern seaboard.
For Buckeye, the move represents a bet that surging Midwest refiners will be better customers - keeping its pipeline full to capacity - than their struggling East Coast counterparts.
The stakes are much higher for the refiners involved. Midwest refiners could gain a huge market opportunity to pipe fuels into the East Coast, the largest U.S. gasoline market.
Their products could also make their way to the New York Harbor, a major gasoline trading hub, where they would likely displace imports from Europe that currently account for about 23 percent of the fuel consumed in the region.
For East Coast refiners, access to the Laurel pipeline is a matter of survival.
""I have terrible anxiety, to say the least, when I see this proposal,"" said Anthony Gallagher, business manager for the local Philadelphia pipefitters union, speaking at a recent hearing on the proposal in Harrisburg, the state’s capital. “It will totally choke off these refiners, and they will have to start laying people off. Then, they will shut down.”
Buckeye’s proposal has also drawn formal objections from state lawmakers and two refiners from the Philadelphia region, Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) and Monroe Energy, a subsidiary of Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL). Together, they employ about 1,000 people.
The two other firms operating East Coast refineries - PBF Energy and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) - also own Midwest refineries, which gives them conflicting economic interests in the outcome.
PBF Energy and Phillips 66 did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment, and neither has filed comments with the commission.
PES and Monroe declined to comment to Reuters but filed formal written objections to the commission.
Monroe argued that approving Buckeye’s plan would require East Coast refiners to “reduce output or sell petroleum products at drastically reduced prices” into an already oversupplied market.
A delegation of Philadelphia-area lawmakers sent a letter warning the commission of “devastating economic effects.”
Buckeye’s attorney David MacGregor countered that consumers will reap the economic benefits.
Midwest refiners, he said at a recent commission hearing, could lower gas prices throughout Pennsylvania and lessen the region’s reliance on imported oil.
A decision on the reversal is not likely until the fall and rests with the five-member state board. The five board members declined to comment through a commission spokeswoman.
SURVIVAL STRUGGLE
East Coast refiners have already closed plants because of their precarious competitive position.
The region's refineries currently meet about one-fifth of gasoline demand on the East Coast, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The rest comes from Gulf Coast refiners, via the Colonial and Plantation pipelines, and imports from Europe and Canada.
Currently, Pittsburgh can access fuels from either the Midwest – through other pipelines owned by Buckeye - or the East Coast, whichever is cheaper at the time.
Losing that market would be a blow to the East Coast plants, but the impact would be far more dire if Buckeye ultimately seeks to reverse the flow of the Laurel line all the way to Philadelphia.
That’s why both Philadelphia refineries and other opponents have argued that regulators must consider Buckeye's broader intent - a possible reversal of flows along the entire pipeline - in deciding the current dispute over reversing a smaller section. 
""It is imperative that there be a full investigation” of Buckeye’s long-term plans, Philadelphia Energy Solutions argued in a filing to the commission.
In an interview with Reuters, a Houston-based Buckeye executive would not rule out seeking future reversals that would extend Midwest refiners’ pipeline access to Philadelphia.
“We go where the market wants us to go,” said Bill Hollis, a Buckeye senior vice president.
THE COMPETITIVE EDGE: CHEAP CANADIAN CRUDE
The market is tilting in favor of Midwest refiners mostly because they can access cheaper crude than their East Coast counterparts.
Midwest refiners including Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and Husky Energy and Phillips 66 have added nearly a half-million barrels of daily refining capacity in the last ten years, tailoring their systems to run crude out of Canada and North Dakota’s Bakken shale oil field.
Today, Midwest refiners process 80 percent of the crude that the U.S. imports from Canada, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), and crude from Western Canada can be purchased for $14 a barrel less than benchmark U.S. crude.
Midwest refiners can access Canada's crude via pipeline; East Coast refiners have to pay more to get it shipped on boats or trains.
Adding to their competitive advantage, Midwest refiners will soon be able to tap Bakken crude through the nearly completed Dakota Access Pipeline.
The East Coast refiners import most of the oil they turn into gasoline and diesel from West Africa and South America, and the region must import gasoline from Europe and Canada to meet local demand.
Buckeye’s proposal is a bet on the future of the Midwest refineries - and against those on the East Coast, Hollis said.

“You don’t have to have 35 years in the industry to know where the trend is going,"" he said.

Elsewhere, Brent oil for August delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London slumped $1.47, or 2.9%, to $49.16 a barrel.
The London barrel lost the $50 per barrel level, while U.S. crude broke below $48 and struggled to hold the $47 level as worries that Trump's decision to abandon the global climate pact could spark even more crude drilling in the United States.
While waiting for the latest update later on Friday, data from Baker Hughes already showed last week that U.S. drillers had added rigs for the 19th week in a row, the second-longest such streak on record, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The U.S. rig count rose by 2 to 722, extending an 11-month drilling recovery to the highest level since April 2015.
The steady increase caused concern that it would thwart efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producing countries to control the global supply glut. 
At last week's meeting in Vienna, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, agreed to extend supply cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day until the end of the first quarter of 2018.
While OPEC's move had been widely expected, some oil market investors had hoped producers would agree to longer or deeper cuts to drain a global glut of crude supplies.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord.
In fact, a Reuters survey released Wednesday showed that OPEC oil output rose in May, the first monthly increase this year as higher supply from two OPEC states exempt from a production-cutting deal, Nigeria and Libya, offset improved compliance with the accord by others.
The cartel will not hold another official meeting until next November, dampening chances for its members to reach a deeper agreement to hamper the effect on global supply of increased U.S. production.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown said on Thursday he will discuss merging carbon trading markets in his state and China when he travels to Asia later this week, a sign of the governor's ambition to influence global climate change policy.
Brown discussed his plans in a telephone interview after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he would withdraw the United States from the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord, a global agreement to fight climate change. The move fulfilled a major Trump campaign pledge, but drew condemnation from U.S. allies and business leaders.
Brown, who vigorously opposes the United States' withdrawal from the pact, lambasted Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris accord as ""insane.""
He has been working with states and provinces around the world to set voluntary agreements to address global warming. The governor heads to China on Friday for meetings focused on climate change.
California has the largest carbon trading system in the United States and has frequently hosted officials from China, which has launched seven pilot regional trading schemes. 
China also plans to roll out a nationwide market later this year, but the launch faces possible delays amid unreliable data and other regulatory problems, according to a government researcher.
California's system, which is known as ""cap and trade,"" is already linked to Canada's Quebec market. 
""I think that is a heavy lift to include Chinese provinces, but we are definitely taking that possibility very seriously,"" Brown said.
""We want to make sure it has full integrity and know exactly what's going on. And we can’t say that today,"" he said. ""Maybe we don’t put it right in the same cap-and-trade regime, maybe some parallel regime,"" he added. ""I am going to discuss that with the highest officials in China this week.""
Brown will be meeting regional and national officials over the course of a week-long trip to China and will host a clean energy forum.

Trump has also sought to engage China, hosting President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in April. Critics say that the U.S. exit from the Paris accord sets up China to take on a higher-profile global role.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were mixed on Thursday, with Brent crude down on concerns that key producers were still adding to the global crude glut but U.S. crude up slightly after a larger-than-expected domestic inventory drawdown.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) settled up 4 cents at $48.36 a barrel, while Brent (LCOc1) ended down 13 cents at $50.63. After settlement, both benchmarks fell, failing to sustain the lift from the morning news of declining U.S. crude and gasoline stocks.
""Eight straight weeks of declining crude and the market is barely up,"" said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “The market is telling us that unless we have significant inventory draws, the idea that we’re going to have stronger prices doesn’t look to be realistic.”
Weekly data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed crude inventories dropped 6.4 million barrels, exceeding the 4.4 million-barrel drop forecast. Gasoline inventories also dropped sharply ahead of the start of the summer driving season, the EIA said. [EIA/S]
On Wednesday, a Reuters survey found output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose in May, the first monthly increase this year, as higher supply from two states exempt from a production-cutting deal, Nigeria and Libya, offset improved compliance with the accord by others..
U.S. production increased, and the expectation is that ongoing activity in U.S. shale will continue to boost output, offsetting OPEC efforts. 
OPEC and other producers, including Russia, have agreed to restrict output by 1.8 million bpd to drain stockpiles that are close to record highs in many parts of the world.
U.S. production is closing in on levels from top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. It hit 9.34 million bpd last week, highest since August 2015. 
In Libya, output has recovered to 827,000 bpd after technical problems were resolved at the Sharara field.
On Thursday OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said to an economic forum in Russia that it was too early to say when production caps could be imposed on Libya and Nigeria as they have a lot of issues to solve.
The group, however, last week discussed cutting output by a further 1 to 1.5 percent, and could revisit the proposal should inventories remain high and continue to weigh on prices, sources said.

Russia, which has cut production by 300,000 bpd under the deal, could increase production next year to as much as 11.07 million bpd, the country's deputy energy minister told Reuters.

1381,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 01, 2017 02:52PM ET</span>",Crude futures rebound as US crude inventories drop for 8th straight week,"Investing.com – Crude futures settled higher, after data on Thursday showed that supplies of U.S. crude fell more than expected and were down for the eighth consecutive week, easing concerns that rising US oil output would undermine Opec and its allies’ efforts to curb supply.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for June delivery rose 4 cents to settle at $48.36 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent dipped by 21 cents to trade at $50.55 a barrel.
Crude futures soared to a high of $49.17 earlier in the session but came under pressure, as the bigger than expected draw in U.S. crude inventories was offset by an announcement from President Donald Trump that the U.S. is withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
Inventories of US crude fell by roughly 6.4m barrels in the week ended May 19, according to the Energy Information Administration. That confounded expectations of draw of around 2.5m barrels.
Gasoline inventories, one of the products the crude is refined into, dropped by 2.86m barrels against expectations for a draw of close to 1.1 million barrels while distillate stockpiles unexpectedly rose by 394,000 barrels, compared to expectations of a 755,000 decline.
The stronger draw than expected in gasoline inventories eased concerns of a slowdown in gasoline demand amid the start of the U.S. summer driving season, which is traditionally associated with heavier refining activity.
Crude futures snapped a four-day losing streak in the wake of investor skepticism concerning Opec and its allies’ decision to only extend, but no deepen, production cuts.
Opec and non-Opec members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March last week, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year, against expectations that the oil cartel was set to announce deeper production cuts."

Gold futures for June delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $5.42 or 0.43%, to $1,266.57 a troy ounce by 13:59 EDT.
Private employers added 253,000 jobs in May, according to payroll processor ADP, well above Wall Street expectations of a 185,000 rise.
In separate report, U.S. manufacturing activity ticked higher, hitting 53.5 in May, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday. Economists had expected a rise to 52.8.
A reading above 50 indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding; below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting.
Meanwhile, spending in the construction sector fell 1.4% for the month, the biggest drop in a year, and below forecasts of a 0.2% decline.
The private sector jobs report comes a day ahead of a key nonfarm payrolls report expected to show that the U.S. economy created 185,000 jobs last month. It is the final nonfarm payrolls report before the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets in June.
According to investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool nearly 90% of traders expect the Fed to hike its benchmark rate in June from 0.75-1% to 1-1.25%. 
Rising expectations of a June rate hike pushed the dollar and U.S. treasury yields to session highs, which weighed on the precious metal. 
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.28% to 97.15, while the U.S. 10-Year rose 1.17% to 2.224.
Gold is sensitive to moves higher in both bond yields and the U.S. dollar – A stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency while a rise in U.S. rates, lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
In other precious metals, silver futures fell 0.79% to $17.269 a troy ounce while platinum futures lost 1.87% to trade at $932.50.
Copper added 0.27% to $2.587, while natural gas dipped by 1.86% to $3.013."

Crude oil for July delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained 61 cents, or 1.26%, to trade at $48.93 a barrel by 11:10AM ET (15:10GMT) compared to $48.66 ahead of the report.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 6.428 million barrels in the week ended May 26. Market analysts' had expected a crude-stock draw of 2.517 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Wednesday reported a supply draw of 8.670 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 0.747 million barrels last week, the EIA said. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 509.9 million barrels as of last week, according to press release, which the EIA considered to be “in the upper half of the average range for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories decreased by 2.858 million barrels, compared to expectations for a draw of 1.091 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles rose by 0.394 million barrels, compared to forecasts for a decline of 0.755 million.
The report came out one day later than usual due to Monday's Memorial Day holiday.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for August delivery traded up 43 cents, or 0.85%, to $51.19 by 11:12AM ET (15:12GMT), compared to $50.95 before the release.
Meanwhile, Brent's premium to the WTI crude contract stood at $2.27 a barrel by 11:15AM ET (16:15GMT), compared to a gap of $2.44 by close of trade on Wednesday.
Oil prices traded more than 1% lower in May as the extension of output curbs by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producing countries announced last Thursday disappointed investors who had hoped for larger cuts.
At last week's meeting in Vienna, OPEC and some non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, agreed to extend supply cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day until the end of the first quarter of 2018.
While OPEC's move had been widely expected, some oil market investors had hoped producers would agree to longer or deeper cuts to drain a global glut of crude supplies.
The cartel next meets in November.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria.
In fact, a Reuters survey released Wednesday showed that OPEC oil output rose in May, the first monthly increase this year as higher supply from two OPEC states exempt from a production-cutting deal, Nigeria and Libya, offset improved compliance with the accord by others.
Meanwhile, a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output also worked to counteract the 1.8 million barrel per day production cut agreement.
Data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed on Friday that U.S. drillers the previous week had added rigs for the 19th week in a row, the second-longest such streak on record, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The U.S. rig count rose by 2 to 722, extending an 11-month drilling recovery to the highest level since April 2015.
Apart from supply, it will also be vital to keep an eye on global demand as the U.S. driving season kicks off."

PARIS (Reuters) - The loss of Britain's net contribution to the European Union farm budget after Brexit and the upcoming reform of EU agriculture policy will require tighter links between the bloc's two biggest farm powers, according to France's farming minister.
Newly appointed Jacques Mezard, 69, who traveled to Berlin on Monday, said he had agreed with his German counterpart Christian Schmidt to work closely together, notably on the consequences of Britain's departure from the 28-member bloc for the future of the EU's farm policy (CAP).
""The priority is to preserve the Common Agriculture Policy as a driver of European life"", Mezard told Reuters in an interview. ""And this wish seemed totally shared by the German minister.""
Current geopolitical uncertainties, notably in the United States, further increased the need for a strong cooperation at EU level, he said.
""What is happening on the international stage, be it Brexit, whether it is Western Europe's relations with President Trump ...has made a number of our European partners, mainly Germany, think about the need to have a European vision, to stick together, and to ensure that the Franco-German engine resumes functioning in full harmony,"" Mezard said.
Still, negotiations will be toughened by uncertainties about the final budget, with Brexit negotiations not expected to be over before 2019.

There are tens of billions of euros that Britain may owe the EU in widely varying estimates, while at the same time there is the prospect of the EU losing Britain's total net contribution to the bloc of around 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) per year.

1386,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2017 08:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: OPEC looked at extra 1-1.5 percent oil supply cut, could revive proposal","By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC discussed cutting its oil output by a further 1-1.5 percent when it met last week, three sources familiar with the matter said, and could revisit the proposal should inventories remain high and continue to weigh on prices.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-member producers ultimately decided at their May 25 meeting to extend their existing supply-cutting agreement for nine months, although oil ministers including Saudi Arabia's Khalid al-Falih confirmed deeper curbs had been debated.
One of the sources said the idea floated was to widen OPEC's supply cut by about 300,000 barrels per day (bpd). 
That would equate to a further curb of about 1 percent of April output of nearly 32 million bpd and bring OPEC's total pledged cut to 1.5 million bpd, from 1.2 million bpd.
""They wanted to do some scenarios and get around 300,000 bpd of extra cuts to be distributed among everyone,"" the source, who declined to be identified, said. ""But I think they decided to wait and see how the market will react first.""
The initial price reaction to OPEC's May 25 decision was one of disappointment that producers had not deepened their cuts. Brent crude fell 5 percent to below $52 a barrel and was trading near there on Thursday, half its level of mid-2014.
OPEC officials nonetheless hope an inventory glut will ease in the next few months as market fundamentals move closer to balance. OPEC is not scheduled to meet again to set policy until November.
""By the next meeting, if prices and the situation remain like this, they will have to do something ... Everyone will be on board (for more cuts) if prices remain like they are now,"" the source said, adding that he expected the market and prices to improve by the third quarter.
A second source familiar with the matter said ""everything is possible"", when asked whether the option of a deeper cut could be revived. 
A third source, an OPEC delegate, was skeptical that a larger cut would be agreed on by all parties, including non-OPEC producers. ""I doubt it,"" that source said. ""There was a proposal for a deeper cut, but it didn't work.""
A fourth source, also an OPEC delegate, was skeptical for the same reason.
""To ensure a proposal can be feasible, you need to see who can buy in,"" that delegate said. ""I believe the number of countries who can buy in will be few. However, continuing the current agreement is much more acceptable even for a longer period of time until the rebalancing is achieved.""
WHATEVER IT TAKES
OPEC, Russia and other producers agreed last year to cut production by 1.8 million bpd for six months starting on Jan. 1.
Oil prices have gained from the pact but stockpiles remain high and production from non-participating countries, including the United States, has been rising, keeping crude below the $60 that top exporter Saudi Arabia would like to see this year.
Riyadh is preparing to list around 5 percent of its national oil company Saudi Aramco in 2018 and wants higher oil prices ahead of the initial public offering (IPO) for a better valuation, industry and OPEC sources have told Reuters.
""I think the Saudis have a target oil price for the Aramco IPO,"" the first source said. Falih, however, said after OPEC's meeting that the IPO did not affect the decision to extend the duration of the supply cut.
A deeper cut, along with extending the curbs for various lengths of time, were among the scenarios reviewed by an OPEC panel, the Economic Commission Board, days before the OPEC ministerial meeting.
Falih, who currently holds the OPEC presidency, said after the May 25 meeting that keeping the existing cuts for another nine months was the best outcome.
On Wednesday in Moscow, Falih reiterated his country's position to do ""whatever it takes"" along with Russia to help stabilize the market, signaling an open-ended policy to reduce the inventory overhang.
OPEC has a self-imposed goal of bringing inventories in industrialized countries down from a record high of 3 billion barrels to their five-year average of 2.7 billion.

The next OPEC meeting is on Nov. 30 in Vienna. Another panel, the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, will convene in Russia in July and has a mandate to recommend adjusting the supply pact, if needed.

U.S. crude futures for July delivery were up 0.25% at $48.44 a barrel, off Wednesday’s three-week low of $47.74.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the July Brent were down 0.14% to $50.69 a barrel, off the previous session’s three-week trough of $50.24.
Trump said he would announce later on Thursday a decision on whether to keep the United States in a global pact to fight climate change, amid mounting speculation the U.S. President is preparing to pull out of the Paris agreement.
The commodity was also buoyed by a report by the American Petroleum Institute showing that crude inventories were down by 8.7 million barrels in the week to May 26, compared to expectations for a decrease of 2.5 million barrels.
Crude prices tumbled earlier in the week, after Libya's National Oil Corporation said on Monday that oil production is expected to rise to 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) this week.
The data added to concerns over a global supply glut as U.S. shale oil drilling continues to climb.
The concerns came amid continued uncertainty over whether the recent OPEC agreement to extend production cuts will actually manage to reduce global output.
OPEC and non-OPEC members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March last week, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year, against expectations that the oil cartel was set to announce deeper production cuts.
As part of the agreement, Nigeria and Libya will remain exempt from making cuts while Iran would be allowed to retain the right to increase production to the same reference level, around 3.797 million barrels a day, agreed in November last year."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A meeting between the two men who run Russia and Saudi Arabia's oil empires spoke volumes about the new relationship between the energy superpowers.
It was the first time that Rosneft boss Igor Sechin and Saudi Aramco chief Amin Nasser had held a formal, scheduled meeting - going beyond the numerous times they had simply encountered each other at oil events around the world.
Their conversation also broke new ground, according to two sources familiar with the talks in the Saudi city of Dhahran last week who said the CEOs discussed possible ways of cooperating in Asia, such as Indonesia and India, as well as in other markets.
The sources did not disclose further details, but any cooperation in Asia between Russia and Saudi Arabia - the world's two biggest oil exporters - would be unprecedented.
State oil giant Aramco confirmed the meeting took place but declined to give details of the closed-door talks, which took place on the same day as OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Russia led a global pact to extend a crude output cut to prop up prices. Kremlin oil major Rosneft declined to comment.
The meeting - which also saw Nasser give Sechin a tour of Aramco's HQ, according to the sources - gives an insight into the newfound, unexpected and fast-deepening partnership between the two countries. It is one that will be closely watched by big oil consumers around the world which have long relied on the hot rivalry between their top suppliers to secure better deals.
Such a detente between Moscow and Riyadh would have been almost unthinkable in the past.
Up until a year ago, the two sides had virtually no dialogue at all, even in the face of a spike in U.S. shale oil production that had led to a collapse in global prices from mid-2014. Sechin was strongly opposed to Russia cutting output in tandem with OPEC. 
In a sign of their white-hot Asian rivalry, Rosneft outbid Aramco to buy India's refiner Essar last year and boost its share in the world's fastest growing fuel market.
Fast forward a matter of months, and Moscow and Riyadh have become the main protagonists of the pact to cut output - agreed in December and extended last week - and are even discussing possible cooperation in their core Asian markets.
""It is a new 'axis of love',"" one senior Gulf official said of the relationship.
On Tuesday, Putin welcomed Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the Kremlin and both men said they would deepen cooperation in oil and work on narrowing their differences over Syria, where Moscow and Riyadh are backing opposing sides in a civil war.
""The most important thing is that we are succeeding in building a solid foundation to stabilize oil markets and energy prices,"" said Prince Mohammed.
Putin said the countries would work together to resolve a ""difficult situation"". 
WHY NOW?
The first attempt at cooperation between the two countries failed spectacularly with both sides unable to agree joint actions at an OPEC meeting in December 2014, six months after oil prices began tumbling from above $100 a barrel.
To add insult to injury, Sechin pledged to keep pushing output higher, even if prices fell to $20 per barrel. Saudi's then oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, retaliated by saying the Russian oil output would collapse as a result of low prices, a prediction that turned out to be wrong.
Much has changed since then, however, economically and politically - and the unlikely partnership between Moscow and Riyadh has been born out of necessity. 
When oil prices collapsed, both economies were driven into deficit after years of high spending and are only now slowly recovering. With Russia heading for a presidential election in early 2018, and Prince Mohammed having pledged to reform the Saudi economy and publicly list Aramco, neither country can afford another oil price shock.
The ousting of veteran minister Naimi and his replacement with the more pragmatic Khalid al-Falih last year also appeared to have helped, with their dialogue facilitated by OPEC's new secretary general Mohammad Barkindo.
""If minister Falih says something, I know it will be done,"" Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said last week in Vienna after Russia and OPEC agreed to extend output cuts.
Novak is looking to organize a trip for Falih to a Russian Arctic field, having visited Aramco's facilities in the Empty Quarter desert himself last October. ""Last year, minister Falih took us to a desert - we want to show him an ice desert,"" Novak joked last week. 
Barkindo told Reuters: ""They (Saudi Arabia and Russia) are the leading lights of the Declaration of Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC which has opened a new chapter in the history of oil.""
'SPASIBO'
On Tuesday, Novak and Falih reiterated in Moscow they would do ""whatever it takes"" to stabilize oil markets, borrowing a famous phrase used by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi five years ago to defend the euro.
They also discussed the outlook for non-OPEC production including U.S. shale output, which has resumed growing over the past year as private American producers have cut costs and adapted to lower prices.
U.S. crude is now being exported all over the world and the chances of private producers agreeing to cooperate with OPEC are minimal because of tough U.S. anti-monopoly legislation.
""Both Russia and the Gulf countries are interested in some type of oil price stabilization and they hope that they can achieve this without undertaking a sort of massive cuts which they had to do back in the 1980s,"" said Paul Simons, a former U.S. diplomat now serving as deputy executive director of the International Energy Agency.
Saudi Arabia and Russia say they will remain in partnership long after the current output reduction deal expires.
""It is necessary to work out new framework principles for continued cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC even after the expiration of the Vienna agreements,"" Novak said on Wednesday.

Falih, for his part, ended his speech by thanking Novak in Russian: ""Spasibo.""

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for June delivery were down 0.39% at $1,267.05.
The June contract ended Wednesday’s session 0.78% lower at $1,272.00 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,258.40, Tuesday’s low and resistance at $1,273.95, Wednesday’s high.
The greenback recovered from recent losses posted amid ongoing fears investigations into President Donald Trump's ties with Russia could hamper his administration's progress on promised stimulus measures.
The Trump administration is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and several congressional panels over alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion with the Trump campaign.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.12% at 97.03, off Wednesday’s one-week low of 96.80.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it weakens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Market participants were especially eyeing Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for further indications on the strength of the U.S. job market, which could give additional clues on whether or not the Federal Reserve will hike rates at its June policy meeting.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.

Supplies at the Cushing, Oklahoma, oil hub dipped by 753,000 barrels.
The API estimates will be followed on Thursday with official data from the Energy Information Administration. The two sets of figures often diverge.
Overnight, crude futures settled more than 2% lower on Wednesday, as investors shrugged of a renewed pledge from Saudi Arabia and Russia to reduce the glut in supply.
Oil prices fell as investors ignored Saudi and Russian Energy ministers’ comments on reducing global inventories, as concerns grew that oil producers that are not part of the global pact to reduce supply would continue to ramp-up production, undermining Opec and its allies’ efforts to curb the glut in supply.
At a meeting with his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday “more needed to be done to draw inventories towards the five-year average”.
Novak added that a new framework “for continued steady cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC” was necessary even after the expiration of the Vienna agreements.
OPEC and non-OPEC members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March last week, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year, against expectations that the oil cartel was set to announce deeper production cuts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the best window to complete the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is by early January, well before Mexico's general elections and U.S. congressional elections in 2018.
Speaking at an event held at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank, Ross said also said that the Commerce Department would impose anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on Mexican sugar and Canadian softwood lumber if negotiated settlements in those trade disputes could not be reached. The deadline for a Mexican sugar deal is June 5.
Ross said he hopes that the sugar and lumber issues can be resolved before negotiations with Canada and Mexico to modernize NAFTA can be resolved. U.S. sugar producers have sought the duties against Mexican competitors, arguing that Mexican government subsides for the industry are unfair.
U.S. lumber producers argue that Canadian competitors are also unfairly subsidized because their timber comes from government-owned land.
NAFTA negotiations cannot formally start until around Aug. 16, when a consultation period with U.S. lawmakers, industry and the public ends.
Ross said that he was hoping to start the talks sooner, but added that completing negotiations by January was important because Mexican elections could interfere with legislative approval of the agreement. 
""Their elections are mid-year. The closer you get to it the more complicated it would becomes, particularly in terms of getting Mexican congressional approval,"" Ross said.
He also noted that the current ""fast-track"" negotiating authority in the U.S. Congress needs to be reconfirmed in July 2018, while the U.S. congressional mid-term elections in November 2018 will be looming large by then as well.

""Those will undoubtedly have some impact on congressional views,"" Ross said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices sank 3 percent to a three-week low on Wednesday as an increase in Libyan output helped boost monthly OPEC crude production for the first time this year.
Brent notched its fifth straight monthly decline in a row despite OPEC-led output cuts and forecasts that U.S. crude inventories would fall for an eighth straight week since hitting a record at the end of March.
U.S. crude stocks were forecast to have fallen 2.5 million barrels last week. [EIA/S]
The American Petroleum Institute (API) was scheduled to release its data at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) on Wednesday, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report was due at 11:00 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT) on Thursday, both delayed a day because of the Memorial Day holiday on Monday.
Brent crude futures for July (LCOc1) fell $1.53, or 3.0 percent, to settle at $50.31 a barrel on their last day as the front-month. It was Brent's lowest close since May 10.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) fell $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to settle at $48.32 per barrel, its lowest close since May 12.
Brent's premium over the same U.S. month  narrowed to its lowest in almost five weeks.
For the month of May, Brent fell almost 3 percent, its fifth straight monthly loss. WTI had its third straight monthly decline, ending May down more than 2 percent.
Output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose in May, the first monthly increase this year, a Reuters survey found. Higher supply from Nigeria and Libya, OPEC members exempt from a production-cutting deal, offset improved compliance by others.
""Even if Libyan output levels from here for a few weeks, current relative strength provides an additional challenge to OPEC given the fact that the elevated Libyan production is not only eating into other OPEC members market share but is also forcing renewed weakening in Brent structure,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note.
Libya's oil production has risen to 827,000 bpd, above a three-year peak of 800,000 bpd reached earlier in May, the National Oil Corporation said.

OPEC and other producers, including Russia, agreed last week to extend a deal to cut production about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of March 2018.
Compliance with output cuts remained high among OPEC members and industry sources said Russian figures for May showed output in line with its pledge.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2017 10:30AM ET</span>","OPEC oil output rises in May as cut-exempt Nigeria, Libya pump more","By Alex Lawler and Rania El Gamal
LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC oil output rose in May, the first monthly increase this year, a Reuters survey found on Wednesday, as higher supply from two OPEC states exempt from a production-cutting deal, Nigeria and Libya, offset improved compliance with the accord by others.
A drop in output in Angola and Iraq and continued high compliance from Gulf producers Saudi Arabia and Kuwait helped lift OPEC's adherence with the supply cut deal to 95 percent from 90 percent in April, according to Reuters surveys.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pledged to reduce output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) for six months from Jan. 1 as part of a deal with Russia and other non-members.
Oil prices (LCOc1) has gained some ground but an inventory glut and rising supply by outside producers has kept prices below the $60 a barrel that Saudi Arabia wants. A sustained output rise from Libya and Nigeria poses further challenges. 
To provide additional support for prices, the producers decided at a meeting last week to prolong the deal until March 2018. They discussed whether to include Nigeria in the output cap but decided against for now, OPEC delegates said.
Nigeria and Libya were exempted because their output has been curbed by conflict. However, supplies from both nations staged a partial recovery in May, lifting overall OPEC output by 250,000 bpd to 32.22 million bpd.
The biggest increase came from Nigeria, where the Forcados production stream began loading cargoes for export. The Forcados pipeline had been mostly shut since it was bombed by militants in February 2016.
In Libya, the state oil firm said output had reached 827,000 bpd on Wednesday, around levels last seen in 2014. But production is still half the 1.60 million bpd Libya pumped before the 2011 civil war.
While the exempt nations pumped more, those bound by output targets boosted compliance. Adherence by OPEC with the deal has been higher than in the past, reaching a record according to the International Energy Agency and other analysts.
Angolan supply showed the largest decline due to fewer scheduled exports after a jump in April. Iraq exported slightly less crude from its southern terminals, the survey found.
Saudi Arabia pumped more although its compliance was the second-highest in OPEC. Even with May's increase, the total curb achieved by OPEC's top producer Saudi Arabia is 564,000 bpd, well above the target cut of 486,000 bpd.
Output in Iran and the United Arab Emirates was steady. Iran was allowed a small increase in the OPEC agreement and, having sold the oil it had held in floating storage, appears to have reached a short-term peak.
The UAE, with lower compliance than other Gulf producers, has said suggestions that it is failing to comply fully can be explained by the gap between its own figures and those estimated by the secondary sources that OPEC uses to track compliance. 
OPEC announced a production target of 32.50 million bpd at its Nov. 30 meeting, which was based on low figures for Libya and Nigeria and included Indonesia, which has since left.
No new target was announced last week to reflect this change or the addition of Equatorial Guinea, which OPEC said on May 25 joined the group with ""immediate effect."" The country will be added to the Reuters survey from June.
The Libyan and Nigerian increases mean OPEC output in May averaged 32.22 million bpd, about 470,000 bpd above its supply target, adjusted to remove Indonesia and not including Equatorial Guinea.

The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data, and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

The brewing battle between the only two provincial NDP governments in Canada is bad news for the party, which should have been basking in a surprise ascent to power in the country's third most populous province.
Instead, it has exposed the party's gulf over energy and the environment, setting the stage for a potential pitched battle between two sides of a party that must unite if it hopes to unseat Trudeau's Liberals or become, at least, kingmakers. 
""This could be the key dividing line between passionate environmentalists and economic pragmatists in the party,"" said pollster Nik Nanos of Nanos Research.
While both Trudeau and the Alberta NDP government support the project, the NDP divide runs up the party line to Ottawa, where six candidates vying for leadership of the third-place federal NDP have varied views on pipelines and the economy. The party will elect its new leader in October.
The western battle over the pipeline expansion, designed to carry crude from Alberta's oil sands to the west coast, also poses potential risks to Trudeau, who had scored a rare political victory with a pipeline policy that balanced demands of energy-dependent Alberta and the environmentalists in his party.
""If you are a Liberal, you have to be worried that the fight within the NDP could spill over to a fight within the Liberals,"" Nanos said.
A political battle between NDP governments has rarely been a risk in Canada, where the Liberals or center-right Conservatives traditionally hold federal power and the NDP has been able to be principled and uncompromising in opposition.
""It's complicated,"" acknowledged Karl Belanger, a longtime senior adviser to NDP leaders, saying the tension building between the provincial NDP leaders in Alberta and British Columbia will soon force the federal leadership candidates to pick a side in the pipeline debate. 
""The energy file has always been a sensitive one ... but eventually the federal candidates will have to take a stronger stand and clarify their positions,"" said Belanger.
While renewed opposition to the pipeline could hurt Trudeau, disarray among his rivals on the left could also benefit the prime minister just as the Conservatives solidify under new leader Andrew Scheer, said Queen's University political history professor Christo Aivalis. 

""The perceived fighting or division within the NDP could allow Trudeau to say: 'I have a solid unified party, and we are the best way to stop social conservatives.' That's a narrative that could be effective,"" Aivalis said.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for July delivery edged up 0.04% to $49.68 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent was last quoted up 0.15% to $52.29 a barrel.
Later on Wednesday, the American Petroleum Institute (API) will release its estimates of crude and refined product inventories to be followed on Thursday with official data from the Energy Information Administration. The two sets of figures often diverge.
Currently , forecasts see a crude oil inventory fall of 2.830 million barrels and a drop of 970,000 barrels for gasoline stocks and a fall of 785,000 barrels for distillates.
Overnight, crude futures settled lower, as investors continued to question whether OPEC and its allies’ agreement to only extend, but not deepen, production cuts would reduce excess supply while expectations for an uptick in Libyan oil output added to oversupply concerns.
Investors braced for an uptick in global supply, as Libya’s Sharara oil field was expected to increase output to 800,000 barrels per day (bdp) from 784,000 bpd, after a technical issue that limited output was solved on Tuesday.
Investor concerns about the glut in supply come amid continued uncertainty as to whether the recent OPEC agreement to extend production cuts would reduce global output to the five-year average in the wake of a surge in U.S. shale production.
OPEC and non-OPEC members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March last week, but stuck to production cuts of 1.8 million bpd agreed in November last year, against expectations that the oil cartel was set to announce deeper production cuts.
As part of the agreement, Nigeria and Libya will remain exempt from making cuts while Iran would be allowed to retain the right to increase production to the same reference level, around 3.797 million barrels a day, agreed in November last year.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded its forecasts for oil prices this year on Monday, targeting an average of $55.29 per barrel for Brent, down from its previous forecast of $56.76 a barrel while lowering its expectations WTI to $52.92 per barrel from $54.80.

Elsewhere in Europe, however, Eurozone finance ministers’ failure to agree on Greek debt relief  with the International Monetary Fund last week, and the prospect of early elections in Italy increased demand for safe haven gold, which limited losses.
Former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi suggested on Sunday that the country's next election be held at the same time as Germany's election, September 24, adding to speculation that Italians could head to the polls in the autumn.
In the mid-afternoon U.S. session, investors parsed Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard’s comments that an interest rate hike is ""likely appropriate soon"" but reaction in gold prices were muted, as Brainard warned that the Fed may delay an interest rate hike should inflation continue to slow.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Tuesday, on signs of resurgent crude output in Libya and concerns that extended production cuts by leading exporting countries may not be enough to drain a global glut that has depressed prices for almost three years.
Brent crude (LCOc1) fell 76 cents, or 1.45 percent, to $51.53 a barrel by 1:00 p.m. EDT, while U.S. light crude (CLc1) was 46 cents, or 0.9 percent lower at $49.34.
Libya's oil production was at 784,000 barrels per day (bpd) because of a technical issue at the Sharara field, but was expected to start rising to 800,000 bpd on Tuesday, the chief of the state-run National Oil Corporation said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers, including Russia, agreed last week to maintain output cuts of about 1.8 million barrels a day for nine months longer than originally planned. 
Still, prices tumbled after the OPEC deal was announced. The cutbacks have yet to drain crude inventories significantly.
""The market is now in the hands of how market participants interpret the weekly and monthly fundamental snapshots with all eyes focused on total global oil inventory levels,"" said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York.
Chirichella said the oil market is looking for ""a sustained inventory destocking pattern that will send global supply and demand balances back to normal historical levels."" 
Part of the problem for OPEC is booming shale production in the United States. U.S. drillers have added rigs for 19 straight weeks to reach 722, the highest since April 2015, according to services firm Baker Hughes.
Some selling pressure on Tuesday came from banks, brokers said. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts have cut forecasts for oil prices, saying falling U.S. production costs should boost supply for years.
""While we are bullish on near-term prices as inventories normalize ... 2018-19 futures need to be in the $45-$50 range,"" Goldman said.
 Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN), however, said it expects global crude inventories will return to their five-year average by the end of the OPEC-led production cuts, with large drawdowns in the second half of 2017.
""We do not think that much, if any, of that tightening is currently priced in. We do expect prices eventually to gain some upwards momentum because of excess demand, but in the short term market sentiment remains bearish,"" the bank said.

Gasoline demand during the U.S. summer driving season may support crude prices, analysts said. For this past Memorial Day holiday weekend, the American Automobile Association had forecast the highest driving mileage since 2005.

The monthly jobs report is set for release on Friday and while the labor market is considered to be at full employment, analysts suggested to pay close attention to the annualized reading of wage inflation as the key point that the Fed will be watching before making its next move.

Traders have questioned whether a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to extend a pledge to cut production by around 1.8 million barrels per day until the end of the first quarter of 2018 will be enough to reduce a massive global supply glut.
While OPEC's move had been widely expected, some analysts had hoped producers would agree to longer or deeper cuts to drain a global glut.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.
The number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil has increased for 19 straight weeks, to 722, the highest since April 2015 and the longest run of increases ever, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes.

(Reuters) - Oil prices rose slightly on Monday, barely paring last week's steep losses with the market remaining cautious as increases in U.S. drilling activity have undercut an OPEC-led push to tighten supply.
Trading was subdued due to public holidays in China, the United States and Britain. The market remains uncertain about whether the extension of output cuts by OPEC and other producing countries will be enough to support prices. 
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) settled up 14 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $52.29 per barrel. Brent fell nearly 3 percent the previous week.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC producers pledged last week to extend production cuts of around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2018.
An initial agreement, in place since January, would have expired in June.
""This is a little bit of a bounce back from last Thursday when we had a really heavy drop,"" said James L. Williams, an energy economist at WTRG Economics in Arkansas.
Nine months of current production levels is not going to be enough to meet OPEC's goal of balancing supply, which is limiting price gains, he added.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Carsten Fritsch called Monday's price moves little more than ""intraday noise.""
High compliance with the cuts so far was unlikely to last, he said, which should keep physical oil stockpiles near record levels. So far the output cuts have not lifted oil prices much beyond $50 per barrel.

1418,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2017 01:30PM ET</span>",U.S. may put emergency tariffs on solar imports,"By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States has notified the other 163 members of the World Trade Organization that it is considering putting emergency ""safeguard"" tariffs on imported solar cells, according to a WTO filing published on Monday.
The move raises the stakes in a global battle to dominate the solar power industry, which has grown explosively in the past five years. As production has increased, prices have tumbled, favoring producers who can take advantage of economies of scale. 
The United States, China and India are vying to be the market leader, and are looking out for any perceived breach of the international trade rules by their rivals.
Last September, the WTO ruled that India was illegally discriminating against U.S. solar exports, while India launched its own WTO complaint about solar subsidies in eight U.S. states.
The United States' ability to attract renewable energy investment has been tarnished by the shift in energy policy under U.S. President Donald Trump, putting China and India on top, a report by British accountancy firm Ernst & Young said earlier this month.
The U.S. decision to consider safeguard tariffs follows a petition to the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) by Suniva, Inc, the filing said. 
Under WTO rules, such temporary tariffs may be used to shield an industry from a sudden, unforeseen and damaging surge in imports. They can be challenged by other WTO members.
The ITC will decide by Sept. 22 whether the U.S. industry has suffered ""serious injury"", and if that is the case it will submit its report to Trump by Nov. 13, the filing said.
Suniva's petition said the volume of imports rose by 51.6 percent between 2012 and 2016, while the value of those imports grew by 62.8 percent from $5.1 billion to $8.3 billion. 
""The petition alleges that increasing imports have taken market share from domestic producers and have led to bankruptcies, plant shutdowns, layoffs, and a severe deterioration of the financial performance of the domestic industry,"" the U.S. filing said.
Suniva itself filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 17.
While imports have risen, U.S. producers have seen business shrivel, with 1,200 manufacturing jobs lost and a 27 percent wage decline in the four years to 2016. U.S. solar cell plants went from running at 81.7 percent of capacity in 2014 to 28.9 percent in 2016, the filing said.

""Data in the petition also indicates that (U.S. producers')domestic market share fell from 21.0 percent in 2012 to 11.0 percent in 2016, despite a $4 billion growth of the U.S. market over the same period.""

1419,By Investing.com,"<span>May 29, 2017 10:06AM ET</span>","Oil supply glut to return with agreement end, shale increase- M. Stanley","Investing.com - Although Morgan Stanley agrees that the recent agreement between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC members led by Russia to extend their agreed production cuts for another nine months through the end of March 2018 will lead to stock draws in the second and third quarter of this year, these experts believe the correction will be short-lived.
These analysts expect the initial extension to reduce inventories and thus provide some oil price support.
“However, when this agreement ends, and coincides with strong shale growth, the market looks oversupplied again,” they explained in a note to clients.
In this scenario, these experts feel that an acceleration of inventory draws in the third quarter should support oil prices, but still reduced their forecast for the barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil to end 2017 at $55, from the prior $60.
With regard to 2018, Morgan Stanley expects that OPEC will not extend the output cuts beyond the first quarter and noted that non-OPEC production had already returned to year-on-year growth with the acceleration driven by shale growth.
“When the end of the OPEC production cuts meet strong shale growth, the market is almost certainly oversupplied again,” they said.
“As a result, we lower our end-2018 WTI price forecast to $55 per barrel, from $60 per barrel before, although we could still see lower prices at some point during 2018,” they concluded.
Oil prices traded near the unchanged mark in holiday-thinned North American trading on Monday.

U.S. natural gas for July delivery sank 8.3 cents, or around 2.5%, to $3.227 per million British thermal units by 8:55AM ET (1255GMT).
The latest U.S. weather model called for mild temperatures over the next two weeks, which should dampen natural gas demand during that time.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.444 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 13.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 9.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 70 and 80 billion cubic feet in the week ended May 26.
That compares with a gain of 75 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 82 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 97 billion cubic feet.

Financial markets in the U.S. are closed for the Memorial Day holiday. U.K. and Chinese markets are also off for a holiday, resulting in light trading volumes.
Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producing countries, such as Russia, agreed to extend supply cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day until the end of the first quarter of 2018 last week.
While OPEC's move had been widely expected, some oil market investors had hoped producers would agree to longer or deeper cuts to drain a global glut of crude supplies.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya and Nigeria, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.
Data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed on Friday that U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 19th week in a row, the longest such streak on record, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.

The rebound in crude futures comes a day after oil prices suffered a nearly 5% tumble, as investors questioned whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies’ decision to extend production cuts nine more months would effectively rein in supply.
OPEC and non-OPEC members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March on Thursday, but stuck to the output cut targets agreed in November last year, against expectations that the oil cartel would take a more aggressive approach with deeper cuts.
Investors feared that the lack of both deeper cuts and inclusion of new non-OPEC members in the supply-cut pact would encourage non-OPEC members such as the U.S. to ramp up output, limiting OPEC’s efforts to curb global output.
Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid Al-Falih, said he expected a “healthy return” for U.S. shale but remained confident that a boom in U.S. shale won’t derail OPEC’s effort to tackle the demand and supply imbalance.

But two hours later, one veteran delegate was staring in despair at the numbers flashing red on his smartphone showing crude down some 5 percent to $51 a barrel.
""That is a disaster,"" he said. 
While OPEC has worked hard in recent years on improving communication to ensure the right message is delivered to financial markets, Thursday's experience showed the 14-member group and its non-OPEC allies still have a long way to go.
The problem was not what was delivered, but what appeared to have been promised beforehand, industry analysts said. 
OPEC agreed on Thursday to extend its existing production cuts by nine months - more than the initially suggested six months - in tandem with non-OPEC producers, including Russia.
But hints from the group that it could deepen supply cuts, extend them by as long as 12 months, curtail exports and tell the market how exactly it would terminate supply curbs in 2018 had raised market expectations much higher.
""OPEC oversold the meeting to the market way too early,"" Amrita Sen, from the consultancy Energy Aspects, told Reuters in Vienna.
The market reaction was all the more disappointing given that from OPEC's perspective, the meeting went very well.
""I have been in OPEC close to 20 years. It's the first time that I witness 100 percent compliance (with cuts) from OPEC and close to 100 percent from non-OPEC,"" Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told Reuters afterward. 
OPEC's No.3 producer, Iran has repeatedly clashed in past meetings with OPEC's de-facto leader, its political arch-rival Saudi Arabia.
Russia, which effectively is fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia in Syria, said on Thursday its energy cooperation with Riyadh would last well into the future.
In its statement, OPEC said it could extend curbs further or cut more.
Normally, all this would be more than enough to trigger a bull rally.
""It's strange. I don't know why (the market crashed)"" Zanganeh said.
WHATEVER IT TAKES
OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers first agreed to cut output in December 2016 - the first joint deal in 15 years - and said the curbs could be extended by a further six months. 
The extraordinary move was aimed at battling a global glut of crude that halved prices from 2014, forcing Russia and Saudi Arabia to tighten their belts and leading to unrest in Venezuela and Nigeria.
The cuts helped push oil prices back above $50 per barrel but also spurred growth in the U.S. shale industry, which does not participate in the output deal. That slowed a rebalancing of supply and demand, with global inventories still near record highs.
As the price fell back towards $47 in early May, near a six-month low, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC would do ""whatever it takes"" to rebalance the market, including a longer extension for the output cuts.
""If you declare nine months in advance, people are bound to expect more,"" Sen said. Russia also added to the expectations by saying this week that cuts could be prolonged by 12 months.
The market was also disappointed OPEC did not mention its previously stated plan to bring stocks down from a record high of 3 billion barrels to their five-year average of 2.7 billion, said Olivier Jakob from the Petromatrix consultancy.
""The December meeting was a breakthrough,"" he said. ""The meeting yesterday gives us, however, a feeling that OPEC is fatigued by the lack of results so far and does not have a consensus anymore to have the five-year average in stocks as a policy target.""
The fact that Iran, Libya and Nigeria remain exempt from cuts suggested OPEC was not yet ready to take additional measures, Jakob added.
Dave Pursell, managing director at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, a Houston-based bank working with U.S. shale producers, predicted markets would rebalance within six months. 

""The market was hoping for deeper cuts,"" he said. ""But I do think oil prices, three months from now, will be higher than they are now.""

1434,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2017 10:20AM ET</span>",OPEC ponders how to co-exist with U.S. shale oil,"By Ernest Scheyder
VIENNA (Reuters) - First, they ignored each other. Then, they went into a bruising fight. Finally, they are talking, albeit with opposing agendas.
The history of the relationship between OPEC and the U.S. shale oil industry has evolved a great deal since the cartel discovered it had a surprise rival emerging in a core market for its oil around five years ago.
U.S. shale bankers came to Vienna this week and OPEC is readying a trip for its top officials to Texas in a bid to understand whether the two industries can co-exist or are poised to embark on another major fight in the near future.
""We have to coexist,"" said Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia's energy minister, who pushed through OPEC production cuts in December, reversing Riyadh's previous strategy to pump as much as possible and try to kill off U.S. shale with low oil prices.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries led by Russia agreed on Thursday to extend oil output curbs by nine months to March 2018, keeping roughly 2 percent of global production off the market in an attempt to boost prices.
But OPEC now realizes supply cuts and higher prices only make it easier for the shale industry to deliver higher profit after it found ways of slashing costs when Saudi Arabia turned up the taps three years ago.
In the Permian Basin - the largest U.S. oilfield -  Parsley Energy  Inc (N:PE),  Diamondback Energy Inc  (O:FANG) and others are pumping at the fastest rate in years, taking advantage of new technology, low costs and steady oil prices (CLc1) (LCOc1) to reap profits at OPEC's expense.
OPEC's latest calculus acknowledges the global clout of shale but seeks to hinder its growth by keeping just enough supply on the market to hold prices below $60 per barrel.
""All shale companies in the U.S. are small companies,"" said Noureddine Boutarfa, who represented Algeria at the meeting. ""The reality is that at $50 to $60 a barrel, (the U.S. oil industry) can't break beyond 10 million barrels per day.""
That is the level many analysts estimate U.S. oil production will reach next year, in what would be a 1 million bpd rise, a staggering jump for an industry marked during 2015 and 2016 by scores of bankruptcies and thousands of layoffs after a two-year price war with OPEC.
Still, that extra volume may not be enough to meet rising global demand or offset natural declines in traditional oilfields, which OPEC is banking on.
""For all OPEC members, $55 (per barrel) and a maximum of $60 is the goal at this stage,"" said Bijan Zanganeh, Iran's oil minister. ""So is that price level not high enough to encourage too much shale? It seems it is good for both.""
Some OPEC members seem keen to show they have shed any prior naivete about shale, making it a key topic during Thursday's meeting after barely mentioning it before. Shale's limitations, including rising service costs, also were discussed. 
""We had a discussion on (shale) and how much that has an impact,"" said Ecuador Oil Minister Carlos Pérez. ""But we have no control over what the U.S. does and it's up to them to decide to continue or not.""
Mark Papa, chief executive of Permian oil producer Centennial Resource Development Inc (O:CDEV), was asked by OPEC delegates to give a presentation on shale's potential last week. He appeared to have played his cards close to his chest.
""In terms of the threat, we still don't know how much (U.S. shale) will be producing in the near future,"" Nelson Martinez, Venezuela's oil minister said after the talk.
WARNING FOR SHALE
By the same token, some U.S. shale leaders may also want a better insight into OPEC thinking and help OPEC understand that shale is not a flash in the pan.
""OPEC looks at shale and it scoffs,"" said Dave Purcell of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, a U.S. shale investment bank that attended the OPEC meeting for the first time. ""There's a rational skepticism globally, but it misses the mark."" 
For example, the UAE Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui said he did not believe U.S. oil production would rise by 1 million bpd next year.
Some of OPEC's customers are happy to see an alternative. India, the world's third-largest oil consumer, said this week it is looking to the United States for greater supply.
""The new normal has to be accepted,"" Dharmendra Pradhan, India's energy minister said this week ahead of the OPEC meeting.
OPEC meets again in November to reconsider output policy. While most in the group now appear to believe that shale has to be accommodated, there are still those in OPEC who think another fight is around the corner. 

""If we get to a point where we feel frustrated by a deliberate action of shale producers to just sabotage the market, OPEC will sit down again and look at what process it is we need to do,"" said Nigerian Oil Minister Emmanuel Kachikwu.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2017 07:36AM ET</span>",Oil edges up after dip on disappointing OPEC meeting outcome,"By Karolin Schaps
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices edged back up on Friday after a 5 percent fall in the previous session on disappointment that an OPEC-led decision to extend current production curbs did not go deeper.
At Thursday's meeting in Vienna the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC producers agreed to extend a pledge to cut around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of output until the end of the first quarter of 2018. The initial agreement would have expired next month.
Producers have expressed confidence that this plan will bring down crude oil stocks to their five-year average of 2.7 billion barrels but the market had hoped for a last-minute agreement on more far-reaching action.
""The problem is that investors look at the impact today, while OPEC focuses on reaching stability in the coming six to nine months, so the long squeeze yesterday was overdone a bit,"" said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.
Clawing back some of Thursday's losses, global benchmark Brent futures (LCOc1) were up 17 cents at $51.63 a barrel at 1103 GMT .
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) remained below $50, at $49.05, though up 15 cents from their last close.
""The front of the curve declined the most, which at least for now implies that the market doesn't quite believe that a tightening and/or backwardation is really coming,"" said analysts at JBC Energy. 
Concerns remain that OPEC-led production cuts will only stimulate a further rise in output from the United States, where producers can operate at much lower costs.
Ann-Louise Hittle, vice president at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said the decision in Vienna sent a signal of continued support for oil prices from OPEC which helped U.S. onshore drillers make plans to further raise their production.
U.S. oil production  has already risen by 10 percent since mid-2016 to over 9.3 million bpd, close to the output of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
With U.S. output rising steadily and OPEC and its allies potentially raising production in 2018 to regain lost market share, many traders, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), already expect another price slump.
Other assessments pointed to the possibility of output cuts being extended into 2019 in order to bring down both crude oil and refined product stocks.

""Output controls will eventually be extended at least until the end of 2018, and more likely than not into 2019 ... At this pace, it will not be until at least the end of 2018, or indeed, 2019, when surplus inventories can be eliminated,"" said analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).

1439,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2017 05:30AM ET</span>",China's teapot refiners set to slow crude imports as tanks overflow,"By Chen Aizhu and Florence Tan
BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - As OPEC extends production cuts in a bid to tighten the oil market, China's independent refiners - awash with crude and facing disappointing local demand - are poised to slow purchases of oil for at least the next two months.
The move by China's so-called ""teapots"", a key driver of the country's crude appetite, will stir concerns about demand in the world's top oil buyer, which fell from a peak of 9.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in March to 8.4 million bpd in April.
Independent refiners, mainly based in Shandong, are under pressure to cut run rates as profit margins have been squeezed by Beijing's tighter scrutiny over taxes and shifting quota policies, while some have begun seasonal maintenance.
Plans by state oil majors to bring on new refining capacity later this year will help offset some import losses, but lower appetite from teapots and the potential for falling output indicates that the boom among this group of upstart refiners that has transformed China's oil market may be slowing.
""There will be more shutdowns in June, July and possibly August. It's seasonal but also because the market is not doing well and stocks are plentiful,"" said a manager at a Dongying-based independent refiner, who asked not to be named.
Independent refiners, which make up some 12 percent of China's crude demand, have enjoyed record profits since winning the right since late 2015 to import oil, selling diesel and gasoline throughout Asia while expanding domestic sales in unprecedented competition with state firms.
However, Beijing in January abruptly banned quotas for independents to export fuel, favoring its large state-owned refiners, put in a deadline for new applications for crude oil permits and tightened scrutiny on tax practices, squeezing margins.
Some refineries had rushed to buy crude in the first quarter, worried that they could be penalized for slow use of import permits, said a second teapot manager, who asked to only give his surname Wang.
""There were some over-purchases of crude earlier as (plants) were unsure of the quota policy. Now inventories are high everywhere,"" he said.
LONGER CUTS
Some analysts reckon the run curbs may last longer than previously expected. Teapots operated at 58 percent of capacity in April, falling below 60 percent for the first time since October and down from record rates of almost 65 percent in February, according to BMI Research.
""Policy headwinds, domestic competition from SOEs (state-owned enterprises) and insufficient storage infrastructure at major port cities will cap imports,"" it said in a research note this week.
Wang said diesel inventories were particularly high in Shandong compared to gasoline. To ease the pressure, his plant planned to shut its 90,000 bpd crude unit through July for an overhaul.
Plans by state oil firms China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and CNOOC to bring on stream new refineries in Yunnan and Huizhou with combined capacity of 460,000 bpd, as well as some new approvals for teapot importers, are expected to bolster China's crude oil imports from August onward, analysts said.
Beijing over April and May has also provided approvals for six independents to import crude with total permits of around 280,000 bpd, although some are still preliminary. 
Harry Liu, an analyst at consultancy IHS Markit, estimated China's total imports have fallen to around 8 million bpd at present, but could climb back to around 8.5 million bpd from around August.
""CNPC and CNOOC will contribute the bulk of the increases in refinery runs later this year. Teapots' contribution will be smaller as the environment for them to grow has got much tougher this year,"" Liu said.

1440,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2017 05:10AM ET</span>",OPEC oil cut extension renews Asia's crude supply worries,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The OPEC-led decision to extend a production cut to March 2018 disappointed financial investors, prompting an exit from oil futures markets, while refiners in Asia were mostly concerned with whether it meant they would need to go hunting for crude. 
In Vienna, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC producers on Thursday extended a pledge to cut 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of output until the end of the first quarter of 2018. 
Financial traders did not like what they heard, thinking it meant an ongoing oil glut. ""The market voted with its feet"", investment bank Jefferies said, dragging crude futures (CLc1) (LCOc1) down 5 percent to near $50 a barrel. [O/R] 
In physical markets, however, where tankers can take weeks or months to deliver up to $100 million in crude oil, refiners want to know if they will be forced to search for new suppliers. 
""This is a declaration of a strong will of OPEC as well as non-OPEC producers to tighten overall supply-demand,"" said Yasushi Kimura, president of the Petroleum Association of Japan, and chairman of petroleum conglomerate JXTG Holdings (T:5020).
To ensure crude supplies, ""we need to carefully monitor OPEC's production cut adherence,"" Kimura said. 
Crude is by far the biggest cost for refiners and the petrochemical industry, shaking margins  whenever benchmark prices take broad swings.
Kimura said the extended cuts could mean demand may exceed supply in 2017, which would be the first time in years. 
This would force refiners to start using up reserves, pushing up prices at least until production catches back up with consumption. 
""In 2017, global demand is likely to exceed supply ... and crude prices are likely to ... rise toward $60 by the end of the year,"" JXTG Holdings' Kimura said. 
REAL SUPPLY CUTS?
So far, though, the cuts that started in January have barely dented supply in Asia, home to three of the world's four biggest oil consumers. 
Exporters were keen to maintain global market share, and they cut domestic supplies or shipments to marginal buyers. As a result, inventories in the big consumer markets have remained bloated, and prices low. 
""We have (so far) not had any impact in terms of any cut from any of these (OPEC) sources into India,"" said B. Ashok, chairman of Indian Oil Corp (NS:IOC), the country's biggest petroleum company. 
OPEC sources said that will change as top exporter Saudi Arabia especially is keen to see a visibly tighter market. 
Many refiners, however, are still not expecting a real crude shortage, largely due to ample alternative supplies. 
""Crudes that can be processed in our refineries include crudes from the U.S. We have procured some crude even from Canada. We have been procuring crude from Latin America ... Africa, Russia,"" Ashok said. 
ALTERNATIVES AT A PRICE
U.S. producers have become a key alternative source of supply as their output - largely due to shale oil - has soared by 10 percent since mid-2016 to 9.3 million bpd , close to Saudi Arabia's and Russia's levels. 
These producers have been fast to fill OPEC's gap, with an average of 374,000 bpd of crude from the United States coming to Asia in the first four months of 2017, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. 
That compares with an average of just 48,000 bpd in 2016. 
""The cut in OPEC supplies will be offset by higher U.S. crude production,"" said KY Lin, spokesman for Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (TW:6505), one of Asia's biggest refiners and petrochemical producers.
Still, most analysts including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Jefferies and  Barclays  (LON:BARC), expect prices to gradually rise toward the beginning of 2018 as the market tightens.
While consumers may have to live with higher prices as OPEC and its allies hold back output, the longer the policy lasts, the more the cartel risks losing permanent market share. 

""In response to ... OPEC production cuts we are working on diversification of crude oil import sources and looking beyond the Middle East,"" said Kim Wookyung, a spokeswoman at  SK Innovation  (KS:096770), owner of South Korea's largest refiner SK Energy.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for June delivery were up 0.43% at $1,261.83.
The June contract ended Thursday’s session 0.26% higher at $1,256.40 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,247.60, the low of May 24 and resistance at $1,263.80, the high of May 23.
The greenback regained some ground thanks to Thursday’s better than expected U.S. initial jobless claims data.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.09% at 97.24.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it weakens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
The data came a day after the minutes of the Fed’s May meeting showed that the central bank plans to unwind its balance sheet towards the end of the year, possibly using a system where cap limits are implemented on how much the Fed would roll off every month without reinvesting.
The Fed also signaled that interest rates could be raised soon, but added that ""it would be prudent"" to wait for more U.S. economic data.
Market participants were looking ahead to U.S. data on durable goods orders, first-quarter economic growth and consumer sentiment due later in the day.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for July delivery fell 0.27% to $48.77 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent was last quoited down 0.41% to $51.25 a barrel.
However, at least one analyst said the decline could prove short-lived.
""This is a bit of an overreaction. Markets are heading towards more rebalancing in Q3 and Q4 of this year,"" said Wood Mackenzie's research director for Asia refining, Sushant Gupta.
Overnight, crude futures settled below $50, tumbling nearly 5%, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies’ decision to extend production cuts for nine more months, failed to meet traders’ expectations that the cartel group would announce deeper cuts.
OPEC and non-OPEC members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March on Thursday, after the output cuts agreed in November last year failed to rein in the glut in supply, which has pressured oil prices for nearly three years.
The nine-month extension was widely anticipated but traders were hopeful that OPEC would take a more aggressive approach to curb oversupply with deeper cuts, in the wake of a rise in non-OPEC output.
OPEC, however, announced that no new non-OPEC members will join the global deal to reduce supply and it would adhere to the production cuts of 1.8 million barrels a day agreed in late November.
OPEC president and Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid Al-Falih said current levels were sufficient to “reach the five-year average by the end of the year” and expected to reach target before year-end.
Falih said he expected a “healthy return” for U.S. shale and remained defiant that a boom in U.S. shale won’t derail OPEC’s effort to tackle the demand and supply imbalance.
Nigeria and Libya will remain exempt from making cuts while Iran would be allowed to retain the right to increase production to the same reference level, around 3.797 million barrels a day, agreed in November last year.

Gold for June delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange edged up 0.04% to $1,256.88 a troy ounce. China vies with India as the world's top gold importer.
Overnight, gold futures steadied on Thursday, after the Federal Reserve’s May meeting minutes, raised concerns over whether the Federal Reserve would continue with its plan to introduce two additional rate hikes in 2017.
According to the Federal Reserve's minutes for its 2-3 May meeting, released on Wednesday, most Fed officials said a further increase in short-term interest rates will be needed ""soon"", fuelling expectations that the U.S. central bank is poised to hike interest rates at its next meeting in June.
According to investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool, nearly 80% of traders expect the Fed to hike interest rates in June.
The hawkish view that a rate hike was needed soon was offset by comments from some Fed members at the meeting, who said that further signs would need to show that weakness in the first-quarter was temporary, prior to future rate hikes.
U.S. economic growth, measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP), rose by annualized rate of just 0.7% for the first three months of 2017. It was the slowest period of first-quarter economic growth since 2014.
A surge in the dollar, however, weighed on gold prices, which dropped to session lows, following bullish initial jobless claim data, boosting sentiment that the economy is continuing to show signs of a rebound in the second quarter.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims rose by 1,000 to 234,000 in the week ended May 18.
Analysts had expected initial jobless claims to rise by 5,000 to 238,000 in the week ended May 18. Dollar-denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar – A dip in the dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency and thus, increases demand.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for July delivery fell 0.10% to $48.85 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent was last quoited up 0.12% to $51.33 a barrel.
Overnight, crude futures settled below $50, tumbling nearly 5%, after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies’ decision to extend production cuts for nine more months, failed to meet traders’ expectations that the cartel group would announce deeper cuts.
OPEC and non-OPEC members agreed to extend production cuts for a period of nine months until March on Thursday, after the output cuts agreed in November last year failed to rein in the glut in supply, which has pressured oil prices for nearly three years.
The nine-month extension was widely anticipated but traders were hopeful that OPEC would take a more aggressive approach to curb oversupply with deeper cuts, in the wake of a rise in non-OPEC output.
OPEC, however, announced that no new non-OPEC members will join the global deal to reduce supply and it would adhere to the production cuts of 1.8 million barrels a day agreed in late November.
OPEC president and Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid Al-Falih said current levels were sufficient to “reach the five-year average by the end of the year” and expected to reach target before year-end.
Khalid Al-Falih said he expected a “healthy return” for U.S. shale and remained defiant that a boom in U.S. shale won’t derail OPEC’s effort to tackle the demand and supply imbalance.
Nigeria and Libya will remain exempt from making cuts while Iran would be allowed to retain the right to increase production to the same reference level, around 3.797 million barrels a day, agreed in November last year.

1445,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2017 04:43PM ET</span>","Big drop in U.S. oil stocks finally on the way, traders say","By Catherine Ngai and Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil traders and analysts are expecting large volumes of crude to draw from storage tanks across the United States in coming weeks, in what would be the most tangible sign of an inventory overhang reduction that has punished prices over the last two years.
A reduction would show the market is finally reversing course after years of stock builds that left a worldwide overhang of half a billion barrels of crude oil and refined products. 
Supplies have remained stubbornly high for months, disappointing traders who were expecting OPEC cuts to help rebalance the market. But traders interviewed said seasonally unusual spring drawdowns in the United States, record refining runs, and big exports to Asia and Latin America as signals that sharp declines in crude stocks could be coming. 
Some traders said that they expect as much as 10 million barrel per week in draws soon, although others forecasted three to four million barrels a week. U.S. crude stocks peaked at 533 million barrels in March, and were at 516 million as of last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
Forecasts can vary depending on unexpected events like unplanned refinery or pipeline outages, but traders agreed the draws would be substantial. 
""I think we'll easily get below 500 million barrels over the next six to eight weeks, or eight to 10 to be conservative,"" said Andrew Lebow, senior partner at Commodity Research Group in Darien, Connecticut.
On Thursday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with non-members, decided to extend cuts of around 1.8 million barrels per day for nine months to curb output. Prices fell sharply, on worries that it would not do enough to reduce supplies. 
So far in 2017, inventories have remained stubbornly high. Heavy growth in U.S. shale production, along with imports, kept U.S. inventories at levels above last year, even though more opaque storage spots were starting to draw. 
That may have already started to accelerate. Between April and May, U.S. crude draws averaged 3.4 million barrels every week, on track for the first decline for that period since 2008. 
U.S. refiners are churning crude at near-record levels. Refinery utilization was at the highest level seasonally in two years last week even ahead of the U.S. Memorial Day holiday, the de facto start of peak gasoline demand. 
Saudi Arabia's oil minister said on Thursday that the seven weeks of U.S. stock draws, along with a drop in floating storage, is ""excellent news,"" adding that exports to the United States were dropping measurably.
The primary offsetting factor is U.S. production, which sits now at 9.3 million barrels a day, 550,000 barrels higher than a year ago, according to EIA data. [EIA/S]
""I expect any curtailment of OPEC exports will be matched by further increases in U.S. shale production, as evidenced by current data on the continued increase of drilling rigs and permits,"" said Josh Sherman, a partner at consulting firm Opportune LLP in Houston.
However, U.S. exports of crude and products remain strong, with some 10 million barrels of U.S. crude en route to Asia, according to shipping data and trade sources. 
One crude analyst at a trading house said that he expects draws to be close to 20 million barrels a month from the Gulf Coast through the summer on ""massive"" levels of exports. 
That could also drain inventories at the U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, where stocks sit at 65.6 million barrels;  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) expects that figure to fall to below 60 million by the end of the summer. 

""At the pace sustained since the start of March, the crude surplus would be totally gone by end-December,"" Standard Chartered analysts said in a note this week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled 5 percent on Thursday as the extension of output curbs by OPEC and other producing countries disappointed investors who had hoped for larger cuts, leading to the biggest daily percentage slide in crude prices since early March. 
At Thursday's meeting in Vienna, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC producers agreed to extend supply cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of the first quarter of 2018.
Brent crude oil (LCOc1) settled down $2.50, or 4.6 percent at $51.46 a barrel. U.S. West Texas intermediate crude futures (CLc1) ended at $2.46 lower, or 4.8 percent, at $48.90 a barrel, breaking below $50 for the first time all week. 
It was the biggest percentage decline for both benchmarks since March 8th. Since then, trading has been volatile.
While OPEC's move Thursday had been expected, some oil market investors had hoped producers would agree to longer or deeper cuts to drain a global glut of crude supplies. OPEC's move was greeted by a sell-off. The day's volumes of 1.1 million contracts of WTI were the highest since the Nov. 30 session, when OPEC first announced cuts.
""There was hope that there would be half a million extra barrels coming off,"" said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Americas. He said the rally in recent days left few buyers to support futures once prices started to fall.
""Today the bottom evaporated from the market,"" he said.
The global crude glut has persisted even after OPEC agreed to cut production in the first half of the year. Futures markets activity shows a reduced expectation for the market to balance.
“I don’t think the cuts are enough for (OPEC) to reach their goal in a nine month period and this is reflecting that,"" said James Williams, president of WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas.
Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said fellow ministers did not see a need to reduce oil output further.
""We considered various scenarios, from six to nine to 12 months, and we even considered options for a higher cut. But all indications discovered that a nine-month extension is the optimum,"" he said.
The cartel next meets in November.
Oil at $50 a barrel has encouraged more U.S. shale output, since production costs are down from a few years ago. That has had a growing effect on global supplies. 
""The U.S. shale producer does what everyone thought was impossible. It becomes so efficient that it can make money at sub $50 oil,"" said Curt Taylor, president of consulting firm Opportune LLP’s Ralph E. Davis Associates in Houston.
U.S. oil production  has risen more than 10 percent since mid-2016 to more than 9.3 million bpd. Rising U.S. production could completely replace OPEC's output cuts of 1.2 million bpd by year-end, according to RBN Energy.
David Arrington, president of shale oil producer Arrington Oil & Gas in Midland, Texas, said that how U.S. producers respond in coming months will have as much of an effect on pricing as OPEC’s cuts. 

“If U.S. shale producers exceeded our projected increases, it’ll drive the price down again,” Arrington said.

OPEC president and Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid Al-Falih said that oil producers had discussed the length of the extension as ranging from six to 12 months but decided that “the nine month (extension) is the optimum”.
Al-Falih admitted that they also discussed even higher production cuts but that they felt that current levels were sufficient to “reach the five year average by the end of the year” and expected to reach target before year-end.
He explained that the extension was made through the end of March 2018 simply to “avoid the typical seasonal stock build”.
Al-Falih further announced that, due to several market variables, the Joint OPEC-Non-OPEC Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) would continue assess the situation regarding stock targets and recommend any changes.
He also noted that “everyone” would meet again at the next official OPEC meeting on November 30.
In a follow-up to Al-Falih’s initial briefing, Russian energy minister Alexander Novak agreed that the nine-month extension leading to the April 1, 2018 was optimal.
He also noted that the JMMC would be meeting every two months in order to make any necessary recommendations for changes to the agreement.
In the question and answer period, Al-Falih repeated that both groups agreed that nine months an optimal extension, though he insisted that it could be extended if necessary.
“We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it,” he stated.
In response to the eventual ending of the production cut agreement, Al-Falih insisted that “just because we don’t have an exit strategy doesn’t mean we won’t.”
He explained that oil producers will handle that situation once the market is balanced.
Regarding U.S. shale, Al-Falih insisted that “that there is no confrontation between OPEC and shale oil” because “this is a big market”.
OPEC secretary general Mohammad Barkindo also chimed in, claiming that producers were in a “new energy landscape” and that “we have to break barriers and we broke bread with them in Houston”.
Experts and markets “disappointed” with agreement
Hamza Khan, head of commodities at ING, showed himself to be unimpressed, insisting that the original six month agreement had failed to either shrink inventories or boost prices and compared the nine month extension to a “record skipping”.
“With continued production out of the U.S. and, crucially, falling costs from producers in the rest of the world, OPEC’s great white hope is that demand will grow fast enough to absorb its eventual resumption of supplies,” Khan said.
“With soft demand figures globally, that hope is fading nightly,” he added.
ETX Capital senior market analyst Neil Wilson shared a similar opinion. “OPEC members had a chance today but bottled it,” he said.
“A nine-month extension just isn’t enough to really lift oil prices as we’ll continue to see US shale fill the gap,” Wilson continued.
“Having said they’d do whatever it takes, OPEC is looking a bit toothless now,” he concluded.
Markets appeared to share the bearish stance, widening losses as the conference progressed and sinking more than 4% at an intraday low, compared to a little over 3% before Al-Falih began speaking.

VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC and non-members led by Russia decided on Thursday to extend cuts in oil output by nine months to March 2018 as they battle a global glut of crude after seeing prices halve and revenues drop sharply in the past three years.
OPEC's cuts have helped to push oil back above $50 a barrel this year, giving a fiscal boost to producers, many of which rely heavily on energy revenues and have had to burn through foreign-currency reserves to plug holes in their budgets.
Oil's earlier price decline, which started in 2014, forced Russia and Saudi Arabia to tighten their belts and led to unrest in some producing countries including Venezuela and Nigeria.
The price rise this year has spurred growth in the U.S. shale industry, which is not participating in the output deal, thus slowing the market's rebalancing with global crude stocks still near record highs.
The nine-month extension was largely expected by the market. By 1530 GMT (11:30 a.m. ET), Brent crude was down nearly 3 percent at around $52.30 per barrel on disappointment OPEC would not deepen the cuts or extend them by as long as 12 months. [O/R]
In December, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed its first production curbs in a decade and the first joint cuts with non-OPEC producer nations, led by Russia, in 15 years. 
The two sides decided to remove about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from the market in the first half of 2017 - equal to 2 percent of global production, taking October 2016 as the baseline month for reductions.
On Thursday, OPEC agreed to keep its own cuts of around 1.2 million bpd in place for nine months, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq said. 
OPEC and non-OPEC delegates said joint cuts with non-OPEC were agreed at around 1.8 million bpd, which would see non-OPEC producers again contributing a reduction of under 600,000 bpd.
Despite the output cut, OPEC kept exports fairly stable in the first half of 2017 as its members sold oil from stocks.
OPEC first suggested extending cuts by six months, but later proposed to prolong them by nine months. Russia offered an unusually long duration of 12 months.
""There have been suggestions (of deeper cuts), many member countries have indicated flexibility but ... that won't be necessary,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said before the meeting.
CUTS EXCLUDE NIGERIA AND LIBYA
OPEC produces a third of the world's oil. Its production reduction of 1.2 million bpd was made based on October 2016 output of around 31 million bpd, excluding Nigeria and Libya.
Falih said OPEC members Nigeria and Libya would still be excluded from cuts as their output remained curbed by unrest.
He also said Saudi oil exports were set to decline steeply from June, thus helping to speed up market rebalancing.
OPEC sources have said the Thursday meeting will highlight a need for long-term cooperation with non-OPEC producers. 
The group could also send a message to the market that it will seek to curtail its oil exports.
""Russia has an upcoming election and Saudis have the Aramco share listing next year so they will indeed do whatever it takes to support oil prices,"" said Gary Ross, head of global oil at PIRA Energy, a unit of S&P Global Platts.
OPEC has a self-imposed goal of bringing stocks down from a record high of 3 billion barrels to their five-year average of 2.7 billion. 
""We have seen a substantial drawdown in inventories that will be accelerated,"" Falih said. ""Then, the fourth quarter will get us to where we want.""
OPEC also faces the dilemma of not pushing oil prices too high because doing so would further spur shale production in the United States, the world's top oil consumer, which now rivals Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's biggest producer.

""Less OPEC oil on the market enhances the opportunity for American energy to fill needs around the world, and will help us achieve energy dominance,"" Ryan Sitton from the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the large Texan oil industry, told Reuters.

In November last year, OPEC and 11 other non-OPEC producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January 1 and June 30.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.

Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producing countries will meet in Vienna on Thursday to decide whether to extend their current production agreement beyond a June 30-deadline.
In November last year, OPEC and 11 other non-OPEC producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January 1 and June 30.
Most market analysts expect the oil cartel to extend output cuts for a further nine months until March 2018, instead of six months as previously expected.
There is also talk that OPEC is looking at the option of deepening current production cuts, but it is not clear whether there would be support for that.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.

Comex gold futures rose $5.00, or around 0.4%, to $1,258.07 a troy ounce by 2:35AM ET (06:35GMT). Meanwhile, spot gold was at $1,258.24, not far from a three-week peak of $1,263.80 touched on Tuesday.
Also on the Comex, silver futures tacked on 12.6 cents, or about 0.7%, to $17.24 a troy ounce, just shy of a one-month high of $17.30 scaled earlier this week.
Minutes from the Fed's last policy meeting showed policymakers agreed they should hold off on raising interest rates until it was clear a recent U.S. economic slowdown was temporary, though most said a hike was coming soon.
The minutes also showed that policymakers favored a gradual reduction in its massive balance sheet. Fed staff proposed that the central bank set a cap on the amount of bonds that would be allowed to run off each month, initially setting it at a low level and raising it every three months.
The somewhat dovish minutes prompted traders to scale back bets on two more rate increases by the end of the year. Futures traders are currently pricing in around an 77% chance of a hike at the Fed's June meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, while odds for a second rate hike by December were at about 40%.
The median Fed policymaker forecast is for two more rate increases by year-end. But a recent run of disappointing U.S. economic data combined with signs of deepening political turmoil in the White House raised doubts over the Fed's ability to raise rates as much as it would like before the end of the year.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 96.90 in London morning trade, not far from six-and-a-half-month lows touched earlier in the week.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
Elsewhere in metals trading, platinum held steady at $950.95, while palladium added 0.2% to $765.25 an ounce.
Copper futures were little changed at $2.589 a pound.

1461,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2017 01:50AM ET</span>",U.S. oilfield service firms lag shale recovery; old deals hold,"By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil services companies have been doing a lot more work as recovering oil prices have lifted the shale industry from a two-year slump, but producers have been pocketing much of the new cash generated by rising output and squeezing service providers to keep costs down.
Oil service companies that provide the crews, labor and technology used to drill, construct and operate wells are lagging the recovery in U.S. shale producers. The lopsided situation could chill the production rebound or keep it from spreading to more shale fields, executives of services companies said.
Rising demand for certain services means raising salaries to attract workers and refurbishing equipment, while often being paid under fixed contracts signed during harder times, these companies said. That has pressured margins, leading to further losses. Law firm Haynes and Boone LLP said the U.S. oilfield sector experienced 127 bankruptcies between 2015 and April 2017. 
Among the 10 largest oilfield service providers, just five were profitable last quarter, the same number as a year ago. In contrast, seven of the top shale oil producers posted a first quarter profit, up from just one a year ago. 
""Both of us have to be able to earn a return and give something back to our shareholders,"" David Lesar, chief executive officer of  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL), the world's second-largest oilfield services company, said in an interview. 
The sector is struggling to change onerous contract terms set when oil prices were much lower. Service companies agreed to those prices out of necessity; they needed cash flow to cover expenses. Those contracts, some of which extend into next year, are contributing to losses, preventing some companies from adding equipment or moving it to oil fields where it could be put to use.
The expiration of those contracts should allow prices for high-demand services to rise, oilfield services executives said.
Even so, some of the changes that shale oil producers made during the downturn are likely to stick, making it harder for service firms to drive up prices.
Oil producers have better returns today because of those cost controls, winning greater favor among investors.
""Many of (oil producers) have reduced capex spending and are increasing capital returns to investors,"" said Tom Bergeron, a senior fund manager for Frost Investment Advisors. 
Shale firms have demanded deals that unbundle the functions of service providers, allowing them to spread the work out among more companies, who then have less leverage to raise prices.
Those practices allowed shale producer profits to start rebounding just a few months after oil prices began to recover from the $26 a barrel nadir of February 2016 (Clc1). But it left services companies without a way to immediately benefit from the U.S. crude benchmark's return to about $50 a barrel.
Service companies hope they can raise prices by the second half of this year, but for now there is limited scope to pass along costs, Chakra Mandava, an operations executive at Nabors Drilling USA, (N:NBR), said at an energy conference this month in Houston. 
Nabors blamed its first quarter loss on an inability to offset costs for new staff and equipment.
Keane Group (N:FRAC), which supplies pressure pumping services, one of the highest demand services in the shale patch, reported a first-quarter loss due largely to long-term, fixed price contracts, despite a 59 percent jump in revenue from the fourth quarter. 
One proposal that might resolve the disconnect between oil price moves and contract changes is to tie deals to the cost of crude.
 Apache Corp  (N:APA), which plans to drill some 250 wells this year in the Permian Basin, is looking to tie what it pays for services to the U.S. crude benchmark (CLc1) - converting fixed service costs to a variable cost in order to cushion the hit to earnings of future oil-price changes. 
That way, if crude prices rise, Apache could afford to pay more for services, but would pay less if oil drops.  Chevron  (N:CVX) also is tying some of its contracts to indexes in a bid to remain competitive, the company said at a recent security analysts meeting.
""We're just opening up the business model to what's possible,"" Michael Behounek, a senior drilling advisor for Apache, said in May at a drilling conference in Houston. ""We want to put a dampener in place."" 

""They [service companies] don't want to ride the roller coaster either. If we go down this route, it might be good for both parties.""

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for June delivery rose 0.74% to $51.74 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 0.80% to $54.39 a barrel.
The schedule sees the opening session at 10:00 a.m. local time, an hour behind London, for the OPEC leg of the meeting which will end for lunch and then a 3:00 p.m. start for OPEC and key producers with a press conference scheduled at 5:00 p.m.
FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga said oil prices remained caught between optimism over the OPEC-led deal and U.S. shale limiting upside gains.
""I believe that U.S. shale is a significant threat to the OPEC deal, especially when considering how the surging output from the U.S. has seized market share from other OPEC members ... While it may be too early to say that this is the end of OPEC, U.S. shale has considerably weakened the cartel's grip on the global markets,"" Otunuga said in a note.
OPEC is widely expected to extend an initial six-month oil output cut pact with allied producers led by Russia to March 2018 at a meeting in Vienna on Thursday that still may produce surprises on new producers joining and a more aggressive tone on compliance.
IHS Energy vice president Victor Shum said supply and demand will be balanced for the rest of 2017 with no sharp drawdowns in inventories even with the production cut extended for another six to nine months. Longer or deeper cuts will take ""a lot of time and a lot of diplomacy,"" he said.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih has led the charge as the world's top exporter and swing producer for the nearly 1.8 million barrels per day cut started in January and agreed to last November that quickly brought prices above $50 a barrel and unleashed a rapid supply response by then struggling U.S. shale oil producers.
Falih said on Monday he expected the new deal to be similar to the old one, ""with minor changes.""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said the market had priced in a nine-month extension.
""The inclusion of smaller producing non-OPEC countries such as Turkmenistan, Egypt and the Ivory Coast would be a negligible boost, in our view,"" Deutsche said. ""A deepening of cuts, though, has more potential to provide an upside surprise."" Still, OPEC is far from cohesive as a cartel with Iran and Saudi Arabia often at loggerheads on other diplomatic issues, while other countries have seemed to pay lip service to the cuts and used the situation to gain market share instead.
Overnight, crude futures settled lower on Wednesday, despite the release of a bullish report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), showing U.S. crude inventories fell more than expected in the previous week, extending the dip in U.S. crude stockpiles to a sixth-straight week.
For the week ended May 19, the EIA said that crude oil inventories fell by 4.43 million barrels, compared to expectations of a draw of around 2.4 million barrels.
Meanwhile, gasoline inventories dropped by only 0.485 million against expectations for a draw of 0.74 million barrels while distillate stockpiles fell by 0.485 million barrels, compared to expectations of a 0.74 million decline.
The lower than expected drawdown in gasoline inventories offset the large drop in crude inventories, as investors remained concerned over the recent slowdown in gasoline demand.
The data came a day ahead of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meeting on whether to extend the current supply-cut agreement.
Crude futures have soared above $50 a barrel, as investors optimism grew that OPEC would seek to extend the supply-cut agreement for a prolonged period.
Kuwait, Iraq, Oman and Venezuela supported the Saudi-Russia agreement that production curbs needed to be extended for a period of nine-months until March 2018, to reduce global supply to the five-year average.""There has been a marked reduction to the inventories, but we're not where we want to be in reaching the five-year average,"" Falih said last week.
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Issam Almarzooq, however, said Tuesday some countries are not in favour of a nine-month extension, but there’s a preliminary agreement on a six-month deal that will be reviewed in November.

1466,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2017 02:45PM ET</span>","OPEC, non-OPEC set for new oil cut, eye longer duration","By Ahmad Ghaddar, Alex Lawler and Vladimir Soldatkin
VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC and non-member oil producers are set to extend output cuts on Thursday, possibly by as long as 12 months, to help clear a global stocks overhang and prop up crude prices.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is to discuss in Vienna whether to prolong an accord reached in December in which it and 11 non-members agreed to cut oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day in the first half of 2017.
The market sees an extension by nine months - instead of the initially suggested six months - as the base-case scenario.
OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, has said it favors such a move to speed up market rebalancing and prevent oil prices from sliding back below $50 per barrel.
Saudi ally Kuwait signalled on Wednesday OPEC could discuss deepening the cuts, in what would come as a positive surprise for market bulls.
But hopes quickly faded after a joint OPEC and non-OPEC committee recommended keeping the curbs unchanged for nine months.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih gave the thumbs up when asked whether the committee had agreed on a nine-month extension, but his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak surprised later by saying a 12-month prolongation was also on the table.
""The recommendation is to keep current quotas ... The duration is nine months. Tomorrow we will discuss the possibility of extending by another three months (to June 2018),"" Novak said. 
Iraq also said the 12-month option - an unusually long duration for an OPEC cut - was on the table.
By 1738 GMT, Brent crude was trading down almost 0.5 percent, below $54 a barrel. [O/R]
""OPEC has already achieved a lot. They stopped the oil market surplus from building even before they started cutting,"" said Gary Ross, head of global oil at PIRA Energy, a unit of S&P Global Platts. 
Amrita Sen of consultancy Energy Aspects said: ""If OPEC can ease fears about 2018 balances, that will also help the upside to prices in 2017.""
Most OPEC ministers including those from Iraq and Iran had already voiced support for extending cuts by nine months.
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh, who had clashed with Saudi Arabia in many previous OPEC meetings, said in Vienna that OPEC seemed to have built a consensus around nine months.
""I would go along with the majority,"" Zanganeh said.
Under the existing deal, Iran received an exemption slightly to raise output, which has been curtailed by years of Western sanctions. Iran's production has been stagnant in recent months, suggesting limited upside potential at least in the short term.
FOCUS ON EXPORTS
OPEC's cuts have helped push oil back above $50 a barrel this year, giving a fiscal boost to producers, many of which rely heavily on energy revenues and have had to burn through foreign-currency reserves to plug holes in their budgets.
Oil's earlier price decline, which started in 2014, forced Russia and Saudi Arabia to tighten their belts and led to unrest in some producing countries including Venezuela and Nigeria.
Surprises on Thursday are still possible.
A substantial additional cut was unlikely, one OPEC delegate said, ""unless Saudi Arabia initiates it with the biggest contribution and is supported by other Gulf members"".
The price rise this year has spurred growth in the U.S. shale industry, which is not participating in the output deal, thus slowing the market's rebalancing with global stocks still near record highs.
OPEC has a self-imposed goal of bringing stocks down from a record high of 3 billion barrels to their five-year average of 2.7 billion. 
Algerian Energy Minister Noureddine Boutarfa said he believed stocks remained stubbornly large in the first half of 2017 because of high exports from the Middle East to the United States.
""Thankfully, things are improving and we started seeing a draw in inventories in the United States,"" Boutarfa said, adding he believed that inventories should decline to their five-year average by the end of 2017.
Exports will be a key focus on Thursday as OPEC members recognize that their own destocking has led inventories to fall less than expected, Sen of Energy Aspects said:
""We believe there will be a push to stop destocking by OPEC producers and hence reduce exports.""

Market analysts' expected a crude-stock decline of around 2.4 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply-drop of 1.5 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 741,000 barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 516.3 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be at the upper half of the average range for this time of year.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories declined by 787,000 barrels, compared to expectations for a fall of about 1.1 million barrels.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a decline of 485,000 barrels.
Oil was higher in overnight trade after a joint OPEC and non-OPEC committee recommended a nine-month extension to the production cut agreement that is set to expire in June.
In a statement, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers who have taken part in the agreement said the recommendation ""reaffirms the commitment of OPEC and participating non-OPEC countries to continue to cooperate for the benefit of producers and consumers alike.""
A final decision will be taken by the oil cartel on Thursday.
In November last year, OPEC and 11 other non-OPEC producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January 1 and June 30.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.
The U.S. rig count rose for the 18th week in a row to the highest level since April 2015 last week, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for June inched down 0.2 cents, or 0.1%, to $1.662 a gallon, while June heating oil advanced 0.9 cents to $1.616 a gallon.

U.S. natural gas for July delivery slumped 1.6 cents, or around 0.5%, to $3.296 per million British thermal units by 8:45AM ET (12:45GMT).
Prices of the heating fuel tumbled 11.2 cents on Tuesday amid bearish weather forecasts.
The latest U.S. weather model called for mild temperatures over the next two weeks, which should reduce demand during that time.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.369 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 13.6% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 10.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
The EIA's next storage report due Thursday is expected to show a build in a range between 59 and 69 billion cubic feet in the week ended May 19.
That compares with a gain of 68 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 71 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 90 billion cubic feet.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2017 08:29AM ET</span>",Oil prices steady as market awaits extended output cut,"By Christopher Johnson
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Wednesday as investors waited for news from Vienna where ministers from OPEC and other exporting countries were discussing whether to extend production cuts into the first quarter of next year.
Benchmark Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was up 10 cents a barrel at $54.25 by 1210 GMT (8:10 a.m. ET). U.S. light crude oil (CLc1) was unchanged at $51.47.
Both crude benchmarks have gained more than 10 percent from their May lows below $50 a barrel, rebounding on a consensus that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers will maintain strict limits on oil production in an attempt to drain a global oversupply.
OPEC has promised to cut supplies by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until June and is expected on Thursday to decide to prolong that cut by up to nine months.
""It could be three, six or nine months,"" the Iranian Students' News Agency quoted Iran's oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, as saying.
Most investors expect an extension of nine months.
Sushant Gupta, research director at Wood Mackenzie, told Reuters Global Markets Forum that output cuts were likely to be extended until the first quarter of 2018, and that adherence by OPEC members to the output cuts would probably remain high. 
Harry Tchilinguirian, strategist at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), agreed:
""With oil stocks nowhere near OPEC’s self-assigned objective of the recent five-year average level, an extension of cuts seems all but a forgone conclusion,"" he said.
BMI Research said the OPEC-led cuts would only result in a balanced market this year, but that from 2018 onward markets would return to oversupply, albeit at a lower level than 2013-2016.
""Over a five-plus-year horizon, oil price growth is in a structural slowdown, pressured by persistent supply gains,"" BMI Research said.
One reason why markets have not tightened more has been U.S. oil production, which has soared by 10 percent since mid-2016 to 9.3 million bpd. 
Benefiting from a market known as contango, in which future oil prices are higher than those for immediate delivery, U.S. drillers have sold future production in order to finance expanding output. 
To stop this, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) have suggested the oil futures price curve should be pushed into backwardation, where forward prices are below current ones. 

But while backwardation might be able to reduce inventories, it is less clear how OPEC could alter the forward price curve, or if that would stop production rising.

1477,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2017 01:30AM ET</span>",Trump's proposed U.S. oil reserve sale not an issue for OPEC: Goldman Sachs,"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump's proposal to sell half of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) will likely have little impact on OPEC's efforts to reduce a global oil glut, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said on Tuesday.
The White House budget, delivered to Congress on Tuesday, aims to start selling SPR oil in fiscal 2018, which begins on Oct. 1. Under the proposal, the sales would generate $500 million in the first year and gradually rise over the following years.
Goldman Sachs said such sales would only average around 110,000 barrels per day annually through 2027, 66,000 bpd between 2018-2020 and just 25,000 bpd this year.
""This is negligible relative to both the size of the OPEC cuts of 1.7 million bpd and the global oil market of 98 million bpd,"" the bank said in a note.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meets in Vienna on Thursday to consider whether to prolong cuts to reduce a global glut of crude. OPEC and other producing countries including Russia have cut output about 1.8 million bpd in the first half of 2017. 
Goldman Sachs said the proposed SPR sales would increase the logistical strains on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which is already struggling with higher shale production. 
The U.S. SPR, the world's largest, holds about 688 million barrels of crude oil in heavily guarded underground caverns in Louisiana and Texas. Congress created it in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo caused fears of long-term motor fuel price spikes that would harm the U.S. economy.

1481,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2017 07:00PM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers gear up to block Trump plan to slash oil stockpile,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Trump administration plan to sell off half the U.S. emergency crude oil stockpile to help balance the budget faces opposition in Congress, with lawmakers from both parties worried the proposal would undermine the drilling industry and make the country vulnerable to supply shocks. 
The White House's 2018 budget proposal, sent to Congress on Tuesday, proposes raising nearly $16.6 billion by 2027 by gradually selling millions of barrels from the reserve, which now holds about 688 million barrels of oil in underground caverns in Texas and Louisiana. News of the proposal had briefly sent oil prices tumbling on concern it would oversupply the market, but prices recovered and finished slightly higher on hopes that OPEC and other countries would extend supply cuts.
    ""We should not be selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve now,"" said Senator John Hoeven, a Republican from North Dakota, a leading oil producer state. ""We should use the SPR for emergencies, and selling now would disrupt the markets.""
The SPR sell-off plan is part of a broader White House proposal to balance the U.S. budget that is meant as starting point to debate policy with Congress - which will ultimately pass its own version. 
Whether the SPR proposal will survive the budget process could depend in part on Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a member of the appropriations committee and the head of the chamber's energy panel. In 2015, when Congress was considering selling a modest amount of oil from the reserve to help fund a transportation bill, Murkowski opposed the idea, saying the reserve should not be used as an ATM. 
Murkowski did not directly address the SPR plan in a statement on Tuesday, but she said ""a President's budget is more of a vision than anything else."" Efforts to reach Murkowski on Tuesday were not successful.
    Murkowski's Democratic counterpart on the energy panel, however, raised concerns that liquidating half of the reserve would run counter to the original purpose of the facility, which Congress created in 1975 to protect against global oil disruptions that could harm the U.S. economy. 
    ""We are not going to let Donald Trump auction off our energy security to the highest bidder,"" Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington said in an email.
The Arab oil embargo of the early 1970s led to chaos at U.S. filling stations and fears of long-term damage to the economy.
Much has changed since then: U.S. oil production has surged in recent years and supply from Canada has increased, displacing a large portion of the imports from some less stable Middle Eastern suppliers.
U.S. oil imports from the producer group OPEC have fallen to less than 3.2 million bpd in 2016 from more than 5.4 million barrels per day in 2008, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Richard Newell, a former head of the EIA, noted that the plan could cause the United States to break its obligation as a member of the International Energy Agency to hold 90 days’ worth of oil imports on reserve. Currently, the SPR holds about 145 days’ worth of oil imports.   
""There are a number of possible scenarios under which reducing the SPR to the levels proposed would violate our IEA treaty obligations,"" he said. 
JOBS AND SECURITY
Lawmakers from both parties also said releasing oil from the SPR could dampen crude prices and hurt drilling companies still recovering from a price crash in 2014. Trump had campaigned on a promise to revive the drilling industry.
""Putting that much oil on the market, you will see a lot of layoffs in the energy business,"" said Representative Gene Green, a Democrat from Texas. 
Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and Budget told reporters on Tuesday, however, there are ways to tap the SPR slowly and ""telegraph it over the course of time"" to avoid having a dramatic impact on prices. 
Representative Pete Olson, a Texas Republican, said the SPR infrastructure needs improvement because tanks and other equipment are constantly exposed to corrosive salt air. But he did not rush to embrace a sell-off of oil, saying that the larger budget deserves careful scrutiny.

Some oil industry representatives also came out against the proposal. Randall Luthi, President of the National Ocean Industries Association said the plan to cut the SPR in half threatened national security. He added he also opposed a proposal in the budget to cut federal oil royalty payments to U.S. Gulf Coast states - funds meant to help them defend their coasts from hurricane damage.

1482,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2017 05:40PM ET</span>","Proposed U.S. oil reserve sales could boost, not hurt, OPEC's plan","By Catherine Ngai
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to sell 270 million barrels of oil from the U.S. petroleum reserve could have the unintended consequence of actually helping OPEC rebalance global petroleum markets.
OPEC meets in Vienna on Thursday. With other producing nations including Russia, the group is expected to agree to extend output cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day.
Even if Congress passes the proposed White House budget, the majority of sales from the U.S. reserve would take place years from now. Their timing might actually help OPEC reach some of its long-range goals of keeping the oil market balanced by limiting expectations of higher prices that could encourage future production.
The White House wants to raise funds by selling 270 million of the 688 million barrels of crude from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) from 2018 to 2027. Previous budgets already authorized sales totaling nearly 190 million barrels through 2025. That amounts to 65,000 barrels per day, or one very large crude carrier each month. 
Sales from the reserve under the proposal would start with $500 million in 2018 and rise gradually, peaking at nearly $3.9 billion in 2027. That would put about 74,000 bpd of additional oil into the market, a fraction of current U.S. production of 9.3 million bpd. 
The plan calls for sales to rise gradually, which would tend to pressure prices for oil delivered further in the future, making the contracts cheaper than those at the front of the futures curve. Oil traders call that phenomenon ""backwardation.""
Output cuts by OPEC and other producers have just started to bring down supply. But in a note this week, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said OPEC must do more than drain the glut to balance markets. It must also move the market into backwardation from contango, the current situation where crude contracts get more expensive further into the future.
Otherwise, U.S. shale producers will have an incentive to keep pumping at record levels, feeding more oil into the market and cutting OPEC's market share. If sales from the strategic reserve pressure far-dated futures contracts, shale producers would be less inclined to add more rigs.
""If you're bringing oil back into the market, that's going to pressure prices in the longer run,"" said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets. ""It dampens or mutes any swift moves to the upside given that selling SPR barrels will be lumpy in nature going forward."" 
In January, the first of several sales totaling 8 million barrels of light sweet crude was awarded.

Gasoline stocks fell by 3.15 million barrels and distillate inventories eased 1.85 million barrels.
The figures will be followed by official data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday. The API and EIA figures often diverge significantly.
Analysts expected crude inventories to drop by 2.733 million barrels, with distillates seen down 1.033 million barrels and gasoline stocks posting a 1.086 million barrels decline.
The oil storage hub at Cushing, Oklahoma saw supplies drop by 210,000 barrels, the seventh straight weekly decline.

1484,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2017 04:45PM ET</span>",OPEC set to prolong oil output cuts by nine months,"By Alex Lawler, Rania El Gamal and Ahmad Ghaddar
VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC is likely to extend production cuts for another nine months, ministers and delegates said on Tuesday as the oil producer group meets this week to debate how to tackle a global glut of crude.
OPEC's top producer, Saudi Arabia, favors extending the output curbs by nine months rather than the initially planned six months, as it seeks to speed up market rebalancing and prevent oil prices from sliding back below $50 per barrel.
On Monday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih won support from OPEC's second-biggest and fastest-growing producer, Iraq, for a nine-month extension and said he expected no objections from anyone else.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in Vienna on Thursday to consider whether to prolong the deal reached in December in which OPEC and 11 non-members, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day in the first half of 2017.
The decision pushed prices back above $50 per barrel, giving a fiscal boost to major oil producers. But it also spurred growth in the U.S. shale industry, which is not participating in the output deal, thus slowing the market's rebalancing.
Saudi Arabia's Gulf ally Kuwait said on Tuesday not every OPEC member was on board yet for an extension to March 2018, but most ministers and delegates in Vienna said they expected a fairly painless meeting.
Ecuador Oil Minister Carlos Perez said OPEC and other oil-producing countries would discuss a six- or nine-month extension to output cuts and probably choose the latter.
""Six and nine months are both proposals on the table ... we will support the majority, probably the nine months,"" Perez, whose country is in OPEC, told reporters after arriving in Vienna on Tuesday.
Asked whether deeper cuts would be discussed, he said: ""Not at this point, I don’t think so.""
Noureddine Boutarfa, energy minister of OPEC member Algeria, said OPEC was discussing a possible nine-month extension, with curbs kept at the same level as under the group's existing deal.
""Right now we are talking about nine months,"" Boutarfa told reporters in the Austrian capital. Falih also arrived in Vienna on Tuesday but made no comment to reporters.
""The Saudi oil minister's view seems accurate and no serious objection is expected if at all,"" said one OPEC delegate, who asked not to be identified as he is not allowed to speak to the media. ""No surprises,"" said a second delegate.
UPSIDE SURPRISE
Many OPEC meetings in recent years witnessed bitter fights between Saudi Arabia and its rival Iran, OPEC's third-largest oil producer.
Tehran has kept relatively quiet in the past few weeks, saying it saw a need to extend cuts. Iran is emerging from a presidential election won by the incumbent, Hassan Rouhani.
""It has been some time since we had such a strong consensus going into an OPEC meeting,"" BNP Paribas's commodities strategist Harry Tchilinguirian said.
""Despite a supply cut extension being factored in by the market, oil prices have made only modest progress. It may take more than an extension to rekindle bullish spirits,"" he added.
Oil prices initially fell 1 percent on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed to sell half of the United States' Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the next 10 years as well as to speed up Alaskan exploration. 
By 1550 GMT, Brent crude was up 13 cents at $54.00 a barrel as most analysts said the sale would not affect immediate OPEC efforts.
Two OPEC sources said a one-year extension was also an option, though others said most discussions were centering on nine months due to weak seasonal demand in the first quarter.
Saudi's Falih said on Monday he expected the new deal to be similar to the old one, ""with minor changes"". 
""He (Falih) has talked to several countries including Norway, including Turkmenistan, including Egypt, and they have made signs of their willingness to join the collaboration,"" Kuwait's oil minister Essam al-Marzouq said on Tuesday.
Norway's oil ministry said later on Tuesday it had no plan to join cuts but had a good dialogue with OPEC.
Deutsche Bank said the market had priced in a nine-month extension.

""The inclusion of smaller producing non-OPEC countries such as Turkmenistan, Egypt and the Ivory Coast would be a negligible boost, in our view,"" Deutsche said. ""A deepening of cuts, though, has more potential to provide an upside surprise.""

Kuwaiti Oil Minister Issam Almarzooq said some countries are not in favour of a nine-month extension, but there’s a preliminary agreement on a six-month deal that will be reviewed in November.
OPEC is expected to decide at talks on Thursday, whether to extend the current deal to cut production.
Meanwhile, In the U.S., the White House included in its budget proposal, a plan to sell half of the nation's 688 million-barrel oil stockpile from 2018 to 2027, as it aims to raise $16.5 billion to reduce the budget deficit.
Investors’ concerns over the impact of the budget proposal was minimal, as the budget is only a proposal and may not take effect in its current form.
U.S. crude stockpiles remained in focus, as investors awaited the release of inventories data from The American Petroleum Institute at 16:30 EDT, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration at 10:30 EDT on Wednesday, expected to show U.S. crude stockpiles fell for a sixth-straight week.

According to investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool, nearly 80% of traders expect the Fed to hike interest rates in June, compared to only 67% of traders in the previous week.
The jump in June rate hike expectations came against the backdrop of weaker than expected economic data, which failed to offset June rate hike expectations, as treasury yields and the dollar rose to session highs, reducing investor sentiment to hold bullion.
IHS Markit flash U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell to its lowest level in eight months with a reading of 52.5, while its services (PMI) soared to a four-month high with a reading of 54, which was above economists’ forecasts.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector; below 50 indicates contraction.
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Depart said sales of newly constructed homes fell in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 569,000. That was below analysts’ estimates of a drop to 610,000.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices inched up on Tuesday in volatile trading as expectations of an extension to OPEC-led supply cuts and another drop in U.S. crude inventories overshadowed a White House proposal to sell half the country's petroleum reserves.
Brent crude (LCOc1) traded up 9 cents at $53.96 per barrel by 11:49 a.m. U.S. light crude (CLc1) was up 12 cents at $51.25.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meets in Vienna on Thursday to consider whether to prolong the deal reached in December in which OPEC and 11 non-members, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day in the first half of 2017.

""It continues to be a momentum driven trade ahead of OPEC’s meeting,"" said Tony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging. ""We continue to build in what the market expects is an extension of cuts.""
U.S. crude oil inventories were seen falling for the seventh straight week, dropping 2.7 million barrels in the week to May 19, according to analysts ahead of weekly inventory reports from the industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) and the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA). [EIA/S]
Earlier in the session oil prices dropped on the White House plan to sell off half of the nation's 688 million-barrel oil stockpile from 2018 to 2027 that aims to raise $16.5 billion and help balance the budget.
The budget, to be delivered to Congress on Tuesday, is only a proposal and may not take effect in its current form.
""Congress needs to agree to this which is rather uncertain,"" said Carsten Fritsch, commodity analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The White House proposal would roll out over a 10-year period so the sales would only average less than 100,000 bpd, said James Williams, president of energy consultant WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas.
Aside from the first day of the roll out, a one-time spike in supply, ""the impact on prices would be negligible,"" he said. ""This is a little over one tenth of one percent of global daily consumption - that does not move markets.""

Releasing reserves would add supplies to already high and rising U.S. production . U.S. crude production has climbed 10 percent since mid-2016 to 9.3 million barrels per day, close to levels from top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2017 10:50AM ET</span>","'War on sugar' takes toll; Asia, Brazil struggle to make up shortfall","By Ana Ionova and Chris Prentice
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The ""war on sugar"" being waged by governments and consumers to combat public health emergencies like diabetes is slowing growth in global demand, which along with other factors could signal a fundamental shift in consumption ahead.
Consumption may grow at its slowest pace in seven years in 2017/18, according to analyst group Platts Kingsman. It forecasts a rise of 1.04 percent, nearly half the average growth of about 2 percent per year over the last decade.
""Consumption is generally stagnating in developed countries,"" Tom McNeill, director at commodity analyst group Green Pool, told Reuters. 
Falling consumption in more health-conscious markets has been exacerbated by higher prices and the use of alternatives like high-fructose corn syrup in developing countries that might otherwise have made up the shortfall.
(For graphic on sugar withdrawal, click http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/SUGAR-CONSUMPTION/0100416C2K6/SUGAR-CONSUMPTION-01.jpg)
Combined with weaker demand from food and beverage makers globally, this could represent a ""step-change lower"" - or a fundamental shift - in global consumption, according to Tropical Research Services. 
""So, it may be that the real long-term 'trend' rate of global sugar demand growth has changed and is now lower,"" the group said in a May 7 report.
At least 17 countries and a number of U.S. cities have added an extra tax on sweetened beverages. Another 11 nations are implementing or considering similar levies.
Many are going further: France has coupled a tax with measures like banning vending machines in schools. Chile last year introduced black stop-sign warning labels on foods high in sugar, salt and fat. 
Mexico is another example. With one in three adults in the country affected by obesity, the country slapped a levy on sweetened soft drinks in 2014.
Although the impact on health will take years to assess, early data shows consumption of soft drinks in Mexico has fallen by 12 percent since the tax was introduced. 
""There is an increasing understanding for the need to control intake of free sugars, in public policy and in culture in general,"" said Francesco Branca, director of nutrition for health and development at the World Health Organization.
""With obesity and diabetes very quickly spreading, they are trying to do something about it early on."" 
The slowing pace of growth globally is adding to worries the world sugar market is headed for a surplus in 2017/18, after two consecutive deficits. [nL5N1H03Y2] 
It could also curtail ambitious plans by the European Union to sharply boost output in 2017/18 in an effort to again become a net exporter, after it ends subsidies and caps on exports in October. [nL5N1H03Y2]
INDIA, CHINA AND BRAZIL
High-income countries like Norway and Canada are already seeing a decline in sugar consumption, Euromonitor figures shows. Now the appetites of developing markets, whose rapid population growth was expected to drive future growth, also appear to be waning.
Sugar sales in India, the world's biggest consumer, are set to fall by roughly 1 million tonnes this season, the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) estimates, due to higher domestic prices and a cash crunch that followed last year's demonetisation of high-value bank notes. [nL8N1HX4HV]
The government's decision earlier this year to abolish a sugar subsidy for poor families also dented consumption.
ISMA expects consumption to rebound next year as production in the country normalizes and domestic prices come down, but analysts say long-term growth remains uncertain as the government mulls higher taxes and stricter labeling on sugary foods. [nL3N1GT3TU]
""If India also jumps on the bandwagon with such a levy, as the world's biggest sugar consumer, this could be felt in global growth,"" said Stefan Uhlenbrock, senior analyst at F.O. Licht.
Sugar demand also seems to be stagnating in China, the second biggest consuming country, as cheaper sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) grow in popularity.
Chinese beet and cane farmers rely on state support to offset steep production costs. Imports, meanwhile, are subject to hefty duties meant to protect the industry, with an additional tariff introduced just this week. [nL4N1IO1J8]
As a result, domestic sugar prices are around double those on the world market. This, coupled with an abundance of cheap corn, has made HFCS highly competitive. 
The USDA last month highlighted the decline in Chinese sugar demand when it slashed its estimates for consumption in that country for 2015/16 and 2016/17 by roughly 10 percent and signaled more modest growth than previously expected. 
""People in China are still eating ice cream and drinking soft drinks,"" said John Stansfield, analyst at commodity trader Group Sopex. 
""It's just the fact that these products are now increasingly made from corn syrup rather than sugar.""
Brazil, the world's third largest consuming nation, has also seen demand growth slow over the last three years as an enduring recession slashed the incomes of many Brazilians. Consumption was growing at roughly 2-3 percent over the previous decade. 
SODA AND CONFECTIONARY
Manufacturers seem to think the anti-sugar movement is here to stay, and many food and beverage companies are pre-emptively reformulating their products as a result. 
Coca-Cola (N:KO) has committed to reducing sugar in its drinks, with more than 200 reformulation initiatives underway. [nL4N1CW3UT]
PepsiCo (N:PEP) also said that by 2025 at least two-thirds of its drinks globally will have 100 calories or fewer from added sugar per 12-oz serving. [nL1N1CK13C]
Nestle (S:NESN) said in 2016 it is developing technology to reduce sugar in some confectionary products by up to 40 percent without affecting the taste. [nL8N1DW1D3]

""Globally, sugar is in the spotlight,"" said Sara Petersson, nutrition analyst at Euromonitor. ""The regulations are increasing with time. And if they're being smart, they're going to tackle this in advance.""

U.S. natural gas for July delivery slumped 3.7 cents, or around 1.1%, to $3.387 per million British thermal units by 8:50AM ET (12:50GMT).
Prices of the heating fuel rallied 7.1 cents on Monday after the latest U.S. weather model called for cooler temperatures through the end of the month, which should increase demand during that time.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.369 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 13.6% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 10.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 59 and 69 billion cubic feet in the week ended May 19.
That compares with a gain of 68 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 71 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 90 billion cubic feet.

Elsewhere, Brent oil for July delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 7 cents to $53.81 a barrel, after climbing to its highest since April 19 at $54.37 in the prior session.
Oil's gains on Monday came amid growing expectations that OPEC members will extend supply cuts for a prolonged period when they meet later this week.
Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producing countries will meet in Vienna on Thursday to decide whether to extend their current production agreement beyond a June 30-deadline.
In November last year, OPEC and 11 other non-OPEC producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January 1 and June 30.
Most market analysts expect the oil cartel to extend output cuts for a further nine months until March 2018, instead of six months as previously expected.
There is also talk that OPEC is looking at the option of deepening current production cuts, but it is not clear whether there would be support for that.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.

1493,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2017 08:05AM ET</span>",U.S. plan to sell oil reserves undermines OPEC supply management efforts,"By Henning Gloystein
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's proposal to sell half of the United States' strategic oil reserve surprised energy markets on Tuesday since it counters OPEC's efforts to control supply in order to boost prices. 
The White House requested in its budget released late on Monday gradually selling off the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) starting in October 2018 to raise $16.5 billion. The U.S. SPR  holds 688 million barrels, making it the world's largest reserve, and a release of half over 10 years averages about 95,000 barrels per day (bpd), or 1 percent of current U.S. output.
The plan came out just a day after Trump left Saudi Arabia, the de-facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), as part of his first overseas trip.
The U.S. has more leeway to release the SPR crude as its own production  has surged 49 percent over the past five years. But the move undermines OPEC's efforts to tighten global oil markets by cutting their output this year and likely into 2018. 
""It will complicate the OPEC efforts to stabilize the market,"" said Anas Alhajji, an independent oil analyst and economist in the Reuters Global Markets Forum following the announcement.
The announcement pulled down front-month crude futures prices (LCOc1) (CLc1). [O/R]
However, the budget is not fixed since Congress has the final say and has rejected many White House proposals in the past.
COMPETING WITH SAUDI, RUSSIA
Following the oil shocks of the 1970s after the Arab oil embargo, members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) started building SPR sites to hold the equivalent to 90 days' worth of a country's daily demand.
The U.S. released supplies from the SPR amid supply concerns at the start of the Gulf War in 1991 and after Hurricane Katrina disrupted Gulf of Mexico output in 2005, and again 2011 amid concerns about lost Libyan supply. 
In December, Congress approved the sale of $2 billion of crude from the SPR to pay for maintenance and repairs. The U.S. Department of Energy sold 6.4 million barrels in January and another 10 million in February. 
The White House proposal would also open areas of Alaska's arctic region to exploration. That could raise production above 10 million bpd, up from 9.3 million bpd currently, putting the U.S. in competition with Saudi Arabia and Russia for the world's biggest oil producer.
Analysts say that soaring U.S. shale output is the reason for the greater security in its supply. 

""The U.S. has likely become more sanguine when it comes to having a very large SPR holding, given lofty medium term forecasts for the Permian basin,"" said Virendra Chauhan, oil analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects, referring to a large U.S. shale oil field.

1494,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2017 03:49AM ET</span>","Trump budget wants to halve oil stockpile, open Arctic refuge to drilling","By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's White House wants to sell half of the nation's emergency oil stockpile and open the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to drilling as part of plans to balance the budget over the next 10 years, documents by the administration showed.
The White House budget, which will be delivered to Congress on Tuesday, is meant as a proposal and may not take effect in its current form. But it reveals the administration's policy hopes, which include ramping up American energy output.
The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest, holds about 688 million barrels of crude oil in heavily guarded underground caverns in Louisiana and Texas. Congress created it in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo caused fears of long-term motor fuel price spikes that would harm the U.S. economy.
The Trump budget proposes to start selling SPR oil in fiscal year 2018, which begins on Oct. 1, with sales that would generate $500 million, according to the documents. The sales from the reserve would gradually rise over the following years, peaking at nearly $3.9 billion in 2027, and totaling nearly $16.6 billion from 2018 to 2027.
The announcement surprised oil markets, and pulled down U.S. crude prices for immediate delivery to just over $50 per barrel during Asian trading hours. [O/R]
Yet the bigger effect, if implemented, would be more long-term as it is planned to last a decade. The Brent forward curve <0#LCO:> shows prices rising toward $55.60 per barrel by April 2018, but then declining toward $53.75 per barrel by late 2018.
The White House budget plan, released just after Trump left Saudi Arabia, the defacto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is seen as undermining OPEC-led plans to tighten global markets by cutting production, and points toward a future of ongoing ample supplies.
ARCTIC DRILLING
The Trump budget would also seek to raise $1.8 billion over the coming decade by leasing oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, the largest protected wilderness in the United States, believed to hold rich reserves of crude.
Increased drilling in Alaska would add to rising U.S. oil production which, largely thanks to shale, has jumped over 10 percent since mid-2016 to 9.3 million barrels per day.
U.S. politicians have been debating whether to open the reserve in northeastern Alaska to drilling since the 1970s, with opponents citing the risk of spills and the contribution to global climate change.
Trump has already moved to expand U.S. offshore drilling, including in parts of the Arctic, as part of his broader effort to support the oil and gas industries. He has also moved to trim the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including by proposing a more than 30 percent cut to its funding.
Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, told reporters on Monday that the overall budget proposal was part of an effort to help the U.S. economy grow at a rate of 3 percent a year.
""It drives our tax reform policy, our regulatory policy, trade, energy ... everything is keyed toward getting us back to 3 percent,"" he said.
The White House did not immediately respond to questions about the energy-related budget proposals.
Trump's budget would also restart a nuclear waste fund that would bring in more than $3 billion by 2027.
The Obama administration stopped charging nuclear energy utilities the fee in 2014 after it stopped the licensing process for Nevada's Yucca Mountain - a waste dump that cost the government billions of dollars but never opened.

Comex gold futures firmed at $1,261.43 a troy ounce by 3:10AM ET (07:10GMT). Meanwhile, spot gold was at $1,261.60. Prices of the yellow metal rose to an overnight peak of $1,263.80, just shy of a three-week high of $1,265.00.
Police said an explosion at the end of a concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande in the English city of Manchester on Monday killed at least 19 people and injured more than 50.
Two U.S. officials said a suicide bomber was suspected, while Prime Minister Theresa May said the incident was being treated as a terrorist attack.
If confirmed, it would be the deadliest militant assault in Britain since four British Muslims killed 52 people in suicide bombings on London's transport system in July 2005.
Gold has been well-supported in recent sessions as political uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration pressured the dollar lower.
Investor sentiment has been hit by fears that the U.S. political system could become engulfed by crisis, preventing lawmakers from pushing through tax or spending reforms.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was at 96.83 in London morning trade. It fell to a six-month low of 96.70 on Monday, having given up all the gains it had made following the election in November.

Most market analysts expect the oil cartel to extend output cuts for a further nine months until March 2018, instead of six months as previously expected.
There is also talk that OPEC is looking at the option of deepening current production cuts, but it is not clear whether there would be support for that.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2017 04:20PM ET</span>",Glencore predicts OPEC insulated from electric vehicle impact,"By Barbara Lewis
ZUG, Switzerland (Reuters) - OPEC nations that deliver some of the lowest cost production will be relatively insulated from an early peak in oil demand caused by any faster-than-expected roll-out of electric vehicles, Glencore's chairman said on Monday.
Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meet this week in Vienna to decide whether to extend output cuts to reduce oversupply.
 Glencore  (LON:GLEN) is among the mining companies that anticipate electric vehicles could have a much earlier impact than previously thought, which is beneficial to them as suppliers of copper, cobalt and other minerals, but negative for oil firms.
""Historically the view was oil demand would increase beyond 2040,"" Glencore Chairman Tony Hayward, who was formerly head of oil major  BP  (LON:BP), told journalists at Glencore's headquarters in Zug.
""With the progress companies have made with electric vehicles, it's quite likely that (peak in oil demand) will come forward,"" he said.
""It's probably not very good news for the oil industry and quite good news for the mining industry.""
Asked whether OPEC still had the power to react to the potential glut in supply, he said expensive deepwater oil and Canadian tar sands, rather than OPEC crude, would be forced out of the market.
""OPEC ultimately has the lowest cost curve in the market and there will be space for it in the market.""
Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg said it was good for Glencore that its portfolio contained little oil and he saw the potential for a doubling in demand for copper.
That is one of the commodities whose supply Glencore dominates, with production of around 1.4 million tonnes, rising to 1.8 million tonnes, when capacity is increased in Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia in 2018 and 2019. 
Glasenberg said that if the world manages to achieve a 90-95 percent share of electric vehicles by 2035, that could nearly double world copper consumption from around 23 million tonnes per year now.

The International Energy Agency has said it will review its electric vehicle (EV) use and oil demand forecasts after India and China flagged new policies in favour of electric cars and vehicles using other alternatives to gasoline.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday as growing confidence that top exporters would agree to extend supply curbs this week and speculation that the cuts could be deepened further pushed prices to their highest levels in more than a month.
Brent futures rose 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $53.87 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for June rose 40 cents, or 0.8 percent, to settle at $50.73 per barrel on its last day as the front-month.
Both contracts plus WTI futures for July delivery, which will soon be the U.S. front-month, closed at their highest levels since April 18.
Both benchmarks climbed for an eighth time in the last nine trading days, putting the contracts up about 16 percent from five-month lows hit earlier this month.
Prices have risen on expectations the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, would extend a deal at their meeting on May 25 to cut supplies by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) for another six or nine months.
""The decision (to extend cuts) seems to be almost a done deal,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets. ""There seems to be a very high harmony in the group."" 
Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih paid a rare visit to Iraq on Monday in the latest effort by the top oil producer to convince its fellow OPEC member to extend supply cuts for a further nine months to ease the global glut and prop up prices.
OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said on Monday that he saw a growing consensus among the group's members as well as non-OPEC producers on the duration of an extension.
The possibility of deeper cuts was also being discussed ahead of a meeting of OPEC and other producers in Vienna on Thursday, sources said.
But such talk could lead to disappointment if not approved, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said.
""If the cuts are merely to be extended, this is likely to be met at best with a neutral reception, if not even with disappointment,"" Commerzbank said in a note.
Some analysts argue that deeper cuts are required to balance the market, but note the cuts so far have stimulated U.S. energy companies to boost shale production.
""We see risks for a renewed surplus later next year if OPEC and Russia’s production rises to their expanding capacity and shale grows at an unbridled rate,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note.
U.S. energy companies added oil rigs for an 18th week in a row, the second-longest such streak on record, as higher crude prices motivated drillers to boost monthly shale production to its highest since mid-2015.
U.S. oil production has already climbed by 10 percent, or almost 900,000 bpd, since mid-2016 to 9.3 million bpd.
In addition, deeper OPEC cuts and higher oil prices could force some consumers to look for alternative suppliers and sources of energy.

India's petroleum and natural gas minister said Monday the country is considering U.S. and Canadian suppliers, as well as encouraging it to turn to renewable energy.

U.S. natural gas for July delivery jumped 5.1 cents, or around 1.5%, to $3.404 per million British thermal units by 9:15AM ET (13:15GMT).
Prices of the heating fuel rallied 7.3 cents on Friday after the latest U.S. weather model called for cooler temperatures over the next two weeks, which should increase demand during that time.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.369 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 13.6% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 10.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 59 and 69 billion cubic feet in the week ended May 19.

1509,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2017 07:41AM ET</span>",China slaps import duties on sugar; experts question impact,"By Dominique Patton and Hallie Gu
BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Monday it will impose hefty penalties on sugar imports after lobbying by domestic mills, but experts said the ruling may not go far enough to stem the flow of lower-priced sweetener into the world's top importer. 
The ruling, which will affect about a third of China's annual sugar imports, introduces an extra tariff for the next three years on shipments that the government said had ""seriously damaged"" the domestic industry.
The move could dent imports from top growers such as Brazil and Thailand as it will close the big gap between Chinese and international prices. Chinese sugar prices are around double those on the London market.
But traders said the higher tariffs will also likely spur increased smuggling across China's porous southern border, while some imports from major producers may be shipped through third-party nations excluded from the tariffs.
Sugar is one of the few sectors in which China struggles to compete given the higher costs of its smallholder farmers, who produce about 10.5 million tonnes of cane and beet sugar a year.
The country imports another 3 million tonnes of the sweetener a year, while Beijing has been trying to crack down on illegal shipments of as much as 2 million tonnes a year, sources have said.
""While smuggling has temporarily slowed, there is a risk that the incentives for smuggling are still strong and in fact could increase if domestic prices rise,"" said Tom McNeill, director of Green Pool Commodities in Brisbane.
The latest ruling exempted about 190 smaller countries and regions from the new duty, including smaller producers such as the Philippines and Pakistan as well as Myanmar on its southern border.
""Of course it will support the domestic industry for a short time,"" said a China-based trader. ""(But) the global raw sugar market just needs to drop a little below 15 cents"" to make it profitable to import into China.
Global raw sugar prices  were at 17 cents per lb on Friday.
IMPACT MUTED
China currently allows 1.94 million tonnes of imports at a tariff of 15 percent as part of its commitment to the World Trade Organization.
Imports beyond this attract a 50 percent levy. Monday's ruling will add an extra 45 percent duty to these imports in the current fiscal year, China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement, taking the total to 95 percent. This will fall to 90 percent next year and 85 percent a year later. 
The measures may also increase pressure on Beijing to sell more of its state reserves to prevent supplies tightening and prices spiking.
Sugar futures  initially fell more than 1 percent on the news as traders interpreted the move, which was in line with a draft proposal issued in April, as too lenient to staunch shipments. They were trading down 0.6 percent at 0650 GMT. 
Thailand, the world's third largest producer, played down the impact of the duty. 
Its millers have a much lower shipping cost to China than rivals, Brazil and Australia, said Viboon Panitwong, chairman of the Thai Sugar Millers Corp Ltd, who did not expect the duty to significantly affect sugar exports.
Thailand exports about 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes of sugar to China a year, but sells much more to Cambodia and Myanmar, which then re-export sweetener to other countries.

1510,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2017 07:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump EPA transition chief laments slow progress in killing green rules,"By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The man who led President Donald Trump's transition team for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Myron Ebell, told a conservative conference last month that the new administration is moving too slowly to unravel climate change regulations.
In closed-door remarks to members of the conservative Jefferson Institute in Virginia on April 18, a recording of which was obtained by Reuters, Ebell said Trump's administration had made a series of missteps, including delays in appointing key EPA officials, that could hamper efforts to cut red tape for industry.
""This is an impending disaster for the Trump administration,"" Ebell, a prominent climate change doubter, said in the recording provided to the Center for Media and Democracy and shared with Reuters.
Ebell was chosen by Trump's campaign to lead the EPA's transition until the Jan. 20 inauguration, a choice that had reinforced expectations Trump would follow through on promises to rescind Obama-era green rules and pull the United States out of a global pact to fight climate change.
Ebell had been seen as a candidate for the EPA administrator job, a post that ultimately went to former Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. 
Ebell no longer works at the agency but remains influential within a faction of the U.S. conservative movement with ties to the Trump administration. His criticism reflects a broader disappointment by some conservatives about Pruitt's focus and commitment to scrapping even more complex Obama-era regulations. 
Since taking office, Trump and Pruitt have moved to unwind environmental regulations, including former President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generators.
But his administration has frustrated some conservatives by entertaining the idea of remaining in the Paris Climate Agreement, and hesitating to tackle the Obama-era ""endangerment finding"" that concludes carbon dioxide is a public health threat and underlies many U.S. regulations governing emissions. Lawyers have said challenging that scientific finding could be time consuming and legally complex. 
Pruitt has said he does not want the United States to remain in the Paris agreement but he has not yet decided to tackle the endangerment finding. At least three conservative groups have filed petitions asking the EPA to overturn the finding.
""Paris and the endangerment finding are the two big outstanding issues. It’s the first wave of things that are necessary to turn this country around, particularly in the heartland states,"" Ebell said at the conference.
Ebell cited the slow pace of key EPA appointments, including deputy administrator and various assistant administrators, a lack of experienced personnel at the White House, deep ideological divisions between the president's close advisers, and an ""imperfect choice"" of EPA administrator, as the main reasons Trump was not acting more aggressively on climate rules.
He said Trump strategists should have allowed his transition team to roll out the full de-regulatory agenda before Trump took office, instead of delaying. ""The new president doesn’t have long before inertia sets in,"" he said.
He also found fault in Trump's choice of Pruitt to run the EPA, saying the former state attorney is a ""clever lawyer"" but his ""political ambition"" may distract him from taking-on time-consuming efforts like challenging the endangerment finding. 
    A spokesman for Pruitt responded to Ebell's assertions, saying Pruitt had been implementing Trump's executive orders and had spearheaded ""about two dozen regulatory reform actions"" since taking up his position.
Ebell also faulted Trump for choosing advisers with broadly different political perspectives and backgrounds - something he said was triggering paralyzing debate, instead of action.
""He’s got people on different sides and they are all fighting over who gets these jobs and nobody has the clout except the president to say, 'Hey fix this, let’s get this done,'"" Ebell said. 
In a statement given to Reuters on Saturday, Ebell said he is still concerned about the White House log-jam in nominating people for key EPA posts and the delay in making the Paris decision.
But he said he supports Pruitt as an administrator and is encouraged by his recent actions.
""Pruitt was an excellent choice to head the EPA, and minor disagreements aside, his recent actions have made me even more confident that he will be an outstanding administrator,"" he said.

A White House official did not respond to a request for comment.

1511,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2017 06:37AM ET</span>",Carlyle battles insurers in New York over Moroccan oil losses,"By Julia Payne
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (NASDAQ:CG) is suing a group of its insurers over $400 million worth of oil it claims it lost when Morocco's sole refinery went bankrupt two years ago, court documents show.
Carlyle claims in a suit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York that insurance underwriters led by Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Underwriting (now known as MS Amlin) have reneged on their obligations when refusing to cover the losses, according to documents on the court's website.
Insurers have said in response to the suit that the nature of Carlyle's dealings with Samir, the refinery's operator, mean that its losses are not covered by the type of insurance it had. 
They also say Carlyle did not alert them early enough about the plant's financial troubles.
The rare public case provides an insight into dealings between insurers and commodity trading firms, which take big risks when supplying raw materials to clients in financial difficulty.
The case also sheds more light on the collapse of Samir, which became the biggest casualty of the oil price crash of 2014-2015, leaving some of the world's biggest trading firms including Carlyle with unpaid debts of over $1 billion.
Carlyle declined to comment on the position of the insurers. Samir and the Moroccan state-appointed liquidator for the refinery declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. 
Carlyle Commodity Management, a subsidiary of Carlyle Group formerly called Vermillion Asset Management, said in the court filing it had about 7 million barrels of crude and oil products stored at Morocco's 200,000 barrel per day refinery in Mohammedia in 2015 prior to its stoppage. 
The refinery was shut down in August 2015 after the Moroccan government imposed a $1.35 billion unpaid tax bill on Samir and froze its accounts. 
The crisis at the refinery unfolded as oil prices crashed from the middle of 2014, drastically reducing the value of oil Samir bought and held in its tanks for refining purposes.
Carlyle says that during 2015 Samir emptied the tanks without its consent.
Carlyle filed the first request for cover to its insurers in January 2016 concluding that the oil could not be recovered.
In late February this year, Carlyle's insurers denied any cover, leading Carlyle to launch a lawsuit against the underwriters in early March, according to the court documents. 
The litigation is still ongoing. 
In their answer to the claim, the underwriters said Carlyle's position in relation to Samir was as a lender and not as an oil supplier since the group never actually owned the oil it claims was stolen. 
Therefore, insurance cover for physical loss did not apply, the insurers argued, according to documents.
""As the transactions were financings rather than true sales of the commodities and Carlyle did not take title to the commodities, the loss or losses allegedly suffered by Carlyle was an uninsured credit loss,"" the insurers said in a response filed at end-April to the court in New York.
The insurers also allege that Carlyle breached its contract by not notifying the underwriters of payment problems.
""Carlyle has breached its contractual duties ... by failing to take any steps to mitigate the alleged loss or losses upon becoming aware that Samir had been processing the commodities,"" the counterclaim said.
""To the contrary, Carlyle entered into numerous additional transactions with Samir, thereby exacerbating the size of the alleged loss or losses by hundreds of millions of dollars.""

1512,By Investing.com,"<span>May 22, 2017 03:55AM ET</span>",Gold starts the week with modest gains as Trump worries support ,"Investing.com - Gold prices were modestly higher in European trade on Monday, starting the week off with small gains as investors continued to assess the impact of the latest bout of U.S. political turmoil.
Comex gold futures added $1.30, or about 0.1%, to $1,254.92 a troy ounce by 3:55AM ET (07:55GMT). Meanwhile, spot gold was at $1,255.33.
Prices of the yellow metal rose to $1,263.20 last Thursday, the most since May 1.
Gold notched a weekly gain of around 2% last week, the largest since mid-April, as political uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration pressured the dollar lower and boosted demand for safe-haven assets.
Investor sentiment has been hit by fears that the U.S. political system could become engulfed by crisis, preventing lawmakers from pushing through tax or spending reforms.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was up roughly 0.3% at 97.25 in London morning trade. It fell to a six-month low of 96.96 on Friday, having given up all the gains it had made following the election in November.
Meanwhile, investors will look ahead to Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting in the week ahead for further hints on the timing of the next U.S. rate hike.
In addition, a handful of Fed policymakers are due to make public appearances this week that may offer insight into the likelihood of higher interest rates in the months ahead.
Monday sees Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans make public appearances.
Market players will also keep an eye out on a revised reading of first-quarter U.S. growth data on Friday to gauge if the world’s largest economy is strong enough to withstand a rate hike as early as next month.
Futures traders are currently pricing in around a 75% chance of a hike at the Fed's June meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
Also on the Comex, silver futures advanced 19.9 cents, or about 1.2%, to $16.99 a troy ounce, after hitting its highest since May 1 at $17.17 earlier.
Elsewhere in metals trading, platinum shed 0.1% to $939.35, while palladium dipped 0.3% to $758.88 an ounce.
Copper futures shed 0.6 cents to $2.576 a pound.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude June contract tacked on 28 cents, or around 0.6%, to $50.95 a barrel by 2:35AM ET (06:35GMT). It rose to an overnight high of $51.26, a level not seen since April 21.
The U.S. benchmark gained $1.01 on Friday. It scored a weekly gain of $2.49, or about 5%, last week, the second straight weekly advance.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for July delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London added 26 cents to $53.87 a barrel, after climbing to its highest since April 19 at $54.17 earlier.
London-traded Brent futures jumped $1.10 in the prior session, to notch a gain of $2.77, or roughly 5.2%, last week.
Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producing countries will meet in Vienna on May 25 to decide whether to extend their current production agreement beyond a June 30-deadline.
In November last year, OPEC and 11 other non-OPEC producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January 1 and June 30.
Most market analysts expect the oil cartel to extend output cuts for a further nine months until March 2018, instead of six months as previously expected.
There is also talk that OPEC is looking at the option of deepening current production cuts, but it is not clear whether there would be support for that.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.
Data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed on Friday that U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 18th week in a row, the second-longest such streak on record, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The U.S. rig count rose by 8 to 720, extending an 11-month drilling recovery to the highest level since April 2015.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for June inched up 0.7 cents, or 0.4%, to $1.657 a gallon, while June heating oil advanced 0.3 cents to $1.589 a gallon.

1514,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2017 02:20AM ET</span>","From suspicion to engagement: OPEC, hedge funds and the Sistine Chapel","By Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - It was an unconventional venue for an unusual encounter.
In the Vatican's Sistine Chapel in the summer of 2016, OPEC's new secretary general Mohammed Barkindo bumped into Citigroup's global head of commodities research Ed Morse.
Their chat, at an energy industry event held in the Chapel, led to a series of meetings that have reshaped the way the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries interacts with the hedge funds and trading houses that influence world oil markets. 
Barkindo, elected to OPEC's top job in June 2016 to deal with an oil price slump, told Morse that OPEC wanted to better understand the way financial players worked in the oil markets.
It was a departure for OPEC from its long-held suspicion of such players. In the past it has routinely accused them of speculation that distorted oil prices, pushing them higher or lower than supply-demand fundamentals warrant. 
OPEC and non-OPEC oil ministers meet in Vienna on Thursday to decide whether to extend beyond June 30 their deal to reduce output, and perhaps deepen it, in an effort to support prices.
""It was at the Vatican that we first discussed the idea of OPEC reaching out to the financial players in the oil markets,"" Barkindo told Reuters.
""The world of oil has changed, including the fundamentals and its dynamics. And so must OPEC."" 
He said Morse helped organize a meeting for OPEC officials with hedge funds at the end of 2016. ""We went further to break the Berlin Wall with tight oil producers and met them in Houston in March,"" said Barkindo. Morse did not respond for a request for comment.
In separate meetings organized via different routes and facilitators, Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al Falih and his team held discussions with hedge funds. They also met top trading houses Vitol and Litasco in Vienna in November, ahead of the last OPEC meeting, according to market sources.
Falih's predecessor, the veteran Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, often took advice from oil market consultants, but had his own advice for hedge funds: leave the market alone.
""As the market got increasingly financialized, the Saudis and others at OPEC understood and accepted it is not just driven by fundamentals and decided it was worth engaging with those who move the market short-term,"" said Amrita Sen of consultancy Energy Aspects, which also often helps facilitate the dialogue between OPEC members and financial markets.
    
""WHATEVER IT TAKES""
The engagement with financial markets seems to be changing the tone of OPEC's public style. It now sometimes mimics the language of central bankers.
Over the past two months, Falih has twice used the phrase coined by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi five years ago in his successful bid to defend the euro.
OPEC will do ""whatever it takes"", to reduce an oil glut, was the message from Falih in April, repeated in a joint statement with Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak.
Hedge funds bought heavily into the oil market late last year as it became apparent OPEC would cut production. They have heavily sold those positions in recent weeks, stalling a recovery in oil prices near $50 a barrel, as they realized bloated world oil inventories would take longer than expected to shrink to normal levels.
""Even after a recent price correction, there is 700 million barrels of (investors') net length in the market,"" said Gary Ross, head of global oil at PIRA Energy, a unit of S&P Global Platts.
""It is exceptionally important for producers to understand the behavior of financial market players and what they think about future price trends.""
Non-OPEC Russia, having joined forces with OPEC to cut output, has also moved closer to the financial players.
Russian oil minister Novak surprised market watchers this year when his team held conference calls with investors about their oil market outlook, organized by banks such as  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) or Sberbank - something his predecessors never did.
    
""EXPLAINING THE LOGIC""
""One of the government's obligations is to explain to investors the logic of its decisions,"" said Novak's head analyst Pavel Sorokin, who previously worked for Morgan Stanley.
""As far as joint policies with OPEC are concerned, the market is always full of rumors. Hence we need to be in contact with the market and investors. We explain our market vision and are learning about reactions to certain events and decisions. But we don't discuss anything confidential,"" he added.
People who attended the discussions between Saudi officials and market players, including hedge funds and traders, said they detected no hint of Saudi intentions. 
One was at such a meeting in November, ahead of the last OPEC gathering. 
""They were listening a lot and said little. If you made a bet based on that meeting, you probably lost money,"" said the participant, who asked not to be named because the meeting was confidential.
Saudi officials told top independent U.S. oil firms at a closed-door meeting in March they should not assume OPEC would extend output curbs to offset rising production from U.S. shale fields.
Prices fell steeply on the comments, as investors assumed Saudis would not be willing to extend production cuts. A month later Falih promised ""whatever-it-takes"" steps, including extending cuts well into 2018.

""Producers naturally want financial players to be long, so the tricky part for producers is not to give financial players any ammunition to go short,"" said Ross.

1518,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2017 09:53AM ET</span>",OPEC heads towards supply cut extension as Saudi signals most on board,"By Reem Shamseddine and Marwa Rashad
RIYADH (Reuters) - OPEC and other oil producers are on course to agree an extension of supply cuts at a meeting on Thursday, with Saudi Arabia saying most participants are on board with the plan to rein in a global supply glut. 
Saudi Arabia's energy minister said on Sunday that extending the supply cuts by a further nine months until next March, and adding one or two small producers to the pact, should reduce oil inventories to their five-year average, a key gauge for OPEC to monitor the success of the initiative.
""Everybody I talked to... expressed support and enthusiasm to join in this direction, but of course it doesn’t preempt any creative suggestions that may come about,"" Khalid al-Falih told a news conference in Riyadh.
""We believe that continuation with the same level of cuts, plus eventually adding one or two small producers, if they wish to join, will be more than adequate to bring the five-year balance to where they need to be by the end of the first quarter 2018."" 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers agreed last year to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) for six months starting from Jan 1. 
Oil prices have gained support from reduced output, but high inventories and rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as the United States, have limited the rally, pressing the case for extending the curbs.
Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC member Russia, the world's top two oil producers, last week agreed on the need to prolong he current deal on cuts, which expires in June, until March 2018, pushing up prices.
On Friday, Brent crude LCOc1 closed up $1.10, or 2.1 percent, at $53.61, the highest settlement for the international benchmark since April 18.
With a nine-month extension now the minimum expectation for the Vienna meeting, OPEC has a lot of work to do to persuade its members and some non-OPEC producers to back the move.
Non-OPEC member Kazakhstan has said it would struggle to join any new deal on the old terms, as its own output was set to jump.
But OPEC's second-producer Iraq, whose output is growing fast, has said it will support extending output cuts in line with any OPEC decision, but did not specify for how long Baghdad was willing to extend the current cut. 
Even Iran is likely to go along with such the extension plan if there is a consensus, sources familiar with Iranian thinking have told Reuters. 
Falih said his understanding from a public announcement by his Iranian counterpart was that Iran was happy to stay within the production ceiling allocated to them last year.
Iran was the only OPEC member allowed to increase its output under the supply cut deal.
The current Iranian oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, said earlier this month he believed producers were likely to extend the OPEC-led deal although he did not give a timeframe.
INVENTORIES REMAIN HIGH
OPEC's aim is to reduce global oil inventories to the industry's five-year average.
While inventories held at sea and in producer countries have dropped, they remain stubbornly high in consumer regions, particularly in Asia and the United States.
Estimated inventories in industrialized nations totaled 3.025 billion barrels at the end of March - about 300 million barrels above the five-year average, according to the International Energy Agency’s latest monthly report.
Preliminary April data indicated stocks would rise further, the IEA said. Crude stocks stood at a record 1.235 billion barrels.
Falih said high compliance to the supply curbs by oil producers including Russia and high seasonal demand for oil in summer will help reduce oil inventories and stabilize the market.
""Our expectation going forward is continuing a balanced and reasonable cut in volumes will optimize for all producers all their revenue, while at the same time keeping prices in a reasonable range for consumers and for the overall market,"" he said. 
An OPEC panel reviewing scenarios for the oil producer group's meeting last week looked at the option of deepening and extending the agreement to reduce crude output, in an attempt to drain inventories and support prices.
The panel, the Economic Commission Board (ECB), does not set policy and its meeting precedes the gathering of OPEC and non-OPEC oil ministers on May 25 to decide whether to extend the supply pact.
The size of the extra supply cut being mulled by the ECB was not immediately available. 
OPEC sources have said that while a larger cut by existing participants was considered unlikely, one could still be debated and the size of the supply reduction could increase from 1.8 million bpd if more non-OPEC countries come into the deal.

OPEC has been urging other producers to join the supply pact. Turkmenistan, along with Egypt and the Ivory Coast, are due to attend the meeting, sources have said.

1520,By Investing.com,"<span>May 21, 2017 06:26AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Futures - Weekly Outlook: May 22 - 26,"Investing.com - Oil futures settled at a four-week high on Friday, with prices scoring a weekly gain of more than 5% amid optimism that key producers will extend output cuts beyond an agreed-on June deadline when they meet later this month.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude June contract tacked on 98 cents, or around 2%, to end at $50.33 a barrel by close of trade Friday, the first time it has settled above $50 in more than four weeks. It touched the highest since April 21 at $50.53 earlier in the session.
The U.S. benchmark rose $2.49, or about 5%, on the week, the second straight weekly advance.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for July delivery added $1.10 to settle at $53.61 a barrel by close of trade, after hitting a daily peak of $53.82, a level not seen since April 19.
For the week, London-traded Brent futures recorded a gain of $2.77, or roughly 5.2%.
Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producing countries will meet in Vienna on May 25 to decide whether to extend their current production agreement beyond a June 30-deadline.
In November last year, OPEC and 11 other non-OPEC producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January 1 and June 30.
Most market analysts expect the oil cartel to extend output cuts for a further nine months until March 2018, instead of six months as previously expected.
There is also talk that OPEC is looking at the option of deepening current production cuts, but it is not clear whether there would be support for that.
So far, the production-cut agreement has had little impact on global inventory levels due to rising supply from producers not participating in the accord, such as Libya, and a relentless increase in U.S. shale oil output.
Data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed on Friday that U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 18th week in a row, the second-longest such streak on record, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The U.S. rig count rose by 8 to 720, extending an 11-month drilling recovery to the highest level since April 2015.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for June gained 4.6 cents, or about 2.9% to end at a four-week high of $1.652 on Friday. It closed up around 4.8% for the week amid easing concern over lackluster demand.
June heating oil added 3.7 cents to finish at $1.582 a gallon. For the week, the fuel tacked on roughly 6%.
Natural gas futures for June delivery rose 7.4 cents to settle at $3.256 per million British thermal units, up 2.3% for the session but about 4.9% lower for the week.
In the week ahead, market participants will focus on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries highly-anticipated meeting on Thursday to see whether major producers plan to extend their current production-cut agreement.
Meanwhile, oil traders will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.

The speculator group cut its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 9,710 contracts to 184,312 during the week to May 16, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.
That represents the smallest long position in crude futures since November. 
U.S. oil futures on the NYMEX gained 6 percent in the five trading sessions ended May 16, boosted by expectations that the major oil producing nations will extend their cuts further, even into 2018. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, along with Russia and other non-OPEC members, agreed to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017. 
The countries plan to meet on May 25 and are widely expected to maintain output limits at least through the end of the year, and perhaps as long as March 2018. An OPEC panel is also considering deepening the cuts to help boost prices.
They will need to contend with rising United States production, which is taking market share away from OPEC. U.S. energy companies added oil rigs for a 18th consecutive week this week, Baker Hughes showed.
Separately, speculators reduced short positions in gasoline as the United States heads into the busy driving season. Short positions fell to a net 12,895 contracts, down by 8,070 contracts on the week.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for June delivery gained 98 cents to settle at $50.33 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 0.97 cents to trade at $53.48 a barrel.
Investors hopes of an extension of the current supply-cut agreement to March 2018, received a boost on Thursday, after Algerian Energy Minister, Noureddine Boutarfa, said that most OPEC members support Saudi Arabia and Russia’s proposal to prolong the production cuts to March next year, and that the rate of compliance should increase.
Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed earlier this week that the production cuts needed to be extended for a period of nine months until March 2018.
""There has been a marked reduction to the inventories, but we're not where we want to be in reaching the five-year average,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday.
In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). The deal to cut supply started in January this year for a period of six months until June.
OPEC is expected to decide at talks on May 25 whether to extend the current deal to cut production.
Meanwhile, the rising level of U.S. oil output returned to the fore, after oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported its weekly U.S. rig count rose by 8 to 720.

Gold for June delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange gained $1.20 or 0.10%, to $1,254.03 a troy ounce by 13:51 EDT.
Investors appeared to take profits in gold in the midst of the precious metal’s best trading week since April – gold is on track to book at 2% weekly gain amid a tumultuous week in U.S. politics.
The Justice Department earlier this week appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to lead a federal investigation into allegations that President Trump collaborated with Russia during the 2016 election.
President Trump remained defiant in the wake of continued allegations that members of his campaign colluded with Russia during the U.S. presidential election.
Trump warned that the special counsel investigation “hurts our country” and labeled the probe “a witch hunt”.
Investors have piled into safe-haven assets such as gold, as they fear that the continued political saga in Washington could dampened President’s Trump ability to deliver on his economic agenda.
Rising doubts over Trump’s ability to deliver on this pro-growth economic agenda, pushed the dollar to a six-month low on Friday, which helped steady gold futures.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell by 0.68% to 97.11 by 13:12 EDT.
Dollar-denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar – A dip in the dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of foreign currency and thus, increases demand.
Meanwhile, investors parsed through somewhat dovish comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve President, James Bullard, on Friday.
Bullard suggested the Fed’s policy path of two more rate hikes this year is “overly aggressive” relative to the pace of recent economic growth.
According to investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool 70% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to hike its benchmark rate in June.
The dollar slump supported commodity prices across the board, as silver futures rose 0.91% to $16.822 a troy ounce while platinum added 0.59% to trade at $942.35.

Drillers added eight oil rigs in the week to May 19, bringing the total count to 720, the most since April 2015, energy services firm  Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI) said on Friday. 
That is more than double the same week a year ago when there were only 318 active oil rigs.
It was the second-longest run of weekly additions, according to Baker Hughes data going back to 1987. Drillers added rigs for 19 weeks in a row through August 2011.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) rebounded this week to trade around $50, putting the front-month contract on track for a second-straight week of gains. Investors expect the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producing countries to extend output cuts into next year. 
OPEC and other producers will meet on May 25 to decide whether to extend the cuts aimed at reducing a global crude glut.
U.S. shale production is expected to rise for the sixth consecutive month in June to 5.4 million bpd, its highest since May 2015, government data showed on Monday.
Futures for the balance of 2017  and calendar 2018  were both fetching about $51 a barrel.
Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the total oil and gas rig count would average 862 in 2017, 1,067 in 2018 and 1,184 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas.
That compares with an average of 786 so far in 2017, 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. If correct, Simmons' 2019 forecast would be the most since 2014 when there were 1,862 active rigs. The rig count peaked in 2012 at 1,919, according to Baker Hughes.
Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said in a note this week that 60 exploration and production (E&P) companies planned to increase spending by an average of 51 percent in 2017 from 2016.

That expected spending increase in 2017 followed an estimated 48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in 2015, Cowen said, according to the 64 E&P companies it tracks.

1526,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2017 11:21AM ET</span>","OPEC panel looking at deepening, extending oil cuts: sources","By Alex Lawler and Rania El Gamal
VIENNA (Reuters) - An OPEC panel reviewing scenarios for the oil producer group's meeting next week is looking at the option of deepening and extending a deal to reduce crude output, OPEC sources said on Friday, in an attempt to drain inventories and support prices.
Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Russia, the world's top two oil producers, have agreed on the need to prolong the current cuts until March 2018, although Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said extended curbs would be on the same terms.
OPEC's national representatives plus officials from its Vienna secretariat met on Wednesday and Thursday. Their panel, the Economic Commission Board (ECB), was due to finish talks on Thursday but they will now end on Friday, OPEC sources said.
Among the scenarios being considered by the OPEC panel were a six- or nine-month extension with a possible deeper cut, sources said.
""All options are open,"" one source said.
That source said a deeper cut in output was an option depending on estimated growth in supply from non-OPEC producers, mainly U.S. shale oil firms, among other scenarios.
The OPEC ECB does not set policy. Its meeting precedes the gathering of OPEC and non-OPEC oil ministers on May 25 to decide whether to extend beyond June 30 their deal to reduce output.
Oil prices were heading on Friday for a second week of gains, trading above $53 a barrel, on growing expectations that producers will agree further steps to support the market when they meet next week.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers originally agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day for six months from Jan. 1.
Oil prices have gained support from reduced output but high inventories and rising supply from producers not participating in the accord have limited the rally, pressing the case for extending the curbs. 
Further details, such as the size of the extra supply cut being mulled by the ECB, were not immediately available.
In addition to the final part of the ECB meeting, there is also a technical discussion on Friday among OPEC and non-OPEC countries participating in the supply cut. This is not expected to result in any decision.
""Today's meeting is just informative,"" an OPEC source said. 

Russia and three or four non-OPEC countries were attending Friday's technical meeting, a different source said. Eleven non-OPEC countries are participating in the supply cut.

U.S. crude futures for June delivery were up 1.22% at $49.95 a barrel, the highest since April 26.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the July Brent contract rallied 1.20% to $53.15 a barrel, the highest since April 20.
Crude prices remained supported after Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed earlier in the week to extend oil output cuts for a further nine months until March 2018.
However, the 12 remaining OPEC members and other producers participating in the cuts have to agree to the extension during a meeting on May 25.
In November last year, OPEC and other major global producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January and June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude oil inventories fell by 1.8 million barrels in the week ended May 12, the sixth weekly decline in a row.
However, the drawdown came in below expectations for a drop of 2.3 million barrels, underlining the view that an ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production is derailing efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand."
1529,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2017 06:05AM ET</span>",Full tanks and tankers: a stubborn oil glut despite OPEC cuts,"By Catherine Ngai
NEW YORK/LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - After the first OPEC oil production cut in eight years took effect in January, oil traders from Houston to Singapore started emptying millions of barrels of crude from storage tanks. 
Investors hailed the drawdowns as the beginning of the end of a two-year supply glut - raising hopes for steadily rising per-barrel prices. 
It hasn't worked out that way.
Now, many of those same storage tanks are filling back up or draining more slowly than investors and oil firms had expected, according to global inventory estimates and more than a dozen oil traders and shipping sources who told Reuters about storage in facilities that do not make their oil volumes public.
The stalled drawdowns shed light on the broader challenge facing OPEC - the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries - as it struggles to steer the industry out of the downturn caused by oversupply. With U.S. shale oil production surging, inventories remain stubbornly high and prices appear stuck in the low-$50s per-barrel range.
The market has not strengthened enough to drain many major storage facilities around the globe - which OPEC oil ministers had hoped would be a first step toward rebalancing what has been a buyer's market since late 2014.
Estimated inventories in industrialized nations totaled 3.025 billion barrels at the end of March - about 300 million barrels above the five-year average, according to the International Energy Agency’s latest monthly report. 
Preliminary April data indicated stocks would rise further, the IEA said. Crude stocks stood at a record 1.235 billion barrels.
OPEC and other non-OPEC nations - most notably Russia - are now widely expected to extend production cuts for another nine months, through March 2018. 
The ongoing struggle to thin supplies has forced economists to cut their oil price forecasts. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), for instance, last week lowered its 2017 target for Brent crude by $7 a barrel to $54.
During the two-year price war started by OPEC, about half a billion barrels of crude and refined products flowed into storage facilities as oil prices hit lows of less than $30 a barrel in early 2016.
Much of the inventory build-up came as traders started using storage to make easy money on the widening spread between rock-bottom spot oil prices and substantially higher prices for contracts to deliver the oil in future months. 
That price spread - a market structure known as contango - allowed traders to profit even after they paid for expensive storage in facilities such as the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) - the only deep-water U.S. oil port and a major conduit for crude imports - or supertankers parked offshore in Singapore.
Although the storage trade has been less profitable since the OPEC production cuts, much of that oil remains in tanks, said Chris Bake, an executive committee member at Vitol, the world's largest independent trader, during an industry conference last week in London.
""This 550 million barrel-plus inventory build of crude and products that started in 2014 is still very much there,"" he said. ""How much is going to come out? That is an ongoing debate among all of us."" 
""CLOGGED"" WITH OIL
From the Malacca Straits in Asia to the ports of Northern Europe and the Gulf of Mexico, drawdowns of global inventories have slowed or even reversed.
In the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) region – one of the most expensive areas in Europe to store oil and the benchmark pricing point for fuel - crude is starting to flow back into storage because refiners are ""clogged"" with oil, an industry source handling deals in that region told Reuters.
Refined fuel inventories have also jumped suddenly, with gasoil in tanks in the ARA hub rising to an eight-month high earlier this month, according to Dutch consultancy PJK International. Gasoil includes jet fuel, diesel and heating oil.
At one of the world's largest oil storage facilities - on the shores of Saldanha Bay in South Africa - millions of barrels were sold in recent months, traders told Reuters.
But more cargoes are flowing right back into its tanks, which can hold 45 million barrels, as sellers struggle to find refiners to buy freshly loaded oil, the traders said. 
In the Houston region, stored oil stocks touched record levels at the end of March, according to energy information provider Genscape.
The state of inventories appears more mixed in Asia. 
In China, the world's second-largest oil consumer behind the United States, commercial crude stocks hit their lowest level in four years in March, according to the government-controlled Xinhua News Agency. But in nearby South Korea, inventories were near a record, according to the Korea National Oil Corp.
SLOW PROGRESS
While global inventories remain bloated, there are some signs that the OPEC cuts have dented supplies. 
Recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed that nationwide stocks started draining in April this year - the first decrease for that month since 1999. 
Declining costs for storage is another indication that traders and oil companies are putting less oil in storage than at the height of the price war. 
At the largest U.S. storage facility at Cushing, Oklahoma, storage tanks costs about 35 cents a barrel per month, traders say, compared nearly 50 cents a year ago. 
Parking oil in a supertanker off the shore of Singapore, Asia's refining hub, costs anywhere from 30 to 40 cents a barrel per month, down from 50 to 80 cents just a few months ago.
The futures contract for oil storage at the LOOP, off Louisiana's coast, dropped to about 24 cents per barrel recently, one of the lowest prices this year.
Still, the patchy evidence of draining storage has fallen far short of what investors expected after OPEC and non-OPEC nations agreed on production cuts last November.

""People were impatient and thought we'd start drawing 10 million barrels a day since the first week of January,"" said Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects. ""We're still in excess, and there's lots of inventory around.""

1530,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2017 05:28AM ET</span>",China's sugar industry seeks sweet success on import curbs,"By Hallie Gu and Josephine Mason
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's beleaguered sugar producers are hoping for a taste of victory next week as Beijing prepares to deliver its verdict on sugar import duties and intensifies a crackdown on rampant smuggling along ancient trade routes.
On Monday, China's Commerce Ministry will issue its first ruling on a months-long investigation into raw and refined sugar imports, having already proposed hefty tariffs in a draft ruling.
A steep hike in duties by the world's biggest sugar importer would be a serious blow for top producers Thailand and Brazil, amid concerns about waning global demand for the sweetener.
However, it would offer a much-needed reprieve to millions of small farmers and state-owned producers like Nanning Sugar Industry and Cofco Tunhe Co who argue cheap imports have caused billions of dollars of losses, cost jobs and forced output cuts.
""If results are what the market has rumored, imported sugar will lose its competitiveness while domestic sugar will get a boost,"" said Wang Weidong, analyst based in Nanning, Guangxi province, at Huatai Futures.
In a further sign that Beijing is trying to revive the broader industry, it has tightened checks along China's porous southern border with Myanmar to try to stamp out the flow of illicit sugar, a source at a major global trader, a sales manager at a top southern producer and three experts said.
As much as 2 million tonnes of raw and refined sugar from Thailand and other producers - worth some $2 billion at current prices - is stowed on trucks and ships and sold illegally at wholesale markets each year, traders estimate.
Sugar is one of the few sectors in which China struggles to compete with foreign rivals because smallholder farmers have to employ more labor, driving up costs.
China's most-active white sugar futures were at 6,737 yuan ($977.60) per tonne on Friday, nearly double the price of London futures. 
The country currently imports about 3 million tonnes of sugar a year, with 1.94 million tonnes of sugar imports allowed at a tariff of 15 percent as part of China's commitments to the World Trade Organization.
Beijing also allows out-of-quota imports, which have been set at about 1.9 million tonnes in the past two years, and currently attract a 50 percent duty.
SMUGGLED SWEETENER
Smuggling will be discussed at a meeting next week called by the China Sugar Association with producers and refiners, in the top sugar growing province Guangxi, a source briefed on the matter said.
The association did not respond to calls seeking comment, while customs did not respond to a fax seeking comment on the tighter border controls.
Some in the industry worry that higher tariffs could tighten domestic supplies and boost prices locally, making China an even more alluring market for smugglers.
""Many major criminals are still at large ... Smuggling is still blatant, and hasn't been smashed completely yet,"" the China Sugar Association's official journal said recently.
Still, this year's crackdown, which started a few months ago and intensified in late March, has had some success, stemming shipments through Yunnan province, leading to the arrest of some traders and boosting domestic prices, according to traders and experts.
Prices of smuggled sugar have risen in China's wholesale markets, they said, while wholesale sugar prices in Myanmar, a major conduit for smugglers, have fallen.
In a recent trip to check the availability of illegal product in Henan province in late April, the sales manager said he no longer saw any smuggled sugar disguised as product from his company.

""The crackdown happens every year and usually the smuggling got quieter for a couple of weeks following each crackdown. But this year, it has been quiet for a couple months,"" said the source at a major global trader.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for June delivery rose 0.85% to $49.77 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 0.70% to $52.88 a barrel.
In figures reported last Friday, oilfield servcies firm Baker Hughes said U.S. drillers added 9 oil rigs to take the total to 712, rigs for the 17th weekly gain in a row and extending an 11-month drilling recovery to the highest level since August 2015, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
Overnight, crude futures settled higher on Thursday, as investors remained optimistic that OPEC would reach an agreement to extend the current supply-cut deal beyond June at its meeting next week.
In what was a choppy day of trade, oil futures recovered from a more than 1% slump, as investors' optimism that OPEC would seek an extension of the current deal to cut global production offset concerns over the rising level of U.S. shale production.
The Energy Information Administration said Wednesday, crude oil inventories fell by 1.75 million barrels last week, which was the sixth-straight week of declining crude stockpiles but the dip in inventories fell short of expectations of a draw of around 2.4 million barrels.
Despite the high level of compliance from OPEC members with the deal to rein in supply, global production remains above the five-year average, as non-OPEC members, who are not part of the supply-cut agreement have ramped up production.
In its monthly report last Thursday, OPEC estimated that non-OPEC production this year would grow by 950,000 barrels per day (bpd).
OPEC and other producers are set to meet on May 25 to decide whether to extend the current supply-cut deal amid growing optimism for a prolonged period of cuts.
Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed earlier this week that production cuts needed to be extended for a period of nine months until March 2018.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Wednesday, however, warned that OPEC’s effort to rein in the glut in supply may fail even if the oil group agrees to extend its supply-cut agreement.

The release of upbeat economic data came amid continued U.S. political turmoil in Washington, after the Justice Department appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to lead a federal investigation into allegations that Trump collaborated with Russia during the 2016 election.
Meanwhile, Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester on Thursday repeated her call for further U.S. interest rate hikes in the wake of recent U.S. economic data, showing that the rate of employment and inflation is close to matching the Fed’s objectives.
According to investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool 61% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to hike its benchmark rate in June, compared to nearly 80% of traders in the previous week.

1534,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2017 08:25PM ET</span>",Oil prices climb on hopes output cuts will be extended,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil futures rose in early trading on Friday on growing optimism that big producing countries will extend output cuts to curb a persistent glut in crude, with key benchmarks heading for a second week of gains.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 12 cents at $52.63 at 0006 GMT, after settling up half a percent on Thursday. The contract is on track for a 3.5-percent climb this week, a second week of gains.
U.S. crude oil (CLc1) was up 14 cents at $49.49 a barrel, after finishing the previous session at $49.35 a barrel, the highest close since April 26. The contract is heading for a weekly increase of 3.4 percent.
Oil prices have been trapped in a tight range in recent weeks as rising U.S. production has erased the effects of output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other countries, including Russia. 
But market watchers are growing more confident that OPEC, Russia and other big producers will extend cuts of almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of March 2018. U.S. producers are not party to any agreements capping production. 
On May 25, leaders from OPEC and other producing countries will meet in Vienna to decide on output policy.

Rosneft, the largest oil producer in Russia will meet agreements with the grouping on oil output reductions, the company's chief executive told reporters in Berlin on Thursday.

Despite the high level of compliance from OPEC members with the deal to rein in supply, global production remains above the five-year average, as non-OPEC members, who are not part of the supply-cut agreement have ramped up production.
In its monthly report last Thursday, OPEC estimated that non-OPEC production this year would grow by 950,000 barrels per day (bpd).
OPEC and other producers are set to meet on May 25 to decide whether to extend the current supply-cut deal amid growing optimism for a prolonged period of cuts.
Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed earlier this week that production cuts needed to be extended for a period of nine months until March 2018.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Wednesday, however, warned that OPEC’s effort to rein in the glut in supply may fail even if the oil group agrees to extend its supply-cut agreement.

The deals with top U.S. companies such as oilfield services firms Schlumberger, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Baker Hughes, and Weatherford are part of the oil giant's push to develop local manufacturing, the sources said.
Aramco will also sign deals with  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and drilling companies National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV), Nabors Industries and Rowan Companies, among others, they added.
Aramco could not be reached for comment on Thursday. 
Halliburton's incoming chief executive, Jeff Miller, declined to comment on any potential deal with Saudi Aramco. Baker Hughes also declined to comment.
When it launched its In-Kingdom Total Value Add program (IKTVA) in 2015, Aramco said it aimed to double the percentage of locally-produced energy-related goods and services to 70 percent by 2021 
U.S. companies have traditionally worked with Aramco on massive projects covering consultancy and project management services to maintaining oil potential in upstream projects and drilling to building refineries.
""These (new) partnerships will boost bilateral investment towards localization,"" said one of the sources.
Last December, Aramco signed deals with drilling firms Rowan and Nabors Industries to establish joint ventures under the IKTVA program.
IKTVA, Arabic for self-sufficiency, will help generate 500,000 direct and indirect jobs for Saudis. It is a key part of the kingdom's Vision 2030 economic reform drive, in which Aramco is to play a big role in developing industrial projects as Saudi Arabia tries to diversify its economy beyond reliance on oil exports.
GE plans to sign memoranda of understanding on oil services, digital and the IKTVA initiative, said one source close to the matter.
Engineering companies KBR and Jacobs Engineering, as well as McDermott and Honeywell will also sign memoranda of understanding with Aramco, the sources said.

An inaugural Saudi-U.S. CEO forum will be held in Riyadh on Saturday in which several deals are expected to be signed in defense, electricity, oil and gas, industrial and chemical sectors. New licenses for U.S. companies to operate in the kingdom also will be issued.

U.S. natural gas for June delivery ticked up 1.3 cents, or around 0.4%, to $3.205 per million British thermal units by 10:35AM ET (14:35GMT).
Futures were at around $3.192 prior to the release of the supply data before falling to a session low of $3.168, the weakest level since May 8.
Prices of the heating fell 3.8 cents on Wednesday amid bearish weather forecasts.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 68 billion cubic feet in the week ended May 12, above forecasts for a build of 61 billion.
That compared with a gain of 45 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 73 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 87 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.369 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 13.6% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 10.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, the latest U.S. weather model called for mild temperatures over the next two weeks, which should reduce demand during that time.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude June contract dropped 61 cents, or around 1.3%, to $48.45 a barrel by 8:45AM ET (12:45GMT).
The U.S. benchmark gained 41 cents on Wednesday after data showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell for the sixth week in a row.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for July delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London declined 62 cents to $51.59 a barrel, after rising 56 cents a day earlier.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that crude oil inventories fell by 1.8 million barrels in the week ended May 12, the sixth weekly decline in a row.
However, the drawdown came in below expectations for a drop of 2.3 million barrels, underlining the view that an ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production is derailing efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
Oil rallied at the start of the week on news that Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to extend oil output cuts for a further nine months until March 2018.
However, the 12 remaining OPEC members and other producers participating in the cuts have to agree to the extension during a meeting on May 25.
In November last year, OPEC and other major global producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January and June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
Crude sank to a five-month low earlier this month, rattled by concern over increasing U.S. crude output that has shaken investors' faith in the ability of OPEC to rebalance the market.
The U.S. rig count rose for the 17th week in a row to the highest level since August 2015 last week, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for June slipped 2.0 cents, or 1.3%, to $1.579 a gallon, while June heating oil shed 1.4 cents to $1.519 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for June delivery tacked on 4.5 cents to $3.237 per million British thermal units, as traders looked ahead to weekly storage data due later in the global day.

Comex gold futures added around $1.00, or about 0.1%, to $1,260.29 a troy ounce by 8:00AM ET (12:00GMT). Meanwhile, spot gold was at $1,260.51.
Prices of the yellow metal jumped to an overnight peak of $1,265.00, the most since May 1.
Gold notched a sixth-straight winning session on Wednesday as investors fretted over the latest news coming out of Washington.
Reuters reported earlier that former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and others on Trump’s campaign team exchanged at least 18 undisclosed phone calls or emails with Russian contacts during the 2016 presidential race.
That was only the latest worry in a tumultuous week at the White House, which included allegations that the president tried to interfere with a federal investigation and shared classified information with Russia's foreign minister.
The Justice Department on Wednesday appointed former FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel to take over the investigation of Russia's alleged interference in the U.S. presidential election.
The recent string of controversies intensified doubts that Trump would be able to follow through on his campaign promises for tax cuts, deregulation and fiscal stimulus.
The deepening political turmoil dampened demand for risk-sensitive assets, such as global equities, and sparked a rally in assets perceived as safe, such as the yen, bullion and U.S. Treasuries, which are often used as a hedge in times of political uncertainty.
The dollar wallowed near six-month lows against a basket of major currencies on Thursday, struggling to recover from its worst losses in almost a year against the yen and the euro as worries over the Trump presidency weigh.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up less than 0.2% at 97.52 in New York morning trade.
It slid to an overnight low of 97.28, levels last seen in the immediate aftermath of Trump's surprise victory in November.
Meanwhile, a recent run of disappointing U.S. economic data, including inflation, retail sales and housing starts has also weighed on the dollar, tempering expectations for higher interest rates.
Odds for a June rate hike dropped to around 60%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, down from more than 80% a week ago, while odds for a second rate hike by December fell to 30% from around 50% in the preceding week.
The Fed has signaled it intends to raise rates twice more this year, after a quarter-point hike in March.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
Also on the Comex, silver futures declined 16.2 cents, or about 1%, to $16.74 a troy ounce, after hitting its highest since May 1 at $17.03 on Wednesday.
Elsewhere in metals trading, platinum shed 1.1% to $935.95, while palladium slumped 1.5% to $765.17 an ounce.

Meanwhile, gasoline inventories dropped by only 0.413 million against expectations for a draw of 0.731 million barrels while distillate stockpiles fell by 1.94 million barrels, compared to expectations of a 1 million decline.
The smaller than expected drawdown in both crude and gasoline inventories caused oil prices to dip but losses were pared later during session, as investors turned attention to OPEC’s meeting on May 25.
OPEC is increasingly expected to extend the current deal to cut production at its meeting next week amid growing support for a deal extension from OPEC nations such as Kuwait, Iraq, Oman and Venezuela.
A report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Wednesday, however, warned that OPEC’s effort to rein in the glut in supply may fail even if the oil group agrees to extend its supply-cut agreement.
Despite the recent rally, oil futures have erased most of the gains achieved since November, when OPEC and other producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd)."

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude June contract tacked on 75 cents, or around 1.5%, to $49.39 a barrel by 10:35AM ET (14:35GMT). Prices were at around $48.73 prior to the release of the inventory data.
The U.S. benchmark rallied to its highest since April 28 at $49.66 at the start of the week on news that Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to extend oil output cuts for a further nine months until March 2018.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for July delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London advanced 81 cents to $52.46 a barrel. The global benchmark touched its strongest level since April 21 at $52.63 on Monday.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 1.8 million barrels in the week ended May 12, the sixth weekly decline in a row.
Market analysts' expected a crude-stock decline of around 2.3 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply-gain of 882,000 barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, increased by 35,000 barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 520.8 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be at the upper half of the average range for this time of year.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories declined by 413,000 barrels, compared to expectations for a fall of 731,000 barrels.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a decline of 1.9 million barrels.
Oil rallied at the start of the week after Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak said they had agreed to prolong an existing production cut deal by another nine months until March 2018.
However, the 12 remaining OPEC members and other producers participating in the cuts have to agree to the extension during a meeting on May 25.
In November last year, OPEC and other major global producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January and June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for June rose 2.3 cents, or around 1.5%, to $1.615 a gallon, while June heating oil gained 2.3 cents to $1.539 a gallon.

1554,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2017 09:55AM ET</span>","In America's largest oilfield, whir of activity confounds OPEC","By Ernest Scheyder
LEA COUNTY, N.M. (Reuters) - As oilfield workers for Lilis Energy Inc (O:LLEX) threaded together drill pipes one recent morning in the Permian Basin, a bulldozer cleared sagebrush to make way for the company's fifth well since January. 
Lilis aims to expand production sevenfold this year in America's most active oilfield.
The whir of activity is all the more impressive after the small firm nearly collapsed in late 2015 - amid unrestrained production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). As per-barrel prices plummeted, Lilis piled on debt and struggled to pay workers.
Now - with prices higher after a November OPEC decision to cut output - Lilis can't grow fast enough. 
Such resurrections are common these days in the Permian, which stretches across West Texas and eastern New Mexico. They tell the story of the U.S. shale resurgence and the quandary it poses for OPEC as it struggles to tame a global glut. 
Surging U.S. production has stalled OPEC's effort to cut supply. Inventories in industrialized nations totaled 3.05 billion barrels in February - about 330 million barrels above the five-year average, according to the International Energy Agency. 
The Permian boom will be high on the agenda as OPEC oil ministers begin gathering in Vienna ahead of a May 25 policy meeting to decide whether to extend output cuts.
In the long term, too much U.S. output could spur OPEC to open the spigots again - setting off another price war - but for now its member nations' need for revenue makes that unlikely.
On Monday, the world's top two oil producers - OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia and Russia, a non-OPEC nation - said they had agreed in principle on the need to continue output cuts for an additional nine months, through March 2018.
That would extend the initial agreement, which took effect in January and reduced production by 1.2 barrels per day (bpd) from OPEC nations and another 600,000 bpd from non-OPEC producers, including Russia.
The pledge to extend cuts marked an evolution in the thinking of Saudi Arabia Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih - in response to surging U.S. output. 
After OPEC's decision in November, Al-Falih expressed confidence that no further supply curbs would be needed because of rising demand.
Then in March, Al-Falih told a Houston energy conference that the ""green shoots"" in U.S. shale might be ""growing too fast"" - and warned there would be no ""free rides"" for U.S. producers benefiting from OPEC production cuts.
But by last week, Al-Falih vowed OPEC would do ""whatever it takes"" to control oversupply.
Unlike OPEC nations, U.S. firms are barred by anti-trust laws from colluding to control output or prices, leaving market demand as the only check on production. 
""I'm really proud American production is offsetting those OPEC cuts,"" said Lilis Chief Executive Avi Mirman.
FREE RIDE ON OPEC CUTS
Now it appears the free ride for U.S. shale producers will continue at least into next year.
U.S. oil output has jumped to 9.31 million bpd this year, up 440,000 bpd from 2016, according to U.S. Energy Information Agency estimates. 
About a quarter of that production comes from the Permian, where broad-based growth comes from small firms like Lilis, global majors including  Exxon Mobil  Corp and large independents such as (N:XOM)  Parsley Energy  Inc (N:PE).
OPEC's two-year price war sank hundreds of companies and forced majors including Exxon and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) to retrench - but it also and stirred their interest in shale.
Exxon paid nearly $7 billion in February to double its acreage in the Permian.
Earlier this month, about 20 miles (32 km) south of Midland, Texas - the center of the basin's industry - a crew from ProPetro Holding Corp (N:PUMP) was hydraulically fracturing, or fracking, an Exxon well.
Silver silos held 18 million pounds of sand, which would be mixed with 22 million gallons of water and forced into the well, unlocking oil trapped in rock.
""We're really approaching the Permian as a major project,"" Sara Ortwein, president of Exxon's shale-focused subsidiary, XTO Energy, said in an interview. 
Across the Permian, the number of rigs this year has risen 30 percent and the number of fracking crews has jumped 40 percent, according to Primary Vision, which tracks oilfield service equipment usage.
That won't change soon, said Mark Papa, CEO of Centennial Resource Development Inc (O:CDEV), which added to its Permian land holdings this month with a $350 million deal.
""A disproportionate amount of U.S. production growth between now and the end of the decade will come from the Permian,"" Papa said in an interview.
'WE'RE OUT OF RIGS'
In a reversal from the thousands of layoffs here in 2015, oil companies are hiring briskly. 
Fracking service provider  Keane Group Inc  (N:FRAC), for instance, has plans to hire at least 240 workers this year.
For the growth to continue, however, prices will have to rise for rigs and other services, executives and analysts have said.
Paul Mosvold, president of drilling contractor Scandrill Inc, has more business than he can handle. 
""We're out of rigs,"" he said. ""We have been since January."" 
But he won't add more rigs unless producers pay more - maybe $25,000 per day, instead of the current $15,000 to $19,000. That may depend on per-barrel prices going up, an unlikely prospect amid expanding supply.
Oil drillers, meanwhile, continue to hunt for new cost-cutting technologies - after already halving the cost of extracting a barrel since 2014.
Parsley is cutting labor costs with sensors on wells that transmit production and maintenance data to its headquarters in Austin, Texas. 
""We're constantly getting more efficient,"" Mark Timmons, Parsley's vice president of field operations. 
The Lilis revival started last year with debt-for-equity swaps and a merger with another troubled oil producer, giving Lilis access to Permian acreage. 
The company's market value has risen to $210 million from about $3 million two years ago. 
At the company's newest well site, Lilis CEO Mirman checked drilling progress on his iPhone and shrugged off any worries about OPEC’s next move. 

""We're using every tool at our disposal to grow,"" he said.

U.S. natural gas for June delivery slumped 2.3 cents, or around 0.7%, to $3.207 per million British thermal units by 9:30AM ET (13:30GMT).
Prices of the heating fuel sank 11.9 cents, or around 3.5%, on Tuesday, the biggest daily decline since January 31.
Natural gas futures are down roughly 6% so far this week as the latest U.S. weather model called for mild temperatures over the next two weeks, which should reduce demand during that time.
Prices of the fuel have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring heating demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.301 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 13.9% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 12.0% above the five-year average for this time of year.
The EIA's next storage report due Thursday is expected to show a build in a range between 55 and 63 billion cubic feet in the week ended May 12.
That compares with a gain of 45 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 73 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 87 billion cubic feet.

Gold notched a fifth-straight winning session on Tuesday as the dollar sank to a six-month low amid signs of slowing economic activity in the U.S.
Markets were unnerved after media reports said President Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to end a probe into Michael Flynn, his former National Security Advisor, relating to alleged ties with Russia.
The news came one day after a report accused Trump of disclosing sensitive intelligence obtained from a close U.S. ally with Russia's foreign minister about an Islamic State operation.
The reports added to concerns that the president will be unable to successfully push through his economic stimulus program in the face of mounting controversies.
The news dampened demand for risk-sensitive assets, such as global equities, and sparked a rally in assets perceived as safe, such as the yen, bullion and U.S. Treasuries, which are often used as a hedge in times of political uncertainty.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, weakened for a sixth straight day, falling around 0.3% to 97.82 in New York morning trade.
It slid to an overnight low of 97.76, levels last seen in the immediate aftermath of Trump's surprise victory in November.
Besides political developments, traders are mulling over a string of weaker than expected U.S. economic reports in recent days, which saw them scale back expectations for more rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year.
Odds for a June rate hike dropped to around 64%, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, down from more than 80% a week ago, while odds for a second rate hike by December fell to 37% from around 65%.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday after data showed an increase in U.S. crude inventories, stoking concerns that markets remain oversupplied despite efforts by top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend output cuts.
Brent crude was down 41 cents, or 0.8 percent, from the last close at $51.24 per barrel at 0534 GMT.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was at $48.23, down 43 cents, or 0.9 percent.
U.S. crude inventories rose by 882,000 barrels in the week ending May 12 to 523.4 million, data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed on Tuesday.
Brent reached $52.63 a barrel on Monday and WTI rose as high as $49.66 a barrel after Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed on the need for a 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) crude supply cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some other producers to be extended until the end of March 2018.
""The vulnerability of OPEC's ... rhetoric was starkly revealed ... as the U.S. API crude inventories showed an unexpected increase,"" said Jeffrey Halley of futures brokerage OANDA.
The extension of the supply cuts, which started in January and were supposed to end in June, is seen as necessary by some as they have not so far significantly tightened the market or propped up prices.
""The agreement by OPEC to extend cuts into 2018 is critical,"" said AB Bernstein in a note.
The International Energy Agency said on Tuesday that commercial oil inventories in industrialized countries rose by 24.1 million barrels in the first quarter of 2016, despite the cuts.
Adding to concerns of ongoing supply increases, North Sea oil production, which has long been seen as in terminal decline, is expected to jump by a net 400,000 bpd, or about a fifth of total output, in the next two years as producers improve operational efficiency.
This adds to a relentless rise in U.S. production, which has jumped by over 10 percent since mid-2016 to 9.3 million bpd, not far off top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Investment bank Jefferies said it was lowering its oil price forecasts ""between 3 percent (2H17) and 22 percent (2019)"" due to a surprisingly strong production rise, especially in the United States.
Jefferies said its new Brent price estimate for the second half of 2017 was $59 per barrel, down from $61 previously.

It lowered its forecast for 2018 Brent from $72 per barrel to $64 per barrel, and cut its estimate for 2019 from $85 per barrel to $67 per barrel.

U.S. crude inventories rose 882,000 barrels at the end of last week, the American Petroleum Institute (API) said on Tuesday, compared to a decline of 2.3 million barrels seen and last week's figure that showed a 5.789 million barrels decline. The API estimates are followed by official figures from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.
Distillate stocks gained 1.79 million barrels and gasoline supplies fell 1.78 million barrels. Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, fell by 540,000 barrels. Analysts expected a 1.050 million barrels decline in distillates and an 731,000 barrels dip in gasoline supplies.
Overnight, crude futures settled lower on Tuesday, as investors awaited a fresh weekly batch of U.S inventory data amid growing support from energy ministers for prolonged supply cuts to March 2018.
Investors’ optimism grew that the OPEC-led supply-cut agreement would be extended for a period of nine months, until March 2018, after Kuwait became the latest oil producing nation to support the idea of prolonged supply cuts.
Kuwait's oil minister, Essam al-Marzouq, said he supported the agreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia that supply cuts needed to be extended until March 2018.
On Monday, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said that the deal to cut global production and rein in supply has significantly reduced inventories, but added that further cuts were needed to trim the level of inventories to the five-year average.

U.S. natural gas for June delivery slumped 8.0 cents, or around 2.4%, to $3.269 per million British thermal units by 9:30AM ET (13:30GMT). Prices of the heating fuel dropped 7.5 cents, or around 2.2%, on Monday.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring heating demand.

However, the 12 remaining OPEC members and other producers participating in the cuts have to agree to the extension during a meeting on May 25.
In November last year, OPEC and other major global producers, including Russia, agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January and June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2017 04:50AM ET</span>","Global oil market rebalancing speeds up, inventories lag: IEA","By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - The global oil market is rebalancing and the pace at which supply and demand are falling into line is picking up, even if inventories still fail to reflect the impact of OPEC supply cuts, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday.
In its monthly report, the IEA kept its global demand growth forecast for 2017 unchanged at 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd), because of slowdowns in previously robust consumer countries such as the United States, Germany and Turkey.
Commercial inventories fell for a second straight month in March, by 32.9 million barrels to 3.025 billion barrels.
But for the first quarter as a whole, stocks in industrialized countries rose by 24.1 million barrels and the IEA said preliminary data suggested inventories increased again in April. 
""It has taken some time for stocks to reflect lower supply when volumes produced before output cuts by OPEC and 11 non-OPEC countries took effect are still being absorbed by the market,"" the Paris-based IEA said.
In the first quarter of 2017, ""we might not have seen a resounding return to deficits but this report confirms our recent message that rebalancing is essentially here and, in the short term at least, is accelerating"".
Global oil supply fell by 140,000 bpd in April to 96.17 million bpd, led by declines in nations outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, such as Canada.
But with strong production increases in the United States, Brazil and Kazakhstan, the IEA said non-OPEC output would grow by 600,000 bpd this year.
OPEC meets on May 25 to discuss an extension of the deal it reached with some of its major rivals, such as Russia, to cut oil output by a joint 1.8 million bpd in the first half of the year and force a drawdown in global inventories.
The IEA, which advises Western governments on energy policy, said if OPEC maintained output at April's 31.8 million bpd, and nothing changed elsewhere in the balance, there would be an implied global draw of 700,000 bpd in the second quarter.
""Adopting the same scenario approach for the second half of 2017, the stock draws are likely to be even greater,"" the IEA said. 
Higher output from Nigeria and Saudi Arabia offset lower flows from Libya and Iran in April, while compliance with OPEC's agreed 1.2-million-bpd cut remained robust at around 96 percent, the IEA said.
OPEC crude production was down 535,000 bpd compared to April 2016, the largest year-on-year decline in nearly three years. 
In terms of demand, the IEA said Chinese consumption remained relatively strong, with a near-425,000-bpd gain in the first quarter of the year, compared with 2016.
The Indian government's demonetization policy will likely lower that country's consumption this year. The IEA expects Indian demand growth to hover around 200,000 bpd.
In the United States, the top source for global crude supply growth, consumption has weakened and the IEA forecast flat U.S. demand this year.

The latest official U.S. demand numbers for February showed the biggest decline in more than four years at 495,000 bpd, the agency said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Paulson & Co held its stake steady in the world's biggest gold exchange-traded fund while Soros Fund Management stayed out of the precious metal in the first quarter of 2017, when bullion prices rallied to 3-1/2-month highs, a filing showed on Monday.
New York-based Paulson & Co, led by longtime gold bull John Paulson, kept its stake unchanged in SPDR Gold Trust (P:GLD) at 4.36 million shares valued at $517.6 million at the end of March, a regulatory U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed.
This was up slightly from a value of $477.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Soros Fund Management LLC dissolved its shares in SPDR Gold Trust in the third quarter of 2016 and then in Barrick Gold Corp by the end of December, as bullion prices saw their weakest quarterly performance in 3-1/2 years. The hedge fund did not take a stake in gold shares in the first three months of 2017, filings showed.
Jana Partners LLC, which dissolved its stake in SPDR Gold Trust in the second quarter of 2016, also stayed out of the precious metal.
Earlier this month, CI Investments Inc, an investment manager of Toronto-based CI Financial Corp, reported that it increased shares in SPDR Gold Trust and bought shares in Barrick Gold Corp.
Spot gold prices rallied by nearly 10 percent to $1,263.80 an ounce during the first quarter of this year as attention shifted to worries over U.S. President Donald Trump's policies and political risks posed by elections in Europe.
Gold's safe-haven appeal increased in April, when prices extended gains to a five-month high at $1,295.42 an ounce, on rising geopolitical risks after North Korea made what was believed to be a failed missile test launch.
Prices eased to an eight-week low at $1,213.81 last week, however, with the U.S. Federal Reserve widely expected to raise interest rates at its June meeting and as safe-haven demand faded in the wake of Emmanuel Macron's victory in the French election.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil is toughening requirements for ethanol importers to protect domestic producers from a surge of U.S. corn ethanol, a minister said on Monday, adding that he opposed the idea of new tariffs that could trigger a costly retaliation.
Buyers of foreign ethanol will need to follow the same capacity and inventory demands as local producers, according to a government ruling published in the official gazette.
Energy Minister Fernando Coelho said the measure aims at giving ""fair treatment"" to importers and producers in the face of a ""violent"" increase in shipments from the United States.
Brazil is the main market for U.S. exports of corn ethanol, which have swelled in recent months to fill a gap left by falling domestic output, as Brazilian cane producers divert more of their crop to making sugar because of high prices.
Ethanol imports from the United States increased fivefold to a record 720 million liters in the first quarter, worth some $363 million, according to Brazil's trade ministry.
Coelho said Brazil needs to protect its ethanol industry from U.S. corn ethanol with measures other than import tariffs, which could trigger a U.S. response. ""I think tariffs could cost us even more in retaliation,"" he said.
Reuters reported on April 27 that Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi had asked Brazilian trade authority Camex to impose tariffs on U.S. ethanol imports. The cane industry in northeast Brazil, the main point of entry for ethanol imports, is leading calls for a 20 percent tariff.
The Camex executive committee held off deciding the matter at a meeting this month to consider the broader implications of a tariff. The committee is expected to make a decision at a meeting in early June.
""A U.S. retaliation is possible and that is being taken into account in discussion of a tariff,"" Trade and Industry Minister Marcos Pereira told Reuters last week.

Coelho said that his ministry would not adopt any other measures to protect the local industry but added that producers were presenting demands to Camex and the Agriculture Ministry.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2017 10:00AM ET</span>",Trump reassures farmers immigration crackdown not aimed at their workers,"By Mica Rosenberg and Kristina Cooke
WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said he would seek to keep his tough immigration enforcement policies from harming the U.S. farm industry and its largely immigrant workforce, according to farmers and officials who met with him. 
At a roundtable on farm labor at the White House last month, Trump said he did not want to create labor problems for farmers and would look into improving a program that brings in temporary agricultural workers on legal visas. 
""He assured us we would have plenty of access to workers,"" said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, one of 14 participants at the April 25 meeting with Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.
During the roundtable conversation about agriculture, farmers and representatives of the sector brought up labor and immigration, the details of which have not been previously reported. Some farmers told Trump they often cannot find Americans willing to do the difficult farm jobs, according to interviews with nine of the 14 participants.
They said they were worried about stricter immigration enforcement and described frustrations with the H-2A visa program, the one legal way to bring in temporary seasonal agricultural workers.
The White House declined to comment on the specifics of the discussion, but described the meeting as ""very productive."" The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment on the April meeting. 
About half of U.S. crop workers are in the country illegally and more than two-thirds are foreign born, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Department of Labor's National Agriculture Workers' Survey. 
During the roundtable, Luke Brubaker, a dairy farmer from Pennsylvania, described how immigration agents had recently picked up half a dozen chicken catchers working for a poultry transportation company in his county. 
The employer tried to replace them with local hires, but within three hours all but one had quit, Brubaker told the gathering at the White House. 
Trump said he wanted to help and asked Secretary Perdue to look into the issues and come back with recommendations, according to the accounts.
While other issues such as trade, infrastructure and technology were also discussed, participants were more positive after the meeting about the conversation on foreign labor ""than about anything else we talked about,""  said Bill Northey, a farmer and Iowa's secretary of agriculture.
RED TAPE
Tom Demaline, president of Willoway Nurseries in Ohio, said he told the president about his struggles with the H-2A guestworker program, which he has used for 18 years.
He told Trump the program works in concept, but not in practice. ""I brought up the bureaucracy and red tape,"" he said. ""If the guys show up a week or two late, it puts crops in jeopardy. You are on pins and needles all year to make sure you get the workers and do everything right.""
While use of the program has steadily increased over the past decade, it still accounts for only about 10 percent of the estimated 1.3 million farmworkers in the country, according to government data. In 2016, the government granted 134,000 H-2A visas
Employers who import workers with H-2A visas must provide free transportation to and from the United States as well as housing and food for workers once they arrive. Wage minimums are set by the government and are often higher than farmers are used to paying. 
Steve Scaroni, whose company Fresh Harvest brings in thousands of foreign H-2A workers for growers in California's Central valley, says, however, that he could find work for even more people if he had more places to house them.

Trump recently signed another executive order titled ""Buy American, Hire American,"" calling for changes to a program granting temporary visas for the tech industry, but not to visas used by farmers and other seasonal businesses, including Trump's own resorts.
FARMER CONCERNS
Trump also signed two executive orders, just days after taking office, focused on border security that called for arresting more people in the United States illegally and speeding up deportations.
Roundtable participants said that many farmers have worried about the effect of the stepped up enforcement on their workforce, but Trump told them his administration was focused on deporting criminals, not farmworkers.
""He has a much better understanding about this than some of the rhetoric we have seen,"" said meeting attendee Steve Troxler, North Carolina's agriculture commissioner and a farmer himself.
The farmers at the meeting said they stressed to the president the need for both short-term and permanent workers. They said there should be a program to help long-time farmworkers without criminal records, but who are in the country illegally, to become legal residents. 
Last Tuesday, Democrats in the House and Senate said they would introduce a bill to give farmworkers who have worked illegally in the country for two consecutive years a ""blue card"" to protect them from deportation. 
Brubaker, the Pennsylvania farmer, said he liked what he had heard about the bill and hoped it would get the president's support to make it a bipartisan effort. 

""The administration has got something started here,"" he said of the meeting with farm leaders. ""It's about time something happens.""

U.S. natural gas for June delivery slumped 7.6 cents, or around 2.2%, to $3.348 per million British thermal units by 9:10AM ET (13:10GMT).
Prices of the heating fuel settled higher for the fourth-straight session on Friday after touching its strongest level since late January at $3.431.
Updated weather forecasting models pointed to a relatively cool period expected over the eastern U.S. for the next few days, but still with warmer conditions gaining ground after, according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 55 and 63 billion cubic feet in the week ended May 12.
That compares with a gain of 45 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 73 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 87 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.301 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 13.9% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 12.0% above the five-year average for this time of year.

1589,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2017 01:30AM ET</span>","Saudi Arabia, Russia agree oil output cuts until March 2018","By Chen Aizhu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world's two top oil producers, agreed on Monday to extend oil output cuts for a further nine months until March 2018 in a bid to erode a global crude glut, pushing up prices.
The timing of the announcement ahead of OPEC's next official meeting on May 25 and the statement's strong wording surprised markets, and the move will go a long way to ensure that other OPEC members and other producers who participated in the initial round of cuts fall into line.
In a joint statement that followed an earlier meeting, Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak said they had agreed to prolong an existing deal by another nine months until March 2018.
The ministers pledged ""to do whatever it takes"" to reduce global inventories to their five-year average and expressed optimism they will secure support from producers beyond those in the current deal, the statement said.
""There has been a marked reduction to the inventories, but we're not where we want to be in reaching the five-year average,"" said Falih at a briefing in Beijing alongside Novak.
""We've come to conclusion that the agreement needs to be extended.""
Under the current agreement that started on Jan. 1, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and other producers including Russia pledged to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of the year.
Saudi, the defacto leader of OPEC, and Russia, the world's biggest producer, together control a fifth of global supplies.
While it was broadly expected that OPEC and Russia would agree to extend the cut, the timing and wording of the statement sent crude prices up more than 1.5 percent in Asian trading.[O/R]
""I think OPEC and Russia recognize that in order to get the market back on their side they will need 'shock and awe' tactics where they need to go above and beyond a simple extension of the deal,"" said Virendra Chauhan, Singapore-based analyst at Energy Aspects.
""The market will also be looking at export cuts and not just production cuts, which is what is required to rebalance the market.""
Major producers had been forced to consider lengthening the cuts as crude futures (LCOc1) (CLc1) have languished around $50 per barrel as markets remain well supplied even after the current deal.
An OPEC source familiar with the market situation told Reuters earlier on Monday that oil inventories in floating storage have declined by one-third since the start of the year.

 Russia and Saudi Arabia together control around 20 million bpd in daily output.

In a briefing after the data release, an NBS spokesman said the nation had already met 63.4 percent of this year's targeted cuts for steel and 46 percent of coal cuts.
The ramp-up in steel output underscores the challenge for the government as it aims to slash 50 million tonnes of low-grade outdated capacity this year, on top of the 65 million removed last year. The government is targeting rebar, used in construction, in particular. 
But many of the plants that have been closed in recent years were already idled and output from still-open plants has continued to rise.
""Driven by high profits, steel companies are raising their capacity, by using high-quality iron ore and increasing their use of steel scrap,"" said Bai Jing, analyst at Galaxy Futures. 
""Production might be at record high, but the steel production capacity is being reduced."" 

In the first four months, production totaled 273.9 million tonnes, up 4.6 percent from the same period a year earlier, the data showed.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2017 04:42AM ET</span>",Mexican beef exporters look to Muslim markets as U.S. alternatives,"By David Alire Garcia and Theopolis Waters
MEXICO CITY/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Mexico's growing beef industry is targeting Muslim consumers in the Middle East for its prime cuts as it seeks to reduce dependence on buyers in the United States.
The potential for a U.S.-Mexico trade war under President Donald Trump has accelerated efforts by Mexican beef producers to explore alternative foreign markets to the United States, which buys 94 percent of their exports worth nearly $1.6 billion last year. 
Trump has vowed to redraw terms of trade with Mexico and Canada to the benefit of the United States. Mexican beef companies fear they may be dragged into a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the three countries.
That has firms looking to the Middle East, where most meat is imported from non-Muslim countries using animals slaughtered by the halal method prescribed by Islamic law.
Mexico, the world's sixth biggest beef producer, plans to quadruple exports of halal beef to 44 million pounds (20,000 tonnes) by the end of 2018 from 11 million pounds (5,000 tonnes) this year, according to data from the Mexican cattle growers association AMEG.
The country should have 15 plants certified to produce halal meat by the end of next year, up from a current six, according to AMEG data.
Jesus Vizcarra, chief executive and owner of SuKarne, Mexico's biggest beef exporter, said his company sees big potential for sales to Muslim-majority countries.
""We have to seek out more markets,"" he said in an interview, pointing to near-term targets in Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Lebanon.
""There's an opportunity in these Middle Eastern countries,"" said Vizcarra, who is known in Mexico as the King of Beef and has boasted of being born in a slaughterhouse. 
At SuKarne's sprawling Monarca plant, located 270 miles (435 km) west of the Mexican capital in Michoacan state, more than 150,000 cows leisurely pick at row after row of grain channels in dusty feed lots.
The plant is the company's first halal-certified facility and earlier this year began its first-ever shipments to Muslim markets.
""EYES WIDE OPEN""
Mexico's cattle growers' association sent a trade mission to Dubai and Qatar in late February to meet potential buyers, said Rogelio Perez, AMEG's top trade official
Inspectors from the UAE will visit Mexico by June, after Saudi inspectors were in Mexico in March, he said.
    ""They left with a very good taste in their mouths regarding Mexican production systems,"" he said. 
Plants must be certified as halal compliant by third-party companies such as U.S.-based Halal Transactions of Omaha or United Arab Emirates-based RACS.
Earlier this year, Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country, expressed interest in buying Mexican beef for the first time although no deals have yet been cut.
Sales to Muslim countries would take a bite out of the market share for halal meat held by beef packers from the United States and Brazil, according to industry and trade sources.
Mexico's beef industry is able to grow its export markets due to a successful push to meet exacting U.S. standards and modernize the sector over the past two decades. 
That has put Mexican packers in a strong position to diversify away from the U.S. market.
""It was our big strength until President Donald arrived, and now it's our major weakness,"" said Bosco de la Vega, president of Mexico's state farm council, adding that Mexico should limit beef exports to the United States to a maximum of half the overall flow.

Markets were still jittery since U.S. President Donald Trump’s unexpected decision to fire FBI Director James Comey.
Comey had been leading his agency's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and possible collusion with Trump's campaign.
Investors were concerned the latest events in Washington could hamper the U.S. administration's ability to implement promised tax reform and stimulus measures.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 99.48 on Friday morning.
A weaker U.S. dollar usually supports gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
 However, the greenback was still supported by the release on Thursday of upbeat reports on initial jobless claims and producer price inflation, as well as by mounting expectations for a rate hike by the Federal Reserve next month.
Market participants were now looking ahead to upcoming data on U.S. inflation, retail sales and consumer sentiment, due later Friday.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The International Energy Agency will review its electric vehicle (EV) use and oil demand forecasts after India and China recently signaled new policies in favor of electric cars and vehicles using other alternatives to gasoline.
In its current policies scenario, last updated in November 2016, the IEA expects vehicle demand for oil to rise until 2040.
But after the world's two fastest growing oil markets, China and India, indicated they are likely to take radical turns away from gasoline, the IEA says it will need to review its forecasts.
""We will therefore revisit our analysis of future EV market penetration on the basis of these new announcements for the next World Energy Outlook 2017, to be released on 14 November,” an IEA spokesman told Reuters.
In its ""road map"", released in April, China said it wants alternative fuel vehicles to account for at least one-fifth of a projected 35 million annual vehicle sales by 2025.
India is considering even more radical action, with an influential government think-tank drafting a report in support of electrifying all vehicles in the country by 2032, according to government and industry sources.
""There has been further policy momentum in support of electric cars, in particular from China and India,"" the IEA said.
The IEA says that China and India currently consume 11 percent and 2 percent of global gasoline demand respectively.

""The choices made by China and India are obviously most relevant for the possible future peak in passenger car oil demand,"" the IEA said.

1611,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2017 11:10AM ET</span>","OPEC sees more oil supply outside the group, countering its cuts","By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC on Thursday sharply raised its forecast for oil supply from non-member countries in 2017 as higher prices encourage U.S. shale drillers to pump more, hampering the producer group's efforts to clear a glut and support prices by cutting output.
In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said outside producers would boost supply by 950,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year, up from 580,000 bpd expected previously. 
As a result, OPEC cut the forecast 2017 demand for its crude by 300,000 bpd.
The 13-country OPEC is curbing its output by about 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1 for six months, the first reduction in eight years. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers agreed to cut half as much.
The report will add to a debate about the effectiveness of the cut, which is expected to be extended when producers meet later this month. While oil prices have gained support, higher rival supply is limiting further gains and an inventory glut has proved slow to shift.
""U.S. oil and gas companies have already stepped up activities in 2017,"" OPEC said in the report. ""U.S. tight crude output is expected to rise rapidly and increase by 600,000 bpd in 2017,"" OPEC said, using another term for shale. 
Oil prices pared gains on Thursday after the release of the report to trade at less than $51 a barrel (LCOc1), below the $60 level that top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia would like to see. Prices are still up from about $48 a year ago.
In the report, OPEC pointed to continued high compliance by its members with the supply deal and said oil stocks in industrialized nations fell in March - although they are still 276 million barrels above the five-year average.
Supply from the 11 OPEC members with production targets under the accord - all except Libya and Nigeria - fell to 29.674 million bpd last month, according to figures from secondary sources that OPEC uses to monitor output.
That means OPEC has complied 111 percent with the plan, according to a Reuters calculation, up from an estimate in March of 104 percent. OPEC did not publish a compliance number.
UAE, IRAQ 
OPEC said its production, including Nigeria and Libya, fell by about 18,000 bpd in April to 31.73 million bpd, according to the secondary sources.
Saudi Arabia increased output by about 50,000 bpd, according to the secondary sources and Saudi figures, although Riyadh continues to produce less than agreed under the deal.
Some of the larger OPEC producers told the organization that their output was higher than the secondary-source figures, meaning compliance is lower if these numbers are used. 
The United Arab Emirates reported a 15,000-bpd increase in its output to 2.988 million bpd - more than its OPEC target of 2.874 million bpd. Iraq said it pumped 4.53 million bpd, above its target of 4.351 million bpd.
Due to the higher supply expected from outside producers, OPEC trimmed forecast demand for its crude in 2017 to 31.92 million bpd, down 300,000 bpd from the previous forecast and not far from current production.
Any more supply from OPEC or non-OPEC could return the market to surplus. However, officials from member countries have questioned the sustainability of the rebound in shale.

OPEC and the non-OPEC producers also cutting output meet on May 25 and are expected to extend the supply cut at least into the second half of the year.

U.S. natural gas for June delivery gained 8.0 cents, or around 2.4%, to $3.372 per million British thermal units by 10:35AM ET (14:35GMT). It touched a daily peak of $3.388, a level not seen since January 27. Futures were at around $3.335 prior to the release of the supply data.
Prices of the heating fuel rallied 6.5 cents on Wednesday.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 45 billion cubic feet in the week ended May 5, below forecasts for a build of 53 billion.
That compared with a gain of 67 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 68 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 73 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.301 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 13.9% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 12.0% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, cool conditions are expected to linger over the northeastern U.S. through early next week, according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
A weather system tracking across the Southwest toward Texas will bring showers, but still with mostly comfortable temperatures as highs reach the 60s and 70s.
Over the West, warm conditions will give way to cooling this weekend as Pacific systems return.
Overall, natural gas demand will remain stronger than normal, mainly driven primarily by the cooler than normal northeastern U.S.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday, with benchmark Brent crude trading comfortably above $50 a barrel after a fall in U.S. inventories and a bigger-than-expected cut in Saudi supplies to Asia helped tightened the market.
But a downbeat report from OPEC tempered early gains as the producer group said higher-than-expected production from its competitors would reduce demand for its crude this year.
Brent (LCOc1) was 60 cents higher at $50.82 a barrel by 1255 GMT (8.55 a.m. ET) after hitting an early high of $51.09. U.S. light crude oil (CLc1) was last up 60 cents at $47.93.
""We saw the biggest draw in (U.S.) inventories for the year last week with stockpiles down more than 5 million barrels, and it looks like OPEC's production cut is finally biting,"" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at brokerage AxiTrader.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia have agreed to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of the year to try to reduce a global fuel glut.
OPEC meets on May 25 to decide on production policy for the second half of 2017, and most analysts expect the group to extend cuts until at least the end of the year.
OPEC has reduced output as promised, but there have been few signs so far that supply has fallen significantly as producers have shielded many key customers, especially in Asia, from cuts.
However, after Brent fell below $50 a barrel last week, analysts said producers felt forced to act.
Saudi Arabia told Asian refiners of its first cuts in crude allocations since OPEC's output reduction took effect in January. Saudi Aramco will reduce supplies to Asian customers by about 7 million barrels in June.
U.S. crude stockpiles posted their biggest weekly drawdown since December last week as imports dropped sharply, while inventories of refined products also fell. [EIA/S]
While U.S. oil inventories fell, the country's oil production  continued to rise, jumping above 9.3 million bpd last week, in what is now a more than 10 percent increase since its mid-2016 trough.

OPEC said in a report on Thursday that higher production in the United States and elsewhere would eat into its market share. It raised its estimate of total oil supply growth from non-OPEC producers this year to 950,000 bpd from a previous forecast of 580,000 bpd.

In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January and June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
Oil futures posted their largest one-day gain since December 1 on Wednesday after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude oil inventories fell by 5.2 million barrels in the week ended May 5, far exceeding market expectations. The reading marks the biggest weekly drawdown since December.
The EIA also said that gasoline stockpiles declined by 200,000 barrels, while distillate stockpiles were down 1.6 million barrels last week.
Crude sank to a five-month low earlier this week, rattled by concern over increasing U.S. crude output that has shaken investors' faith in the ability of OPEC to rebalance the market.

Despite the bounce in gold futures, overall sentiment remained fairly negative as it is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in June.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2017 06:13PM ET</span>",Bid to revoke Obama methane rule fails in surprise U.S. Senate vote,"By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday rejected a resolution to revoke an Obama-era rule to limit methane emissions from oil and gas production on federal lands, dealing a blow to President Donald Trump's efforts to free the drilling industry from what he sees as excessive environmental regulation.
The Congressional Review Act resolution received just 49 votes after Republican leaders scrambled for weeks to secure the 51 needed to pass it. The resolution would have revoked the rule and prevented similar regulations from being introduced.
Getting the Trump administration to repeal the BLM rule had been a top priority of the oil and gas industry. Companies said it was unnecessary, would could cost them tens of thousands of dollars per well and hinder production.
But not all Republicans supported the measure, in part because it would have made regulating methane waste more difficult in the future. 
Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona made a surprise vote against the resolution, joining fellow Republicans Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine in opposition to torpedo it.
""While I am concerned that the BLM rule may be onerous, passage of the resolution would have prevented the federal government, under any administration, from issuing a rule that is ‘similar’,"" McCain said in a statement.
He said the Interior Department should issue a new rule on to replace the existing one on methane leaks, which he called a public health and air quality issue.
The rule, finalized by President Barack Obama in his last weeks in office, updated 30-year-old regulations that govern flaring, venting and natural gas leaks from oil and gas production. Obama's administration said it would preserve up to 41 billion cubic feet (BCF) of natural gas per year that is currently lost to leaks and flaring.
The American Petroleum Institute and other industry groups have said the methane rule is unnecessary because companies have made strides in reducing leaks on their own. 
""The rule could impede U.S. energy production while reducing local and federal revenues,"" said Erik Milito, API's Upstream and Industry Operations Group Director.
Members of the Western Energy Alliance, which include  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) , Whiting Petroleum and EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) had also been strongly opposed to the rule.
Environmental groups hailed what they depicted as a rare victory for the environment after several regulatory rollbacks by the Trump administration.
“In recent months, thousands of Americans asked the Senate to stand up for clean air and against the oil lobby, and their efforts were successful today,"" said Jamie Williams, president of the Wilderness Society.
The Western Values Project estimated that if the rule had been rescinded, the U.S. Treasury would have lost out on $800 million in lost potential royalties from leaked or vented natural gas over the next decade.

Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works who supported the resolution to kill the rule, called on Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to act unilaterally to revoke it.

Oil upgraders capable of converting Orinoco Belt's extra heavy crude into exportable grades have increased processing in recent weeks after working partially earlier this year, allowing more exports, sources close to the projects said.
Sales of Zuata 30, Venezuela's lightest upgraded crude, to the United States almost doubled to 178,000 bpd in April compared with the previous month, according to the data.
Exports of diluted crude oil (DCO) made with extra heavy oil and heavy naphtha increased 17 percent compared to March.
The United States imported a total of 42 cargoes of Venezuelan crude in April. The largest receiver was PDVSA's refining unit Citgo Petroleum, followed by  Valero Energy  (N:VLO) and Phillips 66 (N:PSX).
Even though PDVSA has recently increased crude exports, its sales of refined products have decreased amid very low processing at Venezuela's refining network.
PDVSA's 187,000-barrel-per-day Puerto la Cruz refinery is operating at minimum levels after two of its three distillations units were halted due to lack of available crude and equipment malfunctioning, affecting exports of products such as jet fuel. 
The firm also is regularly importing U.S. light crude through a rented storage facility in the island of Curacao. 

The tanker NS Champion chartered by China's state-run oil firm CNPC has been waiting to discharge at Curacao's Bullenbay terminal after arriving earlier this week from the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The principal impact of a border tax adjustment would be to raise the price of domestic crude compared with international grades such as Brent.
""It would blow out the Brent/WTI spread. You could see WTI trade $15 above Brent,"" Currie told the S&P Global Platts Crude conference.
The premium of Brent crude futures over West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures is currently around $2.81 a barrel.
The government of President Donald Trump has considered a Republican proposal for a border tax adjustment system that would levy a 20 percent tax on all imports while exempting exports.
Domestic U.S. crude prices would automatically rise, pushing up the cost of anything from gasoline to plastics. 
Border tax advocates claim the impact of higher import costs and perceived subsidy for exports would be a rise in the real exchange rate of the U.S. dollar.

""For every non-commodity, the dollar does all the work so that the consumer does not pay the price ... oil does not have that leverage,"" Currie said.

Comex gold futures rose around $6.00, or about 0.5%, to $1,222.30 a troy ounce by 3:05AM ET (07:05GMT). Meanwhile, spot gold was at $1,221.80.
The yellow metal hit its lowest since March 15 at $1,214.30 on Tuesday amid fading demand for safe-haven assets.
Trump fired Comey on the advice of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, over his handling of an election-year email scandal involving then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
Democrats immediately accused Trump of having political motives, as Comey had been leading his agency's investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and possible collusion with Trump's campaign.
Market analysts warned that Comey's firing could create a sideshow that may delay the Trump Administration's plans on tax reform and infrastructure spending, weighing on the dollar.
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, slipped to 99.33, moving away from Tuesday's three-week high of 99.56.

However, expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike next month limited gains. Markets are pricing in around an 80% chance of a hike at the Fed's June meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>May 09, 2017 07:20PM ET</span>",U.S. Commerce chief says EPA permits top regulatory 'hit list',"By David Lawder and Kevin Krolicki
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Tuesday that burdensome Environmental Protection Agency permit requirements were at the top of a ""hit-list"" of regulations on manufacturers that he will soon present to President Donald Trump.
Ross told Reuters in an interview that some of the federal regulations could be eliminated or modified through executive actions, and some through directives to agencies to reinterpret statutes and rules.
The list is part of a Trump cabinet-wide effort to survey U.S. company chief executives to uncover regulatory burdens that are keeping their businesses from growing.
Ross said he had sought ""the most depressive permitting factors, rules and regulations. We are now condensing all of that into a recommendation series to the president and will probably make the recommendations sometime during the month of May.""
Asked what parts of the list were the most onerous, he said: ""On permitting, there are a lot of things. Mostly EPA-related issues.""
Ross said that EPA permit requirements for portable toilets on oil and gas drilling sites was an example of too much regulation. 
""Well, if you can imagine that if they (EPA) torture you with getting a permit for a porta potty, how about a permit to actually drill a well? That whole mindset has got to change,"" he said.
The Commerce Department in March invited companies to submit comments on the type and number of permits required to build, expand or operate a factory, the most onerous part of the permitting process and ways that regulatory compliance could be simplified. It also asked for opinions on the federal, state and local agencies with the best permitting practices. 
Ross said the easing of regulatory burdens on businesses was among several elements of Trump's economic agenda that needed to be in place before the U.S. economy could reach the administration's 3 percent growth target, along with reforms to taxes, trade policies and energy production.
Ross said conservative estimates on regulatory burdens on manufacturing run into the hundreds of billions of dollars in added costs for U.S. manufacturers, but he said the bigger problems were delays in investment decisions. 
He said he recently spoke with representatives from Australian mining giant  Rio Tinto  Plc (AX:RIO) (L:RIO) about the firm's long delayed efforts to gain necessary permits for the Resolution Copper mine in Arizona that it is developing with BHP Billiton Plc (AX:BHP) (L:BLT) 
""They've been eight years trying to get permits to do it. There's been hundreds of millions of dollars (spent), and they still don't even have the assurance that they will get it,"" Ross said. 

""A company shouldn't have to be hundreds of millions of dollars into risk money without knowing whether there is a real chance it is going to get approved,"" he said. ""So one of the problems is the regulation itself. And some of those regulatory problems are at the state and local level.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A tough U.S. proposal on bilateral sugar trade with Mexico sets a bad precedent for an impending renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the head of Mexico's sugar chamber, Juan Cortina, said on Tuesday.
The U.S. sugar industry pressed the Commerce Department late last year to withdraw from a 2014 trade agreement that sets prices and quota for U.S. imports of Mexican sugar unless the deal could be renegotiated.
The new proposal for modifying the 2014 agreement, which seeks to increase minimum prices for refined Mexican sugar and adjust quality requirements, would essentially push Mexican exporters out of the U.S. market, said Cortina, who sits on the Mexican negotiating team.
Bilateral trade relations are under strain as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to renegotiate the NAFTA pact with Mexico and Canada and to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and have Mexico pay for it.
""This is a very bad precedent for upcoming (NAFTA) negotiations if we can't reach an agreement,"" said Cortina, speaking at a news conference.
Mexico and the United States last week extended a deadline to June 5 to reach an agreement on how much Mexican refined and crude sugar can enter the United States.
Mexican sugar producers will formally request the government launch an anti-dumping probe into U.S. high-fructose corn syrup, Cortina said.
The U.S. proposal seeks to sharply lower the amount of refined sugar Mexico exports to the United States, sources said earlier. The current agreement caps Mexico exports of refined sugar at 53 percent of total sugar exports to the United States; the proposal would slash that to just 15 percent. Raw sugar would make up the remainder.
Cortina said Mexican producers are open to decreasing the share of refined sugar, but not as much the new U.S. proposal is calling for.
The proposal would also seek to decrease ""polarity"" of Mexican sugar exports, a measure of sugar quality and its suitability for human consumption, to 99.2 percent, from 99.5 percent, said Cortina.
""The issue of polarity is non-negotiable,"" Cortina told Reuters after the news conference.
Refined sugar is defined as having a polarity of 99.5 percent or greater.
There is ""room to talk"" about minimum prices for Mexican sugar exported to the United States, Cortina said.

He added that local exporters are willing to send sugar to the United States loose in ship, rather than bagged, as refiners in the United States are requesting.

1657,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2017 09:30AM ET</span>","OPEC, non-OPEC discuss extending supply cut by nine months or more: sources","By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC and non-member oil producers are considering extending a global supply cut for nine months or more to avoid a price-sapping output increase in the first quarter of next year, when demand is expected to be weak, OPEC and industry sources said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers agreed last year to curb production by 1.8 million barrels per day for six months from Jan. 1.
Oil prices have gained support but global inventories remain high, pulling crude (LCOc1) back below $50 a barrel and putting pressure on OPEC to extend the cuts through the rest of 2017. 
Production from countries not participating in the deal, such as the United States, has also been rising, keeping crude below the $60 level that OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and others would like to see.
OPEC countries including core Gulf members are discussing internally whether an extension of nine months or longer is needed to give the market more time to rebalance, the sources said.
One industry source familiar with the talks said there had been discussions about extending curbs until the end of the first quarter of 2018, when crude demand should be seasonally weak. 
""To increase production in those months may have a negative impact (on prices). So we may ask for an extension until the end of Q1 of 2018,"" the source said.
An OPEC source said other ideas and scenarios could be discussed, adding that core Gulf OPEC producers had talked about an extension beyond six months. 
Another OPEC source said it would be tough to get a consensus on prolonging curbs for more than six months but ""anything can happen"". 
A third source said an extension of up to one year could be an option.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday the OPEC-led production cut could be extended beyond 2017.
""Based on consultations that I've had with participating members, I am confident the agreement will be extended into the second half of the year and possibly beyond,"" Falih said at an industry event in Kuala Lumpur.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Monday backed extending oil output curbs, saying it would help speed up a return to a healthier market. Novak did not mention for how long he thought curbs should be prolonged.
OPEC officials generally believe the agreement is helping to bring the market closer to balance and that it should be extended into the second half of this year. OPEC sources told Reuters last week that a bigger cut was unlikely.

A formal decision will be taken by OPEC on May 25.

U.S. natural gas for June delivery slumped 9.4 cents, or around 3%, to $3.172 per million British thermal units by 9:20AM ET (13:20GMT). Prices of the heating fuel jumped 8.0 cents on Friday.
Updated weather forecasting models pointed to a relatively cool period expected over the eastern U.S. for the next ten days, but still with warmer conditions gaining ground after, according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 48 and 58 billion cubic feet in the week ended May 5.
That compares with a gain of 67 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 68 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 73 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.256 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 13.7% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 13.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Monday, reversing gains made earlier in the session as evidence of rising U.S. drilling offset news that OPEC and other producers may extend their production cuts.
Brent crude was down 37 cents on the day at $48.73 a barrel at 1246 GMT (8.46 a.m. ET), having risen to a high of $49.92 earlier in the session. U.S. light crude fell by 30 cents to $45.92 a barrel, down from a intra-day high of $46.98.
Both futures contracts have dropped by more than 10 percent in the last month despite moves by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters, including Russia, to restrict supply in the first half of 2017.
The OPEC-led efforts to reduce bulging global oil inventories have been undermined by a surge in drilling in the United States, filling much of the gap left by OPEC.
OPEC meets on May 25 when it is expected to discuss extending the cuts to the end of 2017, although analysts say a further six-month extension may not be enough.
""The market is in a very dangerous condition,"" said Robin Bieber, technical chart analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates. ""The trend is still down, but just correcting.""
Data from the InterContinental Exchange on Monday showed investors cut their bullish bets on Brent to the lowest level since late November. 
Russia said on Monday it was discussing prolonging cuts with other producers beyond 2017, without giving a clear timeline. Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih also talked of the possibility of prolonging curbs beyond 2017.
Countering those efforts, U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a 16th week in a row last week, extending a drilling recovery into a 12th month, energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc said on Friday. 
Since a low point in May 2016, U.S. producers have added 387 oil rigs, or about 123 percent, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.
U.S. crude output averaged 9.3 million bpd in the week ended April 28, its highest since August 2015, according to federal data [EIA/S].
Many analysts now see U.S. crude output heading towards 10 million bpd over the next year or so.
""It's all about inventories and U.S. shale versus OPEC,"" said Hussein Sayed of brokerage FXTM. ""OPEC members have no choice but to talk up prices by signalling an extension to the production cuts agreement.""

He said oil prices would probably rally ""but the recovery won't be a straight line.""

Pro-European Union, market-friendly centrist Emmanuel Macron beat anti-EU, anti-immigration far-rightist Marine Le Pen to clinch the French presidency in the second round of voting on Sunday.
With virtually all votes counted, results showed Macron had topped 66% against just under 34% for Le Pen, delivering a result that most investors were hoping for.
The victory for Macron signaled that political risks in France and across Europe are receding, in the wake of the populist surge which resulted in Brexit and propelled Donald Trump to the White House.
The French election overshadowed Friday’s U.S. jobs report, which showed that the economy added 211,000 jobs last month, beating expectations for a gain of 185,000 and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%, a near a 10-year low.
The report also showed that the prior month’s figure of 98,000 was revised down to an even lower 79,000.
Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in April. However, downward revisions to previous months lowered the year-on-year increase to 2.5%, the smallest gain since August 2016, from 2.6% in March.
The jobs data did little to alter the view that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in June. Markets are pricing in around a 75% chance of a hike at the Fed's June meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Key U.S. economic data this week could provide further evidence if the world’s largest economy is strong enough to withstand a rate hike as early as next month, with Friday's retail sales and inflation reports in the spotlight.

1666,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>",Brimming U.S. oil storage tanks to feel OPEC cuts last,"By Julia Simon and Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The energy industry scrutinizes U.S. oil stockpile data every week for evidence that OPEC supply cuts are ending a global crude glut, but growing domestic output means the world's largest oil consumer may be the last place to feel the cuts.
Stubbornly high U.S. inventory levels have shaken market confidence that a deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and other top producers to cut 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from supply will end the two-year glut.
This week, benchmark Brent crude prices slipped below $50 a barrel. Brent has given up all the gains made since the supply cuts were agreed late last year. [O/R]
U.S. inventories are a trusted barometer for the health of global oil markets because of the transparency of the data and their location in the country that consumes around a fifth of the world's oil. 
But U.S. crude inventories have only grown since the supply cuts took effect. The initial spike in oil prices after the deal reinforced already resurgent production from the U.S. shale industry.
The rush back into the fields boosted U.S. shale output to an estimated 5.2 million bpd in May from 4.5 million at the end of 2016. The increase of 700,000 bpd in U.S. supply has replaced much of the output cuts delivered under the OPEC-led agreement.
Offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico has also hit a record, bringing total U.S. output to 9.3 million barrels a day, its highest since August 2015.
That has helped keep U.S. stockpiles full.
""As long as U.S. producers are able to pump oil at a profit then the rebalancing in the U.S. is going to take time,"" said Mark Watkins, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank.
""It's going to be an extended period of time still. I would look to at least the end of the year."" 
In addition, producer countries that pumped a lot of their own oil into storage at home have recently been exporting from those tanks to consumer countries such as the United States.
OPEC members typically do not disclose their stock levels. So even though the export of stored oil is part of the effort to draw down global inventories, it also has pushed previously invisible inventories into global storage data.
Those OPEC shipments may now be easing. Thomson Reuters shipping data shows crude exports from the group dropped from March to April by about 50 million barrels to 741.2 million barrels.
U.S. STOCKPILES RISE
U.S. crude inventories hit records earlier this year, and remain up 10 percent since the OPEC-led supply cuts took effect on Jan. 1.
U.S. crude stocks stand at 527.8 million barrels, nearly 30 percent higher than the average of the past five years, according to government data.
Exports from the United States have been steadily rising and have also regularly reached records this year. If markets tighten elsewhere, U.S. exports will increase and this should drain domestic inventories more quickly. 
""What you're going to have to see is global supply across the world drop and U.S. crude ship out before you start to see a meaningful drop in U.S. inventories,"" said Watkins.
""And that's something that's started a little bit, but it's pretty marginal."" 
Despite the high domestic output, there are some signs that efforts to reduce the global glut may be having an impact in the United States.
A recent four-week run of U.S. inventory draws has been larger than the 2011-2016 average for this time of year, said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) in a note on Friday.
IMPACT ELSEWHERE
More tangible impacts on inventories can be seen elsewhere, some analysts said; inventories simply need more time to return to average levels.
There have been some signs of drawdowns in global inventories, particularly in floating storage, when oil is stored in a tanker anchored offshore. According to Clipperdata this type of storage has been falling near the refining hub of Singapore.
Singapore ""acts as such a parking lot for tankers and should we see Singapore floating storage be drawn down materially that would indicate that the market is tightening,"" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at Clipperdata.
Clipperdata estimates that 50 million barrels are floating off Singapore, down sharply from February's peak of 64 million barrels, which was the highest point in at least a year.
""The lack of visible stock declines ... undermined oil market confidence and dragged markets lower,"" said oil consultants PIRA Energy in a note this week.

""Market jitters are unwarranted; oil on the water is declining, OPEC output is declining and stocks are declining. Onshore stock declines are inevitable, but the exact timing is tricky.""

Last week, oil futures settled higher on Friday, but still registered a hefty loss for the week as signs of rising U.S. shale production continued to feed concerns about a global supply glut.
Crude has been under pressure in recent weeks amid fears that an ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production is derailing efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.

The U.S. rig count rose by 6 to 703, extending an 11-month drilling recovery to the highest level since August 2015. The relentless increase in U.S. output has overshadowed pledged output cuts by major producers.
In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January and June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices closed 1.5 percent higher on Friday, rebounding from five-month lows, following positive U.S. jobs data and assurances by Saudi Arabia that Russia is ready to join OPEC in extending supply cuts to reduce a persistent glut.
The market, however, remained in technically oversold territory with futures trading down as much as 19 percent from highs in mid April, prompting some speculators to exit their long positions.
Brent futures gained 72 cents, or 1.5 percent, to settle at $49.10 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude climbed 70 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $46.22 per barrel.
After falling almost 5 percent on Thursday, both contracts continued to collapse overnight with WTI falling to $43.76, its lowest since Nov. 15, and Brent down to $46.64, its lowest since Nov. 30 when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to cut production during the first half of 2017.
Both benchmarks pared losses after Saudi Arabia's OPEC Governor Adeeb Al-Aama told Reuters that OPEC and non-OPEC nations were close to agreeing to extend a deal to curb production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) for six months from Jan. 1.
""Based on today's data, there's a growing conviction that a six-month extension may be needed to rebalance the market, but the length of the extension is not firm yet,"" the Saudi official said.
OPEC sources said on Thursday that OPEC is likely to extend cuts when it meets on May 25 but that a deeper cut is unlikely.
In the United States, meanwhile, job growth rebounded sharply in April and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.4 percent, near a 10-year low, according to government data.
""The jobs report is extremely positive for the U.S. economy...and should help boost oil demand,"" said Mark Watkins, regional investment manager for U.S. Bank’s private client group in Park City, Utah.

The unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since May 2007, dropping to 4.4%, down from 4.5% in March.

Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.

The fund, Andurand Capital, is a renowned oil price bull but has been reducing its bullish positions gradually over the course of 2017, the source said.
The $1.5 billion fund lost 11.6 percent in the first quarter of the year, according to data from HSBC.
The losses were incurred even as oil prices remained relatively steady during January-February, which also saw record low volatility levels, undercutting many hedge funds.
However, in March and April oil prices began a steep slide as the market lost confidence in the ability of oil producing countries to quickly eradicate a market glut with output cuts.
Oil prices are now down 17 percent year-to-date but the source said Andurand Capital did not switch its long positions into shorts as it remained ""fundamentally bullish on oil"".
Andurand, who shot to fame in 2008 by correctly predicting the spike and subsequent fall in the oil price from a record $147 a barrel, forecast late last year that Brent (LCOc1) would trade around $60 a barrel by the end of 2016 and rise toward $70 by this summer.
On Friday, Brent edged up from its five-month lows to trade near $49 per barrel.

On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the July Brent contract added 0.17% to $48.47 a barrel, after hitting a six-month trough of $46.65 earlier in the session.
Crude prices came under broad selling pressure after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 930,000 barrels in the week ended April 28, a much smaller draw than expected.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 191,000 barrels, as refiners produced more fuel than the market could consume.
Crude has been under pressure in recent weeks amid fears that an ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production is derailing efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 15th week in a row, reaching the highest level since August 2015. The relentless increase in U.S. output has overshadowed pledged output cuts by major producers.
In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January and June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for June delivery were up 0.42% at $1,233.72.
The June contract ended Thursday’s session 1.59% lower at $1,228.60 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,225.70, Thursday’s low and resistance at $1,257.80, Wednesday’s high.
Gold prices had tumbled after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, as expected, and gave a positive assessment of the U.S. economy, suggesting it was still on track for two more rate hikes this year.
The Fed said it expects the economy to rebound after hitting a soft patch in the first three months of the year, noting that the labor market looks solid and inflation is running close to its target, setting the stage for a rate hike next month.
But the precious metal benefited from a drop in the U.S. dollar on Thursday.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 98.62 on Friday morning, close to Thursday’s six-month trough of 98.56.
A weaker U.S. dollar usually supports gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
Market participants were now looking ahead to the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report due later Friday, for further indications on the strength of the job market.
Data on Thursday painted a mixed picture of the U.S. economy, as initial jobless claims fell more than expected last week while factory orders eased in March.

Last week, U.S. drillers added rigs for the 15th week in a row, data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed last Friday, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The U.S. rig count rose by 9 to 697, extending an 11-month drilling recovery to the highest level since August 2015.
Overnight, crude futures settled 5% lower on Thursday, wiping out the gains achieved since OPEC and other producers agreed a deal to cut production, as investors’ concerns about the glut in crude stockpiles heightened, ahead of the OPEC meeting on May 25.
Crude prices plunged to a session low of $45.31, just shy of the November 30. low of $45.22, the day OPEC and other producers including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) for a period of six-month months until June.
Despite, data from the Information Energy Administration (IEA), showing that 99% of the targeted cut has been implemented during the first quarter of 2017, oversupply jitters returned as producers, who are not part of the deal to curb supply, the U.S. in particular, ramped up output, which has dampened OPEC’s effort to reduce global supply.
Saudi oil chief Khalid al-Falih acknowledged last week, that the first quarter of cuts failed to stem the glut in supply to below the five-year average but hinted at the possibility of extending the supply-cut agreement beyond June.
OPEC is expected to decide at talks on May 25 whether to extend production the current deal to cut production for an additional six-months to the end of the year.
The slide came a day after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) revealed that U.S. crude stockpiles fell less than expected.

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers look likely to extend their agreement to limit supplies beyond its June expiry to help clear a glut, three OPEC delegates said on Thursday, downplaying the chance of additional steps such as a bigger cut.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers originally agreed to curb production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) for six months from Jan. 1 to support the market.
Oil prices have gained support but stockpiles are still high and production from non-participating countries such as the United States has been rising, keeping crude below the $60 level that OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia would like to see.
However, OPEC officials generally believe the agreement is helping to bring the market closer to balance between supply and demand and that it should be extended into the second half of the year with the same numbers.
""The willingness to extend the current understanding is strong among OPEC and non-OPEC participants,"" an OPEC delegate said, declining to be identified by name. 
""I have doubts that more cuts will be discussed as the current agreement is yielding a positive outcome.""
Officials from the 13-country OPEC - which accounts for a third of global oil production - are in Vienna on Thursday and Friday to attend a meeting of the group's governing board. Such meetings provide an occasion to chat informally, but they deal with administrative matters and do not decide policy.
""A rollover with the same numbers,"" another OPEC delegate said on Thursday, asked about the chance of a larger cut being agreed when OPEC and non-OPEC ministers meet on May 25.
To be sure, some OPEC delegates have raised the possibility of a larger supply cut and others have said the existing agreement could be tweaked. 
But another official familiar with the supply deal said an increase in the size of the reduction was not likely.
""I don't expect any surprises,"" this official said. ""Especially now almost everyone is complying reasonably well.""
OPEC members including top exporter Saudi Arabia have voiced support for extending the deal. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak made Moscow's position clearer on Thursday, saying Russia was inclined to prolong the accord.

Compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC with pledged cutbacks stood at 98 percent in March, OPEC said – higher than the organization achieved during its last cut in 2009.

U.S. natural gas for June delivery slipped 3.3 cents, or about 1%, to $3.196 per million British thermal units by 10:35AM ET (14:35GMT). Futures were at around $3.220 prior to the release of the supply data.
Prices of the heating fuel rose 3.3 cents on Wednesday as traders reacted to cooler weather forecasts in the Midwest region.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 67 billion cubic feet in the week ended April 28, disappointing forecasts for a build of 61 billion.
That compared with a gain of 74 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 68 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 63 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.256 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 13.7% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 13.4% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, a strong spring storm tracking through the southeastern U.S. with heavy showers and thunderstorms will push across the Great Lakes and Northeast this weekend into early next week to keep below normal temperatures in place.
Overall, natural gas demand will be slightly stronger than normal well into next week, according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.

1691,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2017 05:52AM ET</span>","Little fanfare, but Gulf of Mexico oil still growing steadily","By Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As rapid growth in U.S. shale production grabs headlines and threatens to upend attempts by OPEC to balance oil markets, a more unsung sector of the U.S. industry is also hitting new output highs - the offshore Gulf of Mexico.
While attention and investment is focused on shale, the Gulf is the among the most prolific oil source in the United States, producing more than Alaska, the West Coast and Rocky Mountains combined. The region churned out a record 1.76 million barrels per day of crude in January, trailing only Texas onshore production, which includes the growing Permian Basin.
“The business can compete with tight onshore oil any day,” said Richard Morrison, regional president for the Gulf of Mexico for  BP  Plc (L:BP) speaking at the annual Offshore Technology Conference in Houston, where nearly 70,000 people from 120 countries are attending.
The Gulf region is expected to add another 190,000 bpd before the end of the year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Growth should continue, according to consultancy RBN Energy, which expects production to rise by 300,000 bpd in 2018 from current levels.
To get similar 2017 growth in Texas's Permian Basin, for example, drillers would need to double the current rig count from the current 342, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. EIA data. Even if that were possible, incrementally added rigs might not be as productive as those currently drilling, as prime locations have already been claimed.
Unlike shale, where price immediately governs production, Gulf production has proved relatively resistant to fluctuations in prices, fueled by projects approved before oil lost 80 percent of its value in less than two years.
For production to ramp up further in the Gulf, however, producers will have to reckon with the idea that the more active shale region - where time horizons are shorter - might keep crude oil prices (CLc1) overall lower for longer, with little chance to break out of the $45 to $55 per barrel range.
Low oil prices had prompted some companies, including ConocoPhillips (N:COP), to pull back from the Gulf, as offshore rig owners are still smarting from the downturn.
Because of the long lag involved in assessing deepwater prospects and building drilling rigs, some of today's projects are the result of decisions made five or more years ago.  Hess Corp 's (N:HES) Stampede offshore project, for example, is expected to produce 15,000 bpd of crude beginning in the middle of next year.
Overall, rising offshore production offset the decline in shale. Through the end of 2016, ""the increase in U.S. crude oil production has been driven entirely by Gulf of Mexico offshore,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts wrote in a note to clients.
While low oil prices from 2014 to 2017 reduced the number of new investment decisions taking during that time, some low-cost projects are still being approved, which may lessen the blow of low prices.
Gulf output is also being driven by so-called tie-backs, which are subsea lines that connect to existing projects, according to RBN Energy. These less-expensive underwater lines offer companies a chance to connect additional wells at known fields to active platforms.
A wave of big projects have come online, including Shenzi, Lucius, Heidelberg and Delta House, all approved before the downturn, said Leslie Cook, principal analyst in Upstream Supply Chain at Wood Mackenzie.
Going into year three of the downturn, tie-backs are continuing but exploration has dropped quite a bit, she said. That may affect growth going forward, even after the Trump Administration signed an executive order looking to review leases, including in the Gulf.
""What we see is a gap coming up,” she said.
Around the Houston trade-show floor, companies are more optimistic than they were in 2016. Services providers hawked technology they say will make offshore exploration and production more competitive.
Ultra-light cranes, platforms that can be brought on-line faster and virtual reality ""twins"" of facilities designed to help engineers spot problems before taking costly flights out to remote platforms were among the highlights.
While the conference is global, many of these developments will be rolled out in the Gulf: BP said its Mad Dog Two production facility will have a virtual twin when it comes online.
At KBR's booth at the OTC, Executive Vice President Graham Hill said they were marketing a new platform to customers, including those in the Gulf, but he was getting some pushback their assertion that the platform can produce oil economically at $40 a barrel.
“Nobody has yet decided to go down that road. We think that's because of false hope, and this is the new norm,” he said. “The new norm is $55 a barrel oil for three to four years, because shale producers will open up the tap when the price goes up.”

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude June contract lost 39 cents, or around 0.8%, to $47.43 a barrel by 3:30AM ET (07:30GMT). The U.S. benchmark touched its weakest level since March 27 at $47.30 on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for July delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 43 cents to $50.36 a barrel, not far from a five-week low of $50.14 logged on Tuesday.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 930,000 barrels in the week ended April 28, a much smaller draw than expected.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 191,000 barrels, as refiners produced more fuel than the market could consume.
Crude has been under pressure in recent weeks amid fears that an ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production is derailing efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 15th week in a row, reaching the highest level since August 2015. The relentless increase in U.S. output has overshadowed pledged output cuts by major producers.
In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January and June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for June declined 0.8 cents, or nearly 0.5%, to $1.514 a gallon, while June heating oil fell 1.0 cent to $1.462 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for June delivery inched down 1.2 cents to $3.216 per million British thermal units, as traders looked ahead to weekly storage data due later in the global day.

The Fed concluded its two-day policy meeting Wednesday afternoon, giving a positive assessment of the U.S. economy while keeping rates unchanged, as was widely expected.
The U.S. central bank's policymaking committee downplayed weak first-quarter economic growth while emphasizing the strength of the labor market, suggesting it was still on track for two more rate hikes this year.
Futures traders are pricing in around a 70% chance of a hike at the Fed's June meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Odds of a September increase was seen at about 85%.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.

1694,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2017 12:50AM ET</span>",Slumping oilfield services sector bets on new offshore technology,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault and Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - The oil industry's top equipment and services suppliers this week are hawking vastly cheaper ways of designing and equipping subsea wells, aiming to slash the cost of offshore projects to compete with the faster-moving shale industry. 
At the Offshore Technology Conference, the industry's annual gathering of floating rig and subsea well suppliers, sales pitches this year are all about cost savings and faster time to first production. With U.S. crude priced (CLc1) under $50 a barrel, offshore projects with their typically high costs and long-lead times are now borrowing from leaner shale in the competition for oil company investment. 
Low oil prices have soured new exploration in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, for instance, but production volumes there have remained strong due to the long lead times of these projects. Gulf of Mexico producers are expected to add 190,000 barrels per day this year to output now running about 1.76 million bpd. 
Tool and services companies are offering new technologies that can do several jobs, taking the place of multiple devices or highly-paid consultants.
National Oilwell Varco Inc (N:NOV) is exhibiting software it touts as performing much like a drilling expert, sorting through vast amounts of data to find ways to speed production and reduce downtime. 
The new software ""takes actions a person would do and runs them automatically. It's low cost and it's simple"" said David Reid, National Oilwell Varco's chief marketing officer. 
 Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI) is showing a new tool called DeepFrac that it said eliminates several steps now required to complete underwater wells. That saving pares the price of a well by up to 40 percent, speeding first production and lowering the break-even cost for producers. 
""This helps sharply cut some of the risk of drilling an offshore oil well and, we believe, sharply reduces costs for our customers,"" said Jim Sessions, a vice president of technology at Baker Hughes.
Graham Hill, an executive vice president at  KBR Inc  (N:KBR), detailed the construction company's plan for a cheaper floating production vessel, saying the new vessel fits producers' tight budgets. KBR can hope to earn more by selling extra features. 
""This is like ordering a Ford,"" he said. ""There's a base package, and you can add extras.""
Richard Morrison, president of  BP  plc (L:BP)'s Gulf of Mexico region, said the industry has accepted that crude prices will probably stay low, meaning oil producers like BP must work with services providers to reduce the multibillion dollar cost of offshore projects. 
""That break even point can't come back to $80 a barrel, so I've got to figure out ways to work with my supplier over the long-term to keep that in check,"" he said during a presentation. 
Morrison touted BP's use of new seismic imaging technology that helped identify 1 billion additional barrels of ""possible resources"" at four of its U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore fields. The technology enhances existing seismic images to find oil hidden beneath salt structures deep underground. 
Just weeks away is a coming Vienna meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries where OPEC and other oil producers are to decide whether to continue production curbs past June.
If OPEC fails to continue the curbs, oil prices could fall again, making a difficult market worse, said Charles Cherington, a co-founder of Intervale Capital, a private equity investor in oilfield services. 
Assuming OPEC continues the existing curbs, Cherington said the best the industry can hope for this year is crude ""gets to the low to mid $50s (a barrel)"" or half what it fetched at this time three years ago. 
Few oilfield suppliers are generating steady profits, he said, and ""in the short run, we don't see the market getting much better,"" he added. 
Marc Gerard Rex Edwards, chief executive of rig provider  Diamond Offshore  Drilling (N:DO), on Monday reported its first quarter earnings declined on revenue down 25 percent from a year ago. 

""I think we're beginning to see the signs of a bottom,"" he told Wall Street analysts, adding: ""But I'm not exactly calling a bottom in the market at this particular moment in time.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A week after President Donald Trump vowed to impose new tariffs on Canadian lumber imports to help the U.S. timber industry, lawmakers passed a spending bill that could push U.S. government agencies to promote burning wood pellets to fuel power plants.
The budget bill that the U.S. House of Representatives passed on Wednesday, which makes way for nearly $1.2 trillion in federal spending, directs the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture to ""establish clear policies that reflect the carbon neutrality of biomass.""
Biomass, or wood pellet fuel, is considered a renewable energy source because it is composed of trees, which can be replaced after they are cut down. It is used to heat homes and fuel power plants. 
Scientists say burning wood pellets actually produces more harmful greenhouse emissions than coal or natural gas. 
""Recent advances in science and accounting for pollution from different types of woody biomass have clarified that burning trees to produce electricity actually increases carbon emissions compared with fossil fuels for many decades and contributes to other air pollution problems,"" a group of 60 U.S. scientists wrote in a 2014 letter to the UK's secretary of state for energy and climate change.
The European Union already treats biomass as carbon-friendly and subsidizes its production. 
A biomass industry group offered praise for the measure on Wednesday.
""We are thrilled to see such strong bipartisan support for biomass, which Congress is officially recognizing as the carbon neutral, renewable energy source that it is,"" said Dave Tenny, president and chief executive of the National Alliance of Forest Owners, in a statement emailed to Reuters on Wednesday.
Environmental groups criticized the decision. Danna Smith, executive director of the Dogwood Alliance, an environmental group focused on forests and logging in the southern United States, said the provision ""will add to a significant climate problem we already have in the U.S.""

The legislation, which will keep the government funded through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, now goes to the Senate, which is expected to pass it before a midnight Friday deadline.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2017 04:50PM ET</span>",Ohio lawmakers add budget provision that could open state parks to fracking,"By Kim Palmer
CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Ohio legislators took a step toward allowing fracking in state parks, adding a provision in a pending budget that would strip the governor of the ability to control the issuing of licenses for the oil and gas drilling practice that has raised environmental concerns.
The provision, added on Tuesday by the Republican-controlled House, would allow the state legislature instead of the governor to control appointments to the Oil and Gas Commission responsible for issuing drilling licenses for state lands.
Governor John Kasich, a Republican, has not named any members to the four-member commission since signing the bill that created the group in 2011. This has effectively halted any fracking in parks.
Fracking opponents complained that the legislature was now trying to find a way to allow fracking without the proper safeguards to ensure public safety.
“It is an end run by Republicans in the legislature to facilitate more fracking and drilling in Ohio state parks,” David Leland, a Democratic state representative from Columbus who voted against the budget partly due to the measure, said on Wednesday. 
Fracking, short for hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting water, sand and chemicals into wells to fracture shale and release natural gas and oil. Critics say the practice has polluted water supplies, while backers say it supplies needed energy resources.
Proponents of the provision said it would not necessarily result in widespread drilling and fracking in state parks. 
“The provision is simply an attempt to fill that committee,” Ben Miller, spokesman for the Ohio House Republicans, said on Wednesday.
Separately, four conservation groups have sued the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management in an attempt to halt fracking plans in Ohio's only national forest.
Nearly a fifth of Ohio has geographical potential for shale gas drilling, said Nathan Johnson, public director of the Ohio Environmental Council, an environmental group.
The proposed budget must be approved by the Republican-controlled state senate by July 1.

Kasich spokeswoman Emmalee Kalmbach would not comment on whether Kasich would use a line-item veto to kill the provision. In an email, Kalmbach said only that the governor does not weigh in on pending legislation, but is confident he can work with lawmakers to “find the right way forward, preserve our jobs-friendly climate and show the world that Ohio can manage its affairs well in the face of all kinds of challenges.”
