On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for April delivery rose 0.09% to USD93.82 per barrel in Asian trading Tuesday after settling down 0.30% at USD93.20 per barrel in U.S. trading Monday. Oil fell in the U.S. on the back of some tepid housing data. In U.S. economic news, the National Association of Homebuilders said its March Housing Market Index fell to 44 from 46 in February in what is the lowest reading since October. Analysts expected a March reading of 48. Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said oil prices at current levels should not hamper Asian growth. China, among other emerging Asian economies, have previously grappled with high oil prices. China is the second-larges oil consumer in the world behind the U.S. al-Naimi said crude at $100 per barrel is a reasonable price. Elsewhere, traders see support for oil futures, particularly Brent, the global benchmark, Iran and the West are still butting heads over the OPEC member’s nuclear regime. Some Western nations, including the U.S., have levied economic sanctions against Iran making it difficult for the country to sell its oil in U.S. dollars or euros. Armed clashes broke out at Libyan oil field between a militia group and protesters seeking jobs. Libya, also an OPEC member, is home to Africa’s largest oil reserves. Meanwhile, Brent futures for May delivery fell 0.03% to USD109.41 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."

191,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 12, 2013 08:36PM ET</span>", Gold trades slightly higher on ECB rumors,"Investing.com - Gold futures rose are trading modestly higher in the early part of Wednesday’s Asian session as traders speculate the European Central Bank might have room to engage in monetary easing. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery rose 0.04% to USD1,592.30 per troy ounce in Asian trading Wednesday after gaining 0.86% to settle at USD1,591.60 a troy ounce in U.S. trading on Tuesday. Gold futures were likely to test support USD1,574.60 a troy ounce, Monday's low, and resistance at USD1,1619.40, the high from February 26. On Tuesday, ECB council member Jens Weidmann said inflationary pressures across the euro zone remain light. Those comments prompted traders to speculate the ECB has some room to weaken the euro through monetary easing. At the conclusion of its policy meeting last week, the ECB left interest rates unchanged at 0.75% while announcing no new monetary easing initiatives. Due in part to a plummeting Japanese yen, some European policymakers are pressuring the ECB to taken action to weaken the euro. Among the most vocal critics of the weaker yen have been Germany and France, the euro zone’s two largest economies. Still, there are signs gold investors remain pensive. Holdings of bullion at the SPDR Gold Shares, the world’s largest exchange traded fund backed by by physical gold, resided at 1,236.729 tons as of Monday, the lowest level since late 2011. On the other hand, physical demand in Asia is seen as steady, helped by comments made by Bank of Japan deputy governor nominee Kikuo Iwata. On Tuesday, Iwata said the central bank should engage in further aggressive easing initiatives. Elsewhere, Comex silver for May delivery rose 0.05% to USD29.185 per ounce while copper for May delivery added 0.11% to USD3.555 per ounce."

203,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 11, 2013 09:20PM ET</span>",Oil down in Asian trading after modest U.S. gains,"Investing.com - Oil futures are trading slightly lower during Tuesday’s Asian session on the heels of modest gains seen in U.S. trade Monday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for April delivery fell 0.12% to USD91.94 per barrel in Asian trading Tuesday after rising slightly in the U.S. on Monday. On Monday, oil traded down by as much as 1.2% following the release of some concerning data points out of China, the world’s second-largest oil consumer. China's industrial production rose 9.9% in February, below expectations for a 10.5% increase also below a 10.3% hike logged during the previous month. Consumer prices in China rose by 3.2% in February from a year earlier, above expectations for a 3% increase and accelerating sharply from a 2% rate of increase in January. Those data points, which fuel speculation the Chinese recovery has not yet reached the pitch market participants have hoped for, combined with news Saudi Arabia increase output last month are seen as weighing on crude prices. Goldman Sachs added on Monday that U.S. crude supplies could increase in the second and third quarters as more pipeline capacity becomes available. Elsewhere, the U.S. state of Colorado said its 2012 oil production climbed to 48 million barrels, a 50-year high, due in large part to increased production at the Niobrara Shale. Colorado’s oil production was less than 33 million barrels in 2009. Some estimates say the Niobrara Shale could be home to more than 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Anadarko Petroleum is among the major producers there. Meanwhile, Brent crude for May delivery fell 0.01% to USD109.53 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery rose 0.22% to USD1,1578.30 per troy ounce in Asian trading Wednesday. Gold settled up 0.06% at USD1,573.40 a troy ounce in U.S. trading on Tuesday. Gold futures were likely to test support USD1,568.80 a troy ounce, Monday's low, and resistance at USD1,619.40, last Tuesday's high. Even as the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped to a record high, gold was supported by one solid U.S. data point. In U.S. economic news, the Institute for Supply Management said its February purchasing managers index rose to 56% from 55.2% in January. Economists expected the February reading to be unchanged from the prior month. The index has risen for 39 consecutive months. Still, withdrawals from the SPDR Gold Shares, the world’s largest exchange traded fund backed by holdings of physical gold, have reached a tenth consecutive day. The fund saw its largest ever monthly outflow in February. Elsewhere, platinum metals surged on news of more labor unrest in South Africa. In Asian trading, platinum for April delivery is higher by 0.79% at USD1,601.30 per ounce while palladium for June delivery is higher by 1.13% at USD745.20 per ounce. South Africa is the world’s largest platinum-producing nation and the second-largest palladium producer behind Russia. Lonmin, the world’s third-largest platinum miner, confirmed Tuesday that thousands of its workers are on illegal strike. Meanwhile, Comex silver for May delivery rose 0.84% to USD28.845 per ounce while copper for May delivery added 0.53% to USD3.539 per ounce."

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for April deliver fell 0.54% to USD92.61 per barrel in Asian trading Tuesday. In U.S. trading Monday, oil lost 0.05% to settle at USD93.08 a barrel. Some commodities, such as gold, were boosted Monday on speculation that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will downplay inflationary side effects of the U.S. central bank's loose monetary policies. Bernanke is set to deliver monetary policy before the Senate Banking Committee later today. The Fed chief will deliver similar testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. Oil and other riskier assets are still seen reacting to the complexity of the Italian election results and the U.K.’s loss of its AAA credit rating. China is help keeping oil’s downside a minimum today. Official data show Chinese oil imports jumped 7% in Januar, but the country’s imports from Iran slipped because of Western sanctions on that country due to its nuclear program. China is the world’s second-largest oil consumer.  The U.S., Russia, China, Germany, Britain and France are meeting with Iran in Kazakhstan later today and may decide to loosen some of the sanctions imposed on the country if it decides to relax its pursuit of enriched uranium. Iran is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Elsewhere, Sonangol, Angola’s state-controlled oil producer, reported that it boosted output 4.5% last year. Angola is Africa’s second-largest oil producer behind fellow OPEC member Nigeria. Angola hopes to be pumping 2 million barrels per day by 2017. Meanwhile, Brent for April delivery added 0.55% to USD114.07 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."
319,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 25, 2013 08:46PM ET</span>",Gold jumps as market jitters soar ,"Investing.com - Gold futures rose during Tuesday’s Asian session following the worst performance by stocks U.S. stocks since November 2012 during Monday’s U.S. session. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery rose 0.63% to USD1,596.60 per troy ounce in Asian trading Tuesday. Gold is seen building on an impressive performance notched during Monday’s U.S. session when bullion settled up 1.09% at USD1,590.00 a troy ounce in U.S. trading on Monday. Gold futures were likely to test support USD1,554.80 a troy ounce, Thursday's low, and resistance at USD1,618.70, the high from Feb. 18. Gold slipped to a seven-month low of USD1,554.49 per ounce last Thursday. Bullion caught a bid Monday on speculation that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will downplay inflationary side effects of the U.S. central bank's loose monetary policies. Bernanke is set to deliver monetary policy before the Senate Banking Committee later today. The Fed chief will deliver similar testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. Last week, gold bugs were sent running for cover on speculation that the Fed is mulling winding down or bring to an end its USD85 billion-a-month bond-buying program known as quantitative easing. Even the dire performance of European equities in the wake of the U.K. losing its AAA credit rating and the complexity of Italian election results was not enough to stop gold’s Monday rally. Exit polls showed former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s conservative party with a chance of capturing a majority in the Italian senate. That could be enough to scare markets and investors that austerity implemented by current Prime Minister Mario Monti could be undone, hastening Italy’s departure from the euro zone. Italy is the region’s third-largest economy. Elsewhere, Comex silver for May delivery rose 0.38% to USD29.158 while copper for May delivery rose by the same amount to USD3.562."

331,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 24, 2013 08:44PM ET</span>",Oil climbs slightly on bargain hunting,"Investing.com – Following a weekly loss that saw futures trade around their weakest levels since early January, oil futures inched higher in the early part of Monday’s Asian session as traders saw an opportunity to perhaps grab crude on the cheap. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for April delivery rose 0.03% to USD93.16 per barrel in Asian trading Monday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude futures for delivery in April rose 0.5% Friday to settle the week at USD93.33 a barrel by close of trade. On the week, New York-traded oil futures lost 2.7%. Oil futures, as was the case with gold and other dollar-denominated commodities, came under pressure on speculation the Federal Reserve is mulling an end to its money-printing endeavors that have previously boosted stocks and other riskier assets such as oil. With traders thinking that oil, gold and other commodities could be in for a near-term pullback, the U.S. dollar’s status as a safe-haven has proven appealing. The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, ended the week at 81.55, the strongest level since August 30. Futures were also pressured by news that Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, may increase output to avoid demand destruction at the hands of higher prices. Speaking of OPEC, Iran is set to meet with the U.S. and five other nations later today in Kazakhstan. Iran has been under sanctions from the West regarding its pursuit of a nuclear agenda and those sanctions have crippled the country’s ability to receive dollars or euros for the sale of crude to foreign buyers. Meanwhile, Oil & Gas UK forecast that country’s oil production will slip 3% to 6% this year due to issues in the North Sea before rising next year. Elsewhere, Brent for April delivery fell 0.22% to USD114 per barrel on the ICE Futures Exchange."

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for April delivery rose 0.11% to USD97.20 per barrel, just below the session high of USD97.23 per barrel. The contract closed down 0.20% at USD96.22 a barrel in the U.S. on Tuesday. Mixed economic data from some of the world’s largest economies may have played part in oil’s sluggish price action. In U.S. economic news, the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index dropped to a reading of 46 in February from 47 in January. The small drop by the Housing Market Index came as a surprise to economists, who had expected the index to rise to 48. The news out of Germany was more encouraging. In Germany, the ZEW Centre for Economic Research reported earlier that its index of German economic sentiment jumped to 48.2 in February, the highest since April 2010, from 31.2 in January.The figure far surpassed analysts' expectations for a 35.0 reading and sent the euro gaining against the greenback, which tends to boost gold prices. Germany is the euro zone’s largest economy.  Elsewhere, Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, said it had proved reserves of 25.2 billion barrels oil-equivalent at the end of last year, up from 24.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2011. The company cited shale projects in Canada and the U.S. as catalysts behind its increased reserves. On Tuesday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said they expect Brent crude, the global benchmark to trade between $100 and $130 per barrel through 2015 with a price forecast as high as $140 per barrel. Speaking of Brent, the April contract traded on the ICE Futures Exchange added 0.01% to USD117.39 per barrel."

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery fell 0.24% to USD1,631.65 per troy ounce in Asian trading Friday. That decline comes after gold settled down 0.54% at USD1,636.15 a troy ounce in U.S. trading on Thursday. Gold futures were likely to test support USD1,626.05 a troy ounce, the low from Jan. 4, and resistance at USD1,653.75, Wednesday's high. On Thursday, a reported showed the euro zone’s fourth-quarter GDP contracted by 0.6%, well below expectations for a 0.4% quarterly decline and far surpassing the previous 0.1% contraction. It was the worst rate of contraction since 2009 and the third straight quarter of negative growth. Typically, economists consider an economy to be in recession with two consecutive negative GDP readings. Adding to the selling pressure on the euro and thereby gold, other reports showed Germany’s fourth-quarter GDP contracted by 0.6%, below expectations calling for a 0.5% drop. France’s fourth-quarter GDP shrank 0.3% while Italy’s contracted by 0.9%. Germany, France and Italy are the euro zone’s three largest economies, in that order. Adding to gold’s woes was a report by the World Gold Council that showed physical demand for bullion fell in 2012 for the first time in three years. The economic news was better across the Atlantic. In U.S. economic news, initial claims for jobless benefits fell by 27,000 last week to 341,000 claims. Economists expected a decrease of just 6,000. The less volatile four-week moving average rose by 1,500 to 352,500. Elsewhere, Comex silver for March delivery fell 0.18% to USD30.298 per ounce. Copper for March delivery lost 0.06% to USD3.741 an ounce."

450,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 10, 2013 08:46PM ET</span>",Gold slightly higher in light holiday trade in Asia,"Investing.com - Gold futures edged higher during Monday’s Asian session amid light holiday trade. Markets in Hong Kong and China are closed for Lunar New Year festivities. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for March delivery added 0.04% to USD1,667.65 per troy ounce in Asian trading Monday. The contract traded as high as USD1,669.75 and as low as USD1,666.90 per ounce. Gold prices were likely to find support at USD1,653.35 a troy ounce, the low from January 28 and near-term resistance at USD1,685.65, February 5’s high. Last week, gold futures fell modestly, losing 0.1%. Year-to-date, gold is off 0.8% as upbeat U.S. and Chinese economic has fed demand for riskier assets such as stocks. Last week, the S&P 500 rose for the sixth consecutive and is now found trading at five-year highs. Data indicate that holdings of physical gold at the SPDR Gold Shares, the world’s largest gold exchange traded fund, fell slightly to to 1326.89 tons on Friday from 1329.90 tons on Thursday. With the euro continuing to pull back from multi-month highs against the dollar, gold could come under additional selling pressure. Dominated in U.S. dollars, gold and other commodities are usually boosted by a weaker greenback. Gold’s safe haven status could prove useful this week as the U.S. is expected to release retail sales for January and consumer sentiment for early February. The January retail sales number is expected to show no growth from the previous month due to shrinking pay checks and higher gas prices. The consumer accounts for nearly 70% of GDP in the world’s largest economy. Elsewhere, Comex silver for April delivery rose 0.06% to USD31.46 per ounce. Copper for March delivery gained 0.11% to USD3.763 per ounce. Action in the red metal could be slow this week with Chinese markets closed. China is the world’s largest copper consumer, accounting for almost 40% of world consumption last year."

458,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 07, 2013 08:49PM ET</span>",Oil slightly higher ahead of Chinese data points,"Investing.com - Oil futures traded slightly higher in the early part of Friday’s Asian session as traders await some important economic data releases out of China later today. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for March delivery added 0.05% to USD95.88 per barrel in Asian trading Friday. Oil was barely higher even after Goldman Sachs said it remains the market to remain for the remainder of the first quarter. In other news, Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said it kept production at around 9 million barrels per day last month, marking the second straight month the kingdom has only pumped at that level. Saudi supplied an average of 9.26 million barrels per day last month, up from 9.15 million barrels per day in December. Futures were not that volatile in Asia following a pair of U.S. economic data points. In U.S. economic news, first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 366,000 last week, according to the Labor Department. The less volatile four-week moving average fell by 2,250 to 350,500, good for the lowest reading since March 2008. A separate report showed that non-farm business sector labor productivity fell by a seasonally adjusted 2% in the fourth quarter, compared to expectations for a decline of 1.3%. The U.S. is the world’s largest oil consumer. Traders will now turn their attention to inflation and trade data from China later today. China is the world’s second-largest oil consumer.  Elsewhere, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, refused to discuss his country’s nuclear program with U.S. Vice President Joe Biden. In Nigeria, Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company declared force majeure on Qua Iboe crude oil exports due to pipeline maintenance. Nigeria, an OPEC member, is Africa’s largest oil producer. Those headlines lifted Brent crude for March delivery by 0.15% to USD117.46 on the ICE Futures Exchange."

546,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 30, 2013 12:19AM ET</span>",Forex - USD/JPY jumps on retail sales news,"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar continued to gain strength against the Japanese yen during Wednesday’s Asian on the heels of retail sales data out of Japan. In Asian trading Wednesday, USD/JPY jumped 0.24% to 90.95 and traded as high as 91.03 earlier in the session. The 91 area is continuing to prove to be stiff resistance for the greenback against the Japanese currency. Earlier Wednesday, Japan’s Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry said December retail sales there fell to a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.4% following an increase of 1.3% in November. Analysts had expected retail sales to fall at annual rate 0.3% in December. The greenback’s strength against the yen could be a sign that traders are beting that yet another discouraging Japanese economic could open the door for swifter monetary easing. Earlier this month, the Bank of Japan disappointed financial markets when it committed to Fed-style asset-buying, but BoJ said it would not launch that program until 2014. While the tumbling yen is viewed as a positive for Japanese exporters, it can have the opposite effect for multinationals doing business in Japan. With U.S. companies in the middle of earnings season, some marquee names have cited increased currency volatility as a reason for lower profits. That list includes some firms that do significant business in Japan including Coach (NYSE: COH) and McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD).  On Wednesday, Japan’s Finance Minister Taro Aso said policymakers there are not manipulating the yen, but the weaker Japanese currency further stokes the fires of possible global currency wars as companies from China to the U.S. to Germany could be adversely impacted by the weaker yen. Elsewhere, EUR/JPY rose 0.18% to 122.64 while AUD/JPY jumped 0.23% to 95.24."

612,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 21, 2013 08:48PM ET</span>",Oil falls on oversupply concerns,"Investing.com - Oil futures were mixed in the early part of Tuesday’s Asian session as traders pondered the notion that supply may once again outstrip demand this due to a tepid global economic recovery. Trade was sluggish because U.S. markets were closed Monday due to the Martin Luther King, Jr. national holiday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude futures for March delivery dropped 0.11% to USD95.94 per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) recently announced its member states have been paring production in an effort to avert significant price retrenchment. The 12-member cartel accounts for 40% of global oil output. Even after Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer, announced a December production cut, OPEC said it expects global oil supplies will be more than sufficient to cover demand this year. News of ample supplies and limited demand are seen as keeping a lid on oil futures prices despite ongoing civil unrest in the Middle East and North Africa. Following a four-day siege at a natural gas facility in Algeria, an OPEC member, other major North African producers such as Libya and Egypt have been increasing security at their energy facilities. Libya, also an OPEC member, is home to Africa’s largest oil reserves. Also seen contributing to robust oil supplies this year is increased production in the U.S. Due to increased production at various shale formations, the U.S., the world’s largest oil consumer, is moving from net importer to net exporter of oil. The U.S. Energy Information Administration recently said it expects increased U.S. oil production to reach record levels this year. Elsewhere, Iraq, also an OPEC member, said on Monday it discovered a new oil field with at least 1 billion barrels of reserves in the southeastern part of the country. Iraq is home to the world’s fourth-largest oil reserves. Brent crude futures for March delivery traded on the ICE Futures Exchange rose 0.07% to USD111.84 per barrel."

733,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 07, 2013 08:15PM ET</span>",Gold bounces back slightly in Asia,"Investing.com - Gold futures rose modestly in the early part of Tuesday’s Asian session, bouncing back from a small loss incurred during Monday’s U.S. session. However, it appears as though the possible end of quantitative easing in the U.S. is still weighing on traders’ minds. On the Comex Division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for February delivery rose 0.24% to USD1,650.25 per troy ounce in Asian trading Tuesday. During Monday’s U.S. session gold futures for February delivery were down 0.19% at USD1,645.75 a troy ounce in U.S. trading, up from a session low of USD1,643.25 and down from a high of USD1,662.55 a troy ounce.Gold futures were likely to test support USD1,626.05 a troy ounce, Friday's low, and resistance at USD1,695.35, Wednesday's high. Gold has been under pressure since late last week when the most recent meeting minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee indicated division among Federal Reserve governors regarding when to bring quantitative easing to an end. While the Federal Reserve has been open its intent to leave U.S. interest rates low until the unemployment rate in the world’s largest economy, currently 7.8%, drops below 6.5%, no hard and fast date for the end of monetary easing has been discussed. The Federal Reserve is currently purchasing USD40 billion in mortgage-backed securities and USD45 billion in Treasuries per month in an effort to stimulate economic growth. While gold recently capped its 12th consecutive annual gain and not all of those annual gains came with the benefit of quantitative easing, monetary easing is seen as helpful to gold bulls because it depresses the U.S. dollar and gold is dollar-denominated. Conversely, gold could still rise if its safe haven status is restored amid a contentious debt ceiling debate or faltering economic growth. Elsewhere, Comex silver for March delivery jumped 0.65% to USD30.278 while copper for March delivery rose 0.04% to USD.3687 per ounce. "

The U.S. National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings over a 730 mile stretch, from New York to Arkansas earlier in the day. The storm is expected to hit the Carolinas later Wednesday and then arrive in the U.S. Northeast early Thursday.Extended weather forecasts showing colder-than-normal weather across most parts of the U.S. in the next seven-to-ten days further boosted sentiment on the heating fuel.Heavy rain is expected in New York City until the end of the week, while snow is expected in much of upstate New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, Weather.com reported.Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting forecasts on winter heating demand. Bullish speculators are betting on the cold weather boosting winter demand for the heating fuel. The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.The heating fuel has lost nearly 14% since touching a 14-month high of USD4.001 per million British thermal units on November 26, on speculation that temperatures won’t be cold enough to erase a surplus of the fuel in storage.Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to a closely watched U.S. government report on natural gas supplies on Friday.Early withdrawal estimates for this week’s storage data range from 66 billion cubic feet to 83 billion cubic feet. Inventories fell by 87 billion cubic feet in the same week a year earlier, while the five-year average change for the week is a decline of 140 billion cubic feet.Total U.S. gas supplies stood at 3.724 trillion cubic feet as of last week, 2% higher than last year at this time and 10% above the five-year average for this time of year.Elsewhere on the NYMEX, light sweet crude oil futures for delivery in February rallied 2.4% to trade at USD90.75 a barrel, while heating oil for February delivery rose 1.75% to trade at USD3.040 per gallon.

938,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 10, 2012 09:15PM ET</span>",Oil mixed in Asian trading after falling in U.S. session,"Investing.com- Oil futures rose modestly in Asian trading Tuesday after slumping for a fifth consecutive day during Monday’s U.S. session. Political volatility in Italy, the Eurozone’s third-largest economy, is the negative catalyst traders are pointing as having pressured crude. In Asian trading Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for January delivery rose 0.04% to USD85.59 per barrel. The contract traded as high USD85.74 and as low as 85.56 per barrel. In U.S. trade Monday, light, sweet crude futures for delivery in January traded at USD85.64 a barrel on Monday, down 0.34%. Over the weekend, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti said he will resign his post as soon as Italy passes a 2013 budget. Perhaps roiling markets even more than news of Monti’s resignation is news that former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is angling for the job once again. Berlusconi has promised to scale back Monti’s austerity measures if elected again. Traders may also be taking a wait-and-see approach with oil ahead of the two-day Federal Reserve meeting, which starts later today. There is not much chance the central bank will cut interest rates because U.S. rates are already near historic lows, but the Fed could announce further monetary easing, which could boost oil prices. The other big news for the week that oil traders will be paying attention Wednesday’s meeting in Vienna of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC is expected to keep its daily production quota at 30 million barrels. Saudi Arabia, the cartel’s largest producer, is content with where oil prices currently reside, but other OPEC members such as Iran and Venezuela favor higher prices. Oil’s struggles continue despite figures released Monday showing China’s imports climbed to 5.69 million barrels per day last month, a 3% increase from November 2011. China is the world’s second-largest oil consumer. Elsewhere, Brent crude for January delivery traded on the ICE Futures Exchange slipped 0.04% to USD106.28 per barrel."
