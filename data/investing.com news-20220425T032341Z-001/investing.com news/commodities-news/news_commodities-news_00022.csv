European officials are discussing adding another bail out fund, doubling the capacity of the original. This fiscal uncertainty adds to the yellow metal's safe haven appeal.
Additional bullish fuel was gleaned from the expected euro zone interest rate cut on Thursday. The European Central Bank is expected to slash rates to a record low of 1%.

624,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 06, 2011 09:43AM ET</span>",Crude oil futures edge lower after S&P’s warning on EFSF,"Investing.com – Crude oil futures were modestly lower on Tuesday, after ratings agency Standard & Poor’s placed the AAA long-term credit rating of the European Financial Stability Facility on watch for a possible downgrade, a day after it also put 15 euro zone countries on review.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for delivery in January traded at USD100.69 a barrel during early U.S. morning trade, slumping 0.3%.      It earlier fell by as much as 0.7% to trade at a daily low of USD100.22 a barrel.S&P said earlier that it placed the EFSF’s, the euro zone’s bailout fund, long-term triple-A ratings on watch, adding that the fund’s long-term rating may be cut by 1 or 2 notches on review.""Depending on the outcome of our review of the ratings on EFSF member governments, we could lower the long-term rating on the EFSF by one or two notches, if any,"" S&P said in a statement released earlier. The warning comes a day after the ratings agency warned it may downgrade the ratings of 15 euro zone countries, included AAA-rated Germany and France within 90 days, depending on the outcome of Friday's critical European Union summit.Earlier Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said European Union leaders will take important decisions to stabilize the euro zone at a summit later this week, brushing off S&P’s warning.The euro zone accounted for nearly 16% of global oil consumption in 2010, according to data from British Petroleum.Crude prices continued to draw support from ongoing tensions over Iran's nuclear program and a potential disruption to oil exports from the country. Last week, the U.S., the U.K. and the European Union tightened their sanctions against the Middle Eastern country, following a United Nations report which concluded that the Iranian government was working on a nuclear weapon.   Iran is the world’s fourth largest oil producer, pumping nearly 5% of the world’s oil in 2011 and the second biggest exporter among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Meanwhile, markets were awaiting fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products to gauge the strength of oil demand in the world’s largest oil consumer. The American Petroleum Institute will release its inventories report later in the day, while Wednesday’s government report could show crude stockpiles fell by 1.1 million barrels last week, while gasoline supplies were forecast to increase by 1.0 million barrels. Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange, Brent oil futures for January delivery eased up 0.08% to trade at USD109.89 a barrel, with the spread between the Brent and crude contracts standing at USD9.20 a barrel.

 By Pratima Desai	
 LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Gold climbed to a three-week high
on Monday, boosted by fresh investor interest and a softer
dollar against the euro after a G20 summit reinforced hopes that
European leaders would soon resolve the region's debt crisis.	
 Spot gold rose 1 percent to hit $1,694.60 a troy
ounce, its highest since Sept. 23. It was bid at $1,685.30 an
ounce at 1243 GMT from $1,678.53 late in New York on Friday.	
 The euro touched a one-month high against the dollar as the
market focused on the potential for a positive outcome from a
European Union summit scheduled on October 23.
 
 ""Gold is moving higher on a modestly weaker dollar. There is
some optimism that European political leaders will come up with
some deal to ease debt concerns,"" said Ross Norman, chief
executive at bullion brokers Sharps Pixley.	
 ""There is scope to see a little bit more strength here, but
I don't think the market is going to run away.""	
 A lower dollar makes metals priced in the U.S. currency
cheaper for holders of other currencies.	
 Analysts expect $1,700 an ounce to offer firm resistance and
said a decisive move above could take several attempts, but
support is seen at the 100-day moving average at about $1,660 an
ounce.	
 The dollar recovered briefly after a gauge of manufacturing
in New York State contracted for the fifth month in a row in
October. 
 ""Investors are active again, there is strong buying interest
in Asia, but whether that will hold if we climb above $1,700
remains to be seen,"" a precious metals trader said.	
 
 NET CFTC positions	
 Holdings of the largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund
(ETF), New York's SPDR Gold Trust and that of the largest
silver-backed ETF, New York's iShares Silver Trust ,
remained unchanged on Friday from Thursday. 
 ""According to the (U.S) Commodity Futures Trading
Commission's Commitment (CFTC) of Traders report, net long
positions for gold and silver increased 373,000 ounces and 9.5
million ounces, respectively, in the week ended 11 October,""
HSBC said in a note.	
 ""Platinum net long positions fell 47,000 ounces and
palladium net long positions increased 95,500 ounces.""	
 Spot silver was bid at $32.27 an ounce from $32.16
late on Friday and platinum was at $1,568.25 from
$1,544.13 an ounce.	
 ""Platinum continued the decrease in net positions from last
week as shorts increase while palladium did the opposite with
net positions increase as shorts decrease,"" HSBC said.	
 ""The small increase in net position for gold and silver was
mainly driven by a decrease in short positions.""	
 Spot palladium touched $644.25 an ounce, the highest
since Sept. 28. It was last at $631.75 an ounce from $619.70 an
ounce late on Friday. 
 Both platinum and palladium used in autocatalysts have come
under pressure in recent months as markets tried to factor
slower economic growth and demand.

 By Ikuko Kurahone	
 LONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Brent crude extended losses and
U.S. crude turned negative on Monday following remarks from
Germany that the forthcoming EU summit would not produce a
definitive solution to the euro zone debt crisis.	
 By 1114 GMT, Brent crude  fell 73 cents to $111.50 a
barrel, reversing its earlier gain to as high as $113.86. U.S.
crude  was down 4 cents at $86.76, easing from its high at
$88.18.	
 North Sea benchmark Brent was leading the fall in key oil
futures prices in percentage terms. 
 At the weekend, in unusually direct language, finance
ministers and central bankers at a meeting of the Group of 20
major economies in Paris said they expected an Oct. 23 European
Union summit to ""decisively address the current challenges
through a comprehensive plan"".	
 However, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on
Monday that European governments would not present an ultimate
solution for the sovereign debt crisis at the summit.

 German Chancellor Angela Merkel has no concrete plans to
meet top bankers ahead of the EU summit, the chancellor's
spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said separately. 
 ""Despite an improved macro outlook, a complete resolution to
Europe's sovereign debt issue is still far away,"" Morgan Stanley
said in its research note.	
 ""Although the recent rally and ongoing supply issues suggest
crude fundamentals are strong, we believe that risks remain
skewed to the downside.""	
 
 
 TIGHT MARKET	
 Supply of light crude has remained tight due to
underproduction in the North Sea, Nigeria and Libya, which has
just resumed oil exports after a civil war.	
 Oil inventories remain low in Europe and the United States
ahead of the winter heating season.	
 ""While a rapid resumption of Libyan production remains a
wild card, until sustained exports are seen, the Brent and light
sweet crude market will remain sensitive to minor disruptions,""
analysts at JPMorgan said in a report.	
 Libyan government fighters battled on Sunday to subdue
pockets of resistance by pro-Muammar Gaddafi fighters, whose
refusal to abandon the ousted leader's hometown of Sirte is
delaying the country's move to democracy. 
 Brent's November contract, which expired on Friday, posted a
weekly gain of 8.3 percent, the largest since the week to Feb.
25. U.S. crude rose $2.57 to settle at $86.80 a barrel, the
highest since Sept. 20. It posted a weekly gain of 4.6 percent,
the biggest since the week to Oct. 7. 
 Speculators increased their net long positions in ICE Brent
crude oil  and gas oil futures  in the week to
Oct. 11, data published by the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE)
showed on Monday.	
 U.S. regulators this week will finalise their toughest
crackdown yet on volatile oil and metals markets, concluding
nearly four years of fierce debate over whether limits on
speculative trade can tame prices.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Gold hovered around $1,680 on
Monday, after posting its biggest weekly gain since early
September, as investors await concrete steps to tackle the euro
zone debt crisis that could come out of a European Union summit
this weekend.	
 Finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of
20 major economies said they expected the Oct. 23 summit to
""decisively address the current challenges through a
comprehensive plan"". 
 Many investors have stayed away from gold given market
turbulence in the past few months caused by the deepening euro
zone debt crisis, the fight over raising the U.S. debt ceiling
and fears that the global economy would plunge into another
recession.	
 Spot gold was little changed at $1,677.90 an ounce by
0626 GMT, after rising more than 2 percent in the previous week.	
 U.S. gold  edged down 0.2 percent to $1,679.90.	
 ""Gold has not been showing its safe-haven property in the
past few weeks,"" said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures
in Singapore.	
 ""If we see risk assets continue to rally with concrete steps
in Europe in place, gold will have the potential to break the
$1,700 resistance.""	
 
 Managed money in U.S. gold futures and options raised their
net long positions for the second time in the past 10 weeks in
the week ended on Oct. 11, but the number still hovered near its
lowest level since early February and was just half the peak hit
in August. 
 Prices are likely to remain range-bound if investment
interest stays away from the market, traders and analysts said.	
 The Indonesian unit of Freeport McMoRan said it has
completely stopped metals output at Grasberg, the world's
second-biggest copper mine which also has the world's largest
gold reserves, because of security concerns and blocked supply
lines to the remote mine. 
 
 PHYSICAL TIGHTNESS EASES	
 Gold bar premiums in Hong Kong eased slightly from last
week, as shipments ordered over the past week or so started to
arrive.	
 The buying interest softened as prices have rebounded from
the end of September when prices dipped well below $1,600.	
 ""People are waiting for more information from Europe by the
end of the month,"" said a Hong Kong-based dealer. ""The shipments
have released the pressure on supply, and the premium has fallen
to about $2.""	
 A second dealer reported premiums between $2.50 to $3.50
above spot prices, from $3 to $4 last week.	
 ""On the Asian side, $1,650 is an attractive level for
physical buyers,"" he said.	
 Asian stocks and commodities firmed on hopes of a plan to
resolve the euro zone's debt woes, and the euro hovered near a
one-month high. 
 Spot palladium led the precious metals complex,
rising 1.2 percent to $627.22.

 By Manash Goswami	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Brent crude futures climbed
towards $113 on Monday, extending the previous session's sharp
gains on hopes European policymakers would reach an agreement to
tackle the euro zone's debt crisis and help stem a slowdown in
oil demand.	
 France's Finance Minister Francois Baroin told the Group of
20 major economies over the weekend that Paris and Germany, the
leading euro zone powers, were on their way to agreeing to a
plan to reduce Greece's debt and stop a contagion. That
optimism, and an almost 11 percent slide in prices last month,
is making oil attractive for investors. 
 Brent crude  gained 37 cents to $112.60 a barrel at
0218 GMT, after rising to as much as $113. U.S. crude 
increased 52 cents to $87.32. 
 ""Oil markets have hit a bottom and sentiment is turning
around to positive as the demand outlook improves,"" said Tetsu
Emori, a fund manager at Astmax Co Ltd in Tokyo. ""The market was
oversold because of the pessimism surrounding the global
economy. Investors are finding the prices attractive.""	
 Still, gains were capped as the world's biggest energy
consumer China said on Saturday that apparent oil consumption
grew only 3.2 percent from a year earlier in the third quarter,
down from the 5 percent rise in second quarter and 9.3 percent
in the first quarter. 
 Asian shares rose on Monday and the euro held firm after the
world's leading economies pressed Europe to act decisively
within eight days to resolve the euro zone's debt crisis. Gold
held steady, while base metals edged higher.	
 
 In unusually direct language, G20 finance ministers and
central bankers said they expected an Oct. 23 European Union
summit to ""decisively address the current challenges through a
comprehensive plan"". 
 Brent's November contract, which expired on Friday,
surged$3.57 to settle at $114.68 a barrel, the highest close
since Sept. 15. The contract posted a weekly gain of 8.3
percent, the largest since the week to Feb. 25. 
 U.S. November crude rose $2.57 to settle at $86.80 a barrel
on Friday, the highest settlement since Sept. 20. 
 
 DEMAND OUTLOOK 
 Oil prices were also supported on Friday by U.S. retail
sales, which grew at their fastest pace in seven months in
September, beating expectations, while sales for August and July
were revised higher as well. 
 The demand outlook for oil will improve during winter when
heating fuel sales get a boost, triggering a rise in crude
requirement, said Emori, who also expects consumption to recover
in the United States and other industrialised nations as
governments work on reviving the economy.	
 On the other hand, supply disruptions continue in the North
Sea and Nigeria, tightening availability as crude shipments from
Libya remain irregular. 
 ""While a rapid resumption of Libyan production remains a
wild card, until sustained exports are seen, the Brent and light
sweet crude market will remain sensitive to minor disruptions,""
analysts at JPMorgan said in a report.

 NEW YORK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose 3 percent on
Friday, posting a second straight weekly gain, on lift from
stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales and optimism about the
prospect that European leaders can reach a deal to address the
euro-zone debt crisis.
 With Brent's front-month November contract expiring on
Friday, the premium to U.S. crude strengthened and intraday
reached a record $28.10 a barrel.
 U.S. retail sales grew at their fastest pace in seven
months in September, above expectations, and sales for August

 results and oil is very responsive to those numbers
and we're seeing a reallocation of funds, with some shorts

 But despite the September buying splurge, consumer
sentiment slipped in early October more than expected, sending
the gauge to the lowest level in more than 30 years.
 France and Germany reaffirmed their commitment to a recent
deal between their two leaders to combat the euro zone crisis,
lending support to oil prices earlier. [ID:nP6E7L6000]

 NEW YORK, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Friday, posting
its biggest weekly gain in six weeks, as optimism about
European plans to contain the region's debt crisis and a dollar
drop lifted bullion with riskier assets in a broad rally.
 Bullion tracked U.S. stocks and industrial commodities such
as copper and oil higher, as French and German officials are
trying to finalize a crisis resolution plan at this weekend's
G20 meeting in Paris. Also supporting was news that China's
inflation dipped, easing worries of further tightening.
 Optimism over plans to tackle the debilitating euro zone
debt crisis, as well as strong U.S. retail sales and corporate
earnings, helped prompt the traditionally safe-haven metal to
move in tandem with equities.
 ""The correlation between gold and risk assets is going to
trade fairly in tandem because they are working on the same
catalyst -- the notion that easy monetary policy in Europe is
going to lift equities and also gold,"" said Sean McGillivray,
head of asset allocation in Great Pacific Wealth Management.
 Spot gold  was up 0.9 percent at $1,680.39 an ounce
by 2:29 p.m. EDT (1829 GMT).
 The metal rose 2.5 percent for the week for a second weekly
gain. The S&P 500 was on track to rise over 5 percent, while
the dollar index <.DXY> lost almost 3 percent.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$14.50 at $1,683 an ounce.
 Trading volume has been sharply below the norm all week
long. The turnover of U.S. gold futures has topped the average
daily volume of 17.5 million ounces of gold on just one trading
day so far this month.
 Analysts said there was a lack of conviction among bullion
investors, while uncertainty over Europe continues.
 Decreasing liquidity tends to result in elevated
volatility, which in gold hit a 2-1/2 year high in the early
part of this month before subsiding. 
 The 30-day correlation between gold and world equities
turned positive for the first time in three months. And the
inverse link between gold and the dollar was at its tightest
since July, indicating lack of clear direction.

 Bullion's above 20 DMA: http://r.reuters.com/hek44s

 Gold ended above its 20-day moving average for the first
time in a month, and technical analysts said bullion could
retest its bearish double top set between late August and early
September should prices rise above $1,700 an ounce.
 RISK ASSET OR SAFE HAVEN?
 Gold rose in lock-step with the S&P 500 for the week on
hopes about progress to tackle the euro zone debt crisis, in
spite of a downgrade to Spain's sovereign debt and a decision
to grant Greece its agreed bailout money.
 ""Gold is no longer viewed exclusively as the anti-risk
trade. Instead, gold has been moving in positive correlation
with risk assets of late,"" UBS said in a note.
 UBS said the bank's physical gold sales in India so far
this year rose 10 percent, suggesting resilient buying interest
in the world's biggest gold consumer despite higher prices.
 Gold-backed exchange-traded funds showed no major changes
in the metals they held, suggesting strong investment demand.

 By Florence Tan	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Brent crude stayed above $111
on Friday, heading for a second straight weekly increase, as
investors looked to more data from top oil consumers United
States and China for cues on economic health and fuel demand.	
 Inflation in China has cooled slightly in September, a sign
the central bank may put on hold further tightening of its
monetary policy that has slowed economic growth and fuel
consumption in the world's No. 2 economy.	
 November Brent crude for  was unchanged at $111.11 a
barrel by 0302 GMT, ahead of the contract expiry at the end of
Friday while U.S. crude  edged down 8 cents to $84.15.	
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude  rose to a record
of $27.26 a barrel earlier on Friday, up from a previous high of
$27.23 on Sept. 6.	
 ""Prices are consolidating, on a mix of positive and negative
news for oil, as the market looks for a direction to go,"" said
Jeremy Friesen, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Societe Generale,
referring to the recent restart of Libyan oil exports and
concern global economic growth will falter.	
 ""In this environment, we'll see some sideways trading,"" he
said. Societe Generale expects Brent crude prices to average
$98.30 in the fourth quarter and West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
to average $73.30 a barrel.	
 China's annual consumer inflation dipped to 6.1 percent in
September, sparing policymakers a jump in price pressures while
they fret about slower growth, although stubborn food price
rises showed Beijing's fight against inflation is not over.

 The Chinese central bank may look at easing monetary policy
that could loosen credit, Friesen said.	
 ""If that helps consumer spending and prevents a slowdown in
construction, it would be positive for global commodities,"" he
said.	
 China is expected to post next week slower economic growth
in the third quarter than the previous three months.

 A sudden worsening in Europe's debt crisis could further mar
China's growth outlook, strengthening the case for Beijing to
loosen policy before it is confident it has won the inflation
fight.	
 Pledges from European leaders early this week have briefly
soothed fears the region's debt crisis will escalate, causing
financial turmoil and dragging down the global economy.	
 ""Europe is starting to take the crisis a bit more
seriously,"" Friesen said. ""Hopefully we don't have to muddle
through to 2012.""	
 
 
 
 U.S. CRUDE STOCKS UP	
 U.S. crude stocks rose more than expected last week as
imports gained, while product inventories surprised with larger
than expected drawdowns, U.S. Energy Information Administration
data showed. 
 ""In our opinion, the most bullish number out of the DOE was
a 2.93 million barrel draw in distillates, the second largest
draw ever seen for this time step,"" analysts at the Schork
Report said in a note.	
 The oil industry has an overwhelmingly gloomy economic
outlook, expecting recession in the next year, less demand for
fuel and lower oil prices, a survey of delegates to a major
industry conference showed this week. 
 The market sentiment is reflected in U.S. crude oil options
activity which is focused more on managing volatility and
liquidating length on Thursday than initiating new positions,
traders said. 
 Market players squared positions and took profits ahead of
the November crude options expiry on Monday, and some hedgers
were seen starting to reset their books for 2012.	
 The United States will release retail sales and confidence
data later on Friday, providing indication on its economic
health.	
 Investors also await a G20 preparatory meeting on Friday and
Saturday, although it is not expected to announce market-moving
actions. .

 SINGAPORE, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Gold was slightly higher on
Friday and headed for its biggest weekly gain in more than a
month, shrugging off the credit rating downgrade of Spain ahead
of a G20 meeting whose agenda will be dominated by the euro zone
debt crisis.
 Ratings agency Standard and Poor's downgraded the long-term
credit rating of Spain by one notch on Friday, just as finance
ministers and central bank governors get ready to pressure
Europe to act swiftly to tackle its financial woes at a weekend
meeting. 
 The euro reversed early minor losses and edged higher
against the dollar, as investors remained confident European
policymakers will be able to contain the debt crisis. 
 ""The bar is very high for Europe credit news to be
considered 'bad' beyond what is priced in,"" said a
Singapore-based trader.	
 ""My sense is that a lot of premium has been spent and cash
hoarded insuring against the worst-case scenario.""	
 Spot gold inched up 0.3 percent to $1,671.80 an ounce
by 0633 GMT, on course for a rise of 2.1 percent from a week
earlier, its biggest weekly gain since early September in the
run-up to a record above $1,920.	
 U.S. gold  also gained 0.3 percent to $1,673.50 an
ounce in thin volume.	
 On the spot gold chart, the 5-day moving average was close
to cross above the 20-day moving average.

 UBS LOWERS 2011 GOLD FORECAST	
 UBS reduced its 2011 average gold price to $1,615 from
$1,665 to allow for mark-to-market adjustments and the impact of
a stronger dollar, but kept its 2012 forecast at $2,075.	
 ""Our core view is that ongoing global macroeconomic
disappointments, the inevitability of further negative turns in
the European sovereign debt crisis, and low business, consumer
and investor confidence will lead to gold being increasingly
used as the line of defence against negative market outcomes,""
the bank said in a research note.	
 The most serious risk to gold is a rapid deterioration in
bank funding and escalating liquidity concerns, it added.	
 The bank said its physical gold sales to India so far this
year rose 10 percent on the year, suggesting resilient buying
interest in the world's biggest gold consumer in the face of
higher prices.	
 Besides physical gold, Indians are likely to invest more in
gold-backed exchange-traded funds, as a sagging stock market
disappoints and high inflation eats into savings, the World Gold
Council said. 
 China, the world's second-largest gold consumer and biggest
gold producer, said its inflation in September eased from the
previous month, but the stubborn food price pressures will deter
the central bank from loosening its policy any time soon.

 High inflation has driven many retail investor in China to
bullion, which his seen as a good hedge against rising prices.	
 Spot platinum gained 0.6 percent to $1,537.49,
posting its biggest weekly rise in about two months of 3.2
percent, snapping five weeks of consecutive losses.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Gold fell in tandem with
riskier assets on Thursday, as disappointing economic data from
China and weaker U.S. equity markets, driven by bank worries,
dampened buying sentiment across the board.
 Bullion took the lead of weaker U.S. stocks and commodities
as lower-than-expected Chinese exports renewed fears of a
global economic slowdown. Wall Street is on track to snap three
days of gains on lower earnings by JPMorgan Chase .
 Optimism about a plan to tackle Europe's debilitating debt
crisis prompted gold, traditionally a safe haven, to move in
sync with equities and commodities. The precious metal is up
around 1.5 percent over the past four sessions, but was
pressured on Thursday by the dollar's rise.
 ""I think we can find still a pretty big correction (in
gold) if the dollar regains its preeminence as the reserve
currency,"" said Stanley Crouch, chief investment officer at
Aegis Capital, who oversees $2 billion in client assets.
 Crouch said that, over the past four to five weeks, gold's
status has completely switched to being part of the risk assets
from a safe haven.
 ""Investors are investing in gold for the perceived safety,
and yet what they're getting is incredible volatility.""
 Spot gold  was down 0.8 percent at $1,662.99 an ounce
by 2:08 p.m. EDT (1808 GMT), having come off an overnight high
at $1,683.89.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled down
$14.10 at $1,668.50 an ounce. Trading has been extremely thin
all week at less than half of its 30-day norm, indicating a
lack of commitment from bullion investors.
 Silver  fell 2.9 percent to $31.62 an ounce,
declining in tandem with the base metal complex led by copper.
 On charts, bullion once again traded below its 20-day
moving average after breaching that resistance the previous
day. Analysts said technical selling could continue after gold
briefly rose to records above $1,900 an ounce twice in late
August and early September.

 Platinum's discount to gold: http://r.reuters.com/wem44s
 Bearish double top: http://r.reuters.com/ceq44s
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 ""Just the double top is enough to push the market down,""
said Adam Hewison, president of MarketClub.com.
 ""I think that gold already topped out for the year, and it
is likely to be moving sideways in a broad trading range
similar to a pattern early this year.""
 Gold also came under pressure after new U.S. claims for
jobless benefits were little changed last week and the trade
deficit narrowed marginally in August, indicating a modest
improvement in the economy.
 IN SYNC WITH RISKIER ASSETS
 The metal, however, is on track for a rise of more than 1
percent this week, its strongest weekly performance in over a
month.
 Following a sharp correction from its record set in early
September, gold has moved in tandem with the so-called risk
assets such as equities and commodities, despite having had an
inverse relationship with them earlier in the year as buyers
sought the metal as a safe haven.
 Gold prices are also being underpinned by strong physical
demand from jewelers and other consumers in Asia, where
premiums are at their highest since the start of the year,
indicating regional supply tightness.
 However, French bank BNP Paribas cut its gold price
forecasts for 2011 through 2013, following the recent pullback
in prices and said a near-term correction may be possible due
to potential extreme risk aversion. [ID:nL3E7LD2L8]
 Among platinum group metals, palladium , of which
China is a key consumer for its the auto industry, fell 2.7
percent to $588.22.
 Palladium, which virtually doubled in price last year due
to demand from China's fast-growing car market, has lost more
than a quarter of its value this year, having fallen to its
lowest in 25 months this month.
 Platinum  dropped 1 percent to $1,527.74.

 By Gene Ramos
 NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Brent crude snapped six
sessions of gains on Thursday, trading slightly lower after
data showed further declines in oil demand from No. 2 consumer
China.
 Crude oil imports into China, one of the largest engines of
demand growth, dropped 12 percent in September from last year's
record high and were below 5 million barrels per day for the
fourth consecutive month, customs data showed. [ID:nL3E7LD08O]
 Brent and U.S. crude futures briefly pared losses after
U.S. government data showed surprisingly large drawdowns in
gasoline and distillate stockpiles. Crude stocks rose more than
expected, and traders said overall the report was not enough to
overcome the bearish Chinese figures. [EIA/S]
 In London, ICE Brent crude for November delivery 
settled at $111.11 a barrel, edging down 25 cents, after
hitting a session low of $109.07. Brent came off the day's lows
in early afternoon trading in New York ahead of the November
contract's expiry on Friday.
 ""There is a squeeze going on ahead of November Brent
crude's expiry,"" said Stephen Schork, editor of the Schork
Report in Villanova, Pennsylvania.
 In the six previous sessions, Brent gained more than $11,
or nearly 12 percent.
 U.S. November crude futures  settled at $84.23,
falling $1.34, after sliding to a session low of $83.17. U.S.
crude fell for a second day, after stemming five days of gains
on Wednesday.
 Strength in U.S. heating oil, which closed up 1.3 percent,
also helped crude on both sides of the Atlantic pare much of
their losses in late trading, analysts said.
 Brent's premium against U.S. crude rose to $26.88 at the
close, from $25.79 on Wednesday, It hit a session high of
$26.95, the highest in five weeks. Brent's record premium over
U.S. crude, also known as West Texas Intermediate, is $27.23,
struck on Sept. 6.
 The spread has widened this week, in part due to the
decision on Tuesday by the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index
<.DJUBS> to add Brent as a component in 2012 and reduce the
weighting for U.S. crude. [ID:nN1E79B09N]
 Brent crude's trading volume by 3:15 p.m. EDT (1915 GMT)
was around 544,000 contracts, down 6.5 percent from the 30-day
average. U.S. crude traded around 658,100 contracts, down 0.5
percent from the 30-day average.
 EURO ZONE, CHINA
 Further pressure on Brent came after the European Central
Bank said forcing private bondholders to accept losses on euro
zone sovereign debt could damage the reputation of the euro,
hurt the bloc's banks and encourage volatility on foreign
exchange markets. [ID:nF9E7GA02A]
 Concerns about shrinking oil demand, in the wake of
Europe's debt problems and slow growth in the United States,
again hit the spotlight after the weak Chinese import data.
 China's report followed bleaker demand growth forecasts for
this year from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries and the Paris-based International Energy Agency this
week. The U.S. Energy Information Administration separately
reported a lower demand forecast for this year, but it raised
its estimate for 2012. [ID:n1E79B178]

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Gold prices held steady on
Thursday, as optimism for a solution to the euro zone crisis
underpinned sentiment, while tight physical supply in Asia
continued to lend support. 
 But failure to break key technical levels triggered some
selling and pushed prices down nearly half a percent.	
 ""Gold is likely to remain in range trade as everyone is
waiting for the euro zone to reveal how it will solve the debt
crisis by the end of the month,"" said Dick Poon, manager of
precious metals at Heraeus in Hong Kong.	
 Poon expected gold to move sideways between $1,650 and
$1,730 until the market sees a clear direction.	
 Investors are watching a meeting of G20 finance ministers
and central bank governors in Paris this weekend, after Germany
and France pledged to unveil new measures to solve the debt
crisis by the end of the month. 
 The pledge, as well as agreement by Slovakia's political
parties to ratify the expansion of the euro zone's rescue fund,
has helped take the edge of widespread anxiety about contagion
in financial markets. 
 Spot gold edged down 0.3 percent to $1,672.39 an
ounce by 0643 GMT, off a 2-1/2-week high of $1,691.6 hit in the
previous session.	
 U.S. gold  lost half a percent to $1,674.40.

 
 
 SLOWING GLOBAL ECONOMY CONCERNS	
 But the concerns about a slowing global economy still hang
over the market.	
 Asia's economies are prone to near-term risks posed by
Europe's debt crisis and a U.S. slowdown, the International
Monetary Fund has warned. 
 Gold, typically seen as a safe haven during times of
economic and political turmoil, has not behaved like one
recently. Instead it has moved in tandem with riskier assets
such as equities, as investors sometimes have to sell off
profitable gold positions to cover losses elsewhere.	
 ""Fundamentals have been more pertinent to bullish gold, but
positioning of funds in market turbulence means that gold is not
going to roar back any time soon,"" said a Singapore-based
trader.	
 The failure to break above $1,700 has prompted some selling,
he added.	
 
 PHYSICAL SUPPLY STILL TIGHT	
 Buying interest in the physical market eased as spot gold
prices rose more than 2 percent so far this week, dealers said.	
 ""We saw some light selling yesterday evening,"" said a
Singapore-based dealer. ""The supply is still tight, and we need
the market to sell back to bring premiums down.""	
 Gold premiums in Singapore were about $2 an ounce above spot
prices, she said.	
 Poon of Heraeus in Hong Kong expected the supply tightness
over the past few weeks to ease, as more shipments arrive in the
bullion trading hub.	
 Physical buyers are eyeing $1,650 as an attractive level to
enter the market, he said.	
 Other precious metals also held steady. Spot platinum
was little changed at $1,544.74 an ounce, after three days of
consecutive gains.	
 Spot palladium lost 0.8 percent to $599.97. It is
down nearly 25 percent so far this year as the worst performer
in the precious metals complex.	
 Although underlying demand from the auto sector has shown
continued improvement over the past three months in key regions,
the lack of investment interest has sunk prices of the metal,
which nearly doubled last year, said Barclays Capital analysts.	
 ""While palladium's fundamentals remain intact, disinvestment
has proved to be a key swing factor as concerns over demand
weigh,"" they said in a research note.	
 ""In turn, prices need investment flows to stabilise before
they can look to their fundamentals for support.""

 * U.S. crude stockpiles probably rose last week, poll shows

 By Florence Tan	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell to near $111
on Thursday, snapping six days of gains, after trade data from
China pointed to slower demand in the world's second-largest oil
consumer.	
 China's September crude oil imports shrank from the previous
month despite expectations of a gain in demand as new refineries
opened and some units restarted after scheduled maintenance. 
 Total exports from the world's largest factory were also
lower than expected, dealing another blow to investors already
worried about the worsening sovereign debt crisis in Europe and
a possible recession in the United States.

 Brent crude for November  fell 25 cents to $111.11 a
barrel by 0301 GMT, after a gain of 11.6 percent over the
previous six sessions.	
 U.S. November crude  slipped 77 cents to $84.80 a
barrel, after tumbling to an intraday low of $84.64.	
 ""Exports growth in September was much lower than market
expectations, showing the sputtering external economy, and we
expect the slowing export trend to continue in the coming
months,"" said Wang Hu, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities Co.
in Shanghai.	
 The weaker Chinese data came after global oil forecasting
agencies cut 2011 demand estimates this week, stressing risks to
growth because of gloomy economic conditions. 
 ""Some of these adjustments will probably help support the
view that demand will be slowing for oil in conjunction with any
weakness in GDP growth,"" said Chen Xinyi, an analyst at Barclays
Capital in Singapore.	
 However, the U.S. government was the most bullish forecaster
as it increased its oil demand estimate for 2012.

 
 
 
 BRENT-WTI SPREAD WIDENS	
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude  stayed at above
$26 a barrel. The spread widened following a decision on Tuesday
by the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index , which had some
$80 billion in tracking funds at the middle of the year, to add
Brent as a component in 2012 and reduce the weighting for the
U.S.-traded West Texas Intermediate. 
 ""It could be a situation that some investors have switched
from WTI to Brent at the front of the curve that helped to
support Brent prices,"" Chen said.	
 Tighter supply stemming from production issues in the North
Sea and lower output forecasts from oil producers such as
Azerbajian may also underpin prices.	
 ""It doesn't seem like prices could come down soon, although
there's a 20 percent chance that a bad case scenario for the
global economy could pan out,"" Chen said.	
 Geopolitical tensions brewed as Saudi Arabia and the United
States traded charges with Iran on Wednesday over an alleged
plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to Washington, deepening
divisions and sharpening a contest for power in the oil-rich
Gulf. 
 In Europe, growing hopes that the euro zone is a step closer
to expanding its financial rescue fund to help contain the
region's debt woes and head off a systemic banking crisis shored
up Asian equities on Thursday. 
 Investors are watching on Thursday for U.S. government oil
inventories data, which is expected to show a build in crude
stockpiles as imports rebounded and refinery utilization rates
fell.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Wednesday
in tandem with riskier assets, as the dollar fell on hopes the
euro zone debt crisis will be contained after Slovakian parties
agreed to boost the region's bailout fund.
 Wall Street and industrial metals also posted sharp gains
after Slovakian lawmakers said they would approve a plan to
expand the powers and size of the European EFSF rescue fund.
Bullion broke above the 20-day moving average, which inspired
technical buying.
 The precious metal has risen 2.5 percent in the past three
sessions. Optimism about a plan to tackle Europe's debilitating
crisis prompted gold, traditionally a safe haven, to move in
sync with equities and commodities.
 ""Investors are less concerned that what's going on in
Europe will develop into some type of Lehman event,"" said Leo
Larkin, metals equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ.
 ""As long as people are confident that gold is not going to
be sold off in panic, it can continue to go higher.""
 Spot gold  was up 0.8 percent at $1,678.80 an ounce
by 2:46 p.m. EDT (1846 GMT).
 U.S. gold futures  for December delivery settled up
$21.60 an ounce at $1,682.60. Trading volume was extremely thin
for a third straight day at less than half of the 30-day norm,
suggesting gold's gains may not hold.
 Bullion held its gains after news that U.S. Federal Reserve
officials in September mulled a fresh round of bond purchases
among other steps to boost the economy. [ID:nN1E79B1BJ]
 Gold in recent weeks has moved with other commodities and
assets perceived as higher risk, such as stocks, despite having
had an inverse relationship with them earlier in the year as
buyers sought the metal as a safe haven from risk.
 The 30-day correlation between gold and world equities has
turned positive for the first time in three months. The inverse
link between gold and the dollar was at its tightest since
July, indicating lack of clear direction among bullion
investors.

 GFMS FORECAST, TECHNICALS IN FOCUS
 Central banks, particularly in emerging markets, are
expected to add more gold to reserves, underpinning prices.
 Metals consultancy Thomson Reuters GFMS said central banks
could buy nearly 500 tonnes of gold this year, raising its
estimate from 336 tonnes last month. [ID:nL3E7LC0G2]
 Spot gold broke above its 20-day moving average for the
first time in nearly a month. Some analysts said bullion was
near a technical breakout after it had been largely in a
trading range over the past two weeks.
 ""Gold is slowing building up to the long side again. Any
technical moving average we break has some significance to it,""
said Zachary Oxman, managing director of futures broker
Trendmax.com.
 ""If we can cross and close above $1,700, that's the key
point to start buying again.""
 Asian physical demand for the precious metal has been
buoyant, dealers said, and should remain so as India's wedding
season and Hindu festivals, both major gold-buying events, get
underway.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Gold prices edged higher in
thin trade on Wednesday, as investors waited for cues from
further developments in the euro zone's debt crisis, and robust
physical demand in Asia underpinned the sentiment.	
 Slovakia's parliament voted against the expansion of the
euro zone's rescue fund, but the move is unlikely to dampen
confidence the euro zone will come up with solutions to its debt
crisis. 
 ""Slovakia is not a big enough player to get in the way,""
said a Singapore-based trader.	
 ""The will in the euro zone is gravitating towards the idea
that they will have to do whatever it takes to prevent
contagion. Eventually we will see some kind of pan-European deal
cut.""	
 International lenders said they were likely to grant a loan
to Greece next month, buying time for a broader response, after
Germany and France pledged to craft new steps to resolve the
debt crisis by the end of the month.	
 Spot gold edged up 0.4 percent to $1,671.60 by 0646
GMT, reversing a 0.8-percent decline in the previous session.	
 U.S. gold  gained 0.8 percent to $1,673.70.	
 Technical analysis suggested that gold is likely to be
trapped in the range of $1,653 and $1,684 in the day, said
Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 
 
 
 PREMIUMS HIGH ON PHYSICALS' SHORT SUPPLY 
 Premiums in Singapore and Hong Kong remained at high levels
because of the short supply of physical materials.	
 ""The premiums are about $2.50, as most dealers are still
filling the orders that were pre-booked a week or two ago,"" said
the dealer. ""The buying has slowed down a bit in the past two
days, but the Thais are still looking at buying on dips.""	
 Dealers in Hong Kong said premiums were as high as $4.5 an
ounce above spot prices, as demand from mainland China stayed
robust after the National Day holiday last week.	
 ""Chinese demand is likely to remain strong until the end of
the year,"" said a Hong Kong-based dealer.	
 Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded
fund, SPDR Gold Trust , stood at 1,227.994 tonnes by Oct.
11, little changed from the end of September and down 4 percent
so far this year, while spot gold prices rose 17 percent during
the period. 
 ""Stabilization in the investment indications could be
backstopped by support in physical demand, where the end of the
Chinese holiday last week has created recovery. Similarly,
Indian demand is anticipated to increase soon due to the end of
a favorable monsoon season,"" said MF Global analyst Tom Pawlicki
in a research note.	
 The Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index announced its
2012 re-weightings, adding Brent crude oil  to its
components while cutting the weightings of gold and silver.

 Central banks' net gold buying for this year could be close
to 500 tonnes, said Thomson Reuters GFMS, up from 336 tonnes
forecast last month.

 NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose on Wednesday,
posting an 11.6 percent gain over six sessions, as Slovakian
lawmakers appeared ready to approve an EU plan to strengthen
the euro zone rescue fund.
 The euro rallied to nearly a one-month high against the
dollar on the news from Slovakia, adding support to
dollar-denominated oil. [USD/]
 U.S. crude seesawed and then settled lower, snapping a
five-session streak of higher closes, after failing in early
trade to push above its $86.64 intraday high from Tuesday.
 With Brent's front-month November contract set to expire on
Friday, the premium to U.S. crude  strengthened and
intraday pushed back above $26 a barrel for the first time
since mid-September, adjacent to October Brent's expiration.
 The spread's rise also followed the $80 billion Dow
Jones-UBS Commodity Index's <.DJUBS> decision on Tuesday to add
Brent as a component in 2012. [ID:nN1E79B09N]
 U.S. allegations that authorities had unmasked a plot by
two Iranians linked to security agencies to assassinate Saudi
Arabia's ambassador to the United States and recent output
problems in OPEC member Nigeria also supported Brent, brokers
and analysts said. [ID:nL5E7LC2LN] [ID:nL5E7LB1YN]
 Brent crude for November  rose 63 cents to settle at
$111.36 a barrel, after reaching $113 and pushing above
front-month Brent's 100- and 200-day moving averages.
 U.S. November crude  fell 24 cents to settle at
$85.57 a barrel, after reaching $86.59 intraday.
 Brent trading volumes outpaced those for U.S. crude, with
Brent turnover 11.5 percent above 30-day averages and U.S. 12
percent under.
 ""U.S. crude failed to push above Tuesday's high and the
Brent spread to U.S. crude has been trading in that $22 to $27
range and is being pushed up today, helped by Shell's force
majeure on Nigerian oil,"" said Gene McGillian, analyst at
Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
 Royal Dutch Shell  said it will lift by late
October or November its force majeure on Nigerian Forcados
crude exports if all repairs go as planned. [ID;nL5E7LB1YN]
 U.S. heating oil  posted the strongest percentage
gain in the oil futures complex. U.S. gasoline futures 
settled slightly higher.

 Gasoline stocks fell 1.2 million barrels and distillate
stocks dropped by 3.1 million barrels, the API said.
 Ahead of the API report, U.S. crude stockpiles were

 Distillate stocks were seen down 600,000 barrels and
gasoline stocks were expected to be down by only 100,000

Monday's Columbus Day holiday.
 In a separate report earlier, MasterCard said U.S. retail
gasoline demand fell again last week, year-on-year and versus
the previous week, as the price of the fuel remained above the
year-ago period. [ID:nN9E7G3006]

 NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil futures surged
to nearly $111 a barrel on Tuesday, rising for the fifth
straight session as investor optimism ahead of earnings season
lifted markets.
 Brent crude's 11 percent, five-day gain was the biggest
since August 2009 and marks a sharp rebound from the
eight-month low close below $100 just a week ago.
 Crude futures fell sharply earlier on worries over the
health of Europe's economy as its top financial watchdog said
the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis threatened global
economic stability.
 By 12:45 p.m. EDT (1645 GMT), Brent crude for November
delivery  had risen $1.35 to $110.30. It peaked at
$110.81, the highest since Sept. 21, from from the early low of
$107.45.
 U.S. November crude  was up 33 cents at $85.74,
having climbed from an early low of $83.97. Both Brent and U.S.
crude have broken above their 50-day averages.
 ""It looks like the stock market turned higher and crude is
following it,"" said Mark Waggoner, president at Excel Futures
in Bend, Oregon.

 By Frank Tang and Jan Harvey
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Gold dropped on
Tuesday, giving up some of the previous day's gains as bullion
investors sold on uncertainty ahead of a key vote in Slovakia
on expanding the euro zone rescue fund.
 Bullion fell with industrial metals led by copper ahead of
the Slovakia results, the only country of the 17-member bloc
which has not yet ratified a pact to boost the size and powers
of the European Financial Stability Facility. Wall Street
seesawed to trade flat after recent rallies.
 Trading of U.S. gold futures was extremely thin for the
second straight day, indicating indecision by some bullion
investors after the metal has moved in sync with risk assets
with its traditional safe-haven status absent.
 ""There is an incredible amount of headline risk at the
moment because of the unclarity behind all the news out of the
EU that may underpin gold or cause gold to sell off,"" said Fred
Schoenstein, precious metals trader of Heraeus Precious Metals
Management.
 ""There is no real clear direction in which gold should
trade.""
 Spot gold  was down 0.6 percent at $1,664.99 an ounce
by 3:04 p.m. EDT (1904 GMT). During the past five sessions,
bullion was still 2 percent higher as economic optimism has
lifted the equity markets as well as gold.
 A day after a broad rally of the so-called riskier assets
such as equities and commodities, copper fell 2 percent Tuesday
on demand worries over the euro zone debt crisis, which also
weighed down on gold.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled down
$9.80 an ounce at $1,661. Trading volume was higher than
Monday's but more than 50 percent below its 30-day norm.
 Commerzbank said in a note that gold futures investors are
more interested in speculating on bullion's upside than buying
the metal as a safe haven.
 ""It is also therefore by no means certain that the gold
price would benefit should the eurozone debt crisis escalate
again. We regard the upward potential for gold as exhausted in
the short term,"" the bank said.
 On weekly charts, gold should remain under pressure due to
a bearish double-top pattern, which could only be offset until
prices rise above $1,700 an ounce, said Adam Sarhan, chief
executive of Sarhan Capital.
 (Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/mad44s)
 Bullion investors are also more cautious after news that
hedge fund manager John Paulson lost more money in September.
 More liquidation could be possible in the gold market as
Paulson's investors now have less than one month left to decide
whether to pull their money out of the firm's biggest Advantage
Funds by the Oct. 31 notice deadline, traders said.
[ID:nN1E79703B]
 PHYSICAL DEMAND BRISK
 The precious metal is still seeing good physical demand at
lower prices, particularly from major buyers China and India.
But it has struggled to gain traction as prices rise, analysts
said.
 Demand for physical gold picked up considerably as prices
fell more than 20 percent from last month's record highs above
$1,920 an ounce.
 Premiums for gold bars in Hong Kong stood at around $3 an
ounce, their highest since at least February, while the premium
in Tokyo held at 50 cents, dealers said.
 Higher premiums on physical gold products could reflect
supply tightness in regional markets.
 Among other precious metals, silver  was up 0.4
percent at $32.15 an ounce. Spot platinum  was down 1
cent at $1,516.49 an ounce, while spot palladium  was
down 1.3 percent at $602.22 an ounce.

 By Gene Ramos and Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil futures rose
on Tuesday for the fifth straight session, on news of an
alleged Iranian plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador
in the United States.
 Before the news, oil markets had traded higher in line with
equities markets, which later eased off highs. Then, crude
found support on news of the alleged plot as well as on U.S.
East Coast refinery problems that raised supply concerns.
 Analysts said the alleged plot could reintroduce a risk
premium to crude prices which had not been seen since the
United States and other producer nations released strategic oil
inventories over the summer.
 ""This is the kind of thing that can move the market
like nothing else,"" said Richard Ilczyszyn, senior market
strategist at MF Global in Chicago, noting oil markets carried
a strong risk premium for much of the first half of the year
due to the Arab Spring.
 Tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran rose at the last
OPEC meeting when Tehran resisted a Saudi plan to increase oil
production to help counter disruptions to Libyan crude and
bring down prices.
 Brent crude's five-day gain of nearly 11 percent was the
biggest since August 2009 and marks a sharp rebound from the
eight-month low close below $100 just a week ago. Further
support for prices came as the euro gained against the dollar,
bolstering commodities denominated in the greenback.
 In London, ICE Brent crude for November delivery 
settled at $110.73 a barrel, gaining $1.78, after hitting a
session high of $111.15, the highest since Sept. 21, from from
the early low of $107.45. In five days, it had gained $10.94,
or 10.96 percent.
 U.S. November crude  settled 40 cents at $85.81,
after rising to the day's high of $86.64 from the early low of
$83.97. In five sessions, U.S. crude has risen $10.14, or !3.4
percent.
 Both Brent and U.S. crude have broken above their 50-day
averages in the recent days, adding to bullish sentiment.
 Trading volume for Brent was heavy, hitting nearly 660,000
contracts, 15.7 percent above its 30-day average. U.S. crude
volume was more than 681,000 contracts, 2.5 percent above its
30-day average.
 U.S. crude also found support on rallying gasoline futures
after trade sources said Sunoco shut a fluid catalytic cracker
unit at its Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania plant. [ID:nN1E79A0SW]
 ""The euro rallying and the U.S. gasoline's rally have
helped pushed oil prices up,"" said Mark Anderle, trader at TAC
Energy in Dallas, Texas.
 Crude futures fell sharply in early trade on worries over
the health of Europe's economy as its top financial watchdog
said the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis threatened global
economic stability.

 OIL DEMAND
 World oil demand may be more robust that expected, as
consumption in Asia and the Middle East is holding up and evem
with the slowdown in economic growth in the United States and
Europe, said Fatih Birol, chief economist of the Internatinoal
Energy Agency. [ID:nL5E7LB2KD]
 Earlier, OPEC, which pumps a third of the world's oil, cut
its global oil demand growth forecast for a fourth consecutive
month on Tuesday, citing the downturn in developed countries
and efforts by China and India to curb fuel use.
[ID:nL5E7LB1R1]
 OPEC cut its forecast of global oil demand growth this year
by 180,000 barrels per day (bpd) to just 880,000 bpd. Next year
it sees oil demand growing slightly faster -- by 1.19 million
bpd, down 70,000 bpd from its previous estimate in September.
 A Reuters poll ahead of weekly inventory reports showed
analysts expected U.S. crude stockpiles rose 300,000 barrels
last week on higher imports and lower refinery utilization
rates. [EIA/S]
 Distilate stocks fell 600,000 barrels and gasoline supplies
dipped 100,000 barrels, the poll also showed.

 * Eyes on possible supply disruption from Kuwait strike
 * U.S. weekly crude stocks likely up on higher imports

 By Florence Tan	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Brent crude held near $109 on
Tuesday on cautious optimism that European banks may avert a
financial crisis after leaders vowed to unveil a plan to resolve
the region's debt woes while a strike in OPEC member Kuwait
threatened exports.	
 World stocks and commodities markets rebounded on Monday,
buoyed by a pledge from German and French leaders to come up
with a plan by the end of the month to tackle Greece's debt woes
and recapitalise European banks. 
 November Brent crude futures  edged down 22 cents to
$108.73 a barrel by 0253 GMT. Prices closed at $108.95 on
Monday, their highest in two weeks. U.S. November crude 
inched down 8 cents to $85.33 a barrel. Both contracts jumped
nearly 3 percent on Monday.	
 ""The market is a little bit optimistic over the European
banking issue, but we still need to watch the situation
carefully,"" said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity sales manager at
Newedge Japan.	
 ""This problem is not so easy to fix as it's not only about
Greece but also other countries. It may take years.""	
 West Texas Intermediate crude futures may trade between $85
and $90 a barrel by year end while a more rosy economic outlook
in 2012 will lift prices to above $100, according to Hasegawa.	
 Brent will maintain a premium of $20 to $25 a barrel to WTI
this year while the spread could narrow to between $10 and $20
next year, he said.	
 Investors remain cautious due to the lack of detail about
the Franco-German plan, and the risk that a solution may be
derailed by an event such as political deadlock in Slovakia, the
one euro country that has yet to approve the EFSF expansion.

 ""That momentum may be growing in favor of a solution,""
analysts from MF Global said in a note.	
 ""That should benefit energy markets as it suggests that
economic demand for energy will improve.""

 
 
 KUWAIT STRIKE	
 Oil investors were closely watching for any supply
disruption from Kuwait after a strike by a customs union shut
ports and halted vessel traffic. 
 ""This will be a supportive factor for oil, but I don't think
it will be serious because it is still easy to get crude from
other parts of the world,"" Newedge's Hasegawa said.	
 Investors are also keeping an eye on oil inventories in the
United States for demand cues in the world's largest consumer.	
 ""The U.S. economic outlook is more healthy than Europe but
it's still a very mild recovery,"" Hasegawa said.	
 U.S. commercial crude stockpiles probably rose last week as
imports rebounded and refinery runs fell, a preliminary Reuters
poll of analysts found on Monday.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Spot gold prices edged higher
on Tuesday, building on a rally of more than 2 percent in the
previous session, as optimism about a resolution of the euro
zone's debt crisis underpinned market sentiment.	
 The pledge by Germany and France on Sunday spurred rallies
in commodities and equities, and also helped U.S. gold futures
stage the biggest one-day rise in nearly two weeks.	
 ""As the news revived risk appetite, some money was being
moved out of the money market to commodities, including gold,""
said Hou Xinqiang, an analyst at Jinrui Futures in China.	
 ""In addition, the outlook for stronger physical gold demand
is likely to buoy sentiment in bullion.""	
 Premiums for gold bars in Hong Kong stood at around $3 an
ounce to spot prices, their highest level since at least
February, while the premium in Tokyo held at 50 cents, dealers
said.	
 ""We see the bottom for gold prices at $1,600,"" said a dealer
at a large Tokyo-based bullion house. ""When gold prices approach
that level, physical demand from emerging economies rises.""	
 Spot gold rose to $1,684.36 an ounce earlier in the
day, its highest in more than two weeks. It stood at $1,678.30
by 0606 GMT, up 0.2 percent from the previous close.	
 U.S. gold  gained half a percent to $1,679.90.	
 Technical analysis suggested that spot gold needs to clearly
break resistance at $1,677 to target $1,690, said Reuters market
analyst Wang Tao. 
 
 
 EURO ZONE IN FOCUS	
 Investors are waiting to see if Slovakia will approve the
expansion of the bloc's rescue fund in a vote later in the day.
Slovakia is the last of the 17-member bloc yet to greenlight the
deal. 
 The European Union on Monday postponed a summit by a week to
allow time for a broader solution to Greece's debt crisis, after
Athens said it had concluded talks with international lenders on
an aid payment needed to avert default. 
 ""The tug of war remains until the politicians wake up,"" said
a Singapore-based trader, adding that gold is likely to be
remain rangebound between $1,630 and $1,720.	
 Asian shares rose and the euro held the previous session's
big gains. 
 Societe Generale said it remains broadly bullish on the
outlook for gold despite the recent retrenchment in prices, but
lowered its 2012 average price forecast to $2,175 from $2,275.

 Other precious metals also rose. Spot platinum rose
as much as 1.6 percent to $1,541.24, before easing to $1,522.49,
extending the 1.8 percent climb in the previous session.

 By Matthew Robinson
 NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Oil rose nearly 3 percent on
Monday, extending gains into a fourth straight session after a
strike halted Kuwait's crude exports and France and Germany
pledged to come up with a plan to tackle the euro zone crisis.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy promised on Sunday to unveil by the end of
October a comprehensive new package to resolve the debt crisis,
which has dragged on oil and other commodities for months.
[ID:nL5E7L90RP]
 Optimism toward a crisis resolution helped push up Brent
more than 9 percent over the past four sessions, the biggest
four-day gain since August 2009 as investors sold the dollar
and put cash into equities and commodities.
 ""There's an assumption there will be some kind of resolve
in the euro zone crisis,"" said Richard Ilczygszyn, senior
market strategist for MF Global in Chicago.
 ""We are seeing the shorts run for the hills in the euro and
all foreign currency versus the dollar. It brings up equities
and the green light for commodities is on right now.""
 Further support came after shipping sources said all oil
tanker traffic from Kuwait, one of the world's top five oil
exporters and a large supplier to Asia, had stopped as a
customs union went on strike. [ID:nL5E7LA2LB]
 November Brent crude futures  settled $3.07 higher
at $108.95 a barrel, above the 20-day moving average. U.S.
November crude  traded up $2.43 to settle at $85.41 a
barrel, breaking through the 20-day and 50-day moving
averages.
 With oil investors closely watching the wider economy for
signals, U.S. crude's negative correlation to the U.S. dollar
has increased, touching the highest since November 2008 on a
25-day basis.
 Brent trading volumes held close to the 30-day average,
exceeding those U.S. futures, which were 30 percent below that
average. Oil's gains were part of a wider commodity rally that
saw gold  up more than 2 percent to near its highest in
two weeks, while copper notched a fourth day of gains.

 OPEC
 Traders also weighed other supply factors, including word
from Saudi Arabia's oil minister Ali al-Naimi over the weekend
that OPEC's top exporter had cut production to 9.39 million
barrels per day from 9.8 million bpd in August.
 But Naimi said he did not see a decline in the kingdom's
exports as Libya restored production disrupted by civil war.
[ID:nL5E7L90DW]
 The loss of Libyan oil exports, an important feedstock for
European refiners, has helped push international benchmark
Brent crude to a record premium to U.S. oil futures this year.
 The International Energy Agency said Libya may be able to
return to its pre-war-level oil output earlier than 2013 if oil
companies resume activities there as quickly as they seem to be
doing. [ID:nL5E7LA2LE]
 Additional support for Brent crude came after Shell
 declared force majeure on exports of Nigerian Forcados
crude for October to December following a sabotage attack on a
major pipeline. [ID:L5E7LA2ZT]
 US INVENTORIES
 A Reuters poll of analysts ahead of weekly inventory data
forecast a 700,000-barrel build in crude inventories for the
week to Oct. 7 due to a rebound in imports and lower refinery
utilization, while distillate and gasoline stockpiles were seen
falling. [ID:nN1E7990TY]
 Inventory data will be delayed due to the Columbus Day
holiday in the United States, with the American Petroleum
Institute report due out on Wednesday, and the Energy
Information Administration's report coming out on Thursday.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Gold rose 2 percent on
Monday in a risk rally with equities and commodities, as the
dollar tumbled after a renewed Franco-German pledge to
introduce a plan to resolve the euro zone's debilitating debt
crisis.
 Trading volume of gold futures was extremely thin due to
the U.S. Columbus Day holiday.
 Bullion notched its biggest one-day gain in a week, as U.S.
stock markets, oil and the euro surged following remarks by
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy to unveil a new comprehensive package to contain the
crisis by the end of October.
 In the past four sessions, the metal gained 3 percent as
bullion prices have moved up and down in sync with the S&P 500,
while the safe-haven buying that spurred gold's three-year
rally was largely absent.
 ""Gold is rallying as a commodity instead of a
flight-to-quality asset. Until that trend changes, you can get
your head ripped off trying to play the other side of it,"" said
Adam Klopfenstein, senior market strategist at futures broker
MF Global.
 ""Right now, the theme for gold is its positive correlation
with equities and the commodity spectrum,"" he said.
 Spot gold  was up 2.1 percent by $1,672.70 an ounce
by 2:26 p.m. EDT (1826 GMT).
 Silver  was up 2.8 percent at $32.03 an ounce.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$35 at $1,670.80 an ounce.
 Volume was about two-thirds below its 30-day average as
banks, government offices and the bond market are shut for the
U.S. Columbus Day holiday. Even so, Monday's turnover was
sharply lagging the level on last year's Columbus Day.
 Jonathan Jossen, COMEX gold options floor trader, said
more options dealers are buying volatility following a recent
decline in gold option prices, indicating the price of the
underlying gold futures is due for a rally.
 Bullion rose about 3 percent as U.S. stocks rallied on
optimism about Europe. The S&P 500 is now more than 10 percent
above a low last Tuesday that took the index briefly into a
bear market.
 The 25-day log-based correlation between gold and S&P 500
was at a negative 0.05, its weakest link in three months,
Reuters data showed. (Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/vuw93s ) 
 The gold-equities correlation is on track to turn positive,
after the two were moving in tandem earlier this year.
 Other precious metals and commodities benefited from a 2
percent drop of the dollar against the euro, its largest
one-day decline in 15 months. [FRX/]
 PAULSON LOST MORE IN SEPT, SEEN BULLISH
 Bullion traders also said news that hedge fund manager John
Paulson lost more money in September showed the correction in
gold may have run its course.
 Disappointing performance at Paulson & Co suggests the firm
could have liquidated some of its gold investments to meet
margin calls amid losses in other markets back in September,
traders said.
 Steadier gold prices suggest the heaviest bouts of
liquidation might have already ended, they said.
 Paulson's flagship Advantage Plus fund, which uses some
borrowed money to help boost returns, tumbled 19.35 percent
last month the firm told clients. [ID:nN1E79703B]
 His gold fund, which includes metal and mining companies,
lost 16.35 percent last month and trimmed its year-to-date gain
to 1.34 percent.
 Gold prices have been choppy since falling as much as 20
percent from the record highs hit early in September.
 Among platinum group metals, spot platinum  was up
2.3 percent at $1,520.49 an ounce, while spot palladium 
was up 4.4 percent at $608.73 an ounce.

 By Zaida Espana	
 LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Brent crude futures gained ground
on Monday, after France and Germany said they would come up with
a plan to contain the euro zone crisis, but details will not
emerge until the end of the month.	
 Market sentiment improved after leaders Merkel and Sarkozy
vowed on Sunday to hatch a new plan to deal with Greece's debt
issues and recapitalise euro zone banks, although details would
not be available until a G20 summit in Cannes on Nov. 3-4.

 Crude futures and the euro rose on the back of the news but
equity markets adopted a more muted reaction.	
 ""It remains to be seen how markets react to this latest
weekend pronouncement, as at some point, words will need to be
replaced by concrete action,"" MF Global analysts wrote in a note
on Monday.	
 November Brent crude futures  were 67 cents firmer at
to $106.55 a barrel by 0817 GMT after rising to an intraday high
of $106.60. The contract posted an increase of 4.5 percent last
week, its best performance since the week to July 8.	
 U.S. November crude  led the gains and was up 97 cents
at $83.95 a barrel, after hitting $84.12 earlier.	
 ""There is a positive feel to problems being solved at the
moment,"" said Jonathan Barratt, managing director at Commodity
Broking Services in Sydney.	
 ""We now have a timeline in Europe which people will work
towards.""	
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy said on Sunday that their goal was to come up with a
sustainable answer for Greece's woes, agree how to recapitalise
European banks and present a plan for accelerating economic
coordination in the euro zone by a G20 summit in Cannes on Nov.
3-4. 
 The board of Franco-Belgian Dexia bank accepted on Monday a
rescue plan drawn up by the governments of France, Belgium and
Luxembourg after it became the first bank to fall victim to the
two-year-old euro zone debt crisis. 
 ""Price sentiment should improve this week as European
lawmakers continue to ease concerns, although oil's high
sensitivity to equity markets creates additional uncertainty,""
ANZ analysts said in a note.	
 Friday's data showing job gains in the United States also
eased recession fears. 
 
 
 SUPPORTIVE DATA 
 In the United States, more workers were hired in September
while job gains for the prior two months were revised higher,
easing fears of a double-dip recession at the world's largest
oil consumer. 
 ""The U.S. economic data suggest that we're not going into
recession,"" Barratt said.	
 He added that recent drawdowns in U.S. oil inventories
suggested more demand while forecasts of a cold winter could
support U.S. oil prices at $85 and $86 a barrel.	
 Saudi Arabia sees neither a decline in global oil demand nor
a reduction in the kingdom's exports due to increased output
from Libya, Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said at the weekend.	
 Naimi said the kingdom remained ready to meet all its
customers' needs. In September, its output fell to 9.39 million
barrels per day (bpd) from around 9.8 million bpd in August, he
said. 
 Unrest in the Middle East brewed on as oppositions struggled
with the governments in Syria and Yemen.

 In Asia, Royal Dutch Shell Plc is restarting the largest
crude distillation unit at its Singapore refinery less than two
weeks after the plant was shut because of a fire, three industry
sources with direct knowledge said on Monday. [IDLnL3E7LA0IJ]	
The drive to partially restart the 210,000-barrels per day
(bpd) CDU, one of three at Shell's largest plant capable of
processing 500,000 bpd of crude, is due to strong margins for
base oils and lubricants. It will also yield light distillates,
sufficient to keep its chemical complex running at reduced
rates, they said.	
 Investors will be watching for trade and inflation data from
China later this week to gauge the economic health of the
world's second largest oil consumer, Barratt said.	
 Yet the euphoria may not last as speculators have opened new
short positions to bet on further price falls, data from the
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed on Friday.

 Daily technical charts showed that Brent's upside was
limited to $107.85/bbl while U.S. oil faced a strong resistance
at $84.10 a barrel, Reuters markets analyst Wang Tao said.

 SINGAPORE, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Brent rose above $106 on
Monday, fuelled by optimism that demand in the world's largest
consumer would hold after U.S. data allayed fears of a renewed
recession while the euro zone edged closer to a resolution of

 SINGAPORE, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose 1 percent on
Monday, reversing a decline in the previous session, after the
leaders of France and Germany promised to unveil new steps by
the end of the month to resolve the euro zone's debt crisis.	
 The announcement by leaders of the bloc's top two economies
followed the downgrade of credit ratings of Italy and Spain last
week, which depressed the price of bullion.

 ""For now, gold seems to follow the movement in the
commodities market,"" said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip
Futures, adding that the safe-haven appeal of gold had faded
after unprecedented volatility in recent months.	
 Spot gold rose nearly 1 percent to $1,653.69 an
ounce, before trimming some gains to $1,651.19 by 0709 GMT. 
 The precious metal gained 0.9 percent last week, snapping
four weeks of consecutive losses -- its longest downward streak
since January.	
 U.S. gold  climbed as much as 1.2 percent to
$1,655.7, and eased to $1,653.30.	
 Technical analysis suggested spot gold is likely to hover in
the range of $1,596 and $1,677 during the day, said Reuters
market analyst Wang Tao. 
 The dollar fell half a percent against a basket of
currencies , helping strengthen commodities, as a cheaper
dollar encourages buyers holding other currencies. 
 
 
 
 China's financial markets have reopened after the week-long
National Day holiday. The popular gold forward contract on the
Shanghai Gold Exchange rose more than 1 percent to
341.90 yuan per gram, or $1,674.50 an ounce. 
 ""We are seeing some buying interest from Shanghai, and the
interest in physical gold is still strong,"" said Peter Fung,
head of dealing at Wing Fung Precious Metals in Hong Kong.	
 Premiums on gold bars in Hong Kong remained around $3 per
ounce, as physical stockpiles were running low, said dealers. 
 Money managers, including hedge funds and other large
speculators, scaled back bullish bets in gold futures and
options for the eighth time in nine weeks, as bullion deepened
its correction from its record set early September.

 Investors are eyeing data from the United States this week,
including minutes of the Federal Reserve's Sept. 20-21 meeting;
weekly filings for jobless benefits and retail sales and
consumer confidence numbers for September, after Friday's data
suggested a stronger-then-expected U.S. labour market.

 Prices of other precious metals also rallied.	
 Spot silver surged 2.5 percent to $31.93, before
easing to $31.70. U.S. silver  jumped 3.2 percent to
$31.98 and pared some gains to $31.72.	
 Spot platinum gained more than 2 percent to $1,518 an
ounce, and spot palladium rose as much as 3.2 percent to
$601.7.

 By Frank Tang and Amanda Cooper
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Gold fell around 1
percent on Friday, as bullion investors raised cash to cover
margin calls amid losses in the equity markets after Fitch
downgraded the credit ratings of Spain and Italy.
 Gold still notched its first weekly gain in a month, moving
higher in tandem with risk assets. The safe-haven buying that
spurred the metal's three-year rally was absent. (Graphic:
http://r.reuters.com/vuw93s )
 In early trade on Friday, gold climbed with Wall Street
after a stronger-than-expected U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.
 Some investors still believe the Federal Reserve may
introduce new measures to stimulate U.S. economic growth, which
would underpin gold as a store of value. But others see more
downside risk if investors need to sell gold to cover margin
calls for losses in other financial markets.
 ""When people need money to answer margin calls, gold is
susceptible to liquidity bids from other markets. I don't know
if we have seen the bottom put in for gold after this week's
reversal,"" said Jeffrey Sherman, commodities portfolio manager
at DoubleLine Capital, which oversees $17 billion in assets.
 Gold  fell 0.9 percent to $1,633.69 an ounce by 2:27
p.m. EDT (1827 GMT). During the session, it traded as high as
$1,665.99.
 For the week, gold was up around 0.7 percent, its first
weeky gain in five weeks. Stronger physical demand boosted gold
after the precious metal fell 20 percent from its record of
$1,920.30 in early September.
 U.S. December gold futures  settled down $17.40 at
$1,635.80. Trading volume was thin for a third consecutive
session, suggesting recent gains could be short-lived.
 Silver  was down by 2.3 percent at $31.17 an ounce.
 Even though U.S. employers hired more workers than expected
in September, the unemployment rate remained stuck at 9.1
percent for a third straight month. That kept pressure on
President Barack Obama and the U.S. Federal Reserve to do more
to spur a stronger recovery.
 Michael Lewis, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said the payrolls
data was not strong enough to change the low interest-rate
environment which has benefited gold.

 NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher in
volatile trading on Friday and posted a weekly gain as
supportive U.S. jobs data and a ratings downgrades of Spain and
Italy buffeted markets.
 Both Brent and U.S. crude futures recovered late after
retreating when Fitch cut Spain's credit ratings minutes after
downgrading Italy, saying the intensification of the euro zone
debt crisis has hurt the entire region. [ID:nL5E7L72KC]
 ""Some late price recovery came after the shock that Spain
was included in the downgrades wore off,"" said Phil Flynn,
analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago.
 ""And there has been progress made with Europe moving to
implement their version of quantitative easing,"" Flynn added.
 The Fitch move followed Moody's ratings cut for British
banks Lloyds  and Royal Bank of Scotland  that
pressured oil prices ahead of the U.S. jobs report.
[ID:nL5E7L70H6]
 Both oil futures contracts rose on supportive U.S. jobs
figures, though gains were limited because the return of
striking workers accounted for much of the improvement.
 Brent crude for November  edged up 15 cents to
settle at $105.88 a barrel, trading from $104.37 to $106.64.
 Brent ended 3 percent higher on the week, the best
percentage weekly gain since the week to July 8.
 U.S. November crude  rose 39 cents to settle at
$82.98 a barrel, having traded between $81.36 and $84.
 U.S. crude jumped 4.7 percent for the week, the best weekly
percentage rise since the week to March 4.
 U.S. crude trading volumes were just 2 percent above the
30-day average while Brent volume was 9 percent under its

 Nonfarm payrolls in the United States rose by 103,000 in
September, versus forecasts for 60,000, and job gains for the

 But part of the strength of September's jobs number
reflected the return of 45,000 Verizon Communications workers
who had dropped off payrolls in August due to a strike.
 Excluding those workers, payrolls increased by 58,000, just
missing expectations.

 * Coming up: Non-farm payrolls

 By Seng Li Peng	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Brent crude stayed firm above
$105.50, boosted by Europe's move to shore up ailing banks and
expectations that the U.S. economy may not be sliding into
recession.	
 The European Central Bank (ECB) announced aggressive
liquidity measures on Thursday, throwing a lifeline to lenders
who have seen wholesale funding drying up as market confidence
ebbed, and the European Union said it would present a plan for a
coordinated recapitalisation of banks by member states.	
 Asian equities rose, and gold and copper headed for their
first weekly gains in about a month, fuelled by confidence that
a euro zone debt crisis, which was seen as inevitably triggering
a global recession, may be avoided. 
 ""Support was given mainly by the focus on Europe and
comments... in favor of recapitalizing banks,"" said MF Global in
its daily report. 
 Brent November crude futures  were up 12 cents to
$105.85 a barrel at 0420 GMT. U.S. crude  rose 11 cents to
$82.70 a barrel.	
 But Brent oil  is expected to retrace to $103 per
barrel, as it may fail a resistance at $105.79, said Reuters
market analyst Wang Tao, while U.S. oil  failed a
resistance at $82.62 per barrel, and is expected to retrace to
$81, as pointed by a rising channel. 
 Traders were also positive ahead of the release of U.S.
non-farm payrolls data for September, which could show 60,000
new jobs created and the unemployment rate unchanged at 9.1
percent, offering hopes the world's largest economy, and top oil
consumer, was only growing slowly, not falling into recession.

 ""Today's jobs numbers will be really important for the U.S.
to see if we get a little bit more bullishness,"" said Jeremy
Friesen, a commodity strategist at Societe Generale in Hong
Kong. 
 ""The ECB's move is part of the bullish story. And if China
continues to slog through, that could a more bullish scenario
for commodities. But until you get rid of that (financial) risk,
we do not think you are going to see sustainable strength.""

 SINGAPORE, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Gold headed for its biggest
weekly gain in a month as equities regained strength after fresh
efforts by Europe to resolve its debt crisis eased nagging
worries about a global recession, while purchases from jewellers
offered additional support.	
 But trading was slow ahead of the release of U.S. non-farm
payrolls data for September, which could show 60,000 new jobs
created and the unemployment rate unchanged at 9.1 percent,
offering hopes the world's largest economy was only growing
slowly, and not falling into recession.	
 Gold added $7.44 to $1,656.79 an ounce by 0313 GMT,
still down from a lifetime high of around $1,920 hit in early
September. 
 ""The payroll number will be a driver of trade today, but
will jostle metals prices only if it's significantly far from
expectations,"" said Tom Pawlicki, precious metals and energy
analyst at MF Global.	
 ""Technical factors have been slightly positive recently, in
our opinion, but have been slow to create any upside. The
bullish focus for the market today will rest on payrolls,
recapitalisation of European banks, and on generally slow
economic growth."" 
 Global stocks rose after the European Union moved to shore
up ailing banks as U.S. President Barack Obama urged European
leaders to act faster to tackle the sovereign debt crisis that
threatened global economic recovery. 
 
 Fears about Europe's two-year-old sovereign debt crisis have
caused a sharp sell-off in riskier assets since late July. 
 Bullion jumped to record last month as the euro tumbled on
worries the debt crisis would spread. But as equities plunged,
investors sold the precious metal to cover losses, sending
prices to a two-month low around $1,534 an ounce last week.	
 U.S. gold futures  were steady at $1,658.1 an ounce.	
 Tokyo's Nikkei share average rose 0.9 percent on
Friday, while MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares
outside Japan rose 1.2 percent, led by a 2.4
percent gain from the materials sector . 
 The euro also held gains on Friday after rallying for a
third session overnight after the European Central Bank's moves
to contain the euro zone crisis. 
 Jewellers across Asia remained active, buying gold whenever
there was a slight dip in prices. Buying from consumers such as
India, China, Indonesia and Vietnam kept premiums steady at
their highest since at least February in Singapore and Hong
Kong. 
 ""People are cautious ahead of the payroll data, but physical
demand is not too bad. It supports gold for the time being,""
said a dealer in Hong Kong. ""The Asian region is still buying
physical gold. People will jump to buy whenever there's a drop
in prices."" 
 Jewellers in main consumer India are building stocks
ahead of the marriage season and Diwali, the Hindu festival of
light later in October. Gold jewellery is an essential part of
the dowry basket Indian parents give their daughters. 
 In other markets, copper is headed for its first week of
gains on Friday, snapping four weeks of declines. 
 U.S. crude oil eased towards $82 a barrel on Friday, after
sharp gains the previous session, as concerns over the economic
outlook in the West kept prices volatile.

 By Frank Tang and Jan Harvey
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Gold rose in thin trade
for a second session on Thursday, boosted by a rally in
equities and commodities after new liquidity measures from the
European Central Bank fueled economic optimism.
 Silver jumped more than 5 percent, rising in tandem with
industrial commodities led by copper and crude oil, as
encouraging U.S. jobless claims data triggered gains across the
board ahead of Friday's key nonfarm payrolls report.
 This week, the safe-haven buying that helped bullion log a
three-year rally was largely absent, and neither did the metal
trade consistently with risk assets, underscoring investors'
confusion about the role of gold in financial markets.
 Gold prices traditionally rise in times of economic
uncertainty.
 ""I really don't see the safe-haven attraction of gold is
going to change very much because of all the financial problems
in Europe and in the western world,"" said Leo Larkin, metals
equity analyst at Standard & Poor's.
 ""There is still a lack of confidence in financial assets.""
 Spot gold  was up 0.6 percent at $1,651 an ounce by
2:41 p.m. EDT (1841 GMT).
 Silver  rose 4.8 percent to $31.84 an ounce, its
biggest one-day gain in nearly two months.
 Bullion has ended higher in five of its last six sessions,
on track to post its first weekly rise in the past five weeks.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$11.60 at $1,653.20 an ounce.
 U.S. COMEX futures' trading volume was thin for a second
straight day at about 55 percent below its 30-day average, set
to be the weakest since June, Reuters preliminary data showed.
 Recent low turnover suggests bullion's gains of about 2
percent so far this week might be short-lived.
 ""Continued uncertainty and choppiness in the metal's prices
have discouraged traders from participating in gold,"" FC Stone
commodity broker George Nickas said.
 Nickas said Friday's employment report could confirm the
more positive tone in the stock market this week, which in turn
may give bullion a firmer direction.
 Economists expect September U.S. nonfarm payrolls to have
risen by 60,000 jobs, after a flat reading for in August.
 GOLD UP ON EUROPE HOPES
 Wall Street rose for a third day after the European Union's
executive arm said it would present a plan for member states to
coordinate a recapitalization of their banks, as regulators met
to reassess the capital buffers of stressed lenders.
[ID:nL5E7L63E3]
 Gold benefited on inflation concerns after the ECB threw a
lifeline to commercial banks by turning up its liquidity pumps
to provide longer-term cheap money for the growing number of
European lenders.
 The moves came amid growing fears that Greece may be forced
to default within months, setting off a chain reaction of
sovereign downgrades and bank failures. Earlier this week,
mounting debt fears dragged on stock markets, which prompted
investors to sell gold to cover losses elsewhere.
 Gold recorded its biggest decline in nearly three years
last month as selling to cover heavy stock market losses pulled
prices more than 20 percent from record highs and prompted a
period of intense volatility.
 Platinum group metals rose on the back of a 5-percent rally
in copper. Spot platinum  gained 1.7 percent at $1,510.74
an ounce, while spot palladium  added 5.4 percent at
$601.22 an ounce.

 By Gene Ramos
 NEW YORK, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped nearly 3
percent on Thursday, gaining for a second straight day as
Europe moved closer to pumping aid to the region's troubled
banks and U.S. jobless benefit claims rose less than expected
last week.
 Trading was volatile, with prices briefly dipping early
after the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged
and the bank's chief warned of more regional economic risks.
 The EU's executive arm said it would present a plan for
member states to coordinate a recapitalization of their banks,
as regulators met in London to reassess the capital buffers of
stressed lenders that received a clean bill of health in July.
[ID:nL5E7L6311]
 The news helped ease concern about the euro zone crisis,
which has weighed heavily on oil and equity markets over the
past two months. Global equities and major commodities such as
copper, which posted its biggest one-day gain since early 2010,
also gained. [MET/L]
 Markets also got a lift from data showing new claims for
U.S. unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week,
feeding hopes for an improved labor market on the eve of the
September nonfarm payrolls report on Friday. [ID:nOAT004875]
 ""Oil traders are looking at the macro-market situation.
reacting to the ECB moves and also the better-than-expected
jobless claims data,"" said Richard Ilczyszyn, senior market
strategist at MF Global in Chicago.
 In London, Brent crude futures for November delivery
 settled at $105.43 a barrel, gaining $3.00, after
rising to the session high of $105.88. U.S. crude 
settled at $82.59, gaining $2.91, after hitting a session high
of $82.90.
 Brent's premium against U.S. crude rose slightly to $23.14,
after closing at $23.05 on Wednesday. 
 U.S. gasoline futures paced the energy complex in New York,
with intraday prices gaining more than 4 percent on East Coast
supply shortfall due to refinery outages. [PRO/U]
 Trading volume on Brent crude was around 557,000 contracts,
1.2 percent below its 30-day average. U.S. crude, volume was
around 692,000 contracts, rising 8.3 percent from its 30-day
average.
 Despite the day's sharp gains analysts saw more downside
risk for crude futures, given economic weakness in the United
States and the debt crisis in the euro zone.
 Also, with some of the oil production curbed by the war in
Libya and interruptions in the North Sea and Nigeria was now
finding its way back into the market, the supply fundamentals
for oil are ""pretty strong right now,"" Exxon Mobil Corp 
Chief Executive Rex Tillerson said at the Washington Ideas
Forum. [ID:nN1E7950T9]

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Gold rose for a second
session on Thursday, boosted by a rally in stocks and
commodities after the European Central Bank launched liquidity
measures to help lenders weather the region's debt crisis.
 Silver jumped more than 4 percent as Wall Street
accelerated gains on hopes that the latest plans by European
policymakers to recapitalize their banks will help end a
sovereign debt crisis.
 Gold rose in thin, choppy trade as the metal's recent
volatility discouraged buying interest. Some investors stayed
on the sidelines ahead of Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls
report, which traders said could confirm the more positive tone
in equity markets this week.
 ""I really don't see the safe-haven attraction of gold is
going to change very much because of all the financial problems
in Europe and in the western world,"" said Leo Larkin, metals
equity analyst at Standard & Poor's.
 ""There is still a lack of confidence in financial assets.""
 Spot gold  was up 0.2 percent at $1,643.09 an ounce
by 12:06 p.m. EDT (1606 GMT). Silver  rose 4.1 percent to
$31.62 an ounce.
 Bullion is on track to rise 1 percent for the week after it
ended higher in five of its last six sessions.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  gained $3.80
at $1,645 an ounce.
 The stronger performance of equities and commodities, led
by industrial metals and crude oil, lifted gold.
 Wall Street rose for a third day after the European Union's
executive arm said it would present a plan for member states to
coordinate a recapitalization of their banks, as regulators met
in London to reassess the capital buffers of stressed lenders.
 Gold benefited after the ECB threw a lifeline to commercial
banks by turning up its liquidity pumps to provide longer-term
cheap money for the growing number of European lenders.
 The moves came amid growing fears that Greece, the most
heavily indebted euro zone state, may be forced to default
within months, setting off a chain reaction of sovereign
downgrades and bank failures.
 Worries about a Greek default weighed on the stock markets
as well as gold earlier this week.

 By Seng Li Peng	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Brent crude held above $102
after surging in the previous session as pessimism about weaker
demand was outweighed by a surprise drawdown of U.S. inventories
and concerns that Libya's largest oilfield could be damaged.	
 Hopes of an early return of Libyan supplies to global
markets after months of war were dashed after Italian oil major
Eni said it feared its largest oilfield in the North
African nation might be in ruins.	
 That statement, coupled with a fall in U.S. crude stocks to
their lowest since January and hopes Europe would prop up its
banking sector, supported oil prices.	
 ""We went from about $76.00 to around $79.70 for WTI (this
week) and prices holding on to those highs shows the market is
pretty much doing alright,"" said Jonathan Barratt, managing
director at Commodity Broking Services in Sydney.
 ""I won't worry about the fact that prices are down by a
fraction today.""	
 Brent November crude futures  fell 32 cents to
$102.41 by 0430 GMT, pulling back slightly from a gain of nearly
3 percent the previous day. U.S. crude , which jumped more
than 5 percent on Wednesday, eased 8 cents to $79.60 a barrel.	
 News of Europe stepping in to assist its financial sector
helped base metals, the euro and global stock markets recover.
U.S. economic data pointing to an improved outlook for
industrial metal demand also provided support.	
 Brent faces resistance at $103.24 per barrel, a break above
which will trigger a further rebound towards $105.79, said
Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 Crude stocks dropped 4.68 million barrels to 336.28 million
barrels in the week to Sept. 30, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration said, beating analysts' expectations for a 1.9
million barrel build. 
 Gasoline stocks fell an unexpected 1.14 million barrels,
while distillates slipped 744,00 barrels, the EIA said. 
 ""What the market is looking at is inventory,"" Barratt said.	
 
 OIL OUTPUT 
 Italian oil major Eni's largest oilfield in Libya, known as
Elephant, may be in ruins, its operations manager Mustafa
Abougfeefa said in an interview. The oil field pumped 130,000
barrel per day before the war. 
 ""We cannot promise the field will start producing before the
end of the year. Gaddafi's militia destroyed everything,""
Abougfeefa said. 
 Global oil prices below $90 a barrel would be difficult to
accept, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister for energy Hussain
al-Shahristani told Reuters on Wednesday, in a sign a slide in
prices is starting to worry some members of oil cartel the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

 Shahristani added that he saw no need for OPEC to review its
crude output at its next meeting in December and no reason now
to trim production. 
 ""We will start to see OPEC reverse their production
increases when Libyan oil slowly start to come on track,"" said
Barratt of Commodity Broking Services. 
 Still, volatility in oil prices will remain as investors
take positions based on the economic outlook for the western
hemisphere, analysts said.	
 U.S. initial jobless claims later on Thursday will be the
next clue on how the world's largest economy is doing. The
market will also focus on non-farm payrolls data due on Friday.

 SINGAPORE, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Gold ticked up in volatile
trade on Thursday, boosted by a steadier euro, gains in
equities, purchases from jewellers, and hopes that Europe's
moves to prop up its ailing banking sector.
 Investors will turn their attention to a policy meeting of
the European Central Bank, when President Jean-Claude Trichet is
likely to prepare the ground for a pre-Christmas interest rate
cut and offer banks further protection against the euro zone's
worsening debt crisis. 
 Gold added $7.39 to $1,647.79 an ounce by 0611 GMT
after falling to a low around $1,634 an ounce. It had gained 1
percent on Wednesday on rallies in equities and commodities.

 ""There's a little bit of (physical) buying. But if the
market continues moving up, then of course the demand will be a
bit less. The market is very choppy and thin,"" said Ronald
Leung, director of Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.	
 ""Everybody is expecting Europe to make a decision today, a
big step to solve the Greek problem."" 
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday Berlin was
ready to recapitalise its banks if needed following an agreement
by European finance ministers to safeguard banks in the face of
mounting concerns about a Greek default. 
 U.S. gold  rose $8.5 an ounce to $1,650.1 an ounce.	
 
 
 
 Bullion rallied to a lifetime high around $1,920 in early
September after the euro tumbled on doubts over Europe's ability
to solve its debt crisis, but the metal then plunged to a
two-month low around $1,534 last week as investors cashed in to
cover losses in equities. 
 Shares in Asia tracked global stocks higher on Thursday
after a recovery across a broad range of assets on optimism over
Europe's efforts to aid the region's financial sector and U.S.
data suggesting the economy could avoid recession. 
 The euro was steady after Germany said it would help
its own banks if necessary and opened the possibility of using a
regional bailout fund to strengthen the euro zone banking
system. 
 Friday's U.S non-farm payrolls data will also be watched by
investors, who expected good numbers to prompt a rally in risk
assets. 
 ""It seems that short-term, gold will still be within a range
of above $1,600 but below $1,700. It's struggling to find some
direction,"" said a dealer in Singapore.	
 ""The U.S. non-farm payrolls data will be an important one
that we will be looking at to ascertain the state of the U.S.
economy. Myself, I am looking at it from the technical point of
view because the uptrend for gold remains intact."" 
 Nonfarm employment probably rose 60,000 as striking Verizon
Communications workers return to payrolls, according to a
Reuters survey, after being flat in August. 
 Steady buying by jewellers and investors kept premiums
steady at $3 an ounce to the spot London prices in Hong Kong,
and at $2 in Singapore -- their highest since at least February.

 London Metal Exchange copper rose for a second day on
Thursday as Europe's steps to help its financial sector and U.S.
economic data point to an improved outlook for industrial metal
demand. 
 Brent crude held above $102 after surging in the previous
session as pessimism about weaker demand was outweighed by a
surprise drawdown of U.S. inventories and concerns that Libya's
largest oilfield could be damaged. ]

 By Frank Tang and Jan Harvey
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Gold rose 1 percent in
thin, choppy trade on Wednesday, fueled by a risk rally in
commodities and equities, but traders said the metal's
correlation with volatile stocks could trigger more selling.
 Bullion's afternoon gains were fueled by a rally on Wall
Street and a slump in the dollar on signs that European leaders
were racing to shore up the banking sector, seeking to draw a
line under the debt crisis that has rattled marktes.
 Mediocre U.S. service-sector and private-employment data
that followed grim figures on the euro zone's services sector
contributed to choppy trade as investors debated whether
bullion was a shelter from turmoil or a speculative bet.
 ""It's starting to look like gold has finally found some
stability as the stock markets around the world have stopped
tanking, but that can evaporate in five minutes,"" said Frank
McGhee, a head trader at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC.
 Spot gold  was up 1 percent at $1,636.79 an ounce by
3:19 p.m. EDT (1919 GMT), off a low of under $1,600.
 On Tuesday, bullion fell as much as 3 percent on fears of a
potential Greek default and a bleak assessment of the U.S.
economy from the Federal Reserve, extending two months of
whipsaw trade that has rattled investors.
 The correlation between gold and the S&P 500 has been
erratic throughout the year. The 25-day log-based correlation
was a negative 0.3, suggesting a weak inverse link between
bullion and equities. (Graphic: http://r.reuters.com/sef34s)
 ""When people saw gold's correlation with equities go from
inverse to positive, there was more fear that maybe gold has
become too frothy in the near term,"" said Adam Klopfenstein,
senior market strategist of futures broker MF Global.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$25.60 at $1,641.60 an ounce.
 COMEX futures volume almost halved the norm, as traders
braced for more volatility after gold's sharp pullback from a
record above $1,920 an ounce set in September.
 Gold's rally was also triggered by broad gains in
commodities led by solid gains in crude oil and grains.
 ""A good portion of gold's gains today was in line with the
fact that the dollar was under pressure. We are back to the
more traditional dollar weakened, commodities positive
relationship,"" said David Meger, director of metals trading at
futures broker Vision Financial Markets.
 FURTHER FUND LIQUIDATION POSSIBLE
 Independent investor Dennis Gartman said gold's drop on
Tuesday below $1,600 an ounce had severely damaged investor
psychology.
 ""We fear that all of the liquidation has not run its
course. We fear that one or two or more large hedge funds have
yet to be forced from their gold positions,"" Gartman said.
 Even though bullion had dropped as much as 20 percent from
its record, gold-backed exchange-traded funds have not seen
significant outflows, suggesting ETF investors have played no
significant role in the slump, Commerzbank said in a note.
 The dollar's decline for a second straight day due to
optimism about a potential solution to end the European debt
crisis also boosted gold.
 Frank Holmes, chief investment officer of U.S. Global
Investors, said gold is due a rally after a healthy correction
largely driven by a resurgent dollar.
 Silver  was up 1.1 percent at $30.24, after having
fallen as much as 5 percent to a low of $28.40 an ounce.
 Spot platinum  rose 1.3 percent to $1,482.99 an
ounce, while palladium  gained 3.5 percent to $568.97 an
ounce.

 NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Oil rose 2 percent on
Wednesday, snapping a three-day losing streak after government
data showed big drops in U.S. inventories and hopes
authorities are moving forward to prop up Europe's ailing
banking sector.
 While demand in top consumer the United States remained
weak, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration
showed a steep drop in imports last week helped drive crude
inventories to the lowest level since January. Stockpiles of
refined products also fell.
 The report added to the bullish tone carried over from
European trading hours, when crude found support after European
finance ministers agreed to examine a way to beef up banks'
balance sheets and prevent a full-blown financial crisis.

 By Simon Falush and Zaida Espana	
 LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Brent crude bounced back above
$102 on Wednesday, snapping a three-day losing streak, propped
up by an agreement by European finance ministers to safeguard
their banks and a larger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude
stocks.	
 Brent crude  rose $2.31 to $102.10 a barrel by 1510
GMT, after touching a peak of $102.56. 
 The contract fell on Tuesday into bear market territory,
defined as a 20 percent drop from recent highs, after closing at
$99.79 a barrel -- its lowest settlement since February. 
 U.S. crude  was up $2.80 at $78.47 a barrel, after
reaching an intraday high of $78.78.	
 Hopes that the IMF, EU and the European Central Bank will
release a vital tranche of aid to Greece lifted investors
spirits, while the larger-than-expected draw in weekly U.S.
crude stockpiles also helped. 
 Data from the Department of Energy's Energy Information
Agency showed that inventories fell by 4.68 million barrels to
336.28 million barrels, in line with data from the American
Petroleum Group on Tuesday, but well below a build of 1.9
million barrels forecast by analysts. 
 ""We are seeing the results of shut refining capacity on the
East Coast, weak margins outside of light sweet (Cushing is
down 831,000 barrels) and lack of interest in bringing imports
of unnecessary crude,"" Carl Larry, director of derivatives and
research at Blue Ocean Brokerage in New York said.	
 ""This may lead us back to a bullish scenario if we can get a
sign of economic recovery or even stability.""	
 Despite a supportive supply environment, analysts remained
downbeat on the prospects for oil and other commodity prices as
anxiety about the state of euro zone finances and the outlook
for demand prevailed.	
 ""I'm not sure this is the end of the bear trend, this is a
short term bounce, but until there is actual doing as well as
comments, we won't see a sustainable recovery,"" said Andy
Sommer, analyst at EGL in Dietikon, Switzerland.	
 U.S. service sector activity growth slowed in September, but
other data on Wednesday showed private employment up modestly
for the month, suggesting that overall the economic recovery is
sluggish.

 
 OPEC EYES PRICES	
 Global oil prices below $90 a barrel would be difficult to
accept, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister for energy told Reuters on
Wednesday, in a sign that the slide in prices was starting to
worry some OPEC members. 
 Iraq's Hussain al-Shahristani also told Reuters he saw no
need for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
to review its crude output at its next meeting and no reason at
the current time to trim production.	
 An official from Iran raised the possibility of OPEC holding
an emergency meeting, with its OPEC governor saying it would be
a ""natural"" thing to do if prices continue to fall.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Wednesday
after dipping below $1,600 an ounce as stock markets appeared
to have found their footing, but traders said the metal's
correlation with volatile equities could trigger more selling.
 Mediocre U.S. service-sector and private-employment data
followed grim figures on the euro zone's services sector,
contributing to a choppy session as investors deliberated over
whether bullion is a shelter from turmoil or a speculative
trade that will rise with riskier assets.
 Ultimately the mildly upbeat mood in stock markets -- which
recovered after European officials agreed to shore up euro zone
banks against the region's debt crisis -- lifted bullion.
 ""It's starting to look like gold has finally found some
stability as the stock markets around the world have stopped
tanking, but that can evaporate in five minutes,"" said Frank
McGhee, a head trader at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC.
 Spot gold  was up 0.5 percent at $1,628.10 an ounce
by 12:06 p.m. EDT (1606 GMT), off a low of under $1,600.
 On Tuesday, bullion fell as much as 3 percent on fears of a
potential Greek default and a bleak assessment of the U.S.
economy from the Federal Reserve.
 ""When people saw gold's correlation with equities go from

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 5 (Reuters) - U.S. gold futures gained 1
percent to above $1,630 an ounce on Wednesday, driven by a
return to bargain hunting after prices dropped the previous day,
while purchases from jewellers helped the precious metal shrug
off a volatile euro.	
 But another round of selling in equities could cap gains,
as bullion's erratic behaviour in recent weeks suggested the
metal was unsure about its role in the financial market despite
lingering worries about the debt crisis in Europe.	
 Gold rallied to a lifetime high around $1,920 in early
September after the euro tumbled on doubts over Europe's ability
to solve the crisis, but it then plunged to a two-month low
around $1,534 last week as investors cashed in the metal to
cover losses in equities. 
 ""It can't make up its mind mainly because investors, the
people who are actually doing the buying and selling, haven't
also made up their minds whether gold is treated as a safe haven
and, therefore, should follow that status,"" said Song Seng Wun,
a regional economist at CIMB Research in Singapore. 
 ""At this moment, it looks like some are still debating
whether safe haven, in the most current environment, is just
essentially the U.S. dollar and (whether) U.S treasuries include
or exclude gold."" 
 U.S. gold  added $12.1 an ounce to $1,628,1 by 0626
GMT, after rising as high as $1,636.50 ounce on early gains in
the euro. Spot gold rose $7.77 an ounce to $1,627.69 an
ounce.	
 
 Stocks in Asia trimmed earlier gains as investors were
sceptical about whether European leaders are going far enough in
their efforts to stop the region's sovereign debt woes from
sparking a full-blown banking crisis. 
 The euro faltered as macro funds and Tokyo exporters piled
pressure on it by taking profits after an overnight rally, but
charts suggested recent heavy selling could ease for now. 
 European finance ministers agreed on Tuesday to safeguard
their banks as doubts grew about whether a planned second
bailout package for debt-laden Greece would go ahead.

 Light physical buying kept premiums steady at $2 an ounce to
spot London prices in Singapore, the highest since February.
Markets in Hong Kong were closed for a holiday. 
 ""I think supply is going to be tight until the end of
October. It's difficult to generate enough stocks without any
selling back from the market,"" said a physical dealer in
Singapore.	
 ""Well, I think if the price stays at this level, then the
demand will be around until the end of this year."" 
 Physical demand has picked up across Asia after recent
declines in gold prices, leading to tight supply of gold bars in
Singapore and Hong Kong.	
 In other markets, copper rose more than 1 percent after
comments by the U.S. Federal Reserve that it was ready to take
more steps to help a struggling U.S. economy helped prices
recover from a five-day slide. 
 Brent crude rose above $101 on Wednesday, snapping a
three-day losing streak, after the Federal Reserve promised to
launch more measures to help the fragile U.S. economy and
European finance ministers agreed to safeguard their banks.

 By Matthew Robinson
 NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose 3 percent on
Wednesday to snap a three-day losing streak, lifted by
government data showing big drops in U.S. inventories and by
signs authorities were moving forward to prop up Europe's
ailing banking sector.
 While demand in top consumer the United States remained
weak, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration
showed a steep drop in imports last week helped drive crude
inventories to their lowest since January. Stockpiles of
refined products also fell. [EIA/S]
 ""The EIA reported better-than-expected numbers,
particularly the crude draw,"" said Joe Posillico, broker for
MF Global in New York.
 ""The oil markets were already up a lot, moving with the
stock market on the ISM services sector data, when the EIA data
came in.""
 Oil and other commodities, as well as stocks, also found
support from news European finance ministers agreed to examine
a way to beef up banks' balance sheets and prevent a full-blown
financial crisis. [ID:nL5E7L51RH] [ID:nL3E7L42VF]
 U.S. data confirmed the economy was narrowly avoiding
another recession and globally growth in both the manufacturing
and services sector accelerated slightly last month according
to JPMorgan's Global All-Industry Output index.
 Brent crude  traded up $2.94 to settle at $102.73 a
barrel, after settling down more than 20 percent from its 2011
high on Tuesday, which traditionally signals a bear market.
 U.S. crude prices  rose even more, gaining $4.01, or
more than 5 percent, to settle at $79.68 a barrel and narrowing
the premium of Brent to U.S. oil to $23 a barrel.
 Brent trading volumes, which have been outpacing those on
the New York Mercantile Exchange's over the past two weeks, hit
645,000 contracts in late afternoon in New York, nearly 19
percent above the 30-day average.
 U.S. crude volumes hit 584,000 lots, nearly 9 percent below
the 30-day average.
 Despite Wednesday's gains, some analysts remained downbeat
on the prospects for oil and other commodity prices with
anxiety about the state of euro zone finances and the outlook
for fuel demand.
 Data showed the euro zone's services sector shrank for the
first time in two years in September as new orders dried up,
stoking fears that the region's economy could be heading back
into recession. [ID:nN1E7940PR]
 ""I'm not sure this is the end of the bear trend, this is a
short term bounce, but until there is actual doing as well as
comments, we won't see a sustainable recovery,"" said Andy
Sommer, analyst at EGL in Dietikon, Switzerland.
 OPEC
 Further pressure on Brent has come as Libya, a key supplier
to Europe, attempts to restart production forced offline by
months of civil war.
 However, Italian oil major Eni  said on Wednesday
it fears its largest oilfield in the OPEC nation, known as
Elephant, may be in ruins, which could dash hopes of a speedy
return of supplies. [ID:nL5E7L54LE]
 The slide in prices has raised concerns among some oil
producing nations. An Iranian oil official told a local
newspaper OPEC could hold an emergency meeting ahead of its
regularly scheduled reunion in December if prices continue to
fall. [ID:nL5E7L51E1]
 Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister for energy told Reuters that a
drop in global oil prices below $90 a barrel would be
""difficult to accept"", although he saw no need for an
extraordinary meeting. [ID:nL5E7L51GW]

vs. risk assets)
 By Frank Tang and Jan Harvey
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Gold tumbled as much as
3 percent on Tuesday, resuming its month-long rout on fears of
a potential Greek default and a bleak assessment of the U.S.
economy from the Federal Reserves.
 The safe-haven buying that has aided gold's three-year
rally was absent throughout, as three days of gains were wiped
away. But nor did bullion trade consistently with risk
assets,underscoring confusion about its role in financial
markets.
 Gold sank early with European stocks on fears that the
region's sovereign debt problems would take a toll on it banks.
Gold then deepened losses mid-morning even as U.S. stocks
pulled off their lows. But it was back in sync at the close, as
Wall Street indices rallied to a last-minute 2 percent gain.
 Even so, with gold's trading volume still about 25 percent
below the norm, few traders were prepared to bet that two
months of extraordinary volatility were over.
 ""Yesterday on that good rally the volume wasn't there. It
seems the volume only comes into play when the gold is sold
off,"" COMEX gold options floor trader Jonathan Jossen said.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled down
$41.70 at $1,616 an ounce.
 Spot gold  fell as far as $1,595 an ounce, but were
later trading down 2.2 percent $1,620 an ounce by 4:32 p.m EDT
(2032 GMT), well off an overnight session high of $1,678.
 Jossen said big players had been buying put options in the
last several sessions to protect their downside risk.
 The crisis-stricken euro zone was in focus early in the
day, as French-Belgian municipal lender Dexia SA 
became the first European bank to have to be bailed out due to
the sovereign debt crisis, concentrating minds on the potential
for an escallating banking sector crisis. [ID:nL5E7L419D]
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke innitially gave
markets a small shot in the arm with a firmer indication that
the bank was prepared to take further steps to prevent a
double-dip recession, but traders later focused on his bleak
assessment that the economy was ""close to faltering"".
 S&P 500 futures <.SPX> vacilated through the day, at one
point entering bear territory marked by a more than 20 percent
slide from its peak. But it zoomed higher at the close, ending
up 2 percent as investors rushed in to buy beaten-down shares.
 Gold had rallied as much as 6 percent in recent sessions,
but remained more than 15 percent below its record of $1,920.30
an ounce set in early September.
 SOME GOLD MINERS HEDGE, OUTLOOK BRIGHT
 Gold has fallen more than 15 percent from its record above
$1,900 an ounce in early September. While some traders viewed
the pull-back as a necessary correction from an accelerating
rally, bullion is struggling to find a floor after months of
extreme volatility and a growing link with risky assets.
 While speculators in the COMEX gold futures have largely
bailed out, pulling open interest to near a two-year low,
investors in exchange-traded funds continued to hold relatively
firm and have shown no sign of any large outflows.
 In the mining sector, gold producers in the second quarter
reported their first consecutive quarterly net hedging in 10
years, driven by new hedges by small producers, metals
consultancy Thomson Reuters GFMS and French bank Societe
Generale said. [ID:nN1E79315I] (Graphic:
http://r.reuters.com/ruw24s )
 Goldman Sachs reiterated its 12-month gold price target of
$1,860 an ounce, while cutting its 2012 forecasts for oil and
copper prices. [ID:nL3E7L4169]
 The U.S. bank said in a note that gold prices would
continue to be driven by low U.S. real interest rates due to a
weakened economic outlook.
 Credit Suisse raised its 2012 gold price forecast to $1,850
an ounce, saying gold, as a clear beneficiary of the
uncertainty and dislocations in financial markets, has further
upside with the crises set to continue. [ID:nL3E7L403A]
 Silver  fell 3.7 percent to $29.23 an ounce. Platinum
 was down 3.2 percent at $1,448.99 an ounce, while
palladium  was down 6.3 percent at $543.47.
 Platinum widened its discount to gold to nearly $200 an
ounce in earlier trade, an unprecedented level. Platinum prices
were hurt by a 29 percent hike in U.S. futures margins.

 NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Oil fell 2 percent on Tuesday,
dragged down by concerns Europe's debt problems would hurt
banks and add further pressure to the global economy.

 ""With stocks taking a turn into bear market territory,
there are concerns that this signals a turn into recession, and
that is not good for oil demand.""

 LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Brent crude futures dipped below
$100 a barrel on Tuesday, as worries that a Greek debt default
could spread across the banking system and threaten the global
economy showed no signs of abating.	
 Brent crude for November delivery  was trading $2.16
lower at $99.55 by 1223 GMT, having hit an intraday low of
$99.32 a barrel earlier in the session. Brent last fell under
$100 on Aug. 9. 
 U.S. crude futures  fell $2.40 to $75.21 a barrel
after reaching an intraday low of $74.95, levels not seen since
late September 2010.	
 A Brent price forecast downgrade from typically bullish
commodity forecaster Goldman Sachs sounded another note of
caution for investors. The investment bank cut its 2012 Brent
crude forecast to $120 a barrel from $130 a barrel, joining a
growing chorus of increasingly bearish analysts. 
 ""The market continues to focus on the risk of a new economic
recession, triggered by the stress on the European financial and
banking system,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said, noting that the
financial stress in Europe will continue to present headwinds to
economic and oil demand growth next year.	
 Stock markets hit a fresh 15-month low on Tuesday, while the
euro and base metals tumbled this week on mounting worries the
debt crisis in Greece will unleash a global recession.	
 Concern about Greece's ability to avert a default, as
negotiations about a second bailout inched ahead, spooked equity
markets after the country admitted it would miss its deficit
targets. 
 ""If our economists are correct in their bearishness, then
the macro gloom will eventually make itself felt in the oil
markets via weak product demand and low refining margins that
undermine crude demand and drive spreads lower,"" Citigroup oil
analysts said in a note to clients. 
 Tony Nunan, a Tokyo-based risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp.,
said: ""I think more people are getting more afraid,"" 
 ""There's a concern that there will be a mini financial
crisis. If they don't do it properly, it will cause some banks
in Europe to fail, and there will be a domino effect,"" he said,
referring to European leaders' efforts to resolve Greece's
financial crisis.	
 The deepening crisis has forced investors to seek safe
havens such as gold and Treasuries, which has helped push the
U.S. dollar to its highest in more than eight months against a
basket of major currencies. 
 A stronger dollar can pressure dollar-denominated
commodities prices by making them more expensive for consumers

 By Frank Tang and Jan Harvey
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Gold fell more than 2
percent on Tuesday, abruptly halting its three-day rally on
fears about a Greek default and after Federal Reserve Chairman
said the central bank might take further steps to support the
U.S. economy.
 Renewed safe-haven buying of bullion evaporated the day
after its biggest daily gain in a month. The metal fell early
in a broad financial market decline on worries about a
fettering European debt crisis.
 Gold kept dropping even as U.S. stock markets turned
positive after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank
was ready to take further steps to prevent a double-dip
recession.
 Bernanke said Fed policy makers were ""prepared to take
further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic
recovery in a context of price stability.""
 ""Yesterday on that good rally the volume wasn't there. It
seems the volume only comes into play when the gold is sold
off,"" said COMEX gold options floor trader Jonathan Jossen.
 Spot gold  was down 2.1 percent at $1,620.89 an ounce
by 12:15 p.m. EDT (1615 GMT), off a session high of $1,678.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  were down
$34.10 at $1,622.90 an ounce.
 Jossen said big players have been buying put options in the
last several sessions to protect their downside risk.
 Gold had rallied as much as 6 percent in recent sessions,
but remained more than 15 percent below its record of $1,920.30
an ounce set in early September.
 Silver  was down 1.7 percent at $29.81 an ounce.
Platinum  was down 2 percent at $1,467.74 an ounce, while
palladium  was down 2.9 percent at $563.47.

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Gold gained 1 percent on
Tuesday, rising for a fourth day, as investors dumped equities
and turned to bullion on growing fears that a Greek default
could trigger another global recession. 
 As safe-haven buying lifted gold prices, European stock
index futures slipped on doubts over Greece's ability to avoid
default, copper fell for a fifth day and Brent crude fell more
than a dollar to below $101 a barrel. 
 Credit Suisse raised its 2012 gold price forecast to $1,850
from its prior forecast of $1,540, saying the clear beneficiary
of the uncertainty and dislocations in financial markets has
further upside with the crises set to continue. 
 Spot gold rose $16.79 to $1,673.19 an ounce by 0636
-- well below a lifetime high around $1,920 struck in early
September.	
 ""The long-term uptrend for gold remains intact and we remain
bullish. Gold could climb to about $2,000 an ounce in 2012. Safe
haven bids could slowly return as prices stabilise,"" said Ong Yi
Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore	
 ""A sustained breach of $1,700 is needed for gold to resume
its upward ascent. After the sell-off in gold earlier, this has
reduced some of the speculative positions.""	
 U.S. gold futures  added $18 to $1,675.7 an ounce.	
 
 Euro zone finance ministers are reviewing the size of the
private sector's involvement in a second international bailout
package for Greece, which could undermine the aid programme and
hasten the threat of a Greek default. 
 The euro fell to as low as $1.3163 early on Tuesday
before stepping back to around $1.3207, up slightly on
short-covering from $1.3170 in late U.S. trade. 
 The physical market paused for breath after a buzz of
activity in the past week. Premiums for gold bars were steady at
$2 an ounce to spot London prices in Singapore, the highest
since February, after a recent correction ignited a rush in
buying from jewellers and speculators.	
 Gold plunged to a two-month low around $1,534 an ounce in
late September.	
 ""I can finally take a breath after a few weeks of hectic
trading. We saw some selling from Thailand and the Middle East
but the market is otherwise quiet,"" said a physical dealer in
Singapore. 
 In other precious metals, silver and palladium
firmed, while platinum tracked equities lower despite
encouraging auto sales in the United States. 
 Platinum and palladium are used in auto catalysts. 
 U.S. auto sales rose almost 10 percent in September,
allaying concerns of a double-dip recession as major automakers
forecast stronger sales through the remainder of the year.

 Still battling to rebound from the effects of the March
earthquake in Japan, Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor
Co posted sales declines of almost 18 percent and 8
percent.

 By Seng Li Peng and Randy Fabi	
 SINGAPORE, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Brent crude slipped below $101
on Tuesday, squeezed by growing fears that a Greek debt default
could spread across the banking system and threaten the global
economy. 
 Goldman Sachs cut its 2012 Brent crude forecast to $120 a
barrel from $130 a barrel and forecast the spread between Brent
and the U.S. benchmark to narrow to $16, $13 and $6.50 in favour
of Brent in the next three, six and 12 months. 
 Stock markets, the euro and base metals have tumbled this
week on rising concerns the debt crisis in Greece could spread
to other countries and unleash a global recession. Brent may
come under further pressure as Libyan output may get restored
faster than expected.	
 ""I think more people are getting more afraid,"" said Tony
Nunan, a Tokyo-based risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp. 
 ""There's a concern that there will be a mini-financial
crisis. If they don't do it properly, it will cause some banks
in Europe to fail, and there will be a domino effect,"" he said,
referring to European leaders' efforts to resolve Greece's
financial crisis. 
 Qatar did not see a need for oil cartel OPEC to meet before
its next scheduled gathering in December, although it is closely
watching the impact on oil demand of slowing economic growth and
the debt crisis in Europe, Energy Minister Mohammed al-Sada told
reporters in Tokyo. 
 Brent crude for November delivery  fell 46 cents to
$101.25 by 0701 GMT, after hitting an intraday low of around
$100.50 a barrel, which was within striking distance of an
eight-week low. 
 U.S. crude  fell 62 cents to $76.99 a barrel after
reaching an intraday low of $75.92.	
 ""Brent crude continues to feel the weight of
economic concerns as it appears that Greece will miss deficit
targets and worries about the health of European banks remain,""
J.P. Morgan said in a research note.	
 Libya will start pumping crude at two major oilfields in
about two weeks, doubling production to 700,000 barrels a day by
year-end, the country's head of National Oil Corp Nouri Berouin
said in an interview with Reuters. 
 While the resumption in operations at
Repsol-operated
Sharara field and Eni part-owned Elephant
will help boost output, Berouin said Libya's biggest oil
terminal at Es-Sider may take more than a year to be fully
repaired. 
 A bearish target at $99 per barrel remains intact
for Brent oil, said Wang Tao, a Reuters market analyst for
commodities and energy, while U.S. oil faces a support zone of
$75.68-$75.71, and may rebound to $78 per barrel.

 
 
 
 MISSING FISCAL TARGET	
 Despite deeper cost-cutting measures, Greece admitted it
would miss its fiscal deficit target this year, sparking fresh
doubts over a planned second international bailout.

 The crisis has forced investors to seek safe havens such as
gold and Treasuries, which has helped push the U.S. dollar to
its highest in more than eight months against a basket of major
currencies. 
 A stronger dollar can pressure dollar-denominated
commodities prices by making them more expensive to consumers
using other currencies.	
 
 OMINOUS SIGNS	
 While oil supply and demand appear largely balanced,
United Arab Emirates OPEC governor Ali Obaid Al-Yabhouni has
said there were ""ominous clouds on the horizon"" for demand
because of global economic problems. 
 U.S. commercial crude stockpiles are expected to have risen
for a second week as imports continued to increase, a
preliminary Reuters poll of analysts found on Monday. 
 Industry group the American Petroleum Institute will release
its weekly inventory report at 2030 GMT. The Energy Information
Administration will issue its own stocks data on Wednesday.	
 The impact of a fire at Royal Dutch Shell's 
Singapore refinery has extended into the crude and naphtha
markets, strengthening price spreads, traders said.

 The closure of Shell's 500,000 barrel-per-day refinery, its
largest in the world, has forced the oil major to cancel the
lifting of 4 million barrels of crude, to wind down its
petrochemical complex and to declare force majeure on some of
its deals, mostly involving distillates.

 NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Oil fell on Monday as fears
that Greece cannot avoid default and a stronger dollar
pressured Brent to the lowest settlement in 7-1/2 months and
U.S. crude to its lowest close in 12 months.
 Concerns that Greek's debt crisis would spread to Europe's
banks and beyond pressured equities and oil prices even after
reports showing U.S. factory activity expanded at a faster pace
than expected in September and construction spending rebounded
in August provided a brief lift. [ID:nN1E7920NX]
 ""Looks like the negativity from late last week and worries
that global demand for oil will be hit by another recession
outweighed the better-than-expected data,"" said Gene McGillian,

 By Jan Harvey	
 LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Palladium prices fell to their
lowest in nearly a year on Monday as concerns over the outlook
for global car demand, against a backdrop of weak euro zone and
U.S. growth, curbed demand expectations.	
 Spot palladium was down 1.7 percent at $599.72 an
ounce at 1002 GMT, having touched a low of $596.90. That was its
lowest price since Oct. 25 last year.	
 Palladium, like its sister metal platinum, is primarily used
in catalytic converters, and has struggled to maintain traction
this year after 2010's sharp price rise as concerns over the
automotive sector persist.	
 Data from carmakers' associations showed Japanese, French
and Spanish auto sales declined last month, while figures due
out later are expected to show only a modest rise in U.S. car
sales. 
 As the most industrial of the four main precious metals, it
has also failed to take much support from investment demand for
the metals as a store of value, which has lifted gold to record
highs, and to a lesser extent supported silver and platinum.	
 Palladium has underperformed all three so far this year with
a 25 percent loss, against a 15 percent drop in platinum prices,
a 16 percent rise in gold, and a flat silver price.	
 Nonetheless, analysts say palladium's cost of production
points to a longer-term floor in prices at around $600 an ounce,
while traders say dips from current levels will be buying
opportunities.	
 ""In the short (term), everybody is worried about the lower
demand to come,"" said one European platinum group metals trader.
""In the long term, it will recover, but those short term worries
are my opportunities.""	
 ""The fundamentals are still good,"" the trader added.

 By Frank Tang and Amanda Cooper
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Gold rose 1.6 percent on
Monday, its biggest one-day gain in a month, as bullion resumed
its role as a haven from turmoil following its worst monthly
loss since the financial crisis in 2008.
 Bullion held onto early gains throughout the session,
buoyed by fears that Greece would fail to avoid a default on
its debt and the effect that may have on European banks.
Investors also returned to bullion after an 11 percent slump
last month corrected a rally that some said had gone too far,
too fast.
 Better-than-expected manufacturing data failed to halt
another nearly 3 percent slide on Wall Street, which provided
additional support for bullion. Gold remains one of the
best-performing assets, with 12 straight quarters of gains.
 ""Expect gold to go higher on concerns about the global
economy, currencies and loss of value. Safe-haven asset buying
will continue until there is something better for investors to
move into,"" said Miguel Perez-Santalla, vice president of sales
of Heraeus Precious Metals Management.
 The flight to quality was also evident in the U.S. dollar,
which rallied more than 1 percent, and Treasuries, while gold
also benefited from improving physical demand.
 Spot gold  was up 1.6 percent at $1,649.30 an ounce
by 3:00 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT). The metal posted its first
three-day winning streak in a month.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$35.40 at $1,657.70 an ounce. Markets are closed in No. 2 gold
consumer China for a public holiday.
 Trading volume was half of its 30-day average, suggesting
the metal's rally could easily run out of steam.
 Gold's gain was well off its record of above $1,920 an
ounce set in early September, after being hit by a sharp margin
increase and heavy bouts of liquidation by hedge funds.
 CME Group Inc , the biggest operator of U.S. futures
exchanges, said it will more than double the amount of physical
gold it can accept from its clearing members as collateral to
$500 million from $200 million. [ID:nN1E7921CR]
 PHYSICAL DEMAND BOOMS
 Bullion's 20 percent fall from that record high has tempted
physical consumers of the metal back into the market.
 ""We have the start of a new quarter, and gold prices
typically respond very well toward the end of the year because
of seasonal demand. That has attracted a lot of investors
today,"" said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at
futures broker MF Global.
 Physical demand often peaks in the fourth quarter due to
the Indian wedding season and Christmas, both of which are
traditionally major gold buying events.
 Demand from key gold-buying regions has picked up, pushing
Asian premiums to their highest since the start of the year.
 Wealthy individuals should buy gold as it has become an
attractive investment following last month's sharp reversal,
private bankers in Asia said on Monday.
 ""Gold at $2,000 is absolutely, potentially on the uptrack,
despite the sell-off. That is sort of the immediate target,""
Marcel Kreis, Credit Suisse's head of private banking for
Asia-Pacific, told the Reuters Wealth Management Summit in
Singapore. [ID:nL3E7L322K]
 Silver  was up 1.8 percent at $30.44 an ounce, having
earlier hit $31.38. It fell by nearly 28 percent in September,
its biggest one-month drop since the early 1980s.
 Despite encouraging sales improvement for major U.S.
automakers, platinum group metals -- mainly used as an auto
catalytic converter -- fell broadly with a disappointing
economic outlook. [ID:nN1E7920NK]
 While General Motors Co  posted a 20 percent gain in
September sales, auto sales in Europe fell to the lowest level
in years. [ID:nL5E7L31MG]
 Platinum  fell 1.9 percent to $1,495.26 an ounce,
while palladium  dropped 3.9 percent to near one-year
lows at $585.99.

 SINGAPORE, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Gold rose more than 1 percent
on Monday as falling equities and lingering worries about a debt
crisis in Europe drew investors to the precious metal, which
posted its biggest quarterly rise this year, but a firm U.S.
dollar could still cap gains.	
 Stocks slipped and the euro tumbled on anxiety the region's
debt crisis would dampen global growth after the Greek
government said it would miss a deficit target set just months
ago in a massive bailout package. 
 Spot gold added $19.14 an ounce to $1,642.09 by 0702
GMT. Gold had posted a quarterly gain of 8 percent -- its
biggest this year, despite a drop of 11 percent for September,
its largely monthly decline in three years. 
""Gold rises despite a firmer U.S. dollar ... perhaps gold's
appeal as a safe haven asset has been reinstated. Also, the
market appears to be buying on the dip,"" said Natalie Robertson,
a commodities strategist at ANZ. 
 ""Now there appears to be strong buying interest towards the
$1,500 an ounce level."" 
 U.S. gold  rose $26.6 to $1,648.9 an ounce.	
 Gold jumped to a lifetime high around $1,920 an ounce in
early September after the euro fell against the dollar on
growing doubts about Europe's ability to solve its debt crisis. 
 European Central Bank member Christian Noyer said on Monday
it was unrealistic to expect an increase in Europe's bailout
fund beyond that agreed in July, but he was open to schemes that
would allow leveraging to expand capacity. 
 
 
 
 Jitters over the spiralling European debt crisis, European
banks' exposure to sovereign debt and a slowing global economy
caused investors to cut their bets on risky assets in the
July-September quarter, sending the euro down almost 10 cents
versus the dollar over the period. 
 In the physical market, tight supply persisted after a
recent drop in bullion prices triggered aggressive buying across
Asia. 
 ""Basically people are trying to fulfil the orders. I don't
have much stock. There's still some buying around and also
advance booking,"" said a physical dealer in Singapore. 
 Premiums for gold bars were steady at $2 an ounce to spot
London prices in Singapore. Demand from top consumer India is
also picking up during the wedding season, when gold jewellery
is an essential part of the dowry basket.	
 In India, retail gold demand traditionally gains pace from
the month of August, when the festival and wedding seasons
start, culminating with Diwali, the Hindu festival of light.

 ""Precious metals are expected to trade higher this week and
throughout this month as they recover from the late-Sept
selloff. The gold market could advance toward the $1,675-$1,700
range while silver trades toward $33.00,"" said precious metals
and energy analyst at MF Global Tom Pawlicki.	
 ""After a poor showing and high volatility in September,
metals could recover this week due to favourable quarter-end
seasonal patterns, the ongoing uncertainty in Europe, a
developing economic slowdown in China, and from the increased
potential of a double-dip recession in the U.S."" 
 The euro plunged to an eight-month low against the dollar on
Monday and is poised to fall further, with Europe still divided
over the best cure for the debt crisis and with the possibility
of a Greek default looming larger than ever 
 The dollar index hit an eight month high, edging up
0.7 percent to 79.092. 
 Brent crude fell more than a dollar on Monday to below $102
as growing fears of the euro debt crisis spreading to other
parts of the region and dampening global oil demand weighed
heavily on investors.

 By Claire Milhench	
 LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell towards $102 on
Monday after Greece said it would miss its deficit target and as
concerns rose about Franco-Belgian bank Dexia, which pulled down
stocks and the euro, while the dollar strengthened.	
 Brent crude futures  were down 55 cents to $102.21 a
barrel at 1100 GMT after hitting an intraday low of $101.12.
U.S. crude futures  were down 68 cents to $78.52.	
 Investors and traders have been troubled by draft figures
released by Greece on Sunday showing it would miss a deficit
target set just months ago in a massive bailout package. This
suggests the steps taken to avert bankruptcy may not be enough.

 In addition, Belgian and French finance ministers will meet
on Monday to discuss ways to shore up the balance sheet of
Franco-Belgium financial services group Dexia . Dexia
has one of the largest exposures to Greece among non-Greek
banks. 
 The euro and European shares also sold off as investors
mulled the lack of a credible solution to Europe's debt crisis.
.	
 ""Greece said it could not meet its deficit target for the
rescue plan and I think that was a significant input,"" said
Olivier Jakob, oil analyst at Petromatrix. 
 ""There is the possibility that Belgian bank Dexia might need
to go through some sort of nationalisation. The market is still
very jittery about the banks so that could put some pressure on
there.""	
 
 WEAK DEMAND	
 Christophe Barret, global oil analyst at Credit Agricole
CIB, pointed to weak demand figures in the U.S. and Europe, and
the return of Libyan crude to the market as likely to weigh on
oil prices. ""At over $100 a barrel the Brent price is still
pretty high so it should continue to go down,"" he said.	
 United Arab Emirates (UAE) OPEC governor Ali Obaid
Al-Yabhouni also pointed to ""ominous clouds on the horizon"" for
oil demand because of global economic problems. 
 European debt problems and the prospect of weaker demand in
parts of Asia are a big worry for producers, he said.	
 Analysts and traders are now unsure as to where oil will go
next. Christopher Bellew, a trader at Jefferies Bache, said if
Brent dipped below $100 it would probably not stay there for
long as funds would come back in and start buying.	
 But Jakob suggested there was a risk of some selling by
hedge funds this week because last Friday was the final day for
many hedge funds' quarterly redemption notice periods. 
 ""We expect the oil price to remain under pressure
from both the ongoing Eurozone debt crisis and the deteriorating
global economy,"" said Marc Ground, an analyst at Standard Bank.
""Volatility is expected to remain elevated.""
 
 A bearish target at $99 per barrel has been established for
Brent, according to Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.
Jakob said with the support of $80 having been broken for U.S.
crude, $75 will now be targeted for support. 
 Chinese data offered some support to prices as it showed
industrial activity was improving. China's factory activity
picked up in September for a second month in a row and export
orders strengthened. 
 The official Purchasing Managers' Index inched up to 51.2
from August's 50.9, largely in line with a median forecast of
51.3 in a Reuters poll.

five quarters.
 U.S. crude futures fared even worse, posting their weakest

biggest percentage loss since the fourth quarter of 2008. For
the month, it dropped $9.61, or 10.82 percent, the biggest
monthly decline since May 2010. 
 Brent's premium against U.S. crude rose back to $23.56,
after dropping to $21.81 on Thursday. 
 CHINA DATA ADDS TO CLOUDY OUTLOOK
 The day's sell-off began after data showed that China's
manufacturing sector contracted for a third consecutive month
in September, adding to doubts about Europe's ability to solve
its debt crisis.
 That drove investors to sell riskier assets such as
equities and commodities. Trading was volatile on quarter-end
booksquaring, traders said.
 The dollar rose while the euro sank, curbing risk sentiment
across many commodities markets. [USD/] <.DXY>
 A gloomy economic outlook and weak demand in the United
States have dragged markets down this quarter, while the
expected return of oil exports from Libya, cut off by the civil
war, added a bearish spin this month.
 ""Declines in the stock market and the euro prompted much of
today's weakness amidst reduced risk appetite,"" said Jim
Ritterbusch, president at Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena,
Illinois.
 Trading in Brent was more hectic than U.S. crude, reaching
701,000 contracts as of 3:45 p.m. EDT (1945 GMT), which was 33
percent above its 30-day average.
 U.S. crude volume hit nearly 599,000 contracts, down 5.3
percent from its 30-day average.

 Supply from all 12 members of the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries is forecast to average 30.25

 Libya's output has begun to recover after falling to almost
nothing in the civil war, the survey found. The country
exported one small crude cargo on Sept. 25 and is reported to
be sending some oil to refineries.
 ""If the current positive reports from Libya are confirmed,
then domestic production could reach 1.3 million barrels per
day by the end of next year,"" JP Morgan said in a note.
 ""On an annual average, this would lead to exports of around
0.6 mbd of light sweet crude, which together with rising Iraqi
and non-OPEC output could lift supply by around 1.9 million bpd
above today's levels.""

 By Frank Tang and Jan Harvey
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Friday on
lingering worries of a global economic slowdown as the price of
bullion is set to notch its biggest quarterly gain of this year
despite a sharp pullback from its record this month.
 Bullion reasserted its safe-haven status even as the dollar
rose and equities and industrial commodities broadly fell,
after data showed China's manufacturing sector contracted for a
third consecutive month in September.
 The metal, however, is 15 percent below its record of
$1,920 an ounce set early this month, having largely fallen in
tandem with riskier assets. Gold is on track for a 11 percent
drop in September, its largely monthly decline in three years.
 ""I think the correction has run its course. For the first
time in quite some time, we actually bought some gold and
platinum exchange-traded funds today,"" said James Dailey,
portfolio manager of the TEAM Financial Asset Management.
 Spot gold  was up 0.5 percent at $1,621.59 an ounce
by 11:49 a.m. EDT (1549 GMT).
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  were up
$6.90 at $1,624.20 an ounce, with trading volume sharply below
this week's average.
 The metal is poised to rise 8 percent for the quarter, its
biggest quarterly gain this year, as fears that the euro zone
debt crisis is far from resolved underpinned safe-haven bids.
 Extreme volatility this month saw the metal in a near $400
range after hitting a record $1,920.30 an ounce on Sept. 6.
 Though the correction from that high has lifted physical
demand, buyers remain wary of gold after this month's violent
fluctuations.
 Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS Finance, said the
market was struggling within the $1,600 to 1,650 range.
 Silver  was down 0.8 percent at $30.33 an ounce.
Holdings of the largest silver ETF, the iShares Silver Trust
, fell nearly 23 tonnes on Thursday.
 Silver prices have also seen extreme volatility this month,
in line with gold, and are set to end the month 27 percent
lower, and the quarter down 13 percent.
 Spot platinum  was up 0.1 percent at $1,519.24 an
ounce, while spot palladium  was down 0.9 percent at
$610.22 an ounce.

 NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday due
to renewed economic concerns, putting Brent on track for a drop

 By Jane Lee	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Brent crude edged above $104
a barrel on Friday, but remains on track for the biggest
quarterly drop in 15 months on concerns that a slowing global
economy will undercut fuel demand.	
 U.S. jobless benefits claims declined and German lawmakers
approved a euro zone bailout fund with greater powers, easing
some of the worries about developed economies. But Asian stocks
continued a downward march to their worst performance since
October 2008 on fears that Europe's debt crisis will infect the
world.	
 ICE Brent  for November settlement rose 41 cents, or
0.39 percent, to $104.36 a barrel by 0622 GMT. Prices are poised
for a monthly drop of 9.4 percent, the biggest since May 2010,
and are down 7.4 percent this quarter.	
 U.S. crude  for November delivery gained 72 cents, or
0.88 percent, to $82.86 a barrel. Futures have fallen 14 percent
this quarter, the worst drop since the final quarter of 2008.	
 ""Crude oil has been holding up quite well compared with the
other asset classes such as equities,"" said Ker Chung Yang, a
commodities analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore, who
forecasts U.S. crude will be between $80 and $90 by the end of
this year. Prices ended at $91.38 a barrel in 2010.	
 ""Sentiment is negative on the macroeconomic front but demand
is still there, especially coming from the emerging markets,
from China and India.""

 
 
 U.S. weekly jobless benefits claims fell to a five-month low
while revised data showed second-quarter GDP grew slightly more
than expected. 
 Germany's parliament overwhelmingly approved a plan agreed
in July to expand the euro zone's bailout fund. 
 Sentiment was also lifted by an index that showed China's
factory activity in September almost unchanged from the previous
month, and stronger than earlier estimates.	
 The HSBC purchasing managers' index (PMI), which looks at
business conditions in a range of industries, was at 49.9 in
September, unchanged from August, the bank said on Friday.
 
 The final reading for HSBC's China PMI is stronger than the
flash PMI reading of 49.4 published last week. 
 Brent is expected to fall back to the previous trading
session's low of $102.35 as indicated by its wave pattern and a
Fibonacci retracement analysis, according to Reuters market
analyst Wang Tao.	
 
 PRICE FORECASTS	
 Morgan Stanley this week cut its 2012 average Brent price
target, citing the prospect of returning supply amidst a weaker
demand outlook. The bank lowered its outlook for the average
Brent price to $100 a barrel next year from $130.	
 Non-OPEC supply was seen growing, largely because of Libyan
restarts, Morgan Stanley said. 
 OPEC oil output is expected to rise in September to its
highest level in almost three years due to a jump in exports
from Iraq and the restart of supplies from Libya, a Reuters
survey found on Thursday. 
 Supply from all 12 members of the Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries is forecast to average 30.25
million barrels a day this month, up from 30.15 million in
August, the survey of sources at oil companies, OPEC officials
and analysts found.	
 Libya's output, which fell to almost nothing due to the
civil war, has begun to recover, the survey found. The country
exported one small crude cargo on Sept. 25 and, sources say, is
sending some oil to refineries.

 SINGAPORE, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Gold jumped more than 1
percent on Friday after Germany approved the expansion of the
euro zone bailout fund, offering temporary relief to investors,
but the precious metal was heading for its worst monthly decline
in three years.	
 With the euro debt crisis unlikely to be resolved any time
soon, investors have shifted their attention to Greece, which
demands more far-reaching measures to prevent the crisis that
started in Athens from spreading far beyond Europe.

 Spot gold added $12.40 an ounce to $1,626.45 an ounce
by 0636 GMT. Despite the gain, prices were headed for a monthly
fall of 11 percent, their worst since their October 2008 tumble
of 17 percent after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.	
 ""It seems that there are still hurdles ahead before the
European debt crisis is resolved,"" said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst
at Phillip Futures in Singapore. 
 ""By mid-October, Greece will start to run out of money and
has to receive the next tranche of aid to avoid bankruptcy. I
think the outlook for the euro zone is still uncertain. The
successful German vote provides a temporary bout of optimism and
more decisive policy action is still needed."" 
 Gold rallied to a lifetime high around $1,920 an ounce in
early September after the euro fell against the dollar on
growing doubts about Europe's ability to solve its debt crisis.	
 
 
 
 PHYSICALS BUZZ	
 Asian stocks fell on Friday, extending the worst monthly
performance since the most volatile days of the global financial
crisis in October 2008 as fears of a spiralling European debt
crisis caused investors to slash their bets on risky assets in
the September quarter. 
 The euro gave up modest gains made after Germany approved an
expansion of the euro-zone bailout fund, pressured by a wall of
orders from Japanese exporters wrapping up deals for the end of
their financial first half. 
 U.S. gold  rose $12.0 an ounce to $1,629.30.	
 Holdings of the largest gold-backed exchange-traded-fund
(ETF), New York's SPDR Gold Trust , fell 0.80 percent, and
those of the largest silver-backed ETF, New York's iShares
Silver Trust dipped 0.23 percent from Wednesday to
Thursday. 
 The physical sector saw a buzz of activity in Hong Kong,
with jewellers from China stocking up before the Golden Week
holiday next week. Premiums for gold bars were steady at a
7-month high at $3 an ounce. 
 ""Buying interest is still strong and people are rushing to
stock up a bit before the holiday in China. We don't have much
stock of gold bars, though,"" said a dealer in Hong Kong. 
 ""There's also Indian buying because of the wedding season."" 
 In top consumer India, retail gold demand traditionally
gains pace from the month of August, when the festival and
wedding seasons start, culminating with Diwali, the Hindu
festival of light. 
 Gold jewellery is an essential part of the dowry basket
Indian parents give their daughters at weddings. 
 In other markets, Brent crude rose above $104 a barrel on
positive economic news, but prices this quarter remain on track
for their biggest drop in 15 months on concerns that a slowing
global economy will undercut fuel demand. 
 London copper dropped more than 2 percent on Friday, heading
for its worst month in three years on concerns that a global
economic slowdown will hit demand.

 Edward McAllister
 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Thursday,
following an initial rebound in broader markets after Germany's
lower house approved new powers for the euro zone's crisis fund
and U.S. economic data beat expectations.
 Germany's support for a beefed-up bailout fund for Europe's
troubled economies, and data showing that the U.S. economy grew
at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the second quarter, helped
push oil higher.
 But prices remained on track for big losses this quarter as
concerns about the global economy continue to weigh. Oil fell 3
percent on Wednesday.
 ""Oil is being battered back and forth by changing
perceptions about how the economy is going to do in the next
year or so and there's no clear answer,"" said Gene McGillian,
analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut
 Brent crude oil futures for November  rose 14 cents
to settle at $103.95 a barrel. U.S. crude oil futures 
gained 93 cents to settle at $82.14 a barrel.
 Brent was poised for a quarterly decline of about 8
percent, while U.S. crude has fallen about 14 percent this
quarter, the sharpest drop since the last quarter of 2008.
 The spread between Brent and U.S. crude narrowed to $21.81
from $22.60 on Wednesday, as a resumption of Libyan oil exports
pressured London crude. The premium hit a record $27.23 on
Sept. 6. 
 ""Seeing Libyan oil come back in the market is a factor in
why the Brent-WTI spread is back under $22,"" McGillian said.
 Wall Street fell as U.S. Labor Department data that showed
promising jobs data failed to outweigh economic concern. [.N]
 The euro rose against the dollar in choppy trade [USD/].
 NEGATIVE FACTORS
 The general outlook for oil and economic growth was less
positive, with slowing global output and the prospect of
declining fuel consumption weighing on the market.
 U.S. July oil demand fell nearly 4 percent year-on-year,
data from the Department of Energy showed, a sign of the effect
that a weak economy can have on oil consumption.
 Morgan Stanley has slashed its forecast for Brent by $30 to
$100 a barrel for 2012, citing rising output from Libya and the
weak economic outlook. [ID:nS1E78R1TW]
 Brent should fall to $100 by the end of 2011 and could drop
as low as $85 a barrel in the first half of next year before
tighter balances and slow growth send it closer to $110, the
bank said.
 Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had been among the most
bullish of the major banks, forecasting $130 a barrel for 2012.
[O/POLL]

 By Frank Tang and Jan Harvey
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Gold rose modestly
Thursday on optimism that Germany's vote to beef up the euro
zone's bailout fund will avert that region's debt crisis.
 Bullion stemmed this week's brutal correction after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke hinted at new stimulus measures
if inflationary pressures ease. Economic optimism was also
fueled by a five-month low in U.S. initial claims for jobless
benefits.
 Spot gold  was up 0.3 percent at $1,612.50 an ounce
by 3:21 p.m. EDT (1921 GMT).
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled down
80 cents at $1,617.30 an ounce, giving up earlier gains. Volume
was lower than usual as some bullion traders were off for the
Jewish New Year holiday.
 Gold futures open interest -- a gauge of overall investor
sentiment -- fell to a near two-year low after prices tumbled 9
percent in the past six sessions on a margin hike and heavy
fund selling to cover losses in other markets.

 http://r.reuters.com/tah24s )
 ""It strikes me that a lot of the weaker, more volatile
longs have been cleared out,"" said James Steel, metals analyst
at HSBC. ""It looks like it's beginning to bottom out.""
 In the past eight sessions, COMEX gold's open interest has
dropped by more than 50,000 lots, equivalent to 5 million
ounces or over $8 billon at current prices. [ID:S1E78S1BK]
 ""It's not anything out of the ordinary other than general,
overall liquidation that you have seen in the last three or
four sessions,"" said Frank McGhee, head precious metals trader
of Integrated Brokerage Services LLC.
 Bullion found support in news that Germany's lower house
approved new powers for the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF) and Bernanke's remarks that the central bank
could ease monetary policy further if inflation or inflation
expectations fall significantly. [ID:nL3E7KT0TR].
 ""If Bernanke's comments mean anything, and if the passage
of the expansion of the ESFS by the German government means
anything, it means bids for gold rather than offers of it,""
said independent investor Dennis Gartman.
 However, analysts said that gold and silver prices could
fluctuate on persistent fears that European policymakers still
lack a cohesive plan to solve the region's debt crisis.
 PHYSICAL DEMAND STRONG
 Physical gold demand in Asia has been extremely strong as
prices retreated from record highs. Premiums for gold bars were
the strongest since at least February in Singapore and Hong
Kong and the highest in a year in India. [ID:nL3E7KS0MO]
 Meanwhile, holdings of gold-backed exchange-traded funds
have remained relatively strong.
 RBS analysts said in a note that the little movement in the
ETFs suggested that the core bullion holders are not going to
desert gold as an important risk hedge.
 Silver  was up 1.6 percent at $30.34 an ounce. Silver
prices sustained hefty losses this month, plunging more than a
quarter as support from higher gold prices evaporated.
 Among platinum group metals, spot platinum  was down
0.3 percent at $1,517.49 an ounce, and palladium  climbed
0.2 percent to $617 an ounce.
 Platinum retained its unprecedented discount to gold prices
as buyers worried a more anemic economic environment would
weigh on demand for industrial precious metals.

 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Brent and U.S. crude rose on
Thursday, following a rebound in broader markets after
Germany's lower house approved new powers for the euro zone's
crisis fund and U.S. economic data was stronger than forecast.
 Germany's support for a beefed-up bailout fund for Europe's
troubled economies and data showing that the U.S. economy grew
at annual rate of 1.3 percent in the second quarter, pushed
stocks and oil prices higher.
 ""We're optimistic about everything today, though

high as $105.82. U.S. crude oil futures  gained $1.55 to
$82.76 a barrel, after hitting a high of $83.98 a barrel.
 Oil prices have dropped sharply this quarter on fears of a
U.S. recession and concern that Europe's debt crisis will
spread and damage the global economy further.

nearly 14 percent this quarter, the sharpest drop since the

 SINGAPORE, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Gold jumped 1 percent on
Thursday as jewellers rushed to buy after prices dropped early
in the session, but declines in other markets could cap gains as
uncertainty about a resolution of Europe's debt crisis stoked
fears for global growth.	
 Stocks fell in Asia and copper futures dropped more than 5

 The euro gained on short-covering in volatile,
commodity-driven trade after riskier assets bounced off intraday
lows on Thursday, but was still on track to mark its worst
quarter since early 2010, with traders preparing for further
falls. 
 The uncertainties about global economic growth, mainly
sparked by the lack of consensus on a lasting solution to the
euro zone debt crisis, have driven gold prices to record highs
since July. 
 But declines in other markets prompted speculators to cash
in to cover losses, and investors were spooked by a revolt
within the government of German Chancellor Angela Merkel ahead
of a vote to expand Europe's bailout fund on Thursday.
ID:nL5E7KS6Z9] 
 Lower gold prices stirred up buying in Asia, sending
premiums for gold bars to their strongest since at least
February in Singapore and Hong Kong. In India, the premiums
jumped to their highest in a year. 
 Traditionally in India, retail gold demand gains pace from
the month of August when the festival and wedding seasons start,
culminating with the Diwali. 
 Gold jewellery is an essential part of the dowry basket that
Indian parents give their daughters at weddings.	
 ""Clients have called and told me they want to buy gold bars
at whatever premiums. That is if you could find gold bars,"" said
a physical dealer in Singapore. ""I don't sell anything to
Vietnam because there's no gold available."" 
 The State Bank of Vietnam has granted quotas for gold
companies and banks to import four to five tonnes of the
precious metal this week in an effort to narrow the gap between
domestic and world prices, an industry source said on Thursday.

 This is the fourth time that such imports have been
authorised since August, with the last one a week ago. 
 ""Physical demand is still there. Everyone in Asia is buying.
Everybody is buying gold and they want delivery,"" said another
physical dealer in Singapore.	
 ""We have stocks of gold bars, but it's not enough to satisfy
demand,"" said the dealer, adding that buyers came from India,
Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand.	
 Gold's steep correction, however, has not yet unnerved
investors in the No. 1 gold exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold
Trust. 
 Holdings of the largest gold-backed exchange-traded-fund
(ETF), New York's SPDR Gold Trust , and that of the largest
silver-backed ETF, New York's iShares Silver Trust
remained unchanged on Wednesday from Tuesday.

 NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Brent crude resumed its downward trend on
Wednesday, falling 3 percent as Europe's debt crisis continued to worry
markets, while a larger-than-expected build in weekly U.S. crude oil
inventories also weighed.
 Doubts about whether Greece would get more aid to bolster its troubled
economy shifted investor sentiment away from riskier assets like crude, a
day after oil posted gains for the first time in five sessions.
 ""There has been widespread liquidation across the grains, metals and
oil markets ahead of the German Bundestag lower house of parliament vote on
Thursday on whether to back new powers for the euro zone's rescue fund,""
said Phillip Streible, analyst at MF Global in Chicago.
 Risk aversion toward the end of the month and ahead of the two-day Rosh
Hashana holiday beginning on Wednesday night also contributed to losses,
traders said.
 Brent futures  dropped $3.33 to settle at $103.81 a barrel,
wiping out Tuesday's gains. U.S. crude  fell $3.24 to settle at
$81.21.
 Weekly data from the United States's Energy Information Administration
(EIA) showed a 1.9 million barrel increase in crude oil inventories, higher
than the 800,000 rise expected by a poll of analysts. [ID:nS1E78R0RW]

 In post settlement trade, 433,959 U.S. contracts were traded, 33
percent below the 30-day moving average. Brent volumes topped the 30-day

 U.S. INVENTORIES
 The market digested an increase in weekly U.S crude oil inventories
 ""The (EIA) report was bearish. Most notable is the decline in refined
product demand across the board. It speaks to the state of the economy and
calls further into question demand estimates for the balance of the year
and 2012,"" said John Kilduff from Again Capital LLC in New York.
 Gasoline stocks rose 791,000 barrels. Average gasoline demand in the
last four weeks dropped 2.4 percent from year-ago levels, EIA said.
 Distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, rose 72,000
barrels.
 Oil prices will weaken only slightly and hover above $100 a barrel next
year, despite fears of a global economic recession and a steep fall in
demand, the latest Reuters poll showed. [ID:nL5E7KR17H]

 The return of supply of Libyan crude oil, which pumped 1.6 million
barrels per day before a conflict which toppled the Gaddafi regime, is seen
as bearish for the oil price.
 Traders were also keeping an eye on potential strike action in French
refineries.
 Workers at French refineries debated going on strike, torn on Wednesday
between anger over moves to restructure the sector and memories of last
year's month-long stoppage that disrupted global flows of oil but left
unions drained and divided. [ID:nL5E7KS0UH]

 * Spread could widen if economic pessimism persists
(Adds comment, background)	
 By Jan Harvey	
 LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Gold prices traded at a $100
premium to platinum on Wednesday after hitting parity with the
white metal for the first time in 2-1/2 years last month, as
concerns over the economic outlook hurt industrial precious
metals while lifting bullion.	
 At 0934 GMT, spot gold was bid at $1,655.70 an ounce,
while platinum was at $1,555.50 an ounce. The
gold:platinum ratio, or the number of platinum ounces needed to
buy an ounce of gold, reached 1.06, its highest since 1991.	
 Due to the lower price of both metals, platinum's discount
to gold stood at less than $25 an ounce at that time, however.
Its current premium is the highest recorded in absolute terms
since Reuters data was first compiled.	
 The gold:platinum ratio dropped back below 1 in August as
traders took parity between the metals as a signal to sell gold
and buy platinum.	
 However, gold's greater appeal as a hedge against
instability in the wider financial market and platinum's
exposure to the lacklustre car sector has since caused the
spread between the metals to widen.	
 ""Overall the situation for the industrial side of the
precious metals complex remains more fragile than for gold,""
said Peter Fertig, a consultant at Quantitative Commodity
Research. ""Even if you are at a new high in the spread, it does
not mean the absolute limit."" 
 ""Nothing is indicating that there should be a relatively
fixed price relationship between gold and platinum, and that
prices for the spreads have to remain rangebound. Therefore
there is still upside potential.""

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Gold fell 3 percent on
Wednesday as the dollar rallied amid mounting worries about the
global economy and Europe's worsening debt crisis, while this
week's brutal correction also kept jittery investors at bay.
 Silver dived 7 percent on sharply weaker commodity prices
as crude oil and grains tumbled. Wall Street fell 2 percent on
the commodities rout and news that bans on short-selling stocks
in France, Italy and Spain had been extended. [ID:nL5E7KS72V]
 Bullion, which staged a one-day rally on Tuesday along with
commodities and equities, has lost around 10 percent in the
past five sessions after a sharp margin increase and heavy
selling by funds to cover losses in other markets.
 Gold investors, however, are unconvinced that the sell-off
has damaged the metal's safe-haven status.
 ""I don't look at it as anything more than a fairly stiff
correction within a secular bull market in gold prices,"" said
Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery
Scott, a broker-dealer with $54 billion in assets.
 ""The issues that are supporting gold haven't gone away,"" he
said.
 Spot gold  was down 2.9 percent at $1,601.79 an ounce
by 3:36 p.m. EDT (1936 GMT).
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled down
$34.40 at $1,618.10 an ounce. Trading volume was weaker than
this week's average, suggesting lower liquidity might have
accelerated bullion's decline.
 Silver  sank 6.9 percent to $29.64 an ounce in choppy
trade.
 Silver has notched its second major retreat of the year
this month, falling almost 30 percent so far in September.
 Traders also cited heavy selling by hedge funds to dress up
end-of-quarter performance.
 INVESTMENT HOLDS FIRM
 Gold's sharp correction has not yet unnerved investors in
the No. 1 gold exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust. And there
is no sign that gold futures and options investors are heading
for the exit, data showed.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 Saxo Bank senior manager Ole Hansen said gold's 200-day
moving average, currently at $1,530 an ounce, should provide
support.
 ""The only worry is obviously how burnt investors have
become from this 20 percent correction, as something which was
perceived to be safe suddenly was not any more,"" Hansen said.
 Strong physical demand from Asia should support the market
at lower prices, dealers said.
 Gold bar premiums in India, the world's biggest bullion

 By Simon Falush	
 LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Brent crude dipped on Wednesday
as worries about details of a euro zone debt bailout fund
prompted investor caution after a sharp gain the previous
session.	
 Investors also were reluctant to take big new positions
ahead of inventory data from the United States later in the day.

 Brent futures  were down 60 cents to $106.54 a barrel
by 1328 GMT after falling more than a dollar earlier. U.S. crude
 shed 79 cents to $83.66 a barrel.	
 It recovered from earlier lows, supported by weakness in the
dollar , which has an inverse relationship with oil. 
 Oil prices jumped more than 3 percent on Tuesday, bolstered
by expectations that European officials would aggressively
tackle the debt crisis in its peripheral economies, particularly
Greece, which eased fears about the outlook for demand.	
 However, the plans face opposition in Germany, and there are
signs of a split within the currency bloc over the terms of
Greece's next bailout. 
 Olivier Jakob, an analyst at Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland
said the sharp spikes in prices were due to the inability of
investors and automatic trading programmes to interpret
political news effectively.	
 ""The headline-reading trading machines cannot understand the
complexity of Europe, so big up moves (are) followed by big down
moves as they are unable to have a proper trading read on
Europe,"" he said.	
 Oil prices will weaken only slightly and hover above $100 a
barrel next year, despite fears of a global economic recession
and a steep fall in demand, the latest Reuters poll showed.

 Benghazi-based oil firm Agoco said on Wednesday it is
planning restarts at three more Libyan oil fields in east and
west Libya by mid-October, boosting output to 350,000 barrels
per day (bpd). 
 The return of supply of Libyan crude oil, which pumped 1.6
million barrels per day before a conflict which toppled the
Gaddafi regime, is seen as bearish for the oil price.	
 
 STOCKS, STRIKES WATCHED	
 The market will be next be looking for data from the U.S.
Energy Information Administration, due out later on Wednesday,
with crude stocks expected to have risen. 
 ""Strong inventories could weigh on prices as some of the
missing barrels that led to a fall in inventories are likely to
show up this week,"" said Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.	
 A sharp rise in U.S. gasoline inventories weighed on
sentiment on Tuesday, with industry data showing a steep 4.6
million barrel rise last week, far above the 1 million barrel
gain expected by analysts. 
 Crude stocks rose by 568,000 barrels in the week to Sept.
23, the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday. Analysts
polled by Reuters had projected an 800,000 barrel rise on
average.	
 Traders were also keeping an eye on potential strike action
in French refineries. 
 Workers at French refineries debated going on strike, torn
on Wednesday between anger over moves to restructure the sector
and memories of last year's month-long stoppage that disrupted
global flows of oil but left unions drained and divided.

 Last October physical crude prices fell, while there was a
glut of unrefined fuel in the Mediterranean and product prices
rose after strikes hit the refinery sector hard.	
""Possible impact hinges on duration and spreading of the
strike action,"" said Commerzbank's Fritsch. 
 ""A multi-week long nationwide strike could lead to local
supply bottlenecks and push European product prices up. On the
other hand, it could ease the supply situation in the European
crude market."" 
 
 Brent  is expected to face resistance at $107.05,
while the resistance for U.S. crude  stands at $85.40 per
barrel, according to Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 Brent is on track to fall 5.5 percent in the third quarter,
its second straight quarterly decline and the steepest since the
second quarter of 2010.	
 Oil has fared better than commodities such as copper and
gold in the recent sell-off due to tight supplies in the
physical market, analysts said.	
 ""We would highlight that because of that very tightness in
the physical markets, oil prices have held up far better than
other commodity markets, and we expect that outperformance to
continue,"" Barclays Capital said in a research note. 
 Royal Dutch Shell  recently shut in 25,000 barrels
per day of oil production in Nigeria, while Libyan crude
production has yet to reach the market.

 SINGAPORE, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Gold slipped 1 percent in
volatile trade on Wednesday as the U.S. dollar regained strength
on doubts over the progress of Europe's efforts to tackle the
region's debt crisis, while this week's brutal correction also
kept investors at bay.	
 Plans to increase the financial firepower of the euro zone's
440 billion euro rescue fund face opposition in Germany, while a
Financial Times report said a split had opened up within the
currency bloc over the terms of Greece's next bailout.
 
 Spot gold fell $4.21 to $1,644.69 an ounce by 0620
GMT, down for a fifth day in six. It had tumbled to a two-month
low of $1,534.49 on Monday -- down from a lifetime high around
$1,920 an ounce struck in early September.	
 ""After the free fall in prices, sentiments have been
impacted and there could be some further downside. Investors are
likely looking for prices to stabilise before they return to the
market,"" said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures in
Singapore. 
 ""Currently, gold has positive correlation with commodities
and a negative correlation with the dollar. This could be a
factor influencing bullion prices. Support for gold established
at $1,525.""	
 U.S. gold futures  dropped more than 1 percent to a
low around $1,633, while other precious metals tracked bullion
lower, with silver falling more than 2 percent.	
 Premiums for gold bars jumped to their highest level since
at least February after a drop in gold prices spurred buying
from jewellers and speculators, leading to tight supply in Asia.
Premiums for gold bars in Hong Kong rose to as high as $3 an
ounce to spot prices from $1.50 last week. 
 


 Asian stocks edged up and a rally in the euro stalled on
Wednesday as investors awaited more signs of progress from
European leaders on tackling the debt crisis before committing
bolder market bets. 
 The dollar rose 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies,
which in theory should weigh on commodities priced in the U.S.
currency such as oil and industrial metals. . 
 The uncertainties about global economic growth, mainly
sparked by the lack of consensus on a lasting solution to the
euro zone debt crisis, have driven gold prices to record highs
since July.	
 But declines in other markets as well as gold's failure to
revisit recent highs eventually prompted investors to sell
bullion for cash to cover losses. 
 Holdings of the largest silver-backed ETF, New York's
iShares Silver Trust rose 1.16 percent (pct) on Tuesday
from Monday, while that of the largest gold-backed
exchange-traded-fund (ETF), New York's SPDR Gold Trust
fell 0.39 pct for the same period. 
 ""Jewellers have bought gold when prices pulled back to
around $1,500. We saw some decent buying, but now everybody
waits and sees,"" said a dealer in Hong Kong.	
 ""Are we going to see a recession? But I think long-term
sentiment for gold is still bullish because the dollar could
still weaken again.""	
 In other markets, London copper fell more than 4
percent as worries about the fate of the global economy and a
stronger dollar fuelled another sell-off, while Brent crude fell
below $107.

 SINGAPORE, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell below $107
on Wednesday, after sharp gains a day earlier, weighed down by a
stronger dollar as investors sought refuge in the greenback amid
lingering concerns over a debt crisis in the euro zone.	
 Brent futures  lost 76 cents to $106.38 a barrel by
0311 GMT, after falling more than a dollar earlier. U.S. crude
 shed $1.17 to $83.28 a barrel. Oil prices jumped more
than 3 percent on Tuesday.	
 The euro zone was back in focus, as doubts remained over the
ability of European policy makers to stem a crisis that
threatens to trigger a global recession and curtail oil demand.	
 Plans to increase the financial firepower of the euro
zone's 440 billion euro rescue fund face opposition in Germany,
while a Financial Times report said that a split had opened up
within the currency bloc over the terms of Greece's next
bailout. 
 Commodities also fell after buying to cover short positions,
which had boosted prices in the previous session, ended.	
 ""There are still a lot of fears over Europe, and after
yesterday's round of short-covering the upside for oil is
limited,"" said Ken Hasegawa, a commodities derivatives manager
with Newedge Brokerage in Tokyo. 
 U.S. gold futures  and cash gold slipped 1
percent, down for a fifth day in six, while silver
dropped more than 2 percent. 
 
 The U.S. dollar gained 0.4 percent against a basket of
currencies, snapping two sessions of losses, as investors
retreated from riskier assets in favour of the safe haven
currency.

its second straight quarterly decline, and the steepest since
the second quarter of 2010. U.S. crude is set to lose almost 13

largest drop since the fourth quarter of 2008.

more than 3 percent higher on Tuesday, ending four straight

 Those efforts bolstered hopes that the euro zone debt

 NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Oil jumped more than 3
percent on Tuesday, snapping a four-day losing streak on
efforts to strengthen the euro zone rescue fund and concerns
about U.S. fuel supplies.
 European officials were seen considering plans to boost the
size of the region's bailout fund and to recapitalize banks,
sparking hopes of an easing in the debt crisis that has dragged
stock markets and commodities this month.
 Equities rose and commodities gained, with gold also
shaking off four days of declines. End-of-quarter and technical
buying also provided lift.
 ""What we might be seeing is some end-of-the-quarter
bookmarking,"" Gene McGillian, analyst for Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""Right now, the (U.S. crude futures) market may have
triggered some technical buying at the $80 level, I think this
is a technically oriented rally with some end-of-the-quarter
buying supporting it.""
 A strong, counter-seasonal jump in RBOB gasoline futures
 further fueled the rally, rising nearly 5 percent on
supply concerns after news ConocoPhillips  would sell or
idle its Trainer, Pennsylvania plant and that Motiva Enterprise
 shut a cat cracker at its Louisiana refinery.
[ID:nS1E78Q0X1]
 Brent futures  rose $3.20 to settle at $107.14 a
barrel, after touching a session high at $107.54. It marked the
biggest percentage gain for Brent since Aug. 10.
 U.S. crude  showed even bigger gains, rising $4.21 to
settle at $84.45 a barrel in the biggest daily percentage gain
since May 9.
 Brent volumes, which have traditionally been lower those
for U.S. futures, again outpaced those of the U.S. contract.
 The rising activity in Brent, compared with the New York
Mercantile Exchange's U.S. contract, could be tied to traders
anticipating large, long-only index commodity funds will
increase their 2012 holdings in Brent relative to U.S. futures,
analysts said.
 The U.S. contract has come under pressure this year as
rising volumes of crude from Canada flood into the U.S.
Midcontinent, especially the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point
for the NYMEX contract. In addition, the backwardated shape of
the Brent curve can yield better returns for long-only indexes
than the WTI curve, which is in contango.
 ""The NYMEX is just such a false indicator of where demand
is and where the real price of oil is, the Brent market is well
over $100 and the NYMEX is just completely detached,"" said
Stephen Schork, editor of The Schork Report in Villanova,
Pennsylvania.
 ""I would expect to see an increase in Brent and a decrease
in NYMEX (by long-only index funds).""
 In afternoon activity in New York, more than 600,000 Brent
contracts had changed hands, 17 percent over the 30-day
average. About 500,000 contracts traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange's U.S. contract, about 24 percent below its

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Gold rose almost 1.5
percent on Tuesday on a weak dollar and renewed risk appetite,
but bullion ended off highs as its recovery from the steepest
three-day drop in nearly three decades appeared to falter.
 Bullion gained as the U.S. stock market rallied 1 percent
and the euro rose against the dollar, fueled by optimism that
European policymakers planned to increase the region's bailout
fund to ease a debt crisis.
 Sharply higher crude oil and grain prices also underpinned
gold buying.
 Despite gold's gains, however, the metal has lost 9 percent
in the past four sessions, as a sharp margin increase on Monday
accelerated selling momentum and spurred a heavy bout of
liquidation by commodity funds, traders said.
 ""Over the last several days, we have gone back to the

 PHYSICAL BUYING EXCEPTIONAL
 Gold reclaimed its 100-day moving average at around $1,640,
following a surge in buying interest in many key consuming
nations in Asia, which pushed local premiums to their highest
since the start of the year, dealers said.
 Premiums for physical delivery of gold in Hong Kong and
Singapore, two major bullion trading hubs, rose to their
highest since February and local dealers reported robust demand
from retail and industrial consumers. [GOL/AS]
 Credit Agricole analyst Robin Bhar said gold's rare
correction in the last several months allowed better value for
buyers who wanted to get back into the market.
 ""I think gold's bottomed out here,"" he said.
 Swiss bank UBS said it had seen strong physical buying in
Asia, particularly No. 1 bullion consumer India, on Monday.
 ""To be clear, physical demand right now is not just decent,
it is exceptionally strong,"" UBS said.
 Gold-backed exchange-traded funds showed few signs of a
rout on Monday. Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust declined some 5-1/2
tonnes but were still up 1.2 percent so far this month.
 Most major funds are still in positive territory for
September in percentage terms, with the iShares Gold Trust
 and ETFS' Swiss Gold fund up 0.5 percent.
 Platinum  was up 0.3 percent at $1,560.49 an ounce,
having fallen to a 21-month low on Monday, while palladium
 rallied 3 percent at $645.75 an ounce.

 By Jessica Donati	
 LONDON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Tuesday, with Brent
crude up by more than $2 to exceed $106 a barrel, as fresh
measures discussed by the European Central Bank (ECB) curbed
anxiety about European debt.	
 Officials said Europe's stability fund could be increased,
indicating the ECB was prepared to act to prevent a meltdown in
Greece and fight the crisis threatening to derail the global
economic recovery. 
 Oil rebounded with other commodities as stock markets jumped
and the dollar weakened. Brent swung to as high as $106.19 a
barrel on Tuesday, from an intraday low of $101.66 a barrel the
previous session.	
 ""Much of the immediate action in oil is simply based on the
same climate of economic fear that is battering all other asset
classes, which then creates a cascading effect involving
technical triggers, precipitous price falls and a disregard for
the underlying fundamentals,"" said Barclays Capital analysts in
a research note.	
 Brent futures  were up $1.86 to $105.80 a barrel at
0849 GMT, while U.S. crude  was up $2.44 at $82.68 a
barrel. 
 Brent and U.S. oil prices were both recovering from
seven-week lows last week, when both crude contracts posted
weekly losses of more than 7 percent and 9 percent,
respectively. 
 
 
 ""Clarity on the euro zone plan is still key. Crude prices
are swinging back and forth depending on what comments come out
of Europe,"" said Victor Say, an analyst with Informa Global
Markets in Singapore. 
 ""Commodities have also been boosted by a weaker dollar and
short-covering after the recent sell-down."" 
 
 WATCH AND WAIT	
 Oil production is climbing in Libya, where Eni said
output at its Abut Attifel field 300 km south of Benghazi had
restarted at around 31,900 barrels of oil per day, just over
half its pre-civil war rate. 
 And at Mellitah in Libya, a tanker was preparing to sail
with a cargo of condensate, and another was expected to load
crude oil from the port later this week. 
 But violence continued in Syria, where oil exports of around
150,000 bpd have ground to a halt because of international
sanctions. 
 Four soldiers were shot dead on Monday as they tried to
escape a military camp, and a crackdown in the region of Homs
continued, where an increasing number of defectors have been
organising and mounting raids. 
 Attention is also focused on weekly U.S. inventory data,
with commercial crude stockpiles expected to have dipped
slightly, according to a preliminary Reuters poll of analysts on
Monday, following last week's precipitous 7.34 million barrel
drop. 
 The decline sent inventories to the lowest level since
January. Product inventories instead are expected to have edged
higher. Data from the American Petroleum Institute is due at
2030 GMT.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Spot gold rallied more than 1
percent and U.S. gold futures as much as 4 percent on Tuesday,
snapping four consecutive sessions of losses as a weaker dollar
helped battered commodities stage a comeback.	
 Euro-zone officials are working to magnify the firepower of
the region's rescue fund, European Central Bank policymakers
said on Monday, boosting hopes the region will be able to
staunch a sovereign debt crisis that threatens the world
economy. 
 The news pushed the dollar down 0.5 percent against a
currency basket , making gold cheaper for holders of other
currencies. 
 Spot gold gained 1.5 percent to $1,651 an ounce by
0708 GMT, after sinking as much as 7 percent to a 7-1/2-month
low near $1,530 on Monday.	
 U.S. gold  rose 3.7 percent to $1,653, headed for its
biggest one-day rise since March 2009.	
 ""In the last couple of days the market over-reacted to the
situation in the euro zone and the U.S.,"" said Cameron
Alexander, senior metals analyst at GFMS, a unit of Thomson
Reuters.

 
 
 Gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset remains intact given the
uncertainty in global growth and concerns about Europe's
sovereign debt, and strong investment demand is likely to push
gold towards $2,000 by the end of the year, said Alexander.	
 Technical indicators suggested gold could see more
short-term weakness. Spot gold may fall back to Monday's
intraday low of $1,534.49 later in the day, said Reuters market
analyst Wang Tao, who is looking for even larger falls in the
long term. 
 Investors are eyeing a key vote in the German parliament on
Thursday to approve changes to the European Financial Stability
Facility rescue fund. 
 ""There may be another leg lower in gold, as people position
themselves ahead of the EFSF votes in case there was a good
outcome that would lead to a sell-off in the dollar and rising
risk appetite,"" said a Singapore-based trader.	
 Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded
fund, SPDR Gold Trust , fell 0.4 percent to 1,246.762
tonnes by Sept. 26, after standing unchanged for four sessions.

 Physical buying has increased over the past week or so, as
spot gold prices sank nearly 10 percent in the past four
sessions.	
 ""At the current level people are buying, because they
believed what happened in the past few days was only a
correction,"" said Ronald Leung, a physical dealer at Lee Cheong
Gold Dealers in Hong Kong.	
 The premium on gold bars in Hong Kong had risen to more than
$2 per ounce above spot prices, as a result of increased demand,
he added.	
 Other precious metals also rebounded from Monday's trough.
Spot silver rallied 3.8 percent to $31.81, before easing
slightly to $31.46. 
 U.S. silver  jumped as much as 6.4 percent to a high
of $31.88, and remains on course for its biggest one-day rise in
two and a half months.

 By Francis Kan	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose above $105
on Tuesday, as concerns over Europe's debt crisis eased
temporarily and a weaker U.S. dollar sparked buying of
dollar-denominated assets.	
 Euro zone officials are working to boost the firepower of
the region's rescue fund, European Central Bank policymakers
said on Monday, while U.S. President Barack Obama piled on
pressure for Europe to staunch a sovereign debt crisis that
threatens the world economy. 
 However, analysts were wary about the rally as markets
remain prone to swings in risk appetite, with investors waiting
for details on the rescue plan.	
 ""Clarity on the euro zone plan is still key, crude prices
are swinging back and forth depending on what comments come out
of Europe,"" said Victor Say, an analyst with Informa Global
Markets in Singapore. 
 ""Commodities have also been boosted by a weaker dollar and

 Brent futures  rose $1.75 to $105.69 a barrel by 0625
GMT, their high for the day. U.S. crude  gained $2.16 to
$82.40 a barrel. 
 Brent and U.S. crude prices have stabilised after falling to
seven-week lows and posting weekly losses of more than 7 and 9
percent last week, respectively. 
 
 
 
 The U.S. dollar was down 0.6 percent against a basket of
currencies on hopes for a resolution to the euro zone crisis,
lifting commodities priced in the greenback. 
 Spot gold rallied 1 percent on Tuesday, snapping four
consecutive sessions of losses, while spot silver gained
2.8 percent. 
 Turbulence in global markets since late July has been driven
by investors' twin fears of renewed recession in the United
States, and the chaos that Europe's sovereign debt crisis could
inflict on the financial system if it continues unchecked. 
 ""Much of the immediate action in oil is simply based on the
same climate of economic fear that is battering all other asset
classes, which then creates a cascading effect involving
technical triggers, precipitous price falls and a disregard for
the underlying fundamentals,"" said Barclays Capital analysts in
a research note.	
 Markets remain volatile, with Brent  expected to
retrace to $102.81 before rebounding further to $105.75 per
barrel, while U.S. crude  is expected to revisit its
previous trading session's low of $77.11 per barrel, according
to Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 
 U.S. INVENTORIES, MIDDLE EAST	
 U.S. commercial crude stockpiles are expected to have fallen
slightly last week, with product inventories expected to show
builds, a preliminary Reuters poll of analysts showed on Monday.

 Forecasts for a small decline follow the steep 7.34 million
barrel drop in crude stockpiles reported by the EIA for the week
to Sept. 16, which sent inventories to the lowest level since
January.	
 Investors are still eyeing the political unrest and conflict
in the oil-producing region of the Middle East and North Africa,
even as Libya moves to restart its oil production.	
 Italy's Eni said it has restarted oil output from
15 wells, and a tanker is loading condensate at the Libyan port
of Mellitah with another due to arrive on Tuesday to pick up a
cargo that is most likely to be crude oil, the terminal's harbor
master told Reuters. 
 In Syria, four soldiers were shot dead on Monday as they
tried to escape a military camp and troops sealed off towns in a
continuing crackdown on opponents of President Bashar al-Assad,
activists said.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,662.35 a troy ounce during early U.S. trade, slumping 4.5%, after hitting a high of USDS1,755.55. 
Gold’s decline continued from Thursday’s session, a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its decision to launch a USD400 billion “Operation Twist”, a combination of buying and selling of short and long term Treasuries.
Dealers hoping for a liquidity boost from the Fed to ignite the faltering U.S. economy were largely unimpressed by the prospects that a bond swap would serve to provide the necessary spark.
Further downward momentum on safe-haven gold was provided by a statement issued from Washington where officials from the International Monetary Fund held meetings with finance representatives of the Group of 20 major economies.
The G-20 said it would be working in the next few weeks to expand the powers of the USD595 billion rescue fund to support troubled banks.
“We will ensure that banks are adequately capitalized and have sufficient access to funding to deal with current risks,” the statement said.

And in its Wednesday report, the National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing homes in the U.S. rose by 7.7% to a seasonally adjusted 5.03 million units in August, well above market expectations of a 1.7% gain.

1156,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 21, 2011 08:20PM ET</span>",Gold futures edge up in early Asian trade,"Investing.com – Gold futures moved marginally higher in Asian trade Thursday, as the decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve to “twist” the yield curve on government bonds failed to convince global investors that the move was enough to revive the U.S. economy. 
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,784.85 a troy ounce during early Asian trade, up 0.07%, after hitting a high of USDS1,779.55. 
At the conclusion of its two-day Federal Open Market Committee Meeting Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would be replacing a portion of the short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in a move known as “Operation Twist.”
The move was highly anticipated by the market and may lead to lower interest rates as well as avoid the resumption of the Fed’s controversial money creation program.
“There are significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets,” the Fed said in a statement, with a reference to the ongoing debt crisis in the euro-zone.
Gold futures were additionally supported following Tuesday’s decision by the International Monetary Fund to downgrade its global growth outlook for 2012 to 4%, down from a previous estimate of 4.3%.
The IMF revised down its forecast for U.S. economic growth to 1.5% for the remainder of 2011 and 1.8% in 2012, down from its June estimate of 2.5% and 2.7% respectively, adding that the world economy had entered a “dangerous new phase.”

Speaking from a meeting of euro-zone finance ministers in Poland Friday, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said a decision on the next round of Greek aid would be made in October.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Gold rallied 1 percent
on Friday in volatile trade, as the safe-haven bid for precious
metals returned when a survey showed U.S. consumers gloomy
about the economic outlook.
 For the week, gold fell around 2.5 percent, its second
straight weekly decline and its biggest weekly loss since early
May. Traders cited panic liquidation by hedge funds for the
weekly losses, but said that factor was missing on Friday.
 ""The lack of fund selling that started last week allowed
gold to move higher"" on Friday, said Miguel Perez-Santalla,
vice president of sales of Heraeus Precious Metals Management.
 Bullion slipped to three-week lows in early trade before
Asian bargain-hunting boosted prices. Gains accelerated after
U.S. data showed American consumers gloomier about the economic
outlook than they have been since May 1980.
 Spot gold  was up 0.9 percent at $1,804.70 an ounce
by 2:59 p.m. EDT (1859 GMT), after hitting $1,761.94, its
lowest level since Aug. 26.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  rose $33.30
to settle at $1,814.70 an ounce. Trading volume was in line
with the avearge for this week.
 Silver  rose 1.3 percent to $40.33 an ounce.
 EYES ON FED NEXT WEEK
 Federal Reserve policy makers meet next week, and some
investors expect them to announce a program to stimulate the
economy by buying longer-dated U.S. government debt while
selling short paper. Many investors have already nicknamed the
potential program ""Operation Twist.""
 Gold investors expect such a move by the Fed to pressure
the dollar, which could boost the value of precious metals. But
few were willing to bet that gold will rise much higher in the
short term.
 ""A portion of the price of gold has already priced in more
currency devaluation,"" said Hereaus' Perez-Santalla.
 The Fed's quantitative easing program helped boost gold,
which is up 40 percent since the start of the central bank's
$600 billion bond-buying spree that ended in June.
 Most analysts said gold's long-term bull run remains
intact, but some investors questioned the metal's ability to
rise above $2,000 after its most volatile trade in two years.
 Implied volatility in gold eased after surging on Monday to
its highest level in more than two years, suggesting investors
were no longer betting on a big break-out in prices.
 Next week's volume could be thiner than usual as around 500
traders, institutional investors and physical users will attend
the annual industry get-together hosted by the London Bullion
Marketing Association in Montreal.
 Among platinum group metals, platinum hit $1,762.28 an
ounce, its lowest since Aug. 11, as the crisis reinforced
worries about the health of global economic growth and demand
for autocatalysts.
 Platinum  was up 1.3 percent at $1,804.49 an ounce,
and palladium  gained 1 percent at $727.73 an ounce.

 By Joshua Schneyer
 NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell on Friday,
reversing earlier gains, as European debt woes weakened the
euro and a gauge of U.S. consumer expectations fell to a
31-year low.
 The dollar firmed, making oil more expensive for holders of
foreign currencies. The euro came under pressure on
speculation that debt-laden Italy may have its sovereign rating
downgraded, just as Greece finalizes plans to restructure its
own debt payments. [USD/] 
 Brent crude for November  fell 8 cents to settle at
$112.22 a barrel. Europe's benchmark crude had risen above $114
a barrel in earlier trading.
 For the week, Brent fell 55 cents a barrel, snapping a
four-week winning streak.
 U.S. crude  took a bigger fall, settling down $1.44 a
barrel to $87.96. A Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
survey of U.S. Consumers' preliminary September consumer
sentiment rose slightly. But a measure of consumer expectations
for the future of the economy fell to its lowest level since
1980. [ID:nS1E78F0HJ]
 ""Oil investors have to be getting worried about global
demand going forward, and the risk of contagion in Europe from
Greece to other economies,"" said Richard Ilczyszyn of MF Global
in Chicago.
 Europe's debt woes could hit petroleum demand as economic
growth slows, although more U.S. economic stimulus measures may
still help to inflate commodity values even if demand does not
expand.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve meets next week, with its
policymakers set to consider additional measures to stimulate
the U.S. economy and prevent it from falling into recession.
 New Fed stimulus measures could weigh on the dollar and
help riskier assets like commodities to rise.
 Brent's losses trailed those of U.S. crude as the European
contract switched to a new front month, November, and investors
bet it would gain in value versus later months on tight prompt
supply of North Sea crudes.
 Brent for November traded on Friday at a $24.18 per-barrel
premium to West Texas Intermediate for the same month. The
spread had closed at $22.71 on Thursday.
 NORTH SEA DELAYS
 North Sea Forties crude, one of the key crude oil streams
used to price about two thirds of global physical oil, has been
suffering from production problems and loading delays since
May, supporting Brent crude futures.
 Shipments of Forties crude oil are being further delayed
due to production shortfalls, trade sources said on Thursday.

 SINGAPORE, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Gold slipped more than 1
percent on Friday, heading for its biggest weekly drop since
March 2009, as stock markets gained and the euro rose after
major central banks around the world strived to fight the debt
crisis in Europe.	
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will discuss with
European finance ministers the possibility of leveraging the
euro zone's bailout fund as the world's main central banks aim
to ease dollar funding for stricken banks. 
 Spot gold fell $21.45 an ounce to $1,767.19 by 0634
GMT after falling 2 percent in the previous session. Bullion
struck a record around $1,920 last week on concerns the euro
debt crisis could stall global growth.	
 ""We favour maintaining our negative trading affair bias in
today's trade,"" said Tom Pawlicki, precious metals and energy
analyst at MF Global. 
 ""Additional pressure will come from low expectations for
quantitative easing at next week's FOMC meeting, and from
technical factors which argue for a move down to $1,700-$1,750
an ounce in our opinion,"" he added.

 U.S. gold futures  fell $11.30 an ounce to $1,770.10
as investors looked to next week's meeting of the Federal
Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on interest
rates. 
 The Fed, facing rising global financial strains and
recession fears, is poised to increase downward pressure on
longer-term interest rates next week in a bid to accelerate a
sputtering U.S. recovery. 
 Next week's focus could also switch back to the dollar when
the FOMC meets, with any hints policymakers are considering
another round of quantitative easing likely to weigh on the
currency. 
 Asian stocks jumped on Friday as the relatively stable euro
ahead of a European finance ministers meeting reflected hopes
for an important policy move to fight the region's debt crisis,
which had initially triggered rallies in gold. 
 ""We're in a consolidation, a very small one, since the
beginning of September. Going forward now, we're probably going
to test somewhere the lows that we have seen at the end of
August,"" said Dominic Schnider, an analyst at UBS Wealth
Management, referring to gold's correction from highs. 
 ""If people are expecting a QE3 right now, they could be
disappointed. The hurdle is very high for a QE3."" 
 Many market watchers said the Fed's programme of bond
purchases through June 30, known as quantitative easing or QE2,
helped drive up commodity prices by providing cheap money to
investors who placed it in risky assets. 
 Gold prices are likely to break through $2,000 an ounce by
year-end to new record highs, metals consultancy GFMS said in a
report on Thursday, as inflation pressures in Asia and debt
concerns in the West lead to a recovery in investment demand.

 The euro clung to gains against the dollar on Friday,
boosted by key central banks coordinated action to add liquidity
to the European banking system, but the rally is unlikely to
last as the Greek debt crisis remains in a critical state.

 Oil was headed for a weekly gain on Friday after central
banks launched coordinated action to boost European bank
funding, easing concern about falling oil demand from
industrialised consumers.

edged higher in August and consumer prices rose more than
expected, reinforcing expectations the Federal Reserve will
offer only modest stimulus measures.	
 ""Fundamentals don't look too bad for oil, it's just that the
macroeconomy has been keeping the market down,"" said Tony Nunan,

 ""We are still nowhere near out of the woods. They are just

 Major central banks around the world will cooperate to offer
three-month U.S. dollar loans to commercial banks in order to
prevent money markets from freezing up in the wake of Europe's
debt crisis. 
 Global stocks advanced for a third straight day and the euro
rose sharply on Thursday after the move by the central banks.

 The euro clung to gains against the greenback on Friday, but
the rally is unlikely to last as the Greek debt crisis remains
in a critical state. 
 
 COORDINATED ACTION	
 Geithner will hold talks with EU ministers in Poland on
Friday and will propose that the European Financial Stability
Fund, a 440 billion euro fund set up in May 2010, be used in a
similar way to an emergency loan fund created by the U.S.
Treasury and the Federal Reserve in 2008 to thaw frozen credit
markets, sources said. 
 New claims for U.S. jobless aid rose unexpectedly last week
and factory activity along much of the Eastern seaboard
contracted early this month, bolstering the case for more action
to support the struggling economy.
 The International Energy Agency said on Thursday it was
formally ending its release of oil from emergency reserves to
help cover a shortfall caused by the loss of Libyan output,
deeming the move successful. 
 Shipments of Forties crude oil are being further delayed due
to production shortfalls, trade sources said on Thursday,
disrupting more supply of the North Sea crude which usually sets
the global Brent benchmark. [ID:nL5E7KF1KM
 The premium of European benchmark Brent over U.S. crude
marker West Texas Intermediate shrank to below $23 a barrel on
Friday from more than $26 a day earlier, after October Brent
went off the board on Thursday. It reached a record above $27 on

1190,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 15, 2011 08:20PM ET</span>",Gold futures rise in early Asian trade,"Investing.com – Gold futures recovered from three-week lows in Asian trade Friday, after falling under USD1,800 an ounce, as the European Central Bank announced plans to provide dollar liquidity to euro-zone financial institutions. 
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,790.05 a troy ounce during early Asian trade, up 0.11%, after hitting a low of USDS1,786.95.

 By Frank Tang and Jan Harvey
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Gold fell 2 percent to
three-week lows on Thursday, as increasing efforts to contain
the European debt crisis fueled another volatile session,
further diminishing bullion's appeal as a safe haven.
 Equities rallied after major central banks said they would
cooperate to offer three-month U.S. dollar loans to commercial
banks to prevent money markets from freezing up. A bearish
double-top chart pattern in gold accelerated technical selling
as prices slid below $1,800 an ounce.
 Gold has lost 7 percent since hitting a record $1,920.30
last Tuesday.
 ""Any attempt to ease the fear or moving forward with the
euro zone debt crisis is going to be viewed as positive by the
markets, and nonetheless takes away the need for the safe haven
assets such as bonds and gold,"" said David Meger, director of
metals trading at futures broker Vision Financial Markets.
 Spot gold  was down 1.8 percent at $1,788.09 an ounce
by 3:57 PM (1957 EDT), having dipped as low as $1,772.04. The
precious metal is set for its second straight weekly loss,
which would be its first two-week drop since early July.
 U.S. gold futures for December  settled down $45.10
at $1,781.40 an ounce. Trading volume was about 10 percent
above this week's average turnover, preliminary Reuters data
showed.
 Silver  fell 2.2 percent at $39.77 an ounce.
 Most analysts said gold's long-term bull run remains
intact, but some investors questioned the metal's ability to
rise above $2,000 after its most volatile trade in two years,
with bullion rising or falling more than 2 percent 12 times in
the past 30 days.
 ""It seems like sentiment has swung back and forth
significantly on a daily basis in the past several weeks. At
the moment, gold is the readily traded asset being watched very
closely by speculators and investors alike, creating volatility
to the market of late,"" Meger said.
 On charts, gold should find support at $1,702, a recent low
reached in late August, representing the ""neckline"" of a
bearish double-top pattern after bullion failed to extend gains
above $1,900 an ounce twice in the past four weeks, said Adam
Sarhan, CEO of New York-based Sarhan Capital.
 ""If we are not able to get above the all-time high, by
definition the double top remains in place. In the short term,
it's definitely going to be technical pressure,"" Sarhan said.

 Equities and the euro rose after coordinated actions by
central banks eased any funding crunch created by Europe's
sovereign debt crisis. European bank shares rallied.
 Gold dropped as German government bond futures staged their
largest one-day fall in six months on signs of more willingness
from policymakers to solve Greece's debt crisis, prompting some
to sell positions in safe-haven bonds. [GVD/EUR]
 U.S. data showed an above-forecast rise in weekly U.S.
jobless claims, August inflation cooling and a surprisingly
large contraction in a reading of regional manufacturing.
 HSBC, GFMS FORECAST $2,000 GOLD
 UBS analyst Edel Tully said in a note that the U.S. Federal
Reserve policy meeting next week could boost the gold market.
 HSBC and metals consultancy GFMS said on Thursday they see
gold rising above $2,000 an ounce, citing high government debt
levels and instability in the currency markets.
 GFMS, a unit of Thomson Reuters, said it expected gold to
break through $2,000 an ounce by year-end, as recovering
investment added to already strong bar, jewelry and official
sector buying. [ID:nL5E7KE2V5]

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Gold slipped 1 percent in
volatile trade on Thursday after equities rose on optimism over
tentative steps by European policy makers to resolve and limit
the region's debt crisis. 
 Gold's failure to revisit recent highs also prompted
investors to trim positions and turn their attention to a series
of economic data from the United States ahead of next week's
meeting of the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) on interest rates.	
 U.S. gold futures  lost 1 percent to hit a low around
$1,806 an ounce, putting pressure on cash gold. 
""We've seen in the last few days that gold has struggled to
make any headway,"" said Darren Heathcote, head of Investec
Australia in Sydney. ""That is a sign of the market really
waiting for something more substantial, either coming out of
Europe or coming out of the United States."" 
 Spot gold fell $12.01 to $1,808.09 an ounce by 0607
GMT, extending losses from the previous session. Bullion, which
has risen around 27 percent this year, was well below a lifetime
high around $1,920 an ounce struck last week.	
 Asian stocks bounced on Thursday after euro zone policy
makers stepped in to tackle a crippling debt crisis, but there
were also fears about obstacles the bloc's leaders face, which
could weigh on the euro and Asian currencies in the medium term.

 Sentiments remained volatile as documents revealed that
European finance ministers have been warned confidentially of
the danger of a renewed credit crunch as a ""systemic"" crisis in
euro zone sovereign debt spills over to banks. 
 The uncertainties about global economic growth have driven
gold prices to scale record highs since July, and are still
expected to underpin sentiment for the metal until investors are
convinced the danger of recession is past.	
 Debt problems in the European Union are raising the risk to
a bullish outlook for commodities, Goldman Sachs economist
Allison Nathan said on Thursday, reiterating a 12-month forecast
for Brent  at $130 per barrel, gold at $1,860 an ounce
and LME copper at $11,000 a tonne. 
 
 
 
 World Bank President Robert Zoellick said on Wednesday the
world had entered a new economic danger zone and Europe, Japan
and the United States all needed to make hard decisions to avoid
dragging down the global economy. 
 ""I would say we'll be watching the U.S. CPI figures ahead of
the FOMC meeting next week. If we do see an acceleration in
inflation, then I think additional Fed action or looser monetary
policy will be more difficult to justify,"" said a dealer in
Singapore.	
 ""I think gold will trade sideways this week. I am looking
for support at $1,800. Gold is becoming a different creature
because of the volatility. We never saw gold trading so volatile
until prices rallied above $1,900."" 
 The Federal Reserve, facing rising global financial strains
and recession fears, is poised to increase downward pressure on
longer-term interest rates next week in a bid to speed up a
sputtering U.S. recovery. 
 Labor Department releases the August Consumer Price Index at
1230 GMT, with economists in a Reuters survey expecting a 0.2
percent rise compared with a 0.5 percent rise in July. Excluding
volatile food and energy items, CPI is seen up 0.2 percent, a
repeat of the July figure. 
 In the energy market, oil fell as rising fuel stocks and
falling demand in top consumer the United States reinforced
fears that crumbling economic growth and Europe's debt crisis
would dent energy use.

 NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Brent crude jumped by almost
$3 to above $115 a barrel on Thursday after central banks
launched coordinated action to boost European bank funding and
as diesel and heating fuels rallied.
 News that major central banks around the world will
cooperate to prevent Europe's sovereign debt crisis from
freezing up money markets was seen as a positive step toward
stopping another recession. [ID:nF9E7JT00G]
 Industrial fuels like diesel and heating oil rallied about
3 percent on expectations demand would keep growing strongly.
 JP Morgan analyst Lawrence Eagles said inventories of
diesel and heating oil in the United States will probably be
drawn down in the coming months by international demand.
 ""Distillate stocks will likely tighten, poised to draw by 4
million barrels over the next four months despite refineries
cranking up output to all-time highs,"" Eagles said.
 ""We see the strong trend in exports that has already
depleted inventories continuing.""
 October Brent crude , which expired on Thursday,
traded up $2.94 to $115.34 a barrel, hitting a week high and
moving above its 50 and 100-day moving averages. The more
heavily traded November contract  gained $2.65 to settle

 U.S. crude oil for October  rose 49 cents to settle
at $89.40.
 U.S. heating oil futures  rose 2.7 percent, while
RBOB gasoline futures  were up 2.1 percent. Gas oil
futures, the main distillate contract in Europe, gained 3
percent.
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude widened by more than $2 to
approach $26. It had narrowed sharply earlier in the week as
part of a sell-off in the spread.
 ""I think this week is set up for the classic exit strategy
for somebody who had a big position in October Brent,"" said
Richard Ilczyszyn, senior market strategist for MF Global in
Chicago, adding that investors may now have shifted into long
December Brent positions while going short contracts for
December U.S. oil futures.
 SLOWING ECONOMY?
 Weak U.S. economic data capped price gains. The number of
Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose
unexpectedly last week. Business activity in the U.S.
mid-Atlantic region dropped in August for a second month, the
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said. [ID:nS1E78D16W]
 The weak data could add urgency for the Federal Reserve to
give the economy a boost. Chairman Ben Bernanke and colleagues
plan to take an extra day at their policy review next week.
 Many economists expect the Fed to unveil new measures to
lift growth when the meeting concludes on Wednesday.
 Many market watchers said the Fed's program of bond
purchases through June 30, known as quantiative easing or QE2,
helped drive up commodity prices by providing cheap money to
investors who placed it in risky assets.
 ""Commodities have been in direct correlation to
quantitative easing,"" said Keith Springer, President of
Springer Financial Advisors in Sacramento, California.
 MIDDLE EAST TENSIONS
 Oil traders said prices also received support from
heightened tensions between Turkey and Israel, two of the
biggest powers in the Middle East.
 Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said Turkish warships
could be sent to the Eastern Mediterranean escalating a war of
words over the 2010 killing of Turkish activists.

 In Libya, Benghazi-based oil firm Agoco is seeking to
import up to 765,000 barrels of gasoline in the first half of

tighten the Mediterranean oil market in the short-term .

 SINGAPORE, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Oil fell on Thursday as
rising fuel stocks and falling demand in top consumer the United
States reinforced views that slowing economic growth and
Europe's debt crisis will dent energy use, while a stronger
dollar also kept prices under pressure.	
 Brent crude  slid 32 cents to $112.08 a barrel by
0302 GMT, down 12 percent from this year's peak above $127. The
front-month October contract expires later on Thursday. U.S.
crude  fell 28 cents to $88.63. 
 Europe's debt crisis is chipping away confidence and capping
any oil rally. The continent's finance ministers have been
warned confidentially of the danger of a renewed credit crunch
as a ""systemic"" crisis in euro zone sovereign debt spills over
to banks. 
 ""The concern is that what starts as a financial crisis will
drive the cost of borrowing to levels where it is difficult for
the corporate world to invest, depressing economic activity and
putting pressure on oil,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief markets
strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney. 
 ""The dollar is also a key driver.""	
 Asian stocks bounced on Thursday, yet investors remained
wary that obstacles which policymakers face in Europe could
weigh on the euro and Asian currencies in the medium term. The
dollar index firmed 0.1 percent. 
 World Bank President Robert Zoellick said on Wednesday the
world had entered a new economic danger zone and Europe, Japan
and the United States all needed to make hard decisions to avoid
dragging down the global economy. 
 Reflecting slowing growth, U.S. total oil product demand
over the past four weeks fell 0.9 percent from a year earlier,
while gasoline use over the summer declined to an eight-year
low, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.

 Gasoline stocks last week rose 1.9 million barrels, compared
with analyst projections for a 500,000 barrel decline, while
average demand for the motor fuel in the last four weeks fell
2.7 percent from year-ago levels, the EIA said.	
 Distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, rose 1.7

 * Gold eyes $1,759-technicals 
 * Coming Up: U.S. CPI level; 1230 GMT

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Gold slipped more than half a
percent on Thursday after equities rose and the euro ticked up
on optimism over tentative steps by European policy makers to
resolve and limit the region's debt crisis. 
 Gold's failure to revisit recent highs also prompted
investors to trim positions and turn their attention to a series
of economic data from the United States ahead of next week's
meeting of the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) on interest rates.	
 Spot gold fell $4.45 to $1,815.65 an ounce by 0311
GMT, having fallen 0.7 percent in the previous session. Bullion,
which has risen around 27 percent this year, was well below a
lifetime high around $1,920 an ounce struck last week.	
 ""We've seen in the last few days that gold has struggled to
make any headway,"" said Darren Heathcote, head of Investec
Australia in Sydney. ""That is a sign of the market really
waiting for something more substantial, either coming out of
Europe or coming out of the United States."" 
 U.S. gold futures  fell $6.4 to $1,820.10 an ounce.	
 The euro held on to gains against the dollar in another
choppy session on Thursday as stock markets firmed and investors
bought back shares after France and Germany said Greece's place
remains in the euro zone. 
 But sentiments remained volatile as documents revealed that
European finance ministers have been warned confidentially of
the danger of a renewed credit crunch as a ""systemic"" crisis in
euro zone sovereign debt spills over to banks. 
 The uncertainties about global economic growth have driven
gold prices to scale record highs since July, and are still
expected to underpin sentiment for the metal until investors are
convinced the danger of recession is past.
 
 World Bank President Robert Zoellick said on Wednesday the
world had entered a new economic danger zone and Europe, Japan
and the United States all needed to make hard decisions to avoid
dragging down the global economy. 
 ""I would say we'll be watching the U.S. CPI figures ahead of
the FOMC meeting next week. If we do see an acceleration in
inflation, then I think additional Fed action or looser monetary
policy will be more difficult to justify,"" said a dealer in
Singapore.	
 ""I think gold will trade sideways this week. I am looking
for support at $1,800. Gold is becoming a different creature
because of the volatility. We never saw gold trading so volatile
until prices rallied above $1,900."" 
 The Federal Reserve, facing rising global financial strains
and recession fears, is poised to increase downward pressure on
longer-term interest rates next week in a bid to speed up a
sputtering U.S. recovery. 
 Labor Department releases the August Consumer Price
Index at 1230 GMT, with economists in a Reuters survey expecting
a 0.2 percent rise compared with a 0.5 percent rise in July.
Excluding volatile food and energy items, CPI is seen up 0.2
percent, a repeat of the July figure. 
 In the energy market, U.S. crude slipped as rising fuel
inventories and falling demand in top consumer the United States
reinforced views that slowing global economic growth is denting
energy use.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD88.96 a barrel during early Asian trade, rising 0.49%, after hitting a daily low of USD88.44.
Earlier Thursday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration released its weekly report revealing that U.S. crude oil inventories declined by 6.7 million barrels for the week ending September 9.
That exceeded market expectations of a 3.0 million barrel decline, as Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee disrupted oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. 
U.S. crude supplies fell by 4.0 million barrels in the preceding week. 
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 346.4 million barrels as of last week, remaining above the upper limit of the average range for this time of year.
Total motor gasoline inventories increased by 1.9 million barrels, outperforming expectations for a 0.5 million barrel drop, and exposing a mixed picture of U.S. energy demand. 
Meanwhile, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that retail sales in August rose 0.1%,  below market expectations of a 0.2% gain, curbing demand expectations from the world’s largest energy consumer..
A rising U.S. dollar helped to limit oil futures, as dollar-denominated futures contracts tend to fall when the dollar rises.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained 0.09% to 77.44. 
On the ICE Futures Exchange Brent oil futures for October delivery gained 0.16% to trade at USD110.86.

 By Frank Tang and Amanda Cooper
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Gold fell on Wednesday
as urgent efforts to end the euro zone crisis drew investors
back toward riskier markets.
 Increasingly volatile trade in gold over the past month has
also begun to diminish its appeal as a safe-haven asset, even
as the U.S. economy weakens and proposals for more stimulus
measures threaten to drag down the dollar.
 ""Some investors may be pulling back from gold due to its
high volatility, which may act to undermine its safe haven
status,"" said James Steel, chief commodity strategist at HSBC.
 Spot gold  was last down 0.7 percent at $1,821.10 an
ounce by 2:49 p.m. EDT (1849 GMT).
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled down
$3.60 at $1,826.50 an ounce. Trading volume was about 40
percent below its 30-day average, in line with quieter trade
this week.
 Silver  was down 1.4 percent at $40.47 an ounce.
 Encouraging euro zone news dragged bullion throughout the
day. Europe's top bureaucrat said plans for a common euro bond
would soon be presented, while French and German officials
stepped up efforts to get Greece to implement reforms.
 Gold options' implied volatility -- a measure of how much
traders expect prices to move, either up or down -- eased after
hitting its highest in over two years on Monday. Gold was 5
percent lower after it hit a record high above $1,920 an ounce
last Tuesday.
 ""A sharp decline in lease rates over the past two days is
theoretically bearish gold as holders seek to use bullion
holdings to raise cash,"" Steel said.
 The one-month gold lease rate  was around 0.48
percent, according to data by the London Bullion Markets
Association.
 On Monday, gold fell 2.5 percent as investors sold the
precious metal to cover margin calls in battered equity
markets. Gold's decline eased on Wednesday after U.S. data
showed wholesale inflation slowed in August and retail sales
stalled, after consumer confidence plunged. [ID:nS1E78D0B7]
 The CBOE Gold ETF Volatility Index <.GVZ>, often referred
to as the ""Gold VIX"" and based on SPDR Gold Trust options,
tumbled a second day after hitting a two-year high on Monday.
 A developing double-top bearish chart patterns also
triggered some selling. Analysts said a technical reversal
contributed to a slide of bullion from last week's record.

 EURO ZONE DEBT IN FOCUS
 Underlying concern about the deepening European debt crisis
limited bullion's losses.
 European finance ministers have been warned confidentially
of the danger of a renewed credit crunch as a ""systemic"" crisis
in euro zone sovereign debt spills over to banks, according to
documents obtained by Reuters on Wednesday. [ID:nL3E7KE09F]
 Flows of metal into exchange-traded funds backed by
physical gold -- one of a number of gauges of investor demand
-- have risen by 4 percent so far this quarter, compared with a
1 percent rise in the third quarter of 2010.
 The gold market awaits the Federal Reserve's policy meeting
next week for a signal on future U.S. monetary policy.
 The Fed's quantitative easing program helped boost gold,
which is up 40 percent since the start of the central bank's
$600-billion bond-buying spree that ended in June.
 Among platinum group metals, platinum  was up 0.1
percent at $1,811.24 an ounce, while palladium  was down
0.8 percent at $715.85 an ounce.

 NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose Wednesday on hopes the
euro zone's debt crisis would ease, while U.S. oil futures fell following
data showing a surprise increase in U.S. product inventories.
 Brent crude  for October delivery settled at $112.40 a barrel,
gaining 51 cents, snapping four days of losses.
 U.S. October crude  settled at $88.91 a barrel, down $1.30, after
rising above $90 on Tuesday.
 Brent's premium against U.S. crude  widened to $23.49 at the
close from $21.68 on Tuesday as data from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration showed large increases in U.S. gasoline and distillate
stockpiles last week due to poor demand. [EIA/S]

 Trading volume on Brent crude rose about 7 percent while those for U.S.
crude fell nearly 11 percent, both against their 30-day averages, according
to Reuters data.
 U.S. crude's losses came despite an EIA report showing a steep drop in
U.S. crude oil inventories last week. The decline was blamed on the
extended shutdown of offshore oil production due to Tropical Storm Lee.
 ""The DOE data was a mixed bag and even though crude fell more than
expected, the market has ignored that."" said Andy Lebow, broker at MF
Global in New York.
 U.S. crude inventories fell 6.7 million barrels last week, the EIA
said, more than twice the 3.1-million-barrel drawdown forecast in a Reuters
poll. [EIA/S]
 Gasoline stocks jumped 1.94 million barrels against the forecast for a
500,000-barrel decline, and distillate stocks, which include heating oil
and diesel fuel, rose 1.7 million barrels, far more than the 700,000-barrel
build forecast.

 POOR DEMAND HITS U.S. GASOLINE
 The unexpected rise in U.S. gasoline stockpiles last week came as
government data showed that demand for the motor fuel fell to an eight-year
low this summer. [ID:nS1E78D154]
 U.S. gasoline prices were $1 a gallon higher from a year ago to average
$3.62 this summer. U.S. gasoline demand fell 1.8 percent in the same
period, Reuters calculations showed. U.S. retail sales stalled in
August, raising more concerns about the economy relapsing into recession.
That followed data showing zero growth in unemployment earlier this month.
 Investors remain nervous about oil demand prospects following reduced
estimates from forecasters, including the International Energy Agency, this
week because of a weaker economic outlook.
 Brent crude also has gained relative to U.S. crude because of
production problems in the North Sea the past few months and due to the
loss of crude from Libya since February.
 This week, Britain circulated a draft resolution at the United Nations
Security Council that would ease U.N. sanctions against Libya. If passed it
would allow the OPEC member to begin exporting crude more easily.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Spot gold reversed early
gains and lost half a percent on Wednesday following sagging
equities, after rating agency Moody's downgraded two of France's
top banks and fuelled fears of a full-blown banking crisis in
the euro zone.	
 Moody's downgraded Societe Generale and Credit
Agricole , and said it was extending its review of BNP
Paribas . 
 The news did not surprise many in the market, as talk of
problems with French banks have circulated for weeks. 
 ""Part of it has already been priced in, but it certainly
added to the gloom,"" said a Singapore-based trader.	
 Stocks fell in Asia, where some regional indexes hit lows
unseen since 2009, forcing some investors to sell their
profitable gold positions to cover losses elsewhere.

 ""Stocks look really ugly now. In addition there is a
rallying dollar, capping gold's upside,"" said the trader.	
 Spot gold reversed early gains and lost half a
percent to $1,824.09 an ounce by 0651 GMT, after rising 1.1
percent in the previous session.	
 U.S. gold  edged down 0.1 percent to $1,828.20.	
 The dollar rose 0.7 percent against a basket of currencies
, as the euro dropped ahead of a conference call among
leaders of Greece, France and Germany. The greenback is headed
for its 10th day of gains since Aug. 30. 
 
 
 
 Gold bugs need to be aware of possible short-term technical
weakness, even though the euro zone's debt crisis and an
uncertain global economic outlook may keep gold prices buoyant
in the long run.	
 ""Technically we are running into a challenging situation
over the next 2-3 days, as the uptrend from the beginning of
July faces a short-term correction,"" said Dominic Schnider, head
of commodity research of UBS Wealth Management in Singapore.	
 ""People are realising the euro concept, not just the debt
problem, has major flaws and if they are not changing
dramatically in the set-up, we are going to end up in a huge
crisis. This degradation is happening right now and warranting
higher gold prices."" 
 Adding to uncertainties in global growth, China's Premier
Wen Jiabao vowed to keep monetary policy tight to battle
inflation, dashing hopes that Beijing would loosen up policy any
time soon even as the global economy slows. 
 Technical analysis suggested that U.S. gold could move
sideways in the next few weeks, while commodities as a whole may
correct moderately by the end of the year, said Reuters market
analyst Wang Tao. 
 Asia's physical buyers have largely stood on the sidelines
of the gold market, save for occasional entries when prices
dipped near $1,800, dealers said. 
 Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded
fund, SPDR Gold Trust , edged lower to 1,241.311 tonnes by
Sept. 13 from a 2-1/2-week high of 1,241.917 tonnes on September

 SINGAPORE, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Oil fell on Wednesday,
pulling U.S. crude off six-week highs, as investors saw little
upside from declining inventories in an environment where the
euro zone debacle is taking precedence over tightening supply.	
 U.S. crude  shed 79 cents to $89.42 a barrel after
touching $90.52 on Tuesday, the highest intraday price since
Aug. 4. Brent crude  fell 31 cents to $111.58. 
 The euro zone crisis is capping gains in oil prices, said
traders including Ken Hasegawa, a commodity derivatives manager
at Japan's Newedge brokerage, while forecasters are lowering
their demand growth outlooks for this year and next. 
 ""Fundamentally, this market should be declining further,""
Hasegawa said. ""We are seeing a decline in inventories, but that
is not a serious matter, while the financial markets are a very
concerning matter. There is no reason for crude to go higher, so
we are seeing profit-taking."" 
 U.S. crude stockpiles fell a larger-than-expected 5.1
million barrels last week as Tropical Storm Lee disrupted output
in the oil-rich Gulf of Mexico, trade group the American
Petroleum Institute reported on Tuesday. Analysts polled by
Reuters had projected a 3.1-million-barrel drop. 
 The inventory drop, related mostly to seasonal weather
events, is helping U.S. crude benchmark West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) narrow its discount to Brent, which is now trading about
$22 higher following a record premium above $27 last week. 
 Lee shut in nearly 5 million barrels of U.S. oil production
from Sept. 3 to 9, according to Reuters estimates based on
government data. 
 Distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, rose
67,000 barrels, compared with analyst forecasts of a 700,000
barrel gain. Only gasoline painted a more bearish picture, with
stocks up 2.8 million barrels, compared with analyst projections
for a 500,000-barrel drop. 
 But on a longer-term basis, the grim outlook for the global
economy is weighing on oil prices.	
 World oil consumption will increase more slowly than
expected this year and next as the pace of global economic
growth eases, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on
Tuesday. 
 In its monthly oil market report, the Paris-based agency
said financial and economic headwinds were gathering momentum
and significant economic threats skewed the demand side risk to
the downside.	
 ""There is still a lot of uncertainty in Europe and the issue
will not be resolved soon, it will continue for the next three
to six months,"" Hasegawa said.	
 The IEA cut its estimate of global oil demand growth this
year by 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 1.04 million bpd and
trimmed its 2012 demand growth estimate by 190,000 bpd to 1.42
million bpd.
 In other markets, a rebound in Asian stocks and the euro
stalled and gold edged up on Wednesday as investors waited for
convincing signs of progress on taming the euro zone debt
crisis. [ID:nL3E7KE00V	
 Global markets have been roiled since the end of July by the
twin fears of renewed recession in the United States and
Europe's protracted debt woes, which have seen bailouts for
Greece, Ireland and Portugal and sparked fears of a new banking
crisis.	
 The euro held on to modest gains against the greenback in
Asia on Wednesday, as bears trimmed short positions just in case
EU leaders surprised by making progress on Greece in a
conference call later in the day.

1219,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 13, 2011 09:09PM ET</span>",Gold futures lifted in early Asian trade,"Investing.com – Gold futures moved higher in Asian trade Wednesday, in a market focused on European debt and buoyed by a rise in global equities.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,836.75 a troy ounce during early Asian trade, up 0.14%, after hitting a low of USDS1,832.65. 
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed confidence that rescue measures to address Greek debt were progressing, and rejected the notion that Greek bankruptcy would provide a quick solution to the euro-zone’s debt crisis.
Stock markets in the U.S. and Europe closed higher on hopes that Greece would take the steps needed to win approval from the ECB, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission to receive its next batch of funding.
By the end of Tuesday trade, France’s CAC 40 added 1.4% to 2,894.93, Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 0.87% to 5,174.25, and Germany’s DAX advanced 1.85% to end the session at 5,166.36.
Wall Street posted its second consecutive day of gains, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4% to 11,105.85, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.5% to 2,532.15, and the S&P 500 climbed 0.9% to close at 1,172.87.
Concerns over the capacity of debt threatened euro-zone economies, including Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain, to actively address their fiscal woes helped send gold prices to record highs earlier this month.
Bullion has fallen 5% from last Tuesday’s all-time high of USD1,921.05.
Investment bank Morgan Stanley reconfirmed its bullish view on gold in a report published Monday, citing, “a formidable cocktail of macro challenges including financial systemic risk, concern of a double dip recession and sustained low interest rates.”
The lender expects gold prices to average USD1,819 a troy ounce through the end of this year and raised its 2012 forecast to USD2,085 an ounce. 
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver for December delivery rose 0.27% to trade at USD41.17 a troy ounce, while copper for December delivery added 0.19% to trade at USD3.980 a pound.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD89.97 a barrel during early Asian trade, rising 0.13%, after hitting a daily low of USD88.75.
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed confidence that rescue measures to address Greek debt were progressing, and rejected the notion that Greek bankruptcy would provide a quick solution to the euro-zone’s debt crisis.

The IEA forecast oil demand would drop by 160,000 barrels a day in 2011 and by 190,000 barrels per day in 2012.
By the end of 2012, the IEA expects Libyan oil production to hit 1 million barrels per day within six months, and return to pre-war levels of 1.5 million barrels a day within 18 months.
French lender Societe Generale said in a report earlier that it expected Brent prices to average USD98.30 a barrel in the fourth quarter of 2011, as Libyan oil supplies start returning to the market

 NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Brent crude prices slipped on
Tuesday, dragged down by spread selling and a downward revision
to the International Energy Agency's forecast for growth in
global oil consumption due to the struggling economy.
 Traders extended a deep sell-off in the premium of Brent to
U.S. crude futures  into a second day, with the spread
narrowing more than $2 to under $22 a barrel as U.S. futures
pushed above $90 to their highest in five weeks.
 Brent traded lower after the IEA revised its forecast for
global oil demand down by 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) for
2011 and by 190,000 bpd for 2012, citing financial and economic
headwinds. [ID:nL5E7KD10U]
 ""Brent crude and the U.S. product markets are weaker, on
demand concerns reinforced by an (IEA) monthly report that
trimmed demand,"" Tim Evans, energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York, said in a note.
 ICE Brent October crude  fell 36 cents to settle at
$111.89 a barrel, after briefly turning positive in afternoon
trading in New York. The October Brent contract expires on
Thursday.
 The more heavily traded November Brent  contract
lost 42 cents to settle at $109.77 a barrel.
 ""With Libyan production expected to rise, we think Brent
traders are increasingly comfortable selling into the forward
market, while they are less certain over the balance for nearby
October,"" Evans said.
 U.S. October crude  rose $2.02 to settle at $90.21 a
barrel, highest close since Aug. 3, gaining further support
from expectations weekly inventory reports would show a decline
in U.S. stockpiles.
 U.S. gasoline futures  rose slightly and heating oil
, benchmark for spot distillates trades, slipped.
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude  fell to $21.91 a
barrel, after its surge to a record above $27 last week. The
record peaks in 2011 resulted, in part, from the disruption of
Libya's supplies by civil war.
 In its report, the IEA raised its forecast for Libyan crude
oil production by the end of 2011, which would increase global
supplies of light, sweet crude, especially for Libya's primary
pre-civil war customers in Europe.
 ""We still view the $22-25 zone as a sweet spot for the
nearby Brent-WTI spread, at least until some cargoes of Libyan
supply into Europe are realized,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president at
Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a research note.
 Brent and U.S. crude trading volumes both exceeded their
30-day averages.

 By Frank Tang and Jan Harvey
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Gold rose nearly 1
percent on Tuesday, as higher equity markets and a rebound in
the euro reversed some of the previous session's sharp drop
driven by margin-call selling.
 The recent lack of safe-haven bids combined with elevated
price volatility prompted bullion investors to question the
metal's outlook.
 Global stocks and the euro recovered on hopes of political
support for Greece from Europe's top powers. On Monday, gold
briefly dipped below $1,800 an ounce as euro debt fears
prompted investors to sell bullion to cover losses in
equities.
 Gold options' implied volatility -- a measure of how much
traders expect prices to move, either up or down, in the future
-- held near its highest in over two years. Some investors are
turned off by bullion's wild price swings since late August.
 ""Gold's clearly not a safety play for the moment, and it
has become more challenging for gold to test $2,000. It would
require a continuation of global economic problems and
investors reclassifying gold as the safety play again,"" said
Phillip Streible, senior market strategist with MF Global.
 Spot gold  was up 0.8 percent at $1,826.90 an ounce
by 12:22 p.m. EDT (1622 GMT), having earlier fallen as low as
$1,798.75.
 Bullion has dropped 5 percent from last Tuesday's record at
$1,920.30.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  was up
$17.20 at $1,830.50 an ounce.
 Silver  was up 1.4 percent at $40.76 an ounce.
 Concerns over the ability of some euro zone economies --
chiefly Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain -- to manage
their burgeoning debt helped drive gold prices to record highs
above $1,920 an ounce earlier this month.
 The metal has faced headwinds around that level, twice
failing to sustain a rise above $1,900. Gold's correlation with
the euro has turned negative since mid-July, after the common
unit has risen in line with the precious metal in recent years
because both are perceived as alternatives to the U.S. dollar.

 The euro fell against the yen, weighed down by a
disappointing Italian debt auction that saw borrowing costs

 ""Gold's fortunes seem to be waning at the moment. A move
downward through $1,802-$1,807 would likely set off a sizable
sum of stop loss orders. Caution, and we think rather extreme
caution, is advised,"" said independent investor Dennis
Gartman.

 The CBOE Gold ETF Volatility Index <.GVZ>, which is often

options, fell 10 percent on Tuesday after a five-session rally

 Economic uncertainties tends to drive investors to put on
bullish bets in the gold option markets. However, more gold
traders are also using puts to hedge against downside risks
after the metal failed to extend gains beyond a record above

 Por Jessica Donati	
 LONDON, 13 Set (Reuters) - Oil pared early gains after the
International Energy Agency (IEA) cut its estimate for demand
growth and raised its supply forecast on Tuesday, countering
support provided by rebounds in the euro and in stock markets.	
 The IEA, which advises 28 industrialised countries on
policy, said slowing economic growth had led the agency to cut
its oil demand growth forecast by 160,000 barrels per day for
2011 and by 190,000 bpd for 2012. 
 Supply was also seen to rise more rapidly than previously
forecast over the next year, with Libyan crude oil production
capacity coming back sooner than expected and signs OPEC output
was continuing to grow.	
 ""It is possible that we could see an easing in the tightness
of the market in the months ahead,"" said David Fyfe, head of the
IEA's oil industry and markets division. 
 Brent  was flat at $112.25 a barrel at 0913 GMT,
erasing gains of $1 a barrel in the early hours of trade. US
crude  was 34 cents higher at $88.53 a barrel, off an
early high of $89.21.	
 The IEA's revision followed a similar cut in another closely
watched report on Monday by the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries. Disappointing U.S. data was the main worry,
but a slowdown in China and India was also a concern.

 ""Oil demand is weak going forward. If we are going to rely
on the global economy, then we have to rely on China, the only
economy with decent numbers coming out,"" said Rob Montefusco, an
oil trader at Sucden Financial. 
 The world's top consumer, the United States, also lowered
its projection for growth earlier this month, trimming the
figure for demand in 2012 by 250,000 bpd. 


 
 OUTSIDE SUPPORT	
 Stocks steadied and the euro rebounded from a seven-month
low against the dollar after a report that Italy may get
financial support from China, easing worries about defaults in
the euro zone. 
 ""This is a shallow bounce because of Wall Street ending
higher, so there is some confidence returning, but I don't think
anybody would be putting any big positions given the global
situation,"" said Victor Say, an analyst at Informa Global
Markets in Singapore.	
 ""You never know what is going to blow up in Europe next.""
 But an expected drop in U.S. crude inventories was also
supporting markets, with analysts estimating a 3 million barrel
draw last week after Tropical Storm Lee disrupted oil production
in the Gulf of Mexico, a Reuters poll showed. 
 Industry group the American Petroleum Institute will release
its weekly report on Tuesday at 2030 GMT, followed by government
figures from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.	
 In other news, executives at Reuters Russia Investment
summit said Russian oil exports would jump and production rise
as a result of changes to energy taxes designed to help the
world's largest oil producer keep its lead over OPEC heavyweight
Saudi Arabia.

 SINGAPORE, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Oil rose by as much as $1 on
Tuesday as a weaker dollar rekindled some of the appeal of
commodities and concern about Europe's deteriorating debt crisis
eased temporarily.	
 Brent  added 65 cents to $112.90 by 0707
GMT after touching $113.30, having dropped 11 percent from this
year's April peak above $127. U.S. crude  climbed 52 cents
to $88.71 a barrel, off an earlier high of $89.21.	
 Asian stocks steadied and the euro held above a seven-month
low against the dollar after a report that Italy may get
financial support from China lifted Wall Street in late trade
but did nothing to ease fears Europe is descending into a
banking crisis. 
 Traders were wary about the modest oil rally as markets
remain prone to swings in risk appetite, with policy makers
struggling to reassure investors Greece can stay afloat. 
 ""This is a shallow bounce because of Wall Street ending
higher, so there is some confidence returning, but I don't think
anybody would be putting any big positions given the global
situation,"" said Victor Say, an analyst at Informa Global
Markets in Singapore.	
 ""You never know what is going to blow up in Europe next.""
 
 
 
 U.S. crude futures rose on Monday, propped up by spread
trading with Brent crude, which slid on concerns the euro zone
debt crisis could weaken Europe's economy and dent oil demand.

 On Tuesday, the dollar weakened about 0.7 percent against a
basket of currencies, restoring some of the shine of commodities
as an alternative investment. 
 Brent's premium against U.S. crude benchmark West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) remained below $24, down from $25.53 at the
end of last week. It reached a record $27.23 on Sept 6.
 
 
 POLICY MAKERS ON THE MOVE	
 U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner makes a one-day
trip to Poland this week for an unprecedented meeting with euro
zone finance ministers as growing fears of a potential Greek
debt default rip into Europe's banking sector.

 ""The European debt, especially the Greek situation, is not
bound to go away so soon. That, along with the slowing of the
global economy, means you will see some shrinking on demand,
which will weigh on oil prices,"" said Say.	
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut
its forecast for global oil demand growth next year because of a
worsening economic outlook and said a disappointing economic
performance in top consumer the United States could further
weigh on fuel use. 
 OPEC also said concerns were easing about a tight oil supply
and demand balance and it expected Libyan oil output to return
to full capacity in less than 18 months, more quickly than some
estimates.	
 World oil demand will increase by 1.06 million barrels per
day (bpd) in 2011, OPEC said in the report, 150,000 bpd less
than it estimated last month. The growth estimate for next year
was lowered by 40,000 bpd to 1.27 million bpd.	
 
 INVENTORIES SUPPORT 
 Oil prices on Tuesday got some support from an expected drop
in U.S. crude inventories, which may have fallen about 3 million
barrels last week after Tropical Storm Lee disrupted oil
production in the Gulf of Mexico, a Reuters poll showed.	
 Gasoline inventories were expected to have dipped by 400,000
barrels as the U.S. summer driving season ended, while
distillate stocks were forecast to have gained 800,000 barrels.

 Industry group the American Petroleum Institute will release
its weekly report on Tuesday at 2030 GMT, followed by government
figures from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.	
 In other news, Russian oil exports will jump and production
rise as a result of changes to energy taxes that will help the
world's largest oil producer keep its lead over OPEC heavyweight
Saudi Arabia, executives told the Reuters Russia Investment
Summit.

 SINGAPORE, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Gold prices rebounded 1
percent on Tuesday from a sell-off in the previous session, as
heightened worries about the sovereign debt crisis in Europe
remain supportive of safe-haven demand for bullion.	
 The threat of a potential Greek default and a full-blown
banking crisis in Europe triggered a sell-off in equities and
the euro in the previous session, before talks that Italy had
asked China to buy its debt helped ease the panic. 
 Investors are watching a meeting between the U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner and euro zone finance ministers on
Friday to discuss risks posed by European debt contagion.

 ""There is a slow-motion train wreck going on in Europe at
the moment, which is going to be relatively supportive of gold,""
said Nick Trevethan, senior commodities strategist at ANZ.	
 ""All the factors that have been supporting gold for the past
few months are still there. Nothing has changed.""	
 But in the short term, gold could face more downside risk
and prices may test as low as $1,750, he added.	
 Spot gold gained as much as 1.2 percent to $1,835.19
an ounce and eased to $1,823.79 by 0620 GMT, after shedding more
than 2 percent in the previous session.	
 U.S. gold  rose 0.8 percent to $1,827.90, easing from
an intra-day high of $1,838.9.	
 Technical analysis suggested that gold could decline to
$1,759 later in the day, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.

 
 
 
 The daily trading range in spot gold increased from an
average of $20 in July to $51 in August. In the past few
session, gold swung in a range of over $60.	
 The volatility has put off some investors, and led to
concerns that exchanges might increase margin requirements to
protect themselves from potential default.	
 ""There is a possibility of more margin increases going
forward. We've seen a lot of $60-plus intra-day moves, which has
to be concerning exchanges and clearing houses,"" said Trevethan.
 The CME Group raised margin requirements on U.S.
gold futures twice in August. 
 
 STRONG DOLLAR DETERS PHYSICAL BUYING	
 As the euro zone debt crisis threatens the integrity of the
single-currency bloc, the dollar has risen sharply since the end
of August, although the greenback lost 0.6 percent against a
basket of currencies after hitting its highest since late
February in the previous session. 
 An expensive dollar makes commodities priced in the
greenback less attractive for buyers holding other currencies.	
 ""Since the dollar has strengthened, people are not rushing
to buy gold even though prices have fallen from the record
high,"" said a Singapore-based dealer.	
 India, the world's largest gold consumer, is gearing for the
festival and wedding season later this month, which will peak in
later October. 
 Dealers reported purchases from India in recent weeks but
said the high gold prices in rupees have dented buying interest.

1236,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 12, 2011 09:09PM ET</span>",Crude oil rebounds in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - Crude oil futures advanced in Asian trade Tuesday, as investors bought on dips after a two-day decline, and European debt concerns eased following reports that Greece would be receiving a new round of bailout funds. 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD88.88 a barrel during early Asian trade, rising 0.07%, after hitting a daily low of USD88.75.
A Wall Street Journal report cited two senior officials from the International Monetary Fund saying that Greece would receive its next installment of bailout loans later this month.
Greece’s government announced over the weekend it would be imposing new property taxes to cover a EUR2 billion shortfall in its budget for this year.
Earlier in the day, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries lowered its forecast for global oil demand for 2011 and 2012, citing diminished economic growth in developed nations and a drop in U.S. demand.
OPEC said, in its monthly report, that world oil demand through 2011 was expected to total 87.99 million barrels per day, down from its previous forecast of 88.14 million barrels.
""Uncertainties in the oil market are increasing at a time when the recovery of the global economy is losing momentum and is becoming less evident,"" OPEC said.
For 2012, global demand was expected to average 89.26 million barrels per day, compared to OPEC’s August estimate of 89.44 million.
OPEC also forecast that Libyan oil production could reach one million barrels a day within six months, about two-thirds of pre-war levels.
A falling U.S. dollar helped to support oil futures, as dollar-denominated futures contracts tend to rise when the dollar falls.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, eased 0.02% to 77.84. 
On the ICE Futures Exchange Brent oil futures for October delivery gained 0.16% to trade at USD110.86.

1238,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 12, 2011 08:25PM ET</span>",Gold futures fall in early Asian trade,"Investing.com – Gold futures moved lower in Asian trade Tuesday, as reports pointed to the likely resumption of monetary aid to Greece, cooling enthusiasm for the safe-haven precious metal.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,899.55 a troy ounce during early Asian trade, down 0.09%, after hitting a high of USDS1,903.75. 
European Central Bank President Jean-Cluade Trichet said earlier Monday, it remains his “working assumption” that Greece would take the steps needed to win approval from the ECB, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission to receive its next batch of funding.
Trichet’s comments followed a Wall Street Journal report that International Monetary Fund officials said Greece would receive its next round of bailout funds later this month.
Despite the recent pullback in gold prices, German lender Commerzbank said, ""The same factors that strengthened gold's price rally before are still intact in our opinion."" 
""Besides the persistent debt problems in euro-zone countries and the threat of the U.S. economy sliding into recession, interest rates are set to remain at a very low level for an extended period,"" the lender said in a report released earlier.
Greece’s  government, over the weekend, announced it would be imposing a new property tax to cover a EUR2 billion deficit in its budget target for this year.
European investors added further downward pressure on gold, selling the precious metal to cover losses on slumping equities in the region.
By the end of Monday trade, France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.02% to 2,854.81, Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 1.63% to 5,129.62, and Germany’s DAX declined by 2.27% to close the session at 5,072.33.

 By Edward McAllister
 NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell in volatile
trade on Monday, weighed down by concerns the euro zone debt
crisis could dent the global economic recovery and a bout of
spread trading.
 U.S. crude rose more than 1 percent as traders sold the
spread between WTI and Brent crude prices after it widened to a
record high last week.
 Brent futures  fell 52 cents to settle at $112.25 a
barrel, after earlier falling as low as $110.42. U.S. crude
 rose 95 cents to settle at $88.19.
 ""In the Brent market, we are seeing a little more
profit-taking on the WTI-Brent spread and that is why Brent is
down a little and WTI is up,"" said Gene McGillian, analyst at
Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The spread between WTI and Brent crude narrowed to below
$24 after closing at $25.53 on Friday . The spread
hit a record $27.23 on Sept 6.
 U.S. crude has been at a discount to Brent in part due to
the glut of supplies trapped in the U.S. Midwest. A lack of
pipelines has left growing production stranded at the Cushing
storage hub without access to refineries on the Gulf Coast.
 In afternoon trading volumes in New York, Brent trade was
twenty percent above the 30-day average, with U.S. crude 13
percent below the 30-day average.
 Wall Street dipped in volatile trade, on concern about the
global economy. [.N].
 Worries mounted that Greece may default on its debts, after

 OPEC CUTS FORECAST
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut
its forecast for global oil demand growth next year because of
a worsening economic outlook. OPEC said a disappointing U.S.
economic performance could further weigh on fuel use.
 OPEC said in a report world oil demand would rise 1.06
million barrels per day (bpd) in 2011, 150,000 bpd less than
that expected last month. The growth estimate for next year was
lowered by 40,000 bpd to 1.27 million bpd. [ID:nL3E7KC2CU]
 Investors were also looking at data that showed China's
implied oil demand in August slipped to its lowest rate this
year as maintenance and accidents cut into refinery
production.
 Fuel consumption in the world's No.2 user has been losing
steam since May, with growth easing from the double-digit pace
seen since last year as higher crude costs have squeezed
refining margins and Beijing's credit tightening cut into fuel
spending.
 Still, on a year-on-year basis, China's oil use expanded
7.8 percent, Reuters calculations based on preliminary
government data showed on Saturday. [ID:nL3E7K928K]
 Concern eased regarding damage to U.S. Gulf oil
infrastructure after Tropical Storm Nate made landfall in
central eastern Mexico. No other major weather disturbances
were expected to affect the hydrocarbon-rich region in the
short term.
 Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday as it
moved further inland after cutting Mexican oil production by
178,800 barrels a day as of Friday. Mexico's Dos Bocas port
re-opened to shipping on Sunday, but the crude-exporting hub of
Cayo Arcas remained closed. [ID:nS1E78A01P]
 Oil markets also eyed production and exports of Libyan
crude following the country's power transition. Libyan oil firm
Arabian Gulf Oil Company said on Monday it restarted production
at the eastern oil field of Sarir in an early sign the industry
is coming back to life. [ID:nL5E7KC16E]

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Gold dropped 2.5
percent on Monday, falling further from last week's record
highs, as mounting fears about the European debt crisis
prompted investors to sell bullion to cover losses in equity
markets.
 Spot gold  has recoiled since jumping to a record
high last Tuesday of $1,920.30. While viewed as a safe haven,
gold often falls during a stock market sell-off as investors
tap the liquid gold market to meet equities margin calls.
 Fears of a potential Greek default that could spread
through global markets slammed stock markets, triggering heavy
liquidation in gold. U.S. equities reboundeded in late trade to
close higher, lifted by a technology merger agreement and hopes
China might purchase Italian government debt.
 But Wall Street's bounce did not lift bullion from sharp
early losses, traders said.
 Some warned that technical signals pointed to more downside
for gold.
 ""We have some technical selling now coming into the market.
If we poke our head below the $1,800 level, we can see a fairly
rapid downward acceleration that might carry us back down to
$1,700,"" said Frank McGhee, head precious metals trader at
Integrated Brokerage Services LLC.
 Spot gold  was down 2.3 percent at $1,814.39 an ounce
by 3:42 p.m. (1942 EDT). It fell more than 1 percent last week,
its sharpest weekly decline since late June.
 U.S. December gold futures  settled down $46.20 at
$1,813.30 an ounce. Trading volume was in line with its 30-day
average, Reuters data showed.
 Silver  was down 3 percent at $40.10 an ounce.
 ""We had a similar situation in 2008, when stock markets
dropped and pulled gold lower, as some hedge funds had to
compensate loses by liquidating gold positions,"" said Peter
Fertig, a consultant at Quantitative Commodity Research.
 ""Depending on whether the situation in stock markets calms
down, this could go on for another couple of days,"" he said.
 Greece confirmed on Monday that it had cash for only a few
more weeks. [ID:nL5E7KC0F1] Investor confidence also was
rattled by concerns that Moody's Investors Service could
downgrade the credit-worthiness of French banks, which are
widely exposed to Greek bonds.

 GOLD VOLATILITY SPIKES
 Gold options' implied volatility -- a measure of how much
traders expect prices to move, either up or down, in the future

double its level of early July.
 In addition, more gold option traders are using puts to
hedge against downside risks after the metal failed to extend
gains above a record above $1,900 an ounce last week, and for
the second time in past three weeks. [ID:S1E78B1KW]
 Volatility in other markets also affects gold. The CBOE
Volatility Index <.VIX>, also known as the Wall Street fear
gauge, jumped almost 10 percent to over 40 on Monday.
 Early in the session, gold priced in euros  rose
to a record 1,373.92 euros an ounce as the European currency
fell sharply against the dollar and the Japanese yen. [FRX/]
 The gold price has risen by a third so far this year and by
22 percent in the third quarter alone, its largest quarterly
gain since 1986, driven by a push by investors seeking an
alternative to sinking currencies and volatile stocks.
 In platinum group metals, platinum  fell 1.2 percent
to $1,807 an ounce, and palladium  fell 3.1 percent to
$700.18 an ounce.

 SINGAPORE, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Gold fell more than 1 percent
on Monday after ending at its lowest level since June last week
but bargain hunters could cushion the fall, while escalating
worries about Europe's debt crisis sent bullion priced in euro
to a record high.	
 Fears about a Greek default rose after senior politicians in
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right coalition started
talking openly about it following the surprise departure of
German's top official at the European Central Bank last
week. 
 Spot gold dropped $29.77 to $1,827.39 an ounce by
0702 GMT, well below a lifetime high of around $1,920 struck
last week, with speculators still cashing in on the metal to
cover losses in equities. 
 ""We still lean negative in our bias and expect a fall
toward $1,750 over the next week or so,"" said Tom Pawlicki,
precious metals and energy analyst at MF Global. 
 ""A decline may be anything but a straight line fall, as
volatility is likely to remain."" 
 U.S. gold futures  also fell more than 1 percent to a
low of around $1,828 an ounce.	
 But gold priced in euro struck a record high at
1,373.92 euros as the single currency fell against the U.S.
dollar on Europe's debt crisis -- a factor which had initially
lifted cash gold to a record.	
 Debt-laden Greece will run out of cash next month, the
country's deputy finance minister said on Monday, highlighting
the country's need to qualify for the next tranche out of its
ongoing EU/IMF bailout. 
 ""Strength in the dollar is weighing on gold. I think perhaps
some investors are also concerned about the extreme volatility
in gold,"" said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures in
Singapore.	
 ""So there is some short-term profit taking before the
longer-term uptrend may continue. If gold comes down further to
about $1,800 level, I think we could see some buyers coming back
to the market."" 

 
 European and Asian stocks slid on Monday, while the euro
dived to a seven-month low against the U.S. dollar as more
negative news from Europe hit already shaky sentiment, and
markets were also bracing for possible ratings downgrades on
France's top banks, as well as Italy's sovereign rating.

 The uncertainties about global economic growth have driven
gold prices to record highs since July, and are expected
to underpin sentiment for the metal until investors are
convinced the danger of recession is past. 
 The physical sector saw bargain hunting from jewellers in
Indonesia and Thailand, keeping premiums for gold bars steady.

 ""The interest is there. Most jewellers in Indonesia are back
to work after the Muslim holiday. The wedding season is coming
up in India, so their demand should pick up,"" said a dealer in
Singapore. 
 Buying is expected to pick up in top consumer India, where
the wedding season, traditionally the period of greatest bullion
demand, gets under way in September. 
 Gold demand, which dropped in the second quarter of this
year, is expected to strengthen by the end of 2011, driven by
robust jewellery buying in India and China and recovery in
investment demand, senior World Gold Council officials said.

 ""For today, there is little market moving economic data
scheduled for release. The focus of financial markets and gold
could remain on the euro zone debt crisis,"" said Ong of Phillip
Futures.	
 ""Later this week, we are seeing quite a bit of economic
data: retail sales, industrial output etc."" 
 In the energy market, Brent crude oil fell by more than $2
on Monday as investors sold commodities on worries over the
European debt crisis and slowing global growth.

 NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil rose in
choppy trade on Monday as U.S. equity markets pared losses,
outweighing concern about Europe's debt crisis.
 Brent fell earlier on worries that Greece may default on
its debt, but rose with U.S. crude as Wall Street bounced of
its lows.
 ""It looks like a bit of a short-covering rally spurred on
by equities not getting decimated today. Oil traders are
responsive to that,"" said Richard Ilczyszyn, senior market
strategist at MF Global in Chicago.
 Brent futures  rose 51 cents to $113.28 a barrel by
12:03 p.m. EDT (1403 GMT), after earlier falling as low as
$110.42. U.S. crude  rose $1.24 to $88.48.
 Wall Street at one point was nearly flat on Monday as
European bank shares recovered after early losses and
technology stocks regained their footing. [.N]
 Worries increased that Greece may default on its debts
after finance ministers of the Group of Seven (G7)
industrialized economies pledged a joint response to the
slowdown but offered nothing specific to help their economies.

 China's oil demand coverage: [O/CNDEMAND]
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut
its forecast for global oil demand growth next year because of
a worsening economic outlook and said a disappointing U.S.
economic performance could further weigh on fuel use.
 OPEC said in a report world oil demand would rise 1.06
million barrels per day (bpd) in 2011, 150,000 bpd less than
that expected last month. The growth estimate for next year was
lowered by 40,000 bpd to 1.27 million bpd. [ID:nL3E7KC2CU]
 Investors were also looking at data that showed China's
implied oil demand in August slipped to its lowest rate this
year as maintenance and accidents cut into refinery
production.
 Fuel consumption in the world's No.2 user has been losing
steam since May, with growth easing from the double-digit pace
seen since last year as higher crude costs have squeezed
refining margins and Beijing's credit tightening cut into fuel
spending.
 Still, on a year-on-year basis, China's oil use expanded
7.8 percent, Reuters calculations based on preliminary
government data showed on Saturday. [ID:nL3E7K928K]
 Concern eased regarding damage to U.S. Gulf oil
infrastructure after Tropical Storm Nate made landfall in
central eastern Mexico. Also, no other major weather
disturbances expected to affect the hydrocarbon-rich region in
the short term.
 Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday as it
moved further inland after cutting Mexican oil production by
178,800 barrels a day as of Friday. Mexico's Dos Bocas port
re-opened to shipping on Sunday, but the crude-exporting hub of
Cayo Arcas remained closed. [ID:nS1E78A01P]
 Oil markets also eyed production and exports of Libyan
crude following the country's power transition. Libyan oil firm
Arabian Gulf Oil Company said on Monday it restarted production
at the eastern oil field of Sarir in an early sign the industry
is coming back to life. [ID:nL5E7KC16E]

 By Alejandro Barbajosa	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Oil fell by about $1 on
Monday with a stronger dollar as investors shunned commodity
risk because of Europe's deepening sovereign debt crisis, while
economic gloom dampened the outlook for energy use.	
 Brent crude  fell as much as 97 cents to $111.80 a
barrel and was down 0.7 percent at $111.99 by 2255 GMT, while
U.S. crude  slid 87 cents to $86.37. The dollar climbed
about 0.25 percent against a basket of currencies .	
 Risk aversion erased about 3 percent of Brent's value in the
previous two sessions on speculation Greece would default, while
G7 finance ministers pledged a coordinated response on Friday to
the global economic slowdown, but offered no specific steps and
differed in emphasis on Europe's debt crisis. 
 ""People are quite nervous about Greece and other countries
in the European area, so that is why investors are escaping to
the dollar,"" said Tetsu Emori, a fund manager at Tokyo-based
Astmax Co Ltd. ""It's risk aversion."" 
 Greece on Sunday slapped a new tax on real estate to plug a
2011 budget hole, please international lenders and secure a key
new loan tranche as concerns mounted in Europe over its euro
zone membership. 
 Vague pledges and a lack of action by Group of Seven
industrialised nations underscored differences between Europe
and the United States and a lack of room to manoeuvre in the
face of the worst loss of confidence since the credit crisis.	


 Concern about damage to U.S. Gulf oil infrastructure eased
after Tropical Storm Nate made landfall in central eastern
Mexico over the weekend, with no other major weather
disturbances expected to affect the hydrocarbon-rich region in
the short term.	
 Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday as it
moved farther inland, after cutting Mexican oil production by
178,800 barrels a day as of Friday. The Dos Bocas port re-opened
to shipping on Sunday, but the crude-exporting hub of Cayo Arcas
remained closed along with two other smaller ports.

 Hedge funds and other large investors reduced their futures
and options net long positions on the New York Mercantile
Exchange by 5,780 contracts to 155,837 in the week to Sept. 6,
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commision said on Friday.

 Oil markets were also eyeing production and exports of
Libyan crude following the country's convulsed power
transition. About 2 million barrels of very light crude oil have
been offered via a tender, making it the largest volume to come
to market since war erupted in February.

U.S. and European stock markets sank in Friday trade, following the announced resignation of European Central Bank Governing Council member Juergen Stark, who was reportedly opposed to a resumption of a bond-buying program by the central bank.
Stark’s resignation helped to reignite fears over European sovereign debt and the ECB’s efforts to expand the European Financial Stability Facility, a rescue fund for debt threatened euro-zone members.
 In afternoon trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.72%, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.48%, and the S&P 500 declined 2.63%.

Meanwhile, G-7 officials met in Marseille, France to discuss European debt as well as recent moves by Japan and Swiss national banks to curb growth of their currencies.
A rising U.S. dollar helped to drag down oil futures, as dollar-denominated futures contracts tend to fall when the dollar rises.

 By Barani Krishnan and Jan Harvey
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Gold slid on Friday,
closing its worst week since June, as profit-taking by
investors and a spike in the U.S. dollar outweighed the desire
for a safer haven.
 Gold tumbled in early U.S. hours on apparent investor
liquidation, but clawed back much of its loss by mid-afternoon
as the resignation of European Central Bank policymaker Juergen
Stark reignited aversion to riskier assets. [ID:nL5E7K91CF]
 But even as U.S. stocks fell nearly 3 percent and other
commodities tumbled, gold came under renewed pressure as two
weeks of extreme volatility for bullion rattled some confidence
in its bull run -- despite the prospect of a second recession.
 ""The weakness in stocks and the drop in bond yields to new
lows have helped gold come back today, but I doubt people are
building new long positions ahead of the weekend,"" said James
Steel, metals analyst at HSBC in New York.
 ""Everyone's cautious after this wild week.""
 By 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT), spot gold  was down half
a percent at around $1,858 an ounce, off an earlier low under
$1,825. For the week, however, the spot price, which tracks
trades in bullion, was down 1.4 percent -- its sharpest loss
since the week ending June 26.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$2 at $1,859.50, after touching an intraday low at $1,825.50.
 The spot and futures prices hit record highs above $1,920
an ounce on Tuesday, before logging daily swings of up to $87.
 Wall Street stocks <.SPX>, oil  and copper 
fell about 3 percent. U.S. Treasuries [US/] joined gold in
moving up, amid demand for so-called safe havens.
 Worries that the U.S. Congress was unlikely to approve much
of President Barack Obama's $447 billion plan to get jobless
Americans working again added to investor angst.
[ID:nN1E7880DX]
 ""Gold's working into a quiet Friday close after being
pushed around again from lows to highs,"" said George Nickas, a
futures broker at FC Stone in New York.
 The strong dollar was suspected to be another factor
restraining gold from breaking out into a new rally. The U.S.
currency <.DXY> was up 1.2 percent against a basket of
currencies after the euro  fell around 1.6 percent.

 Some traders said gold also came under pressure from
platinum, which looked increasingly attractive to some
investors after the white metal's prices fell below gold's this
week.
 ""Historically gold is about half the price of platinum,""
said Lars Steffenson, managing director at Ebullio Capital

trade after hitting its lowest level on Friday, but it was
heading for a weekly loss as investors digested plans by U.S.
President Barack Obama to spur economic growth which could dent
bullion's safe-haven appeal. 
 Although the lingering debt crisis in Europe and volatile
currencies are supportive for gold, the metal could take its cue
from Obama's $447 billion jobs proposal. 
 Spot gold hit an intraday low of $1,853.39 an ounce
before rising 0.33 percent to $1,874.40 an ounce by 0644 GMT,
which was still below a lifetime high of around $1,920 hit this
week.	
 ""I think Obama's speech was actually better than expected.
The market was pricing in for a $300 billion dollar package,""
said Natalie Robertson, a commodities strategist at ANZ.	
 ""Also a senior Republican said the proposal merits
consideration, so that could also be seen as a sign the
Republicans could pass the bill. The risk for gold is to the
downside, but I think it will settle at around $1,800 to
$1,810.""	
 Other markets shrugged off the speech and instead focused on
economic data from China, with the Nikkei down more than 2
percent for the week and the dollar index off two-month highs.

 U.S. gold futures  jumped more than 1 percent to a
high of $1,880, which helped pluck cash gold from intraday lows.	
 
 European stock index futures fell on Friday, following Asian
markets lower, as Obama's jobs package failed to entice
investors back into equities amid concerns that it could be
hamstrung by political wrangling. 
 Gold, which shrugged off China's inflation data for August,
which was within market expectations, is likely to look to U.S.
stocks for direction.	
 ""Let's see how the U.S. stocks react, and I think nobody
wants to go short at around these levels,"" said a physical
dealer in Hong Kong. ""We don't see much selling in the physical
market, but investors do take profits at high levels."" 
 Investors turned their attention again to the state of the
U.S. economy after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said
the U.S. central bank ""will do all it can"" to boost economic
growth and reduce unemployment, but disappointed investors by
not offering details. 
 The uncertainties about global economic growth have driven
gold prices to scale record highs since July, and are expected
to underpin sentiment for the metal until investors are
convinced the danger of recession is past. 
 ""The lack of details on the further stimulus plans that the
Fed could pursue may prompt some short-term profit taking in
gold. However, in the long term, I think gold remains attractive
amidst slowing growth and economic uncertainty,"" said Ong Yi
Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures. 
 ""Time will be needed before the measures proposed by
President Obama are implemented and translate into growth.
Effects will be lagged and it's not going to improve the job
markets so quickly."" 
 In the energy market, Brent crude oil edged up towards $115
a barrel on Friday, after falling more than a dollar in the
previous session, supported by storm threats and Obama's plan to
revive the economy of world's largest oil consumer.

 NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday as
the euro and equities tumbled on increasing gloom over economic
growth and reinforced worries about Europe's debt problems.
 Despite the day's losses, Brent and U.S. crude futures
posted small gains for the week. Prices rose earlier in the
week on tropical weather threats to U.S. output and a ruling by
Germany's top court briefly soothed euro zone debt fears.
 The euro fell to a 6-1/2-month low against the dollar as
risk aversion increased on news that a member of the European
Central Bank's Executive Board will step down due to a conflict
over controversial ECB bond-buying. [USD/] [ID:nF9E7JT009]
 The dollar index <.DXY>, measuring the greenback against a
basket of other currencies, gained more than 1 percent.
 Dollar strength can pressure oil by making it less
affordable for consumers using other currencies and by
attracting investment to markets offering better returns.
 U.S. stocks tumbled more than 2 percent as the ECB news
reinforced concerns about the region's debt and as investors
remained skeptical about how much of U.S. President Barack
Obama's $447 billion proposal to generate jobs would make it
through Congress. [.N]
 ""Worries about the economy are resurfacing. Oil is tracing
the plunging equity markets and strong dollar,"" said Gene
McGillian, analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford,
Connecticut.
 ICE Brent October crude  fell $1.78 to settle at
$112.77 a barrel, swinging from $110.93 to $115.17. Front-month
Brent managed a fourth straight weekly gain, but rose only 44
cents, or 0.39 percent.
 Brent fell under its 100-day moving average at $114.22 and
the 60-day MA of $112.69, according to Reuters data, but
bounced back ahead of its 30-day MA at $110.68.
 U.S. October crude  settled down $1.81, 2 percent, at
$87.24 a barrel, having dropped as low as $85.64. U.S.
front-month crude posted a third consecutive weekly gain, up
only 79 cents, just under 1 percent.
 The Brent premium to its U.S. counterpart  was
at $25.53 a barrel based on settlements, after reaching a
record $27.23 intraday on Tuesday.
 Brent trading volume was 23 percent above the 30-day
average and slightly outpaced U.S. crude volume that was 15
percent below its 30-day average.
 Speculators cut their net long U.S. crude oil futures and
options positions in the week to Sept. 6, the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commision said. [ID:nEMS1ISDUN]
 U.S. gasoline  and heating oil  futures also
fell. Gasoline ended nearly 4 percent lower after last Monday's
Labor Day holiday, the traditional end of the U.S. summer
driving season.
 Also bearish for oil, especially Brent, was news that about
2 million barrels of Libyan crude have been offered via a
tender, the largest volume to come to market since civil war
erupted in February. [ID:nL5E7K92HJ]

 By Randy Fabi	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil edged up
towards $115 a barrel on Friday, after falling more than a
dollar in the previous session, supported by storm threats and
the U.S. president's latest plan to revive the world's largest
economy.	
 Brent for October delivery  was on track for a weekly
gain of more than 2 percent this week, trading up 35 cents at
$114.90 a barrel by 0247 GMT.	
 U.S. crude oil  rose 40 cents to $89.45 a barrel and
was set to gain more than 3 percent this week. 
 Concerns over economic growth and tepid demand for oil
continue to be the main pressure points for the oil markets,
offsetting bullish sentiment from Libya's civil war, hurricanes
and a battered U.S. dollar.	
 ""The question for the oil market is on demand destruction
and how confident the consumer is, both of which are very
uncertain,"" said Jeremy Friesen, commodity strategist at Societe
Generale in Hong Kong.	
 ""If European and U.S. policymakers can find some compromise
and willingness to work together before economics force their
hand, then that is bullish for oil. But I think we will probably
see the market grind sideways,"" Friesen added.
 
 
 
 JOBLESS PROBLEM 
 U.S. President Barack Obama unveiled a $447 billion package
of tax cuts and new spending to revive a stalled job market but
he faces an uphill fight with Republicans. 
 The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless
benefits rose unexpectedly last week, according to Labor
Department data released just hours before Obama's speech to
Congress. 
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, also highlighting an
elevated jobless rate and sluggish underlying growth, hinted the
central bank may ease monetary policy further at its September
meeting.	
 But investors were disappointed he did not offer details on
what measures Fed policymakers would pursue, sending the Dow
Jones Industrial Average down more than 100 points on Thursday.

 The U.S. dollar index barely reacted to Obama's job
package, trading down 0.24 percent to 76.065.	
 Oil found continuing support from the busy 2011 hurricane
season in the Atlantic.	
 Tropical Storm Nate, the 14th named storm, was gaining
strength and could become a hurricane on Friday or Saturday, the
U.S. National Hurricane Center said. 
 The tropical storm has prompted producers in the Gulf of
Mexico to begin another round of evacuations of nonessential
workers. 
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration said commercial
oil inventories fell nearly 4 million barrels last week, far
deeper than the forecast for a 1.9 million barrel drawdown.	
 Inventories dropped as imports slid more than 1 million
barrels per day with offloading hampered by Hurricane Irene's
passage through the East Coast that also compelled refineries to
cut utilization rates by more than a quarter.

1263,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 08, 2011 09:11PM ET</span>",Crude oil retreats in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - Crude oil futures declined in Asian trade Friday, but held at near five-week highs as a government report showed that U.S. crude stockpiles fell more than expected.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD88.51 a barrel during early Asian trade, rising 0.37%.
Oil earlier rose as much as 0.89% to trade at USD90.28 a barrel, just below the previous day’s five-week high of USD90.39 a barrel.  
Earlier Thursday, the Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. crude oil inventories fell by 4.0 million barrels for the week ending September 2, far below market expectations of a 2.2 million barrel decline.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 353.1 million barrels in the EIA’s latest report, after rising by 5.3 million barrels the previous week.
Total gasoline supplies dropped by 0.87 million barrels to 209.9 million, below forecasts of a 1.2 million barrel decline.
In a highly anticipated speech Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke provided no suggestions of possible moves by the Fed to institute further quantitative easing, leaving investors no new clues as to future U.S. oil demand.
Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Nate continued to move into the Gulf of Mexico, threatening to become a hurricane in the next 48 hours, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.
British Petroleum and Apache Corp. were reported already beginning evacuations of some non-essential workers from facilities in the region.
The Gulf is home to 29% of U.S. oil production facilities.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell 0.18% to 76.21. 
Dollar-denominated futures contracts tend to rise when the dollar falls, as oil future purchases become less expensive for investors who hold other currencies.
On the ICE Futures Exchange Brent oil futures for October delivery rose 0.11% to trade at USD114.41.

1265,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 08, 2011 08:31PM ET</span>",Gold futures rise in early Asian trade,"Investing.com – Gold futures moved higher in Asian trade Friday, as downbeat comments from European and U.S. central bank leaders boosted the appetite for safe-haven investments.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,866.45 a troy ounce during early Asian trade, up 0.03%, after hitting a daily low of USDS1,861.75. 
Speaking at a post-policy meeting press conference in Frankfurt, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said the euro-zone economy was facing “particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks.” 
The ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1.5% after previous hikes in April and July, as second quarter euro-zone gross domestic product grew by a scant 0.2% in the second quarter.
The ECB revised down its outlook for economic growth for 2011 and 2012 and warned of ""tightened"" financing conditions in the single currency bloc.
Gold also got a lift from the U.S. Department of Labor report, released earlier Thursday, that the number of Americans that filed for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly for the week ending September 2.
Jobless claims rose by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 414,000, above market forecasts of a decline to 405,000. The previous week’s figure was revised up to 412,000 from 409,000.
Safe-haven alternatives were additionally supported by a downturn on Wall Street where U.S. shares posted their fourth loss in the past five sessions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.04%, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.78%, and the S&P 500 declined 1.06%.
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver for December delivery added 0.11% to trade at USD42.43 a troy ounce, while copper for December delivery rose 0.03% to trade at USD4.121 a pound.

 By Barani Krishnan and Amanda Cooper
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Gold rose 3 percent on
Thursday, erasing the previous day's loss, as investors awaited
President Obama's speech on the U.S. economy, after a dim
outlook for the euro zone from the European Central Bank.
 Obama will address Congress at 7:00 p.m. (2300 GMT) on an
estimated $300 billion plan to spur job creation. Gold will be
trading in Friday's Asian session at that time.
 ""I'd be interested to see how the President's speech
outlines another $300 billion in stimulus to boost the economy,
all of which will be bullish for gold,"" said Sean McGillivray,
head of asset allocation at Great Pacific Wealth Management in
Grants Pass, Oregon.
 ""The fundamentals are in place for gold as a safe-haven,
but expect a lot of volatility as it is a very small market
compared to U.S. Treasuries, and there's so much attention on
it now, so market swings will be the norm.""
 Obama will make tax cuts for middle-class households and
businesses the centerpiece of his stimulus plan and press for
new spending to repair roads, bridges and other deteriorating
infrastructure. He had pushed through a bigger $800 billion
stimulus package in 2009. [ID:nN1E7870HE]
 Earlier on Thursday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke,
also pledged to boost growth and fight joblessness but offered
no details. [ID:nW1E7IR02M]
 Both bullion and U.S. futures of gold closed down 3 percent
on Wednesday as investors sold the precious metal and bought
stocks after a German court ruling that was seen aiding
Berlin's participation in euro zone bailouts.
 ""In the medium term to long term, it's pretty clear that
the bullish trend hasn't been tarnished a bit,"" said Pradeep
Unni, senior analyst for gold at Richcomm Global Services in
Dubai. ""We take yesterday's slide as a correction which is good
for the overall bullish market.""
 In Thursday's session in Asia, gold finished sharply higher
as traders expected more physical demand for bullion from
Wednesday's price drop. Demand anticipated ahead of the wedding
season in India -- a time when jewelry buying peaks -- also
boosted prices. [GOL/AS]
 Gains in gold accelerated during the European session after
the ECB signaled a halt in interest rate hikes in the euro
zone, driving the euro lower. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet
said he expected ""particularly high uncertainty and intensified
downside risks"" to the region's growth.
 By 3:20 p.m. (1920 GMT) in New York, spot gold ,
which tracks trades in bullion, was up about $54 or 3 percent
at near $1,870 an ounce.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  also jumped
more than $50 or 3 percent to above $1,873 an ounce in
post-settlement trade, after finishing the official session up
2.2 percent at $1,857.50.
 Reuters data showed gold prices have moved by more than $50
only 16 times in the past 40 years with seven of those moves
occurring in the past month alone.
 For the year thus far, both the spot and futures prices
have risen more than 30 percent, heading closer to the $2,000
per ounce target long anticipated by gold bulls.
 Swiss bank UBS raised its forecast for the average price of
gold to $2,075 an ounce from an earlier $1,380. It also boosted
its 2011 price view to $1,665 from $1,500 previously.
[ID:nL3E7K81E9]
 ""At this point in time, there is nothing else that can act
as a safe haven,"" said Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS
Finance in London. ""Buy gold or just keep your cash under the
mattress. Those are the only real (safe-haven) options.""

 SINGAPORE, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Gold prices bounced back more
than 1 percent on Thursday, boosted by bargain-hunters after the
previous session's fall of 3 percent, ahead of a speech by U.S.
President Barack Obama that could allay recession fears.	
 Obama will lay out a jobs package worth more than $300
billion later on Thursday, after data showed the world's top
economy added no new jobs in August. 
 Gold prices dipped to below $1,800 in the previous session,
triggering a wave of buying during Asian hours. The price of
cash gold rose as much as 1.5 percent to $1,843.49 an
ounce and pared some gains to $1,840.66 by 0641 GMT.	
 The most-active U.S. gold futures contract  rose 1.6
percent to $1,846.6, before easing to $1,843.50.	
 
 
 
 The uncertainties around global economic growth have
propelled gold to consecutive record highs since July, and are
expected to underpin sentiment for the metal until investors are
convinced the danger of recession is past.	
 Obama's speech may offer hopes of improving the labour
market, but the uptick in risk appetite is likely to be
temporary.	
 ""All his package may do is lessen the fallout of recent
knocks to confidence from the euro zone sovereign debt crisis
and U.S. ratings downgrade,"" said David Thurtell, a Citigroup
analyst.	
 Buyers rushed to the physical gold market after prices
dropped as much as 6.6 percent in the past two sessions from a
record high of $1,920.3 hit on Tuesday. 
 
 RISK APPETITE IMPROVES	
 Investors abandoned precious metals for the riskier stock
market on Wednesday, as Germany's top court rejected lawsuits
aimed at blocking German participation in emergency loan
packages, but gave its parliament more say in
bailouts. 
 The euro slipped and European stock index futures inched up
ahead of a European Central Bank meeting later that is expected
to call a halt to its rate tightening circle to support
economies battered by the debt crisis. 
 Technical analysis suggested that spot gold could fall
towards $1,793.19 later in the day, said Reuters market analyst
Wang Tao. 
 ""The gold market is anticipated to maintain its downward
trend in the near-term, with a fall toward $1,750 possible over
the next few days,"" Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at MF Global, said
in a research note.	
 The direction of the market is less than certain, as an
uncertain economic outlook in the United States and Europe,
mixed data, Obama's job packages and deteriorating technical
indicators vie for investors' attention.	
 In a sign indicating caution among gold investors, holdings
of SPDR Gold Trust and iShares Silver Trust have
remained unchanged for a few days.

 NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Crude oil futures fell in
choppy trading on Thursday, following Wall Street lower after
the U.S. Federal Reserve Chief gave a speech that lacked new
steps to spur economic growth, and as the dollar rose sharply.
 In early trade, oil dipped on data showing many more
Americans than expected filed new claims for jobless benefits,
stoking worries about the economy. [ID:nN1E7870A9] Oil then
rose to session highs after government data showed U.S. crude
inventories fell much more than expected last week and on
prospects of more bad weather in the Gulf of Mexico.
 In London, Brent crude for October delivery  settled
at $114.55 a barrel, falling $1.25, after extending the day's
low to $114.20. Its session high was $116.60, the highest for
front-month Brent since August 2.
 U.S. October crude  settled at $89.05, slipping 29
cents, dropping from a session high of $90.23, which was below
its Wednesday high of $90.48. It fell as low as $88.59.
 Brent's premium against U.S. crude, also known as West
Texas Intermediate, narrowed to $25.50 at the close, from
$26.46 on Wednesday. The premium hit an intraday record of
$27.23 on Tuesday. 
 ""The dollar rose against the euro and that pulled down U.S.
equities, dragging crude futures lower."" said Tom Knight,
trader at petroleum product marketeres Truman Arnold in
Dallas,
 ""Crude rose on the inventory drawdown earlier ... a deeper
sell-off is being prevented by fears that Tropical Storm Nate
may head to areas in the Gulf of Mexico where there are
production sites."" Knight added.
 The euro slid on signals from the European Central Bank of
intensified risks to euro zone growth. The dollar rose further
against the single currency fell deeper as Fed Chief Ben
Bernanke pledged to help shore up the U.S. economy, although he
did not specify what action the Fed would take. [USD/] <.DXY>
 Wall Street fell back after Bernanke's comments as
investors were disappointed he did not offer details on what
measures Fed policymakers would pursue. [.N]
 For details of Bernanke's speech, see [ID:nN1E7860OB]
 Traders were cautious ahead of a speech by U.S. President
Barack Obama before the U.S. Congress that will call for urgent
steps to spur the economy and create jobs.
 Obama is scheduled to speak at 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT) and is
expected to lay out a $300 billion jobs plan.
 Earlier, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet underlined risks to the economy at a press conference
following the ECB's decision to keep interest rates steady, as
expected. [ID:nECBNEWS]
 CRUDE STOCKS DOWN SHARPLY, NATE WATCHED
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration said commercial
crude oil inventories fell nearly 4 million barrels last week,
far deeper than the forecast for a 1.9 million barrel drawdown.
[EIA/S]
 Inventories dropped as imports slid more than 1 million
barrels per day with offloadings hampered by Hurricane Irene's
passage through the East Coast that also compelled refineries
to cut utilization rates by more than a quarter.[ID:nWEN8048]
 Tropical Storm Nate, the 14th named storm of the busy 2011
hurricane season, was gaining strength and could become a
hurricane on Friday or Saturday, the U.S. National Hurricane
Center said. [ID:nL3E7K83HF]
 The tropical storm has prompted producers in the Gulf of
Mexico to begin another round of evacuations of nonessential
workers. [ID:n1E7870Z1]

 By Seng Li Peng	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Brent crude held steady above
$115 a barrel, after a $3 surge in the previous session, in line
with a rebound in equity markets as a ruling by a top German
court helped assuage fears that euro zone bailout efforts might
get stalled. 
 Prices were also supported by storms in the U.S. Gulf Coast
that have already shut in about 37 percent of oil production
from the region. Investors are awaiting U.S. President Barack
Obama's speech on jobs and a European Central Bank rate-setting
meeting later for cues on the health of the global economy.	
 ""We saw equities rising and we saw oil put on a 3-4 percent
(rise) last night,"" said Ben Le Brun, a Sydney-based analyst at
CMC Markets. ""We have Obama speaking about jobs and if the
market gets what it wants to hear that would further underpin
the positive movements on oil prices.""	
 Brent crude  slipped 12 cents to $115.68 a barrel,
after gaining $2.91 to settle at $115.80, above its 100-day
moving average, a key technical indicator that has capped the
market since August. In post-settlement trade, prices rose
further, pushing on to $116.50, the highest since Aug. 2.	
 U.S. crude  gained 9 cents to $89.43 a barrel, after
settling $3.32 at $89.34 a barrel, and also climbed in
post-settlement trade to a five-week high of $90.48. 
 European stocks rose 3.1 percent, while on Wall Street, the
S&P 500 rose 2.9 percent. 
 The positive mood extended into the Asian market, with
Japan's Nikkei gaining 1 percent, while MSCI's broadest index of
Asia Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent. 
 
 The European Central Bank is expected to signal a change in
policy direction on Thursday, halting a cycle of interest-rate
rises just five months after it started as the euro zone debt
crisis weighs on the economy. 
For Brent, the upside will be limited to $116.83
as a short-term uptrend that started at the Aug. 9 low of $98.74
approaches its end, said Reuters market analyst for commodities
and energy technicals Wang Tao. 
 Prices were also supported by an industry report that showed
a steep fall in oil stocks. Stockpiles of U.S. crude fell by 3
million barrels last week due to production shut-ins and lower
imports, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said.

 That was well above the average forecast of a 1.9 million
barrel draw in a Reuters poll ahead of the more closely watched
data from the U.S. government's Energy Information
Administration on Thursday at 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT). 
 In addition, three tropical storms - Nate, Maria and
Hurricane Katia -- are posing threats to Mexico's Bay of
Campeche, Puerto Rico and the U.S. East Coast.	
 Katia has weakened significantly in the last two days, but
was still a hurricane with 80 mph (130 kph) winds, making it a
Category 1 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson intensity
scale. 
 In Libya, ousted leader Muammar Gaddafi's whereabouts have
remained a mystery since rebel fighters stormed his Tripoli
headquarters two weeks ago. Markets are awaiting an end to the
months-long conflict to get a sense of when output from the
nation can be restored. 
 ""For Brent, it all comes down to when they can get some sort
of definite answer as to when Libya can return to production,""
said Le Brun. 
 In Syria, forces backed by tanks killed at least 20
civilians in the city of Homs on Wednesday in one of the
fiercest military assaults on urban centres to crush six months
of pro-democracy protests, activists and residents said.

 SINGAPORE, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Gold prices rebounded more
than 1 percent on Thursday following a drop of 3 percent in the
previous session, as sharply lower prices attracted bargain
hunters, but improved risk appetite is likely to cap gains.	
 Spot gold rose as much as 1.5 percent to $1,842.89 an
ounce after its most volatile day in two weeks, with a trading
band of more than $80. It had pared some gains to $1,830.72 by
0410 GMT.	
 The most-active U.S. gold futures contract  rose 1.6
percent to $1,846.6, before easing to $1,833.80.	
 ""Some investors, speculators and physical buyers have shown
a lot of buying interest at current prices, as they are much
lower compared to a few days ago,"" said a dealer at a
Tokyo-based bullion house.	
 Spot gold hit a record high of $1,920.3 on Tuesday.	
 Technical analysis suggested that spot gold could fall
towards $1,793.19 later in the day, said Reuters market analyst
Wang Tao. 
 
 
 
 The faith in gold's long-term bullish trend remained intact
as concerns about global growth still run high, although the
short term is likely to remain choppy.	
 ""Concerns about economic growth in the United States and
euro zone will keep supporting gold prices. Even though we may
see liquidation repeatedly along the way, gold will rise towards
$2,000,"" the dealer said.	
 
 RISK APPETITE RETURNS	
 Investors abandoned precious metals for the riskier stock
market, as Germany's top court rejected lawsuits aimed at
blocking German participation in emergency loan packages, but
gave its parliament more say in bailouts. 
 Further encouraging the risk appetite, Germany's industrial
output jumped unexpectedly in July, offering hopes that Europe's
largest economy may avoid recession. 
 ""The gold market is anticipated to maintain its downward
trend in the near-term, with a fall toward $1,750 possible over
the next few days,"" Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at MF Global, said

1281,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 07, 2011 09:05PM ET</span>",Crude oil gains in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - Crude oil futures advanced in Asian trade Thursday, ending a two-day losing streak on a lower dollar and a report predicting an drop in U.S. oil stockpiles.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD89.78 a barrel during early Asian trade, rising 0.34%, after hitting a daily low of USD89.47.
Earlier Wednesday, industry group the American Petroleum Institute, forecast that U.S. crude oil stockpiles would show a drop of 3 million barrels for last week, far below market forecasts of a 1.9 million barrel decrease.
The institute cited a reduction in imports and disruptions in production in the Gulf of Mexico due to Tropical Storm Lee.
The Energy Information Administration predicted world oil demand would grow “less robustly” due a weaker outlook for global economic growth through next year.
In its monthly short-term outlook, the EIA said it expects world consumption to rise by 1.4 million barrels per day in both 2011 and 2012, slightly down from the last month’s forecast from the administration.
Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Nate lined up in the Gulf as the next storm to threaten U.S.  oil facilities in the region, and could be upgraded to hurricane status by Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell to a daily low of 75.48 before rebounding 0.15% to 75.63. 
Dollar-denominated futures contracts tend to rise when the dollar falls, as oil future purchases become less expensive for investors who hold other currencies.
On the ICE Futures Exchange Brent oil futures for October delivery rose 0.22% to trade at USD116.14. 
The weekly report from U.S. Energy Administration on energy stockpiles was due out later Thursday, where forecasts were for a 1.4 million barrel reduction in crude oil supplies."

1283,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 07, 2011 08:25PM ET</span>",Gold futures ease in early Asian trade,"Investing.com – Gold futures retreated in Asian trade Thursday, as a rebound in global equity markets cooled investor appetite for safe-haven investments after the precious metal’s record high rise in the previous session. 
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,816.65 a troy ounce during early Asian trade, down 0.08%, after hitting a daily high of USDS1,819.05. 
Following Switzerland’s central bank decision to limit falls in the Swiss franc, gold rallied to a record high of USD1,921.05, prompting some profit taking from investors.
But attraction to riskier assets was boosted by a ruling by Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court that upheld German participation in last year’s Greek bailout and the formation of the European Financial Stability Facility.
Plaintiffs in the case had sought to block the country’s role in euro-zone bailouts.
European and U.S. markets welcomed the news as a positive step in the EU’s efforts to address debt problems in the region, with France’s CAC 40 rising 3.6%, Britain’s FTSE 100 climbing 3.1%, and Germany’s DAX rising sharply by 4%.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.5%, the Nasdaq Composite Index added 3%, and the S&P 500 advanced 2.8%.
Later Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama was scheduled to deliver a speech before a joint session of Congress where he was expected to outlay nearly USD300 in additional stimulus for the U.S. economy

 By David Sheppard
 NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Oil rose by more than $3 to a
five-week high on Wednesday, boosted by production outages in
the Gulf of Mexico and tracking a surge in equity markets after
a ruling by Germany's top court soothed euro zone fears.
 Traders were eyeing the formation of Tropical Storm Nate
over Mexico's Bay of Campeche, which the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said may move toward the U.S. Gulf Coast and
had chance of becoming a hurricane by Friday. [ID:nL3E7K73WJ]
 Although Nate was far south of U.S. oil installations, it
stirred fears it could further hamper the slow recovery of
production in the region after Tropical Storm Lee had hit.
 ""This is going to make it difficult to get people back on
rigs -- it looks like we could have an extended period of
having production offline"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest
Research in Chicago.
 Stockpiles of U.S. crude fell by 3 million barrels last
week due to production shut-ins and lower imports, industry
group the American Petroleum Institute said. [API/S]
 That was well above the average forecast of a 1.9 million
barrel draw in a Reuters poll ahead of the more closely watched
data from the U.S. government's Energy Information
Administration on Thursday at 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT). [EIA/S]
 Brent crude  gained $2.91 to settle at $115.80 a
barrel. In post-settlement trade after the API numbers, prices
rose further, pushing on to $116.50, the highest price since
Aug. 2. U.S. crude  rose $3.32 to settle at $89.34 a
barrel and also climbed in post-settlement trade to a five-week
high of $90.48.
 ""The market is being very reactive to the developing
storms, due, in part, to the declining crude inventories,"" said
John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.
 Brent settled above its 100-day moving average, a key
technical indicator that has capped the market since August.

 Oil was also supported by a near 3 percent gain in U.S. and
European equities after Germany's top court struck down
internal efforts to block Berlin from helping stabilize the
euro zone. Many oil traders use broader markets to try and
gauge the strength of the economic recovery. [ID:nL5E7K70Q9]
 That has led to heightened volatility in the oil market for
much of the past month, as investors have been torn between
lackluster economic data in the developed world and increased
efforts to find a lasting solution to the euro zone crisis.
 ""Despite the fact people aren't particularly optimistic
about the overall economy, it's been hard to push oil prices
down,"" Peter Beutel, president of oil consultancy Cameron
Hanover said.
 The S&P 500 <.SPX> was up 2.9 percent, while gold  --
which has seen safe haven flows push it to a series of record
highs in recent weeks -- was down more than 3 percent at
$1,813.60 an ounce.
 PRODUCTION AND INVENTORIES
 More than 500,000 barrels per day or almost 37 percent of
oil production in the Gulf of Mexico remained shut from Lee,
which came ashore and weakened on Sunday, the U.S. government
reported on Wednesday. That's down from 60 percent on Tuesday.
 Since companies began to shut in production due to Lee on
Sept. 1, a total of more than 4.5 million barrels of oil
production have been lost, according to Reuters calculations
from government estimates. That's equal to roughly a quarter of
one day's oil use in the United States. [ID:nN1E7851AX]
 Brent's premium over U.S. crude oil  fell to
about $26.40 a barrel after hitting a record of more than $27
on Tuesday.
 Brent has been boosted relative to U.S. crude by production
problems in the North Sea over the past few months, as well as
the loss of crude from Libya since February.
 European refiners have had to scramble to find replacements
for the approximately 1.2 million bpd of pre-civil war Libyan
crude oil exports.
 While limited exports from Libya were expected to resume in
the coming months, most industry experts have said it will take
Libya's National Transitional Council at least 12 to 18 months
to return production to 1 million bpd or more.

 * Firmer equities, German court ruling spook gold holders
 * Euro zone debt woes back in spotlight
 * Kazakhstan will buy all gold output until 2014-2015

 By Jan Harvey and Amanda Cooper	
 LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Gold prices fell by nearly 3
percent in Europe on Wednesday after a sharp rally in stock
markets prompted nervous investors to cash in gains after the
precious metal's rally to record highs in the previous session.	
 Gold was set for its most volatile day in two weeks, with
price swings of nearly $80, just shy of late August's $104
difference between session peaks and troughs.	
 By 1445 GMT, spot gold was down 2.8 percent at
$1,812.89 an ounce. It rallied to a record $1,920.30 a day ago,
but dropped after the Swiss National Bank intervened to weaken
the franc, shaking up financial markets.	
 U.S. blue chip stocks rallied by nearly 1 percent in early
Wall Street trade, echoing the strength in global equities,
after Germany's highest court paved the way for Berlin to
continue to participate in any bailouts for Greece or other euro
zone members.	
 ""The focus was on lack of growth and perhaps the Swiss
decision and some stabilisation of (equity) markets has perhaps
made people a bit less depressed about growth and that buying
has come out of the market,"" said Mitsubishi analyst Matthew
Turner	
 ""Gold's strength in the last few weeks was, in theory, on
the lack of growth, not on higher inflation and this addresses
that 'lack of growth' theory, and if gold investors were fearing
that, then this is bad for them.""	
 Reflecting the investor retreat from gold over the past few
days, even with a rise in the price to record highs, was a fifth
consecutive decline in exchange-traded fund holdings of gold --
a key gauge of investment demand. Holdings are at 67.38 million
ounces, their lowest in six weeks.	
 Support from current levels is likely to continue to come
from the euro zone debt crisis. The bloc's most indebted nations
are struggling to convince investors of their commitment to
reduce debt, as Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, faces
opposition to further aid. 
 In a closely watched decision, Germany's Constitutional
Court on Wednesday rejected a series of lawsuits aimed at
blocking Germany's participation in bailout packages for Greece
and other euro zone countries. 
 It said however that parliament must have a bigger say in
future rescues, which could further slow down Europe's response
to the debt crisis.	
 The news helped assets seen as higher risk to rise, briefly
lifting the euro against the dollar but pressuring German Bund
futures. European shares rose sharply, bouncing from a two-year
closing low. 
 
 
 DEBT CONCERNS SIMMER	
 Nonetheless ongoing concerns over euro zone debt and
Tuesday's news from Switzerland are likely to lift gold in the
longer term while pressuring so-called higher-risk assets,
analysts said.	
 ""Efforts to dampen currency appreciation mean gold moves up
the pecking order of preferred safe havens,"" said UBS in a note.
""This is crucially important given that safe havens are
currently sought as alternatives to equities and other assets
while macro concerns and European sovereign issues prevail. 
 ""Now that the SNB has entered the intervention arena, FX
markets are on high alert for the BoJ to follow suit. So in
theory, gold should be a considerable beneficiary ahead.""	
 In supply news, Kazakhstan's central bank said on Wednesday
it would be buying up the Central Asian nation's entire gold
bullion output until at least 2014-15 to ease its exposure to
the sagging dollar. 
 According to metals consultancy GFMS, Kazakhstan was the
world's 20th-largest gold producer last year, with output of
26.9 tonnes. It plans to boost output this year to 33 tonnes.	
 Among other precious metals, silver was down 2.2
percent at $40.73 an ounce, spot platinum was down 1.7
percent at $1,814.99 an ounce, and spot palladium was up
0.1 percent at $746.an ounce.	
 Palladium, the most industrial of the main precious metals,
is still this year's worst performer among them, currently down
6.7 percent compared to a 3.7 percent rise in platinum prices
and gold's 33 percent appreciation.	
 The white metal has come under heavy pressure from falling
appetite for raw materials, as well as concerns over the outlook
for car sales and speculation that its sharp price run higher of
recent years had become overdone.	
 ""Prices have been buffeted by risk appetite, but now have
the potential to recover,"" said Standard Chartered in a note.

 By Claire Milhench	
 LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Oil was up at just over $113 a
barrel on Wednesday, underpinned by expectations of lower U.S.
crude stocks after a storm disrupted production in the Gulf of
Mexico, and optimism about a new support package for the U.S.
economy.	
 A Reuters poll ahead of the weekly inventory report from the
U.S. Energy Information Administration gave a consensus forecast
for a fall of 1.9 million barrels of crude in the week to Sept.
2. 
 Front-month Brent crude futures  gained 28 cents to
$113.17 a barrel by 1123 GMT, after settling up $2.81 on
Tuesday. U.S. crude  was trading at $86.73 a barrel, up 71
cents. 
 Brent had rallied from $109.85 to $113.61 on Tuesday, and
Wednesday's trading consolidated these gains, supported by a
weaker dollar , tight North Sea supplies due to production
problems, and the ongoing hurricane season.	
 ""Oil does seem to have an ability to stay up despite
appalling economic data, due to Middle East unrest, hurricanes
and dollar weakness,"" said Christopher Bellew, a trader at
Jefferies Bache.	
 He said oil had bounced on Tuesday partly because of the
Swiss National Bank's decision to peg the Swiss franc to the
euro to try to prevent further appreciation. 
 Analysts believe oil may gain further support from this move
because it reduces the number of safe haven assets available. 
 ""Investors will seek other obvious investments,"" said
Thorbjorn Bak Jensen, an oil analyst at Global Risk Management.
""Commodities will surely be one of them. Yesterday's mini-rally
supports our conclusion."" 
 Olivier Jakob, oil analyst at Petromatrix, agreed: ""With
what is going on in the currencies and the stock market we have
to respect that some flows might be looking for a parking spot.""	
 Traders are also closely tracking the progress of storms in
the Atlantic. Tropical Storm Lee, which made landfall over the
weekend, is expected to have disrupted imports to the U.S.,
adding to the impact of Hurricane Irene, which forced the
closure of several oil hubs on the U.S. East Coast the previous
weekend.	
 ""Following Tropical Storm Lee, production of almost 850,000
barrels a day, or over 60 percent of U.S. oil production in the
Gulf of Mexico, were still shut down until yesterday,"" said
analysts at Commerzbank. ""This should be reflected in a fall in
U.S. crude oil inventories."" 
 A broad area of low pressure located over the southern Gulf
of Mexico has a medium 40 percent chance of becoming a tropical
cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center
forecast. 
 
 Analysts and traders also pointed to hopes that U.S.
President Barack Obama might announce new stimulus measures to
boost the flagging U.S. economy.	
 Obama is expected to unveil a $300 billion package to create
new jobs in an address to Congress on Thursday, CNN reported,
citing Democratic sources. 
 Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets, noted that gains
in oil are being limited however, despite European shares
bouncing from a two-year closing low with a German court ruling
against blocking bailout packages. 
 ""You would have thought oil would be higher on the back of
the rally in the equity markets but it's not, which leads me to
believe that the bounce in equities is just froth,"" he said.	
 ""What has changed really in Europe with respect to bailouts?
We're no further forward than we were, despite the ruling from
the German constitutional court.""

 SINGAPORE, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose above $113 a
barrel for the second consecutive day on Wednesday on
expectations of lower U.S. crude stockpiles after a storm
disrupted production in the Gulf of Mexico.	
 A Reuters poll ahead of the weekly inventory report from the
U.S. Energy Information Administration showed an average
forecast for a drop of 1.9 million barrels in the week to Sept.
2. 
 Tropical Storm Lee, which made landfall over the weekend,
was also expected to have disrupted imports, adding to the
impact of Hurricane Irene, which forced closure of several oil
hubs on the U.S. East Coast the previous weekend.	
 Front-month Brent  gained 47 cents to $113.36 a
barrel by 0327 GMT, after settling up $2.81 on Tuesday. U.S.
crude  was trading at $86.44 a barrel, up 42 cents. 
 ""The disruption to Gulf production is supporting prices, and
with storms coming more often to the U.S., it could be a bullish
factor until the end of hurricane season,"" said Tetsu Emori, a
fund manager at Astramax Co. Ltd. in Tokyo.	
 More than half of U.S. Gulf oil production remained shut as
of Tuesday in the wake of Tropical Storm Lee, which dissipated
on Monday but the after-effects of which have delayed a faster
restart. 
 A broad area of low pressure located over the southern Gulf
of Mexico has a medium 40 percent chance of becoming a tropical
cyclone in the next 48 , the U.S. National Hurricane Center
forecast. 
 Market participants are also betting that U.S. President
Barack Obama may announce new stimulus measures to boost the
flagging U.S. economy and ease fears of oil demand falling in
the world's biggest energy consumer.	
 Obama is expected to unveil a $300 billion package to create
new jobs in an address to Congress on Thursday, CNN reported,
citing Democratic sources. 
 Asian stocks snapped a three-day streak of losses on
Wednesday as short-covering helped prop up benchmarks, and the
euro edged up against the dollar as traders covered some bets
against the common currency after a sharp overnight fall.

 
 The weaker dollar, which fell 0.3 percent against a basket
of currencies, helped boost dollar-denominated oil by making it
cheaper when purchased in other currencies.	
 Brent crude could rise towards $115.36, while U.S. oil is
expected to revisit the Sept 1 high of $89.90, according to
Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 The WTI/Brent spread  was steady at $26.82 a
barrel, after hitting a record above $27 a barrel in intraday
trading on Tuesday as Brent crude strengthened on tight North
Seas supplies and data showing strong growth in the U.S.
services sector in August. 
 According to a new Reuters survey, official forecasters are
overestimating the pace of oil demand growth for 2012,
reflecting the deepening uncertainty facing oil markets over the
next year.

 SINGAPORE, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Spot gold dropped 2 percent
abruptly on Wednesday to as low as $1,826, nearly $100 off the
all-time high above $1,920 hit in the previous session, tracking
heavy losses on U.S. gold futures on technical selling.	
 ""It was intra-day technical stops,"" said a Sydney-based
trader. ""It doesn't reflect any changes in fundamentals.""	
 Spot gold dropped nearly $40, two minutes after U.S.
gold tumbled about $50 over three mintues. Cash gold prices
since regained some lost ground to $1,836.26 an ounce by 0559
GMT, down 1.5 percent.	
 U.S. gold  dived to as low as $1,818.2, and was
trading at $1,839.10, down 1.8 percent from the previous close.	
 ""Someone dumped a big position with little care, which set
off stops and caused the price to cascade even lower,"" said a
Singapore-based trader.	
 Some traders talked about some 4,000 lots of gold being
dumped on COMEX.	
 
 
 SIGNS OF CAUTION	
 There are signs that investors have become more cautious in
joining the gold rush.	
 The Relative Strength Index of spot gold has hovered in the
lower 60s so far this month. In August, when gold surged 12
percent on a record-setting rally, the RSI exceeded 70 for 14
out of 23 trading days. A reading above 70 suggests the
underlying asset is overbought.	
 Holdings in the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded
fund, SPDR Gold Trust , remained unchanged from the end of
August at 1,232.314 tonnes. In August, the fund posted its
largest monthly decline in holdings since January.

 ""Gold tried to test $1,900 twice and couldn't sustain the
level, therefore people are cautious this time,"" said a Hong
Kong-based dealer.	
 Volatile prices, and expectations that other central banks
may step in to intervene in the currency market, may have also
contributed to the restraint, analysts said.	
 Gold's premium over platinum narrowed to just $1 after
gold's dramatic decline. Spot platinum fell 0.6 percent
to $1,835.50 an ounce.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD86.34 a barrel during early Asian trade, falling 0.06%, after hitting a daily high of USD86.59.
Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Institute of Supply Management reported its non-manufacturing purchasing manager’s index rose by 0.6 in August to 53.3 from 52.7 the previous month.
Economists had forecast the index to fall to 51.0 for the month.
An ISM manufacturing index above 50.0 indicates expansion in the non-manufacturing sector, while below 50.0 is a sign of general contraction.
U.S. service sector activity accounts for 75% of all U.S. economic activity, and is a key determinant to gauging future energy demand from the world’s largest oil consumer.
Earlier Tuesday, the Swiss National Bank set a floor for EUR/CHF at 1.20 in an effort to lessen the negative effects a strong currency would have on exports.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose to a daily high of 76.11 before falling 0.20% to 75.92. 
Dollar-denominated futures contracts tend to fall when the dollar rises as oil future purchases become more expensive for investors who hold other currencies.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,873.55 a troy ounce during early Asian trade, down 0.29%, after hitting a new intraday high of USDS1,921.05. 
Gold surged earlier in Tuesday trade, following the unexpected and extraordinary move by the Swiss National Bank to limit the minimum for the EUR/CHF exchange rate.
“With immediate effect, the SNB will no longer tolerate a EUR/CHF exchange rate below the minimum rate of CHF 1.20. The SNB will enforce this minimum rate with the utmost determination and is prepared to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities,” the SNB said in a statement.
The Swiss franc has been a favorite safe-haven option amid a deepening European debt crisis and continued signs of a sluggish recovery from the U.S. economy.
Gold has rallied by 34% so far this year, its biggest yearly gain since 1979.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that eliminating Greece from the euro zone could trigger “a dangerous domino-effect"", while worries over rising debt levels in Italy saw the cost of insuring Italian sovereign debt against default rise above that of Spain for the first time since December 2009 earlier in the week.

 By Barani Krishnan and Amanda Cooper
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Gold jumped to a record
high on Tuesday after Switzerland pegged its currency to the
euro, before closing down as investors took profits.
 Analysts said they still expect the precious metal to chart
new peaks on worsening euro zone troubles.
 The spot price of gold -- which tracks global trades in
bullion -- and U.S. gold futures set all-time highs above
$1,920 an ounce after the Swiss National Bank imposed an
exchange rate cap on the soaring franc to stave off a
recession. The SNB aims to keep the franc at or above 1.20 to
the euro by buying other currencies in unlimited quantities.
 Profit-taking pushed bullion and gold futures down more
than $50 an ounce soon after that record and prices ultimately
closed lower.
 At 3:35 p.m. EDT (1935 GMT), bullion  hovered at
$1,880 an ounce, down 1 percent from Monday's late afternoon
trade in New York. It was also off the record high of $1,920.30
seen earlier on Tuesday.
 U.S. gold futures' benchmark December contract 
settled at $1,873.30 an ounce, down $3.60 or 0.2 percent from
Friday's close ahead of the Labor Day holiday. Earlier,
December gold hit an all-time peak of $1,923.70.
 Profit-taking aside, analysts blamed the reversal on the
U.S. dollar, which rallied as the Swiss currency fell. <.DXY>
 Safe-haven buying of gold further evaporated after
surprisingly positive U.S. services sector data in August.
[ID:nN1E7850B2]
 Gold bulls remained convinced of the precious metal's
upside potential, saying it was within striking range of the
$2,000-per-ounce target.
 ""I think gold is headed for $2,000,"" said Frank McGhee,
head of precious metals trading at Integrated Brokerage
Services in Chicago.
 ""In theory, this could actually happen in a matter of days.
In reality, if this type of intervention action was taken and
was ultimately seen to be ineffective, then the market will get
new strength from that. Ultimately, intervention can only cause
markets to pause, not change their direction.""

 Analysts said the SNB should be able to defend the Swiss
franc at 1.20 per euro for now, as it can print unlimited
currency. But long-term success depended on efforts in the euro
zone to deal with debt problems, given the relative strength of
the Swiss economy and government finances. [ID:nL5E7K61FL]
 The peg knocked about 8 percent off the value of the franc
against the euro . The Swiss currency had soared by
a third since Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, as investors
sought a safe haven from financial market turmoil.
 While gold would benefit from the franc's exclusion from
the safe-haven club, that did not make it a one-way trade for
the precious metal, some analysts said.
 ""I don't think gold becomes the ultimate safe haven,"" said
Dennis Gartman, author of financial markets newsletter The
Gartman Letter and a regular commentator on bullion.
 ""Safe means stability. What we're seeing in the gold market
is anything but stability. Anything that moves as gold has
moved today -- from $1,920 all the way down to $1,870 in a
course of five minutes -- is hardly safe.""
 Gold's 34 percent rally so far this year, its largest
yearly gain since 1979, has been fueled largely by investor
worries over debt in the United States and euro zone.
 But recent inflows into gold show investors have exercised
restraint. Exchange-traded gold funds, which back investors'
money with bullion purchases, saw their holdings in gold fall
by nearly 2.5 million ounces over the last month to reach a
six-week low of 67.4 million ounces. [GOL/ETF]

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Spot gold climbed more than
one percent to a record high above $1,920 on Tuesday, as
concerns about a worsening euro zone debt crisis and stalled
global growth drove investors out of from riskier assets to safe
havens, including gold.	
 It was the 12th record high that spot gold has reached since
the beginning of August, and the rally is expected to continue,
with investors unable to see a quick resolution to the euro zone
crisis and the global economy at risk of slipping into another
recession. 
 Investors are watching a string of legal and political
events in Europe this week that could hurt efforts to resolve
the debt crisis, after dispute broke between international
lenders and Greece over disappointment that Athens had fallen
behind schedule on cutting deficit.

 Spot gold stood at $1,919.49 an ounce by 0605 GMT,
and has risen about 18 percent since the beginning of August. It
is up 35 percent on the year so far.	
 U.S. gold  rallied 2.5 percent to a record high of
$1,923.2, and eased slightly to $1,922.50.	
 ""After we broke above $1,900 people are now looking at
$2,000 as the next target,"" said Peter Fung, head of dealing at
Wing Fung Precious Metals in Hong Kong.	
 Fung said physical demand from India and China, the world's
top two gold consumers, remained strong despite lofty prices,
and helped keep gold premiums in Hong Kong in the range of $1 to
$1.50 an ounce over spot prices.	
 


 STIMULUS HOPES	
 Financial markets will also closely follow the U.S. ISM
non-manufacturing index for August due later in the day.

 ""If we get a negative reading, it will just reinforce
concerns about a global recession and possibility of some form
of stimulus from the Fed (U.S. Federal Reserve) down the road,""
said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures.	
 As long as gold holds above $1,700, the bullish trend will
persist and prices could hit $2,000 by the end of the year, she
added.	
 India, the world's largest gold consumer, sees its festival
and wedding season start later this month. Strong demand has
defied record high prices, traders said. 
 The platinum-gold spread dipped to a discount of more than
$20, headed for a third consecutive session in negative
territory. The last time the spread was in discount for a
prolonged period was 1985.	
 Spot platinum rose to a two-week high of $1,889,

 NEW YORK, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose on Tuesday
after falling in the previous three sessions as tight North Sea
supply and continuing uncertainty in Libya boosted prices.
 U.S. oil fell on pressure from slumping equities,
especially on Wall Street where markets resumed trading after
the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday, and worries about a
global economic slowdown.
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude  reached an
all-time peak above $27 a barrel intraday, eclipsing Friday's
record $26.98.
 European equities dropped, extending Monday's 4 percent
decline, with bank shares hitting a 29-month low on worries
about the political handling of the euro zone debt crisis.

 But investors noted that the pace of hiring slowed slightly
in the Institute for Supply Management's report on the dominant
service sector, not encouraging after Friday's dismal U.S.
nonfarm payrolls report for August.
 ""Libya's crude is still not in play and North Sea problems
remain supportive for Brent, and U.S. markets are still playing
catch-up after being shut,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest

 ICE Brent October crude  rose $1.52 to $111.60 a

 U.S. October crude  fell $1.95 to $84.50 a barrel,
but was off its $83.20 low.
 The Brent crude spread to its U.S. counterpart stood at
$26.97, after reaching $27.23 intraday.

 * Chinese oil field shutdown supporting prices

 By Francis Kan	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose towards $111
a barrel on Tuesday, rebounding from sharp falls a day earlier,
as expectations for further economic stimulus in the U.S.
boosted sentiment. 
 Front-month Brent  rose 58 cents to $110.66 a barrel
by 0342 GMT, after rising over a dollar earlier. Brent plunged
over $2 a barrel on Monday on weak economic data from the U.S.
and China.	
 U.S. crude  was trading at $83.95 a barrel, down $2.50
from Friday's close, as there was no settlement on Monday due to
a holiday in the U.S. However, it was up 34 cents from late
Monday. 
 ""The market is looking for fresh stimulus coming from Obama
when he makes his jobs speech on Thursday, and also when the Fed
meets on September 20th,"" said Gordon Kwan, head of energy
research at Mirae Securities in Hong Kong.	
 U.S. employment growth ground to a halt in August, reviving
recession fears and piling pressure on both President Barack
Obama and the Federal Reserve to provide more stimulus to aid
the world's top energy consumer. 
 On Monday, Obama previewed proposals for new infrastructure
spending and an extension of payroll tax cuts as part of a major
jobs package he will unveil this week. 
 Worsening economic data may also raise the odds of another
round of bond buying, or quantitative easing, by the U.S.
Federal Reserve.	
 Prices also received a boost from the closure of a major oil
field in China due to oil leaks, which analysts expect will
reduce CNOOC's total output and earnings by about 2 percent this
year, raising the prospect of more Chinese crude imports.	
 China's State Oceanic Administration ordered the PL19-3
oilfield in the northern Bohai Bay, owned and operated by CNOOC
and ConocoPhillips , to cease operations
because the American firm had failed to seal a leak that had
lasted for more than two months, CNOOC said on Monday.

 ""The event in itself is not that big, but if regulators
decide to shut more platforms and oil fields after a safety
review, it may result in China importing more crude,"" said Kwan.	
 
 Gains, however, were capped by concerns that Europe's
sovereign debt problems and a slowing Chinese economy could
crimp oil demand.	
 China's economic growth may fall below 9 percent in 2012,
partly due to a weak global economy, a senior Chinese foreign
exchange official said on Tuesday. 
 Brent oil  is expected to fall to $109.01 per barrel,
while U.S. oil  may hover in a narrow range of
$82.95-$84.20 per barrel for half a trading session or one
session before plunging towards the Aug. 19 low of $79.17,
according to Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 More than half the crude production in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico remains shut due to Tropical Storm Lee, which is
hindering efforts to restaff and restart oil and gas platforms
in the basin. 
 Another hurricane, Katia, powered up to a major Category 4
storm on Monday, but was expected to veer away from the U.S.
East Coast later this week, avoiding a direct hit on a seaboard
already battered by Hurricane Irene.

1312,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 05, 2011 09:18PM ET</span>",Crude oil falls in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - Crude oil futures declined in Asian trade Tuesday, as investors reacted negatively to U.S. figures indicating a stagnant labor market and diminished prospects for demand from the world’s largest oil consumer.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD83.47 a barrel during early Asian trade, falling 0.19%, after hitting a daily high of USD83.94.
The U.S. Labor Department, late last week, reported that non-farm payrolls were unchanged in August, the weakest job reading in a year.  Market expectations were for non-farm payrolls to increase by 74,000 in August, after a revised 85,000 gain in July.
Stagnant job growth raised further speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank may be preparing for a new round of asset buying, or quantitative easing.
Elsewhere, Tropical Storm Lee weakened to a tropical depression after making landfall on the Louisiana coast Sunday, moving away U.S. oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico.
British Petroleum and Exxon reported their workers were returning to oil facilities in the western Gulf, after being evacuated before the arrival of Lee. Royal Dutch Shell also confirmed it had begun returning staff after evacuating more than 800 workers.
A strengthening U.S. dollar helped to depress enthusiasm for oil futures, as dollar-denominated futures contracts tend to fall when the dollar rises.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose 0.24% to 75.38. 
On the ICE Futures Exchange Brent oil futures for October delivery gained 0.42% to trade at USD110.42. 
NYMEX floor trading was closed Monday for the U.S. Labor Day holiday. Electronic trades were to be booked with Tuesday’s transactions for settlement purposes.

1313,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 05, 2011 08:44PM ET</span>",Gold futures pare gains in early Asian trade,"Investing.com – Gold futures eased from session highs in Asian trade Friday, after breaking above the psychologically important USD1,900 level, as dealers sought safe havens amid slumping European stocks and in the wake of a gloomy U.S. labor outlook.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,899.55 a troy ounce during early Asian trade, down 0.09%, after hitting a high of USDS1,903.75. 
While U.S. markets took the day off for the Labor Day Holiday, European bourses reacted negatively to last week’s release from the U.S. Labor Department showing that non-farm payrolls remained flat in August, and the unemployment rate held steady at 9.1%. 
Market expectations were for non-farm payrolls to increase by 74,000 in August. The labor reading was the weakest since September of 2010.
By the end of Monday trading, France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.73% to 2,999.54, Britain’s FTSE 100 slumped 3.58% to 5,102.58, and Germany’s DAX plummeted by 5.28% to 5,246.18.
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union was roundly defeated in her home state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, setting the stage for a new round of debate on Germany’s role in expanding the powers of the European Financial Stability Facility. 
The election result may hinder efforts to grant additional powers to the bailout fund, ahead of a ruling on the legality of the latest bailout for Greece, due to be decided by Germany’s Constitutional Court later this week.
Meanwhile, Swiss investment bank UBS said in a report that, “Additional evidence of U.S. economic weakness raises the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will announce further easing this month.”
UBS added that the implications of last week’s U.S. labor report and intense focus of European sovereign issues give gold “two strong reasons to rally in the coming weeks.”   
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver for December delivery added 0.30% to trade at USD43.07 a troy ounce, while copper for December delivery fell 0.08% to trade at USD4.057 a pound.

 LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Gold climbed to a near record
high above $1,900 an ounce on Monday as renewed pangs of euro
zone debt concerns sent investors fleeing from riskier assets.
 Stock markets in Europe extended a decline that was set off
by Friday's gloomy U.S. payrolls data, with European bank
shares sliding to a 29-month low. The euro shed nearly 1
percent versus the dollar and oil prices slumped as investors
sought the favour of havens like gold and Bunds.
 Expectations that a faltering U.S. economic recovery will
force the Federal Reserve to embark on a third round of
quantitative easing also aided bullion, with traders starting
to bet on a repeat of the QE2 program that aided gold's more
than 50 percent rise over the past 12 months.
 Spot gold rose 0.9 percent or $16.25 an ounce to$1,900.05
an ounce at 2:55 EST (1855 GMT), having earlier touched a high
of $1,902.70. It is one of this year's best-performing
commodities, up by around a third in 2011.
 U.S. COMEX gold futures for December delivery rose $25.90
or 1.4 percent to $1,903.10, with trading volume at about
one-third the 30-day average.
 European shares fell on fears of recession and yet more
evidence of political disunity that could hamper efforts to
solve the region's debt crisis. German Bund futures hit record
highs in early trade.
 ""Clearly the debt issue is back in the spotlight,"" said
Societe Generale analyst David Wilson. ""Added to that you had
the fairly (weak) U.S. non-farm payrolls data. There are a
number of reasons you can see why gold is supported.""
 Gold had a choppy month in August, peaking at a record
$1,911.46 an ounce and trading within its biggest range in
absolute terms since January 1980, when it hit a record $835 an
ounce, or above $2,000 in inflation-adjusted terms.
 Europe faces a string of political and legal tests this
week that could hurt efforts to resolve its sovereign debt
crisis and increase pressure for governments to try more
radical solutions.
 The uncertain mood was set on Sunday, when German
Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition lost ground in a state
election on Sunday.
 Standard Bank analyst Walter de Wet said a court ruling due
Wednesday that may reduce the freedom of the German government
to finance rescues of crisis-hit countries like Greece was
supporting interest in safe-haven gold, while a European
Central Bank meeting on Thursday will be closely watched.
 ""There is a growing expectation in the market that we will
have to get some policy response from the ECB at some stage,""
he said. ""Whatever that will be, it is more likely to be
positive for gold than not. Either they will have to cut rates,
or they will have to be more accommodating.""
 Managed money in gold futures and options reduced their
net length for a fourth straight week to August 30, the latest
data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
late on Friday.
 ""Current positioning is in line with the year-to-date
weekly average, and considering the uptick in both U.S. and
European risks this week, we certainly don't consider current
spec positioning as been excessive,"" UBS said in a note.
 Sales of gold and silver American Eagle coins were at their
highest since January in August, data from the U.S. Mint
showed. The Mint sold 112,000 ounces of gold coins and 3.68
million ounces of silver coins last month.
 Gold prices quickly shrugged off news the Shanghai Gold
Exchange had temporarily raised trade margins -- which cover
the risk of default -- for its gold and silver forward
contracts.
 A margin requirement hike on COMEX gold contracts was
instrumental in pulling gold from record highs last week.
 ""It's not going to have a major effect,"" said Standard
Bank's de Wet. ""A lot of demand we see out of Asia is physical
rather than speculative.""
 Among other precious metals, silver was down 0.6 percent at
$42.94 an ounce. Holdings of the world's largest silver-backed
exchange-traded fund, the iShares Silver Trust, rose 35 tonnes
on Friday, the trust said.
 Spot platinum was up 0.2 percent at $1,881.50 an ounce,
while palladium was down 2.8 percent at $764 an ounce. Gold
regained its premium over platinum, with the autocatalyst metal
struggling for traction as demand fears grew.

 By Christopher Johnson	
 LONDON, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil fell towards $110
a barrel on Monday as fears of another U.S. recession and
slowing growth elsewhere raised the prospect of lower demand for
fuel.	
 China's services sector grew in August at the lowest pace on
record, a private survey showed on Monday, as new orders ebbed
and tightening measures to rein in an exuberant property sector
started to pinch. 
 Global growth in services came to a virtual standstill last
month as new business all but dried up, adding to fears that the
world economy is facing a double-dip recession.	
 U.S. jobs data came in worse than expected on Friday, adding
to worries about the U.S. economy. 
 Stock markets and the euro -- battered by the debt crisis --
continued to fall on Monday while the dollar rose against other
currencies. The dollar often moves inversely to oil and other
key commodities because they are generally priced in the U.S.
currency on international markets. MKTS/GLOB] 
 ICE Brent futures  for October fell $2.14 to a low of
$110.19 before recovering slightly to trade around $110.40 by
1420 GMT. U.S. crude futures  were down $2.40 at $84.05 a
barrel. Volume was relatively light with U.S. markets closed for
Labor Day.	
 ""Oil is falling on worries over weak demand, unemployment
and talk of a double-dip recession,"" said Eugen Weinberg, head
of commodities research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.	
 Christopher Bellew, broker at Jefferies Bache in London,
agreed, saying the market had come under additional pressure
with a fall in the value of the euro .	
 ""The background is one of poor economic growth and worries
over demand. The euro is under a lot of pressure and equities
have been weak all day,"" Bellew said.	
 
 
 STORM WATCH	
 Providing some support for prices was oil companies'
shutdown of more than half the crude production in the U.S. Gulf
of Mexico due to Tropical Storm Lee, which is hindering efforts
to restaff and restart oil and gas platforms in the basin.

 Lee reached Louisiana's coast early on Sunday, but was
moving inland slowly. High winds grounded helicopters on standby
for oil and gas companies that would have otherwise ferried
workers post-storm assessments and restaff facilities.	
 Another storm, Hurricane Katia, intensified over the open
Atlantic on Sunday, bulking up to a powerful Category 2 storm,
the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. 
 The Miami-based hurricane center said it was still too soon
to gauge the potential threat to land or to the U.S. East Coast
with any certainty. But most computer models showed the storm
veering on a northeast track out to sea after moving safely west
of the mid-Atlantic island of Bermuda later this week. 
 The European Union imposed a ban on purchases of Syrian oil
on Saturday and warned of further steps unless President Bashar
al-Assad's government ended its crackdown on dissent.

 In Libya, soldiers supporting the new interim government
made ready to storm a town held by loyalists of Muammar Gaddafi,
but held off in the hope a surrender would avoid bloodshed.

 The EU has lifted sanctions on Libyan ports and oil firms,
but few expect the country's normal oil production -- around 1.6
million bpd -- to be restored soon, after a civil war halted its
oil sector this year.	
 Olivier Jakob, managing director of oil market consultants
Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland said Thursday would be a key day
for markets with the meeting of the European Central Bank and a
U.S. presidential speech about job creation:	
 ""Global financial markets are still under a lot of stress
(if not under increasing stress) and our opinion remains that in
this environment a low risk-profile needs to be observed,"" Jakob
said.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Spot gold edged lower on
Monday, retaining most of its gains from the previous session,
as a dismal growth outlook after last week's U.S. jobs data
supported safe-haven interest in bullion.	
 U.S. employment growth ground to a halt in August, reviving
recession fears and piling pressure on both President Barack
Obama and the Federal Reserve to provide more stimulus to aid
the frail economy. 
 The bleak outlook of the world's largest economy sent
anxious investors to safe haven assets including bullion.	
 ""Even if you take out the effect from the Verizon strike, it
is still a lousy number and people are concerned that growth is
not there any more,"" said Dominic Schnider, head of commodity
research of UBS Wealth Management in Singapore.	
 He expected the recession fear to send gold to test its
record high above $1,911 hit in late August, and to $2,200 in
the next three months.	
 Technical analysis echoed Schnider's expectations. Spot gold
may rise towards the record of $1,911.46 later in the day, as it
has resumed its long-term uptrend, said Reuters market analyst
Wang Tao. 
 
 
 
 Spot gold edged down 0.3 percent to $1,878.50 an
ounce by 0635 GMT, after surging 3.2 percent in the previous
session. U.S. gold  inched up 0.2 percent to $1,881.40.	
 Amid concerns about the resurgent debt crisis in Europe,
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso on Monday said
he still expected modest growth in Europe and did not anticipate
a recession. 
 ""The market has been a bit choppy -- some sold to book
profit earlier and many are waiting for cues for further
stimulus from the Fed,"" said a Hong Kong-based dealer.	
 Market participants will also closely watch U.S. President
Barack Obama's speech on Sept 7 to unveil new economic proposals
to Congress. 
 The Shanghai Gold Exchange will raise trading limits and
margin requirements on its gold and silver forward contracts on
Sept. 9 to prevent excessive volatility. 
 Money managers cut their net long positions in U.S. gold
futures and options for a fourth week in a row in the week ended
Aug. 30, as bullion prices pulled off an all-time high set a
week earlier, data showed on Friday. 
 Spot platinum hit a two-week high of $1,885.50,
before easing to $1,869. 
 The platinum-gold spread dipped into negative territory on
Friday and remained at a discount of $11, which may help
increase platinum's appeal to investors.

 * More than half of U.S. Gulf crude production remains shut

 By Francis Kan	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell below $112 a
barrel on Monday, as fears of another U.S. recession slowing
fuel demand overshadowed supply concerns over a major shutdown
of offshore oil production forced by Tropical Storm Lee. 
 U.S. employment growth ground to a halt in August, reviving
recession fears and piling pressure on both President Barack
Obama and the Federal Reserve to provide more stimulus to aid
the frail economy. 
 Front-month Brent  fell 61 cents to $111.72 a barrel
by 0248 GMT, after falling to as low as $111.46 earlier. Brent
plunged almost $2 a barrel on Friday on the disappointing jobs
data released in the U.S.	
 U.S. crude  was down 67 cents to $85.78 a barrel,
after settling $2.48 lower at $86.45. Friday's oil losses wiped
out part of U.S. crude's 4.1 percent gain in the week through
Thursday. 
 ""The macro situation is leading to fears of a double-dip
recession. And there has been a recent trend of selling into
strength when the market hits a soft patch,"" said Chen Xin Yi, a
commodities analyst at Barclays Capital in Singapore.	
 Asian stocks followed Wall Street lower on Monday, after the
U.S. Labor Department said employers added no net new jobs last
month and July's total was revised lower. 
 Compounding fears of a recession in the United States,
Europe faces a string of political and legal tests this week
that could hurt efforts to resolve its sovereign debt.

 However, worsening economic woes may also raise the odds of
more quantitative easing (QE) by the U.S. Federal Reserve. That
could cheapen borrowing, weaken the dollar, and encourage
investment in commodities as an asset class. 
 ""This is likely to bring further calls for quantitative
easing, despite the Fed's apparent aversion,"" said CMC Markets
market strategist Michael McCarthy in a research note.
 
 
 
 Brent oil  will fall further to $109.01 per barrel,
while U.S. oil  is also expected to fall more to $84.20
per barrel, according to Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.

 STORM WATCH	
 Providing some support for prices was oil companies'
shutdown of more than half the crude production in the U.S. Gulf
of Mexico due to Tropical Storm Lee, which is hindering efforts
to restaff and restart oil and gas platforms in the basin.

 Lee reached Louisiana's coast early Sunday, but was moving
inland very slowly. Its 45 miles-per-hour (75 kmph) winds
grounded helicopters on standby for oil and gas companies that
would have otherwise ferried workers out to do post-storm
assessments and restaff facilities.	
 ""Reports that about 60 percent of crude refinery capacity
was halted while Tropical Storm Lee hit the coast could lead to
further declines in crude stockpiles in the latest government
inventory report,"" ANZ Bank said in a research note.	
 Another storm, Hurricane Katia, intensified over the open
Atlantic on Sunday, bulking up to a powerful Category 2 storm,
the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. 
 The Miami-based hurricane center said it was still too soon
to gauge the potential threat to land or to the U.S. East Coast
with any certainty. 
 But most computer models showed the storm veering on a
northeast track out to sea after moving safely west of the
mid-Atlantic island of Bermuda later this week.

 MENA RISKS 
 The European Union imposed a ban on purchases of Syrian oil
on Saturday and warned of further steps unless President Bashar
al-Assad's government ended its five-month crackdown on dissent.

 In Libya, forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi refused on Sunday
to give up one of their last strongholds without a fight,
raising the prospect of an assault on the town of Bani Walid.

 The EU has lifted sanctions on Libyan ports and oil firms,
but few expect the country's normal oil production -- around 1.6
million bpd -- to be restored soon, after a civil war halted its
oil sector this year.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD86.38 a barrel during afternoon U.S. trade, falling 2.75%, after hitting a daily high of USD88.99.
The U.S. Labor Department, earlier Friday, reported that non-farm payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest job reading in a year.  Market expectations were for non-farm payrolls to increase by 74,000 in August, after a revised 85,000 gain in July.
Stagnant job growth raised the odds that the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank may be preparing for a new round of asset buying, or quantitative easing.
The White House’s Office of Management and Budget, on Thursday, forecast that unemployment would average 8.8% this year, down from an earlier estimate of 9.3%.
Meanwhile, oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico braced for the next major storm of the year. A tropical depression was forecast to approach the coast of Louisiana over the weekend, and could be upgraded to a tropical storm later Friday, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.
The Gulf is home to 29% of U.S. oil production and British Petroleum has already ordered the evacuation of non-essential personnel from four of its platforms in the area.
A rising U.S. dollar helped to depress oil futures, as dollar-denominated futures contracts tend to fall when the dollar rises.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, gained 0.28% to 74.78. 
On the ICE Futures Exchange Brent oil futures for October delivery retreated 1.02% to trade at USD112.94.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,873.65 a troy ounce during mid-day U.S. trade, up USD49.10 or 2.7%. 
 The U.S. Labor Department reported earlier Friday that non-farm payrolls remained flat in August, after a revised 85,000 gain in July.
Market expectations were for non-farm payrolls to increase by 74,000 in August.
Unemployment held steady at 9.1% in August, mirroring the July figure and in line with economist’s forecasts, according to the Labor Department report. 
“The number of unemployed persons, at 14 million, was essentially unchanged in August...Employment in most major industries changed little over the month,” the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its report.
Gold rallied by 12% during the month of August as unresolved debt issues in the euro zone coupled with a downgrade of the U.S. top-notch credit rating triggered extreme volatility in global stock markets.
Speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may be prepared to take further quantitative easing measures to prop up the economy surfaced in minutes from last week’s Fed meeting in Wyoming.
At the Federal Reserve’s August policy meeting, some members favored the introduction of further action to boost the economy, including the purchasing of additional government debt, according to a central bank release earlier this week.
Wall Street shares bounced from Friday session lows following the labor report but remained in the red, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 1.71% to 11,296.42, the Nasdaq Composite Index dropping 2.08% to 2,493.12, and the S&P 500 retreating 2.03%. to 1,180.21.

 By Carole Vaporean
 NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Gold surged nearly 3 percent
on Friday, hitting its highest level since last week's record,
as investors sought refuge in safe haven assets following a
bleak U.S. employment report.
 Some investors viewed the lack of jobs growth in August as
a sign the world's largest economy may be heading back into
recession, heightening demand for gold. It was the first time
in nearly a year the economy had failed to create new jobs.
 Some said the report increased the odds of more stimulus
from the Federal Reserve when it meets on Sept. 20-21, also a
positive for bullion. Gold's sojourn to all-time highs was
largely carved out on added liquidity from stimulus measures
along with a gloomy economic outlook.
 ""I think there was a great deal of disappointment with the
employment numbers and that kicked off speculation of further
quantitative easing or some sort of monetary response,"" said
HSBC metals analyst and senior vice president James Steel.
 By 3:23 p.m. EDT (1923 GMT), spot gold  was up
$57.25, or 3.1 percent, at $1,881.69 per ounce. It earlier rose
to a high of $1,879.30, its highest level since reaching its
record at $1,911.46 on Aug. 23.
 Benchmark U.S. gold December futures on the COMEX exchange
 finished 2.6 percent, or $47.8 higher, at $1,876.90 an
ounce. It rose as high as $1,887.40, also its highest since its
Aug. 23 record at $1,917.90.
 Gold had notched up a sizable portion of the day's gain
prior to the data, with traders having braced for yet another

 (Adds settlement prices and details)
 By Joshua Schneyer
 NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Oil fell on Friday as stalled
U.S. job growth in August rekindled worries of another will be
recession, which would slow fuel demand.
 Pressure from the jobs data more than offset support from
oil companies shutting down nearly half of the crude production
in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico ahead of Tropical Storm Lee.
 U.S. nonfarm payrolls were unchanged last month, the Labor
Department said on Friday. The weakest job reading in a year
bucked economists' expectations for a gain of 75,000 jobs.
 Brent  fell by $1.96 a barrel to settle at $112.33.
U.S. crude was  down $2.90 at $86.03. U.S. crude 
fell $2.48 a barrel to settle at $86.45 a barrel, in trading
volume around 37 percent below the 30-day average.
 U.S. financial markets will close on Monday for Labor Day,
although electronic trading will remain active.
 Stunted jobs growth would weigh on fuel demand, but it may
also raise the odds of more quantitative easing (QE) from by
the U.S. Federal Reserve. That could cheapen borrowing, weaken
the dollar, and encourage investment in commodities as an asset
class.
 ""The (jobs) data reinforces our concern that the U.S.
economy has stalled, and we think there is a 60 percent chance
it will fall into recession by the end of the year or at the
start of next year,"" said Rachel Ziemba at Roubini Global
Economics in London.
 ""We think QE3 is coming,"" she said.
 The August U.S. jobs data will be ""likely enough to spur
Fed easing action at the September meeting,"" Goldman Sachs
economists wrote in a note.
 The Fed may extend the maturity of its Treasuries holdings
after a policy meeting slated for Sept. 20-21, they added.
 BRENT-WTI SPREAD WIDENS
 The spread between Europe's benchmark crude and U.S. crude
surged to as much as $26.98 a barrel, a new record.

 European Union governments agreed to ban imports of oil
from Syria, which typically ships 150,000 barrels per day.
[ID:nLDE7810H1] 
 The EU also lifted sanctions on Libyan ports and oil
firms, but few expect the country's normal oil production --
around 1.6 million bpd -- to be restored soon, after a civil
war halted its oil sector this year.
 The newly-appointed chairman of Libya's National Oil
Corporation expressed optimism this week that full production
could be restored within 15 months. [ID:nL5E7JU2JK]
 Oil also followed equities markets lower, as the S&P 500
index shed 2.5 percent. Copper, another economic bellwether
, fell 0.6 percent in London. Gold, a perceived safe
haven bet, jumped nearly 3 percent to a 1-1/2 week high
.
 STORM RISK
 Friday's oil losses wiped out part of U.S. crude's 4.1
percent gain in the week through Thursday, when it had settled
at a one-month high, in part due to a tropical storm threat in
the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
 Oil companies shut in 666,321 barrels of crude production
in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on Friday, or 48 percent of the
region's output, as they braced for Tropical Storm Lee.
 The weather cycle is moving towards Louisiana and has
forced wide evacuations of offshore oil platforms.
[ID:N1E7810S2]
 BP Plc  , the largest oil producer in the Gulf,
evacuated all personnel from its platforms in the region.
Refiners on the Gulf Coast said they were getting ready for up
to 15 inches (38 cm) of rain in the next 48 hours.
[ID:nN1E7810KA]
 ""The fact that this storm isn't very supportive (for U.S.
crude prices) shows you that the U.S. is well supplied,"" said
Richard Ilczyszyn at MF Global in Chicago.
 Speculators hiked their bets on rising U.S. crude oil
prices in the week to Aug. 30, raising their net longs futures
and options positions by the largest percentage amount since
June, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said.
 Hedge funds and other large investors increased their net
longs on the New York Mercantile Exchange by 18,422 or 12
percent to 161,617. [ID:nEMS0D41HN]

 By Florence Tan	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Brent crude was steady above
$114 a barrel, headed for its second straight weekly gain, while
investors eyed key U.S. jobs data for clues on whether the
world's largest oil consumer would be able to dodge a recession
and leave demand growth intact.	
 Weak data may prompt the Federal Reserve to start a fresh
round of policy easing at its next meeting on Sept. 20.
Investors were also watching for potential supply disruption in
the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) as a brewing storm shut nearly 6
percent of output in the key producing region.	
 Front-month Brent  fell 13 cents to $114.16 a barrel
by 0310 GMT. It was on track for a weekly gain of more than 2
percent. U.S. crude  was down 28 cents to $88.65 a barrel,
but was set for a nearly 4 percent rise this week -- highest
since early July.	
 ""The market is still expecting some concrete steps from the
Fed to boost the economy,"" said Yusuke Seta, a commodity sales
manager at Newedge Japan, adding that the sentiment helped to
support oil prices.	
 But if the jobs data is weaker than expected, equities could
fall and oil may follow, he said.	
 While the consensus forecasts is for a 75,000 addition to
jobs in August, the market is discussing a smaller number after
a decline in the employment component of the Institute for
Supply Management's factory activity index. 
 
 Some analysts were still pessimistic about the macroeconomic
outlook and were not pinning hopes on another bond buying, or
quantitative easing, by the central bank.	
 ""The recent figures have been pretty poor, and we are not
sure why so many prominent economists refuse to see the numbers
trending back towards recession,"" Peter Beutel, president of
trading advisory Cameron Hanover said in a note.	
 ""It seems to us that the belief that the Fed will ride to
the rescue - even though not everyone wants it to - is overly
optimistic.""	
 Latest data showed unexpected growth in the U.S.
manufacturing sector in August and fewer jobless claims last
week, despite a slump in confidence that threatened to push the
economy back into recession. 
 
 EYES ON STORMS	
 In the Gulf of Mexico, major oil and gas producers on
Thursday shut down offshore platforms and evacuated workers
ahead of a storm brewing offshore that was expected to bring
flooding to Louisiana over the weekend.	
 So far only a fraction of Gulf output was shut as of
Thursday-- 5.7 percent of oil supply and 2.4 percent of gas
supply, according to the U.S. government. 
 Those percentages will likely rise significantly in coming
days as the storm develops.	
 Investors were also concerned with outages in the North Sea
and Nigeria, Newedge's Seta said, referring to a force majeure
of Nigerian Bonny Light, production issues at the Forties and
Ekofisk.	
 This has pushed up October Brent futures and widened its gap
with November contract, keeping the market in wide
backwardation, he said.	
 Brent's premium against U.S. crude widened to $25.62 a
barrel from Thursday's close. The premium hit a record $26.69 on
Aug. 19, according to Reuters data.  
 BP said on Wednesday that production at its Valhall
platform, which pumps Ekofisk, would resume by mid-September,
later than expected. 
 In Syria, looming European Union sanctions are unlikely to
immediately impact oil supply from the producer as several
tankers are sailing to the country this week to either deliver
fuel or pick up crude. 
 European oil companies are betting on the survival of
President Bashar al-Assad, in contrast to their support for
Libya's opposition six months ago.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Gold prices held steady on
Friday as investors stood on the sidelines ahead of a key U.S.
payrolls report due later in the day, after recent data sent
mixed signals about the status of the world's largest economy. 
 Caution is likely to prevail before the key U.S. August
employment report is released at 1230 GMT. Nonfarm payrolls are
expected to have increased 75,000, slowing from July's 117,000
rise, according to a Reuters survey. 
 A big surprise in the jobs data could move gold prices up or
down. Short of a huge discrepancy with forecasts, however, many
players will continue to try to ride the middle ground.	
 ""Gold seems to have a trading band of $1,810 and $1,840, and
is unlikely to break the range ahead of the payrolls data,"" said
David Thurtell, a Citigroup analyst.	
 Spot gold edged up 0.3 percent to $1,829.21 an ounce
by 0634 GMT, little changed from a week earlier.	
 U.S. gold  inched up 0.2 percent to $1,832.30, headed
for a weekly gain of 1.9 percent.	
 
 Investors will keep an eye on inflation figures from China
next week to gauge the progress of Beijing's battle against
rapidly rising prices, while a two-day policy meeting of the
U.S. Federal Reserve starting Sept. 20 will also be in the
spotlight.	
 Financial market participants are eager to learn if the Fed
plans to launch more stimulus plan to spur the ailing economy. 
 Latest data showed unexpected growth in the U.S.
manufacturing sector in August and fewer jobless claims last
week, despite a slump in confidence that threatened to push the
economy back into recession. 
 Uncertainties around global growth have sent anxious
investors to the safety of gold. Bullion prices surged about
$400 in July and August in a record-setting rally.

 ""Given the current economic circumstances, I don't think
anything is going to change any time soon,"" said Gavin Wendt,
senior resources analyst at Minelife, an Australia-based
research firm.	
 ""Gold is the place to be as far as investors are concerned.
Prices are going higher -- there's no doubt about that. It's not
only about making money in this environment, but also about
wealth preservation.""	
 Spot silver gained 0.4 percent to $41.60, headed for
a 0.2 percent rise from a week earlier.	
 Bolivia, the world's sixth-largest silver producing country

On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD88.70 a barrel during early Asian trade, falling 0.08%, after hitting a daily high of USD88.93.
The U.S. Institute of Supply Management reported earlier Thursday, that its index of purchasing managers fell to 50.6 in the month of August from 50.9 the month before. That was better than analyst’s forecasts of a retreat to 48.5 for the month but still represented a contraction in activity.
Separately, the U.S. Department of Labor released data for the week ending August 26, showing that the number of Americans filing for initial job benefits dropped by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 409,000, in line with market expectations.
In Europe, Markit Economics reported that its August purchasing manager’s index for manufacturing dropped to a two-year low to 49.0, below market expectations of retention of the previous month’s figure of 49.7.
 Oil traders pay close attention to manufacturing trends as harbingers of changes in demand for energy.
Meanwhile, oil producers in the Gulf of Mexico prepared for Tropical Storm Katia as it strengthened to hurricane status, threatening U.S. production in the region which accounts for 29% of the nation’s total.
British Petroleum reported it had already ordered the evacuation of non-essential workers from four of its platforms in the Gulf.
A weakening U.S. dollar helped to minimize losses in oil futures, as dollar-denominated futures contracts tend to rise when the dollar falls.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell 0.02% to 74.56.

1340,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 01, 2011 08:27PM ET</span>",Gold futures rise in early Asian trade,"Investing.com – Gold futures staked out gains in Asian trade Friday, bouncing from session lows following the release of an industry report showing U.S. manufacturing activity contracted at a slower rate than market expectations.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,826.85 a troy ounce during early Asian trade, up 0.11%. 
Earlier Thursday, the U.S. Institute of Supply Management reported that its index of purchasing managers fell to 50.6 in the month of August from 50.9 the month before, better than analyst’s forecasts of a retreat to 48.5 for the month.
Separately, the U.S. Department of Labor released data for the week ending August 26, showing that the number of Americans filing for initial job benefits dropped by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 409,000, in line with market expectations.
A turndown in U.S. stocks helped support gold prices as investors stayed with precious metal positions rather than turn to risker equity investments.
Financial service provider Barclays said in a report, that although gold prices faced a possible correction in the short term, “long-term settlement is underpinned by a number of factors including low U.S. interest rates, stubborn inflation in emerging economies and a lingering euro-zone debt crisis.”
Barclay’s noted that it forecast golf prices to “venture into uncharted territory.”
A higher dollar contributed to dampened enthusiasm for gold purchases as a stronger greenback makes the precious metal more expensive for investors who hold other currencies.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was higher by 0.06% to 74.62.

 By Carole Vaporean
 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Gold was mildly mixed by the
close on Thursday, with many investors reluctant to take their
positions in the precious metal too far in either direction a
day ahead of key U.S. employment figures.
 Gold fell sharply in early trade after better-than-expected
U.S. economic data allayed recession fears and boosted the
dollar. But by late in the session, spot gold prices had moved
into positive territory and U.S. gold futures were only
slightly lower, as investors awaited the jobs data.
 Both spot gold and futures logged inside days on pricecharts, within the highs and lows of the previous session.
 ""Today's (economic) numbers were kind of a mixed bag. But
they were still bearish for our economy and bullish for gold.
But I think it's aiding in the sideways trade we're seeing.
There's no real defining factor that is pushing people in one
direction of the other,"" said Fred Schoenstein, metals trader
at Heraeus Precious Metals Management in New York.
 Spot gold  was up slightly at $1,824.40 an ounce by
4:23 p.m. EDT (2023 GMT) having earlier slipped to $1,815.15.
 Meanwhile, Benchmark COMEX December gold futures 
settled down $2.60 at $1,829.10 per ounce, after falling
earlier as low as $1,815.50 an ounce.
 Investors were reluctant to place big bets ahead of the
government's August employment report, expected to show a tepid
75,000 increase in payrolls. [ID:nN1E77S1IS]
 A big surprise in the jobs data could move gold prices up
or down. Short of a huge discrepancy with forecasts, however,
many players will continue to try to ride the middle ground.
 ""If non-farm payrolls are terrible tomorrow, we'll see gold
move. But for now, I think people are relatively hesitant to
add onto positions or even to initiate new positions at this
level. And, if you are long, why would you take profit here?,""
said Heraeus' Schoenstein.
 The U.S. Labor Department's monthly data are due at 8:30
a.m. EDT (1230 GMT).
 After mixed economic readings released in recent sessions,
the labor market figures should guide investors in positioning
themselves ahead of the long U.S. Labor Day weekend. But the
looming holiday may help keep trading in a range.
 Earlier on Thursday, gold fell to session lows on mixed
economic readings. Weekly jobless claims and the August
manufacturing series were stronger than expected, but still
weak enough to show a very sluggish U.S. economy.
 ""Gold is off again and I think it's partly the somewhat
stronger U.S. dollar and of course the economic data--the
claims data, but even more so the ISM index has suggested that
we're not in a recession at this point,"" said Peter Buchanan,

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Spot gold slid 0.3 percent on
Thursday as investors weighed the possibility of further monetary
easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve after stronger-than-expected
manufacturing and labour market data.	
 After recent data showed plunging U.S. consumer confidence,
Thursday's numbers suggested a strong rebound in demand for
manufactured goods in July and increased hiring from private
employers, easing fears the world's largest economy would slip back
into recession. 
 Investors are closely watching a Sept. 20 Fed policy meeting for
clues to whether the central bank might launch more stimulus
measures for the economy.	
 ""Some investors have left the safe haven assets, such as gold,
for the stock market with hopes that the Fed will announce more
stimulus, as increased liquidity and improved economic prospects are
expected to lift share prices,"" said a Tokyo-based dealer.	
 Global stock markets recently recovered after several weeks of
losses. Gold climbed 12 percent in August, but has been seesawing
around $1,800 for the past few sessions. 
 
 
 
 Another round of government bond-buying by the Fed would lift
the inflation outlook, and interest in bullion, as a hedge against
higher prices.	
 In China, the world's largest gold producer and second-largest
gold consumer, the government has made battling inflation a top
priority and gold bugs have ploughed more money into bullion.

 Spot gold inched down 0.3 percent to $1,818.19 an ounce
by 0730 GMT, up 28 percent so far this year. It hit a record high of
$1,911.46 on Aug. 23.	
 U.S. gold  declined 0.6 percent to $1,821.60 an ounce.	
 Gold is faced with strong resistance at $1,840 and silver at
$42, said the Tokyo-based dealer.	
 ""Neither gold nor silver has enough momentum to break higher
after they fell off the recent highs,"" he said.	
 Spot silver edged down 0.3 percent to $41.34 an ounce,
down more than 6 percent from a 3-1/2-month high of $44.14 hit on
Aug. 23.	
 U.S. data due later on Thursday includes jobless claims,
construction spending and the ISM manufacturing index, as well as
the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) from the euro
zone. 
 China's factory activity improved slightly in August from a
28-month trough, but tight monetary policy at home and torpid demand
abroad has dimmed chances for a sustained recovery. 
 Gold could face a correction after rallying 20 percent in the
past two months, but long-term sentiment is underpinned by several
factors including low U.S. interest rates, stubborn inflation in
emerging economies and a lingering euro zone debt crisis.	
 ""The uncertainty clouding the macro outlook has lifted gold
prices, and as long as it persists and investors remain responsive
to gold, barring short term corrections, prices are set to venture
further into uncharted territory,"" Barclays Capital said in a
research note.	
 Central banks are also still buying gold despite record high
prices. Russia added 4.42 tonnes to its reserves in July, while
Colombia bought 2.3 tonnes of in its first purchase since March
1998.

 By Edward McAllister
 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Oil in London fell on Thursday
on concerns about the European economy, while U.S. crude rose
slightly as a brewing storm in the Gulf of Mexico shut nearly 6
percent of output in the key producing region.
 Weak manufacturing data in Germany and France, and news
that Greece could miss its 2011 deficit target, pressured
prices in light, choppy trading in London.
 U.S. crude ended marginally higher as companies evacuated
personnel from platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and shut in 5.7
percent of production there ahead of a tropical disturbance
over the central gulf. [ID:nWEN7851]
 Front-month Brent  settled down 56 cents at $114.29
a barrel, after hitting a low of $113.61. U.S. crude 
rose 12 cents to settle at $88.93 a barrel, after earlier
touching a four-week high of $89.81 a barrel. Traders saw
resistance around the $90 level for U.S. crude.
 ""The stock market is lower and helping to pull U.S. crude
back and the weak German and French data weighed on Brent,""
said Dan Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago.
 Wall Street fell as investors paused after a four-day rally
and awaited Friday's key payrolls report, despite mildly
positive manufacturing and payroll data on Thursday. [.N]
 Economic worry persisted in Europe, as German manufacturing
activity grew at its slowest pace in nearly two years in August
and French manufacturing activity contracted. [ID:nL9E7HO0AG]
 Oil trading volumes were light. By 2:55 p.m. EDT (1855
GMT), 487,200 U.S. crude contracts were traded, 29 percent
below the 30-day average. Brent crude volume was 420,200
contracts, 10.4 percent below the 30-day average.
 Brent's premium against U.S. crude narrowed to $25.36 at
the close, from $26.04 on Wednesday. The premium hit a record
$26.69 on Aug. 19, according to Reuters data. 
 U.S. crude has been at a discount to Brent in part due to
the glut of supplies trapped in the U.S. Midwest. A lack of
pipelines has left growing production stranded at the Cushing
storage hub without access to refineries on the Gulf Coast.
 Magellan Midstream Partners  said it will convert a
products pipeline in Texas into a crude pipeline, and reverse
the flow to transport oil from the Texas Permian Basin south to
refiners in Houston and Texas City. The conversion project, to
be completed by mid-2013, should help relieve the glut at
Cushing. [ID:nN1E7800SD]

 By Alejandro Barbajosa	
 SINGAPORE, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose to a
one-month high above $115 on Thursday after China's
manufacturing rebounded in August, stoking expectations for
growth in the world's largest energy consumer to offset slowing
industrialised economies.	
 Front-month Brent  touched $115.27 a barrel, the
highest intraday price since Aug. 3, and was up 25 cents from
Wednesday at $115.10 by 0230 GMT. U.S. crude benchmark West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) climbed 29 cents to $89.10.	
 China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to
50.9 in August from a 28-month low of 50.7 in July, official
data showed, while upbeat sentiment across financial markets
lifted Asian stocks on hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve would
intervene to support the economy. 
 ""From a Chinese perspective, the PMI data is encouraging in
that it is going in the right direction,"" said Nick Trevethan, a
senior commodities strategist at ANZ in Singapore.	
 ""Markets are still hoping for some kind of easing policy in
the United States and there are some worries about a couple of
storm systems developing.""

 
 
 Hurricane Katia became the second storm of such intensity
over the Atlantic this year, while another mass of thunderstorms
that could become a named storm this week triggered evacuations
of some oil workers from the Gulf of Mexico. 
 BP began to evacuate more than 500 non-essential
workers from four platforms in the region, home to large volumes
of U.S. crude and natural gas production. 
 Brent crude is on track for eight straight sessions of gains
following a sharp drop of 2.8 million barrels in U.S. gasoline
stockpiles last week and as North Sea production issues keep
European crude supplies tight.	
 Prices rose on Wednesday after a report showed the U.S.
private sector added 91,000 jobs in August, while an index of
factory activity in the U.S. Midwest in August and U.S. July
factory orders were better than expected. 
 Still, the data continued to portray an economy struggling
to mount a sustained recovery. As such, it further raised
expectations that the Fed would adopt new measures to shore up
the economy, supporting gains on Wall Street.	
 Underscoring fears about a global slowdown, Brazil surprised
markets by cutting its benchmark interest rate to 12 percent
from 12.5 percent, and expressed particular concern abut the
pace of growth in mature economies.

1353,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 31, 2011 09:02PM ET</span>",Crude oil falls in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - Crude oil futures moved lower in Asian trade Thursday, as inventories in the U.S. rose last week, further dampening expectations for an increase in demand from the world’s largest energy consumer. 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD88.82 a barrel during early Asian trade, falling 0.12%, after hitting a daily low of USD88.66.
In its weekly report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that crude oil inventories rose by 5.3 million barrels in the week ending August 26 after a 2.2 million barrel decline the week before. Market expectations were for a 0.9 million barrel increase for the period.
The IEA reported that total crude oil inventories in the U.S. stood at 357.1 million barrels as of last week.
Gasoline inventories fell by 2.8 million barrels with East Coast stockpiles hit hardest as drivers filled up ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Irene.
Earlier in the day, payroll processing firm ADP reported that non-farm private employment in the U.S. rose less than expected to a seasonally adjusted 91,000 in August.
The August figure follows a 109,000 gain in July and fell short of market expectations of an increase to 103,000. 
Separately, data from the U.S. Census Bureau on Wednesday showed that factory orders jumped 2.4% in July, far exceeding economist’s forecasts of a 1% increase.
Concerns of a slowdown in the global economy and therefore decreased energy demand sent crude oil futures lower by 7.2% for the month of August.
A falling U.S. dollar helped to provide underlying support for oil futures, as dollar-denominated futures contracts tend to rise when the dollar falls.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell 0.05% to 74.17.

1355,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 31, 2011 08:23PM ET</span>",Gold futures inch higher in early Asian trade,"Investing.com – Gold futures eked out marginal gains in Asian trade Thursday, as dealers locked in profits following a 2.5% gain in the previous day’s session, and the precious metal registered a 12% rise in the month of August, its strongest showing since November 2009.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,825.55 a troy ounce during early Asian trade, up 0.07%. 
Earlier in the day, payroll processing firm ADP reported that non-farm private employment in the U.S. rose less than expected to a seasonally adjusted 91,000 in August.
The August figure follows a 109,000 gain in July and fell short of market expectations of an increase to 103,000. 
The poor labor numbers came at the heels of the release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s August policy meeting, where some members favored the introduction of further action to boost the economy, including the purchasing of additional government debt.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said that the central bank should consider additional stimulus measures unless the U.S. economy shows significant improvement.
Evans added that the Federal Reserve’s bond buying measures “need to stay in place until unemployment drops below 7% or inflation gets past 3%.”
Elsewhere, People’s Bank of China adviser Xia Bin told the China Business News that the country should shore up reserves of gold and other commodities.
“China should realize that gold is an important strategic reserve, and should increase its holdings over the long term,” Xia said in a Dow Jones newswire report, adding, “In the past we have not established this as an investment principle, but now we must.”
China and India are the world’s largest consumers of gold.

 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Brent crude futures rose for a
seventh straight day on Wednesday, lifted by a sharp drawdown
in U.S. gasoline stockpiles and as North Sea production issues
kept European crude supplies tight.
 U.S. gasoline futures led the oil complex higher for a
second day, after the U.S. Energy Information Administration
reported a steep 2.8 million barrel drawdown in stockpiles for
the week to Aug. 26. [ID:nN1E77U0XZ]
 The drawdown came as motorists on the East Coast filled up
their gasoline tanks ahead of the Hurricane Irene. Another
factor was a seasonal decreases related to the expiry on
Wednesday of the September RBOB futures contract, the last
contract for summer-grade gasoline.
 ""Gasoline stocks continue their seasonal drawdown,"" said

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Gold pared sharp losses
on Wednesday, ending down less than 1 percent as soft U.S.
private-sector job and factory data gave investors hope that
the Federal Reserve would use extra stimulus to help the
economy.
 Gold faced pressure as an initial rally in equity markets
weakened safe-haven bids. Bullion has gained 12 percent so far
in August, its biggest monthly rise in nearly two years.
 The metal has rallied as much as 8 percent in the past four
sessions on weak U.S. consumer confidence and European
sentiment data. Comments by U.S. and European policymakers on
the need for easy monetary policies also underpinned bullion's
investment appeal.
 ""Investors have come to the realization that there is no
expectation for any type of European rate hike any time soon,""
said David Meger, director of metals trading at Chicago-based
Vision Financial Markets.
 ""Low interest rates here and in Europe are another positive
aspect for the gold market going forward,"" he said.
 Spot gold  was down 0.7 percent at $1,823.79 an ounce
by 3:13 p.m. EDT (1913 GMT), having briefly turned higher. It
was sharply off a session low of $1,812.39. Gold gained 2.6
percent on Tuesday.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$1.90 at $1,831.70 an ounce. Trading volume was 25 percent
below its 30-day average.
 Silver  rose 0.2 percent to $41.50 an ounce.
 European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet on
Monday suggested the bank could tone down its view on inflation
pressures and keep interest rates on hold well into next year.
[ID:nL5E7JT1FF]
 Physical coin demand also boosted prices as investors
sought refuge in gold and silver from a global market maelstrom
in early August.
 U.S. Mint data showed that sales of its American Eagle gold
bullion coin in August are on track to mark the third-strongest
month so far this year, behind February and April.

 FED, ECB MEETINGS IN FOCUS
 The Fed has given no explicit signal that it will embark on
a third round of purchases of government bonds to keep market
interest rates low -- a measure known as quantitative easing --
meaning markets are increasingly jittery and prone to swings in
response to influences such as economic data.
 Minutes from the Fed's policy meeting on Aug. 9 released on
Tuesday showed the central bank discussed a range of unusual
tools it could use to help the economy and more quantitative
easing remains an option. [ID:nN1E77T1HY] [ID:nL4E7JV009]
 ""The next data point for gold is some sort of clarity out
of the U.S. Fed over the next few weeks on whether they will
deliver another round of quantitative easing,"" said Tom Price,
global commodity analyst at UBS.
 The Fed is scheduled to meet on Sept. 20 to discuss options
to help spur the faltering U.S. economy.
 The gold price has risen nearly 50 percent since the Fed
signaled in August last year it would inject more stimulus into
the economy. Since then, it has also committed to leaving U.S.
interest rates near zero for another two years.
 Investors are also looking forward to the ECB's meeting
next Thursday. The bank is expected to tone down its inflation
prognosis due to new, more downbeat economic forecasts from the
ECB's in-house economists.

1367,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2011 10:36PM ET</span>",CORRECTED-Brent stays near $114 on U.S. stimulus hopes," (Corrects to show Brent on track for biggest monthly loss since
June, not May, in paragraph 4)	
 * Fed mulls action to help struggling U.S. economy
 * Crude stockpiles rise more than expected -API data
 * Tropical Storm Katia may become hurricane -NHC

 By Florence Tan	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Brent crude hovered at $114 a
barrel on Wednesday after posting six days of gains on
expectations the United States will act again to try to
stimulate its economy and boost fuel demand.	
 Investors also eyed storm developments for potential supply
disruption in the United States and a pick-up in seasonal fourth
quarter demand, although a larger-than-expected rise in crude
inventories depressed U.S. oil futures.	
 Brent crude  was down 5 cents at $113.97 by 0218 GMT,
after settling at a four-week high of $114.02 a barrel. U.S.
crude  fell 39 cents to $88.51 a barrel, snapping four
days of gains.	
 U.S. crude is headed for its biggest monthly loss since May
while Brent is on track for its largest loss since June, as
fears that another recession in the United States and a debt
crisis in the euro zone could cut fuel demand sparked a sell-off
at the start of August.	
 U.S. crude's discount against Brent crude  was at
$25.46, slightly wider than Tuesday's close, as a force majeure
on Nigerian Bonny Light tightened supply of Brent-linked grades.	
 ""Investors are already looking at fourth quarter demand
which doesn't look so bad from a seasonal standpoint,"" said Tony
Nunan, a risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp.	
 ""If we can get beyond the fear of a second recession, the
oil market still stands a chance for upside.""	
 Minutes from an August Fed meeting showed it was considering
a range of actions to help the struggling economy, including the
unprecedented step of tying the interest rate policy outlook to
a specific unemployment level. 
 ""There's no way that the Fed could have another round of
quantitative easing, but the financial community seems to have a
strong expectation,"" Nunan said.	
 Federal Reserves chairman Ben Bernanke, by delaying the
September meeting, could be ""leaving the door open"" to assess
more data on housing and unemployment, he added.	
 Jonathan Barratt, managing director of Commodity Broking
Services in Sydney, said the need for additional stimulus was a
debatable issue.	
 ""I am of the opinion that they will do nothing. The United
States could suffer in terms of growth but it will not be a
detrimental issue,"" he said. ""The market needs to work itself to
the right level.""	
 Technical charts showed that Brent and U.S. crude are
heading for further gains, Reuters market analyst Wang Tao said.	
 


 
 INVENTORIES RISE	
 An industry report showed a higher than expected rise in
U.S. crude oil inventories last week as imports rose and
refinery utilization dropped, while gasoline saw a big draw.

 Crude stockpiles rose 5.1 million barrels for the week to
Aug. 26, data from the American Petroleum Institute showed, well
over analyst expectations for a 400,000-barrel gain. The
government's Energy Information Administration will issue its
own data on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT.	
 Investors were eyeing the development of Tropical Storm
Katia in the Atlantic, which could become a hurricane by late
Wednesday or early Thursday, according to the National Hurricane
Center. 
 A tropical wave over the northwestern Caribbean Sea has a 10
percent chance of becoming a cyclone in the next 48 hours, and
could move into the western Gulf of Mexico, home to a large
concentration of oil and natural gas facilities.

 In Libya, oil production can restart within weeks and reach
full pre-war output within 15 months, the newly-appointed
chairman of the country's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said.

 The resumption of Libyan production was supposed to weaken
Brent prices but this has been balanced by the Bonny Light force
majeure and an embargo on Syrian exports, Mitsubishi's Nunan
said.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Spot gold fell half a percent
on Wednesday, pulling back from a rally of 2.6 percent in the

since the 2007-2009 recession, after a bruising battle over the
U.S. budget slammed stock prices and pushed the nation to the
brink of default. 
 * Expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may launch more
stimulus for the faltering economy also support the sentiment in
the gold market, as investors await a Fed meeting in September.

 * The euro zone's economic sentiment fell more than expected
in August, just as Italy warned weak growth may endanger

 By Matthew Robinson
 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose for a sixth
straight session to a four-week high on Tuesday, boosted by
concerns about gasoline supplies, optimism about fresh economic
stimulus and the threat of fresh storms.
 U.S. gasoline futures led the complex higher, rallying 3
percent, boosted in part by concerns about the slow return of
some refinery operations following Hurricane Irene.
 ""The market is getting a little perturbed that refiners are
not coming back quickly,"" said Stephen Schork, editor of The
Schork Report in Villanova, Pennsylvania.
 Further support for prices came after Chicago Federal
Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said he favored strong
central bank accommodation for a substantial period of time, as
the U.S. economy looks to be moving ""sideways."" [ID:nN1E77T08F]
 Traders have been closely watching for any signs of more
stimulus for the economy, which would spur investors into oil.
 Crude got an additional boost following the release of
notes from the Aug. 9 policy meeting showed the Fed considered
a range of actions, including the unprecedented step of tying
interest rate policy outlook to a specific unemployment level.
[ID:nW1E7IR01J]
 ""The Fed minutes revealed they were inclined to do QE3
(quantitative easing) and this could be bullish for oil and
commodities going forward,"" said Richard Ilczyszyn, senior
market strategist, at MF Global in Chicago.
 Brent crude  traded up $2.14 to settle at a
four-week high of $114.02 a barrel, breaking over the 50-day
moving average. U.S. crude,  settled up $1.63 at a
three-week high of $88.90 a barrel.
 Trading volumes were 9 percent below the 30-day average for
Brent and 10 percent below for U.S. crude.
 U.S. RBOB gasoline futures  rose 3 percent and
heating oil  2 percent. Lift for RBOB came ahead of
Wednesday's September contract expiration, the last contract of
the year that covers summer-grade gasoline, Schork said.
 Oil rebounded after being pressured by data showing U.S.
consumer confidence in August fell to the lowest in more than
two years. [ID:nN1E77S0ZM]

 The CME Group  declared force majeure on Tuesday on
the few remaining deliveries of its New York Mercantile

at a New York Harbor delivery facility caused by Irene.

 Traders awaited the restart of Sunoco Inc's  Gerard

 * Coming Up: U.S. consumer confidence data; 1400 GMT
(Updates prices)	
 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Gold regained strength on
Tuesday as bargain hunting resurfaced after prices dropped more
than 2 percent in the previous session, but higher equities and
easing worries about recession in the United States could limit
gains. 
 The physical market saw demand from jewellers as prices
remained below all-time highs, while main consumer India was
expected to step up purchases before the wedding season resumes
in September. 
 Spot gold added $10.71 to $1,797.96 an ounce by 0647
GMT. Trading was volatile last week, when gold tumbled more than
$200 towards $1,700 after striking a record at $1,911.46 as
investors sought refuge from the euro zone debt crisis, weakness
in the U.S. economy and volatile currencies. 
 ""I think you can say the market is trying to stabilise and
is in some kind of consolidation mode. $1,780 is support and
then $1,850 will the resistance level. There's a little bit of
bargain hunting,"" said Ronald Leung, director of Lee Cheong Gold
Dealers in Hong Kong.	
 ""Towards September, jewellers pick up (buying) positions.
Festivals give gold a little bit of support for the time being.
The premiums are increasing due to some demand. There's not much
sales of scrap around.""	
 Hong Kong dealers quoted premiums for gold bars as high as
$1.50 an ounce to spot London prices, from $1.20 last week.
Bullion markets were closed in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia
for the Muslim Eid al-Fitr festival. 
 The festival season in India has started and will peak in
October before tapering off in December. In India, gold
jewellery is an essential wedding gift. 
 Physical dealers in Tokyo saw selling from local investors,
but they also noted buying interest from China, where demand for
jewellery increases during the Mid-Autumn festival in September.

 U.S. gold  rose $8.9 to $1,800.5 an ounce, but
investors closely watched equities markets, which gained on
better-than-expected U.S. consumer spending data and a bank
merger in debt-ridden Greece. 
 U.S. consumer spending rose at its fastest pace in five
months in July, a further sign the economy is not falling back
into recession, although manufacturing activity in Texas almost
stalled this month. 
 Global equities have rallied on hopes the Federal Reserve
might eventually launch a third round of quantitative easing
(QE3) after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke left the door open for
further action in a speech on Friday. 
 The Fed is caught between a struggling recovery and high
unemployment on one side, and political pressures against more
monetary easing on the other. It has already pushed interest
rates close to zero and bought $2.3 trillion in bonds to try to
lower longer-term borrowing costs.	
 ""Given the high inflation environment or rising inflationary
environment, I think, it's likely that they won't announce the
QE3,"" said Natalie Robertson, a commodities strategist at ANZ. 
 ""In terms of fundamentals, (gold) still looks good. The only
risk to the downside is if the CME raises margin requirements
again."" 
 The CME Group raised margins on gold futures by
about 27 percent last week, the biggest hike in more than two
and a half years and the second increase in a month, as gold
prices fell sharply after a record-setting rally.

 Investors await U.S. consumer confidence data for August and
minutes from the Federal Reserve's last committee meeting on Aug
9 for more clues on divisions among board members over further
stimulus measures. 
 In the energy market, Brent crude rose for a sixth straight
session on Tuesday, buoyed by strong data from the United States
that allayed fears the world's top oil consumer was sliding back
into recession and a landmark bank merger deal in Greece.

 By Florence Tan	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose for a sixth
straight session on Tuesday, buoyed by strong data from the
United States that allayed fears the world's top oil consumer
was sliding back into recession and a landmark bank merger deal
in Greece.	
 Oil prices were also supported by a rally in stock markets
with money switching back to riskier assets after U.S. data
showed consumer spending in the world's largest economy rose at
its fastest pace in five months in July. 
 Brent October crude  was up 45 cents to $112.33 a
barrel by 0216 GMT. 
 U.S. October crude  rose 41 cents to $87.68 a barrel,
having reached $87.72, highest intraday price since Aug. 17.	
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude  was at $24.73 a
barrel, well off its record $26.69 on Aug. 19.	
 ""Investors are expecting more monetary easing policies from
the U.S. and that's why money is coming back into equities,""
said Tetsu Emori, a Tokyo-based commodities fund manager at
Astmax Investments. 
 ""As long as equities are improving, oil will be in a better
shape.""	
 In Europe, a merger between two Greek banks gave a much
needed capital boost to a sector battered by the country's
severe debt crisis that has threatened to spread through the
euro zone. 
 The merger ""is good news psychologically, but it does not
have a major impact to the oil market as Greece is not a big oil
consumer,"" Emori said.	
 The dollar index was down slightly on Tuesday as
investors moved away from safe havens to riskier assets. A
weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated oil more attractive to
holders of other currencies. 
 
 Markets were also keeping an eye on U.S. crude inventory,
which likely rose last week on continued inflows from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve and evacuations forced by Hurricane
Irene, a preliminary Reuters poll showed. 
 Analysts expect crude inventories in the week to Aug. 26 to
rise by 1.2 million barrels while gasoline stocks may have
dropped by 1.4 million barrels and distillate stockpiles are
expected to have risen 1.1 million barrels.	
 U.S. refiners and energy companies on Monday began to
restore operations disrupted by Hurricane Irene over the
weekend. One refinery was heard to have suffered damage to a
crude unit due to flooding, while another remained shut.

 ""Oil markets need to see better fundamentals, otherwise it's
difficult (for Nymex) to break $100,"" Emori said, adding that
the contract could stay rangebound between $80 and $100 a
barrel.	
 
 LIBYAN SUPPLIES	
 Italy's Eni SpA signed a deal with Libya's rebel government
on Monday aimed at quickly restarting its oil and gas operations
in the country following concerns it could lose its dominant
position to rivals. 
 A spokesman for Libya's Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO)
told Reuters earlier that it plans to restart production at two
eastern oil fields in mid-September and resume shipping oil from
Tobruk by the end of the same month. 
 ""Prices could also soften with the reinstatement of Libya's
new government after the downfall of Gaddafi's regime and
announcements they would restart production at two eastern oil
fields in mid-September and resume shipping oil by the end of
the month,"" ANZ analysts said in a note.	
 ""But with the focus on risks to global growth, oil prices
are likely to be led by moves in financial markets."" 
 Speculators cut their net long positions in Brent crude oil
but raised slightly their long exposure to gasoil  in the
week to Aug. 23, data published by the IntercontinentalExchange
showed.

 By Carole Vaporean
 NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Gold prices remained lower
into late trade on Monday, as Wall Street stocks added to their
gains on increased investor risk tolerance, but bullion cut its
decline to about 2.20 percent as some buyers bought dips.
 Sought as a haven asset in times of uncertainty, the yellow
metal had some players adding to their holdings as a safety
play, unconvinced that a day's positive news would stick.
 ""Although gains in equities initially caused
flight-to-quality buyers of gold to disappear, there's still a
lot of pent up demand on price breaks. Gold seems to be an
asset people want to own for the foreseeable future,"" said Adam
Klopfenstein, Senior Market Strategist at MF Global in
Chicago.
 Spot gold  cut earlier declines to a 2.20 percent
loss at $1,787.35 an ounce by 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT). Thin
markets helped the precious metal find its balance after recent
volatile swings.
 Last week, prices were highly volatile sliding more than
$200 from a record $1,911.46 an ounce, dropping towards
$1,700.
 ""The sharp sell-off last week was a reminder that markets
never move in a straight line, and it will probably slow down,
but not stop, further progress to the upside,"" said Saxo Bank
senior manager Ole Hansen.
 In New York, COMEX gold for December delivery 
finished $5.70 per ounce lower at $1,791.60, a 0.3 percent
decline. Early selling, however, lead to a low at $1,781.20.
 U.S. stocks rallied over 2 percent in a broad rally as a
merger between two big Greek banks provided a rare bit of
encouraging news out of debt-stricken Europe, while a rebound
in consumer spending calmed fears of a U.S. recession. [.N]
 Insurance company shares were higher after property damage
from Hurricane Irene was less than feared, according to early
estimates. For details, see [ID:nN1E77S0H6]
 Gold's moves were limited in both directions by light
volumes, however, with a bank holiday keeping London trade
light and New York desks thinly staffed following a hurricane
wracked U.S. East Coast.
 Dollar strength also pressured gold prices. The greenback
climbed against the yen and Swiss franc as strong consumer
spending data reduced fears of another U.S. recession. [USD/]
 U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
of economic activity, rebounded strongly in July from June.
Weak pending sales of existing homes, however, showed the
housing sector remains soft. [ID:nN1E77SOBS]
 Some participants noted that mixed U.S. economic readings
and anticipation of a next Federal Reserve move to stimulate
U.S. growth could keep gold rangebound for the near term.
 ""Markets are waiting for our leaders to come to some type
of conclusion that would paint a bullish picture. That's taking
center stage right now,"" MF Global's Klopfenstein said.
 Last Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke opted to
postpone a decision on more stimulus, giving the central bank
more time to assess the state of the U.S. economy.
 The Fed's move to leave the door open for further measures
heightens the focus on upcoming economic data, including the
closely watched August U.S. employment report due on Friday.
 Gold players will also be anticipating the U.S. central
bank's policy-setting meeting in September that was extended to
two days to allow time to review all of the Fed's ""tools.""
 Further quantitative easing would likely further undermine
the dollar, boosting gold's appeal as a safe store of value.
Much of the metal's rally to record highs came on the back of
last year's round of easing.
 Holdings in the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded
fund, SPDR Gold Trust , recorded an outflow of nearly 60
tonnes last week, its largest weekly outflow since the fund was
launched in November 2004. [GOL/ETF]

 NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose a fifth
straight session on Monday as equities rallied on a rise in
consumer spending, strong financials and relief that damage
from Hurricane Irene was less severe than expected.
 U.S. consumer spending rose at its fastest pace in five
months in July, a Commerce Department report said, helping Wall
Street equities gain more than 2 percent. [ID:nN1E77S0BS] [.N]
 ""The spending data helped Wall Street take off, and oil
rose on the hope some of that spending will be on gasoline,""
said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago.
 Global equities advanced ahead of Wall Street's open on
hopes the Federal Reserve might eventually launch a third round
of quantitative easing (QE3) after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke
left the door open for further action in a speech on Friday at
an annual event in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. [MKTS/GLOB]
 U.S. gasoline  futures fell and heating oil 
futures only nudged higher after East Coast refineries did not
experience catastrophic damage like facilities on the Gulf
Coast after Hurricane Katrina.
 ""Storm premium that was injected into the (gasoline)
futures ... appeared to be extracted today as the hurricane
failed to significantly impede refinery activity, pipeline
movement or distribution,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president at
Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note.
 Widespread flooding and power outages were also expected to
dampen fuel demand after Irene.
 Trading volumes were thinner due to a public holiday in the
U.K. and New York-area traders out in the aftermath of the
storm. Brent volume trailed the 30-day average by 62 percent
and U.S. crude by 48 percent.
 Brent October crude  rose 52 cents to settle at
$111.88 a barrel, after reaching $112.73, highest intraday
price since Aug. 4.
 U.S. October crude , up a third straight session,
rose $1.90, or 2.23 percent, to settle at $87.27 a barrel,
having reached $87.62, highest intraday price since Aug. 17.
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude  fell below $25 a
barrel, well off its record $26.69 on Aug. 19.

 * Bernanke's stimulus comments provide support
 * Investors eyeing key U.S. jobs data on Friday

 By Francis Kan	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell below $111 on
Monday as oil refiners and terminals along the U.S. east coast
weathered the worst of a tropical storm, easing fears of fuel
supply disruptions in the world's top oil consumer.	
 Brent crude  was down 45 cents at $110.91 a barrel as
of 0134 GMT, after settling up 75 cents at $111.36 on Friday.
U.S. crude  slipped 7 cents to $85.30. 
 Most oil refineries, terminals and pipelines along the east
coast weathered Tropical Storm Irene, downgraded from hurricane
levels. Seven refineries with a total of 1.23 million barrels
per day capacity - 73 percent of the 1.7 million bpd total in
the U.S. Northeast - were in the storm's projected path.	
 ""Expectations of refiners being affected added a risk
premium, but now that the impact is not as bad as expected, we
are seeing a little pull back in prices,"" said Ben Le Brun,
market analyst with CMC Markets in Sydney.	
 The U.S. Northeast is the second-smallest of the five U.S.
refining regions, with most of its fuel being supplied by
pipeline from the Gulf Coast or tanker ship from Europe.	
 Nuclear plants along the east coast were also unaffected,
with most expected to restart or boost output once the storm
passes. The storm has left at least 15 dead, as many as 3.6
million customers without electricity and thousands of downed
trees. 
 
 Looking ahead, participants will be watching a slew of
economic data out of the U.S. this week for further insight into
the health of the world's biggest economy. The key will be the
key non-farms payroll jobs data due out on Friday.	
 The market received some support after U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke left the door open for further action to
stimulate the economy in comments made on Friday. 
 The central bank's policy panel would meet for two days
next month instead of one to discuss additional monetary
stimulus, Bernanke said, offering some hope to investors. But
the chairman stopped short of announcing any new stimulus
measures. 
 Brent oil  still faces resistance at $111.60 per
barrel, while U.S. crude  is neutral in a range of
$83.01-$86.39 per barrel, according to Reuters market analyst
for commodities and energy technicals Wang Tao. 
 
 LIBYAN OUTPUT 
 The potential for oil supplies to resume from Libya
continued to be a downside risk for prices, analysts said.	
 Libya's battered oil towns are struggling to get back to
work after months of back-and-forth clashes between rebels and
forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi along the Mediterranean coast.

Rebel authorities have called on oil workers to return to
their jobs to get the country's economic lifeline flowing again
but there are few signs of an imminent return to production, and
many workers were too afraid to come back. 
 ""A resumption of output in Libya is a possibility and will
weigh on the market from the supply side,"" said MF Global
analyst Tom Pawlicki in a report.

on Monday as tropical storm Irene, downgraded from a hurricane,
swept through Manhattan, but the gains were limited as most oil
refiners weathered the worst of its fury.	
 
 FUNDAMENTALS	
 * NYMEX crude for October delivery  was up 17 cents at
$85.54 a barrel by 2304 GMT, after settling up 7 cents at $85.37
on Friday on firm Wall Street gains.	
 But the gains were limited after Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke stopped short on Friday of detailing further action
to spur a flagging economy.	
 Last week, front-month crude gained $3.11 or 3.78
percent, snapping a four-week losing streak.	
 * London Brent crude for October delivery  was down
13 cents at $111.23 a barrel, after settling up 74 cents on
Friday.	
 Last week, Brent rose $2.74 or 2.52 percent, extending gains
to a second straight week. 
 * Tropical storm Irene left at least 15 dead, as many as 3.6
million customers without electricity and thousands of downed
trees. It forced the closure of New York's mass transit system
and the cancellation of thousands of flights. 
 Most U.S. oil refiners, terminals and pipelines along the
U.S. East Coast weathered the storm, downgraded from hurricane
levels early on Sunday morning, while a few shut down operations
or ran at reduced rates. 
 U.S. nuclear facilities look to resume operations after
Irene passes. 
 * Libya's battered oil towns are struggling to get back to
work after months of back-and-forth clashes between rebels and

 * Al Qaeda's new second-in-command was killed in Pakistan,
U.S. officials said on Saturday, in a major blow to the group
still reeling from the death of Osama bin Laden. 
 * The IMF's updated forecasts to be released next month do
not foresee a global recession but risks have risen, a senior
IMF official said on Friday. 
""I can say that our base case is certainly not a recession,""
IMF First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky told CNBC
television. ""There's no doubt, however, that risks have risen
given the weak performance in many economic data in the last few
months,"" he said. 
 * U.S. crude oil speculators on two rival exchanges differed
in their view of the market last week, raising net longs on
NYMEX but cutting them on the UK Intercontinental Exchange.

 Money managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures
and options positions on NYMEX in the week to Aug. 23 by 521 to
165,897 contracts, a weekly report from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission showed.	
 
 MARKETS NEWS	
 * U.S. stocks are setting up for another turbulent week, and
while Irene passed with less damage than had been feared in many
areas, the storm's impact on public transit near Wall Street
could depress trading volumes. 
 August is shaping up as the worst month for stocks since
February 2009, partly on the belief that the U.S. economy was

cobble together more aid for the weak economy, though its
chief, Ben Bernanke, stopped short of detailing further action
to boost the U.S recovery.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD84.98 a barrel during afternoon U.S. trade, rising 0.05%, after hitting a daily low of USD83.03.
Earlier Friday, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, speaking from the central bank’s annual meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, said although the bank had the capacity to stimulate U.S. economic growth, further discussion was necessary to weigh the benefits of an additional round of quantitative easing.
Also Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that U.S. gross domestic product rose to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1% in the second quarter. That followed a  1.3% rise the previous three-month period but was below market expectations for a 1.1% gain for the April to June quarter.
Oil markets were closely monitoring Hurricane Irene, the first major storm of the season to threaten the U.S. mainland, which was on a path to make landfall on the eastern seaboard over the weekend. 
Irene, a Category 3 storm, pummeled the Bahamas Thursday and was expected to hit North Carolina before heading north to several key ports in the U.S. Northeast including New York Harbor.
The oil delivery station in New York connects to pipelines and power networks that serve more than 100 million Americans.
Meanwhile, rebel forces in Libya had not yet located long-time leader Moammar Gadhafi and a resumption of the country’s oil production remained in limbo.
The Libyan rebel government had said it was hopeful that oil exports could restart in two  or three months and reach full production after a year.
A falling U.S. dollar helped to support oil futures, as dollar-denominated futures contracts tend to rise when the dollar falls.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell 0.64% to 73.84. 
On the ICE Futures Exchange Brent oil futures for October delivery advanced 0.7% to trade at USD111.23.

 NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Gold rose 2 percent on Friday
after days of liquidation pushed bullion down from record highs
this week, as the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman raised hopes
that the central bank could consider further stimulus measures
to fight high unemployment.
 Gold fell briefly after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke did not
provide details on steps the central bank could take, but it
rose as investors focused on the Fed's pessimistic economic
outlook and its intention to consider what more it could do at
an extended policy meeting in September.
 Analysts said gold's long-term bull run was intact despite
this week's 3 percent pullback. Lingering fears about a
European debt crisis amid new troubles facing Greece
underpinned gold's safe-haven appeal.
 ""Bernanke said the Fed has more tools in the chest and he
will use them as necessary, so that's supportive to the gold
market. That's why we are seeing the bulls have things under
control for the moment,"" said Frank McGhee, head precious
metals trader of Integrated Brokerage Services LLC.
 Spot gold  was up 2.2 percent at $1,808.60 an ounce
by 2:28 PM EDT (1828 GMT).
 But gold was still set for its first weekly loss in eight
weeks after days of profit taking on its surge to record highs
at $1,911.46 on Tuesday. Prices slid more than $200 from that
level by Thursday in volatile trading.
 U.S. gold futures  for December delivery settled up
$34.10 an ounce at $1,797.30. Trading volume was lighter than
the last three sessions, when turnover hit a new record in
volatile trade.
 McGhee said that gold's rally amid lighter Friday afternoon
volume ahead of a major hurricane approaching the U.S. East
Coast suggested bullion is vulnerable for a pullback.
 Bernanke said the Fed will meet for two days in September
instead of the planned one to mull its options to provide
additional monetary stimulus, among other topics.
 ""It is clear the recovery from the crisis has been much
less robust than we had hoped,"" Bernanke said in remarks
prepared for delivery to an annual Fed retreat at Jackson Hole,
Wyoming.

 James Rife, an assistant portfolio manager at Haber Trilix

 NEW YORK, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose in choppy
trade on Friday as Hurricane Irene targeted the U.S. East Coast
and traders weighed comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben Bernanke on the economy.
 Bernanke gave a speech on the ailing U.S. economy that
mentioned no new stimulus measures, initially pressuring Brent
and U.S. oil. Wall Street rebounded and closed higher after
extending losses right after the speech. [.N]
 Increasing concerns that gasoline and diesel fuel supplies
will be severely disrupted by Irene also provided a boost to
oil futures as refiners, terminals and pipelines began to wind
down operations ahead of the storm.
 Brent October crude  gained 74 cents to settle at
$111.36 a barrel, having swung from $109.30 to $111.70. For the
week, Brent gained 2.52 percent.
 U.S. October crude  rose 7 cents to settle at $85.37
a barrel, having recovered from an intraday low of $82.95. It
posted a 3.78 percent gain for the week, after four consecutive
weekly losses.
 Thin crude trading volumes below 30-day averages
contributed to the volatility.
 In his speech at the Fed's annual retreat in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, Bernanke said ""the recovery from the crisis has been
much less robust than we had hoped"".
 But he did not announce any new stimulus measures even
though a U.S. government report revised second-quarter economic
growth lower on Friday. [ID:nN1E77P09C]
 A separate report showed the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan consumer sentiment index fell to 55.7 this month from
63.7 in July.

 ""The bigger picture here is that Bernanke appears to have
enough confidence that the economy is not going to worsen and
so he thinks there is no need for a QE3 at this time,"" said
Andy Lebow, broker at MF Global in New York.
 Lebow pointed to the stock market bouncing back after an
initial move lower on the speech, ""and don't forget the oil
markets are still awaiting the East Coast arrival of Hurricane
Irene"".
 At last year's Jackson Hole meeting, Bernanke hinted at
what eventually became a $600 billion quantitative easing
bond-buying program. Many analysts said the stimulus helped
support the economy but also boosted prices of many
commodities, stoking inflation.
 Continued fighting in OPEC member Libya and international
pressure on Syria also underpinned oil market sentiment.
 A Reuters poll of analysts showed Brent prices were
expected to stay above $100 a barrel next year despite downward
pressure from the expected return of some Libyan production and
fears of a double-dip recession. [O/POLL]

 HURRICANE IRENE
 Irene weakened a little, but was still a Category 2 storm
on the Saffir-Simpson scale, as tropical-storm-force winds
arrived along the coast of the Carolinas, the U.S. National
Hurricane Center said on Friday afternoon.
 The U.S. East Coast region has no major crude oil and
natural gas production like the more hurricane-prone Gulf
Coast. But the region has around a dozen nuclear plants and a
massive oil delivery hub at New York Harbor. Its pipelines and
power networks serve more than 100 million Americans.
 ""PADD I (U.S. Northeast) has plenty (of crude) to ride out
any kind of supply disruptions. We are well-covered with
products for this time of year and consumption will go down.
This is not Katrina,"" Jim Beck, analyst at the U.S. Energy
Information Administration, told Reuters.
 Seven refineries with a total of 1,229,200 barrels per day
of refining capacity are in Irene's projected path.

 By Seng Li Peng	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed
on Friday ahead of a key speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
on the health of the world's largest economy and top oil
consumer.	
 Hurricane Irene barrelled towards U.S. East Coast
refineries, posing a potential threat to supply and supporting
prices. Ongoing conflict in OPEC member Libya and international
pressure on Syria also underpinned sentiment.	
 Brent crude  was up 6 cents at $110.68 a barrel as of
0721 GMT. U.S. crude  was down 15 cents to $85.15, after
hitting an intraday low at $84.75. 
 WTI-Brent spread was above $25.00. 
 ""We saw a little bit more bullish data this week
on the crude side which gave some support,"" said Jeremy Friesen,
a commodity strategist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong,
referring to the EIA data that showed a drop in U.S. crude
stockpiles. 
 ""But heading into today, the markets are going to focus a
lot on the resolutions (from Bernanke's talk).""	
 Brent oil faces a resistance at $111.60 a barrel and signals
will be temporarily neutral before this resistance is cleared,
while U.S. oil is biased to drop to $83.01, according to Reuters
market analyst for commodities and energy technicals Wang Tao.

 
 The oil market was also closely watching the powerful
Hurricane Irene, a major Category 3 storm that lashed the
low-lying Bahamas on Thursday and was expected to hit North
Carolina on Saturday before heading up the coast to New York and
beyond. 
 MF Global said in its daily report that it expects
refineries standing in the path of the hurricane to withstand
the winds from the storm and not shut down for now. 
 While the East Coast region has no major offshore oil and
gas production like the hurricane-prone Gulf Coast, the stakes
are still daunting. 
 The region has around a dozen nuclear plants, a massive oil
delivery hub at New York Harbor, and its pipelines and power
networks serve more than 100 million Americans. 
 ""The biggest issue may be flooding if the storm surge brings
water up into New York Harbor. The harbor imports 400 kb/d in
gasoline,"" the MF Global report said.	
 
 BERNANKE SPEECH IN FOCUS	
 All eyes are on Bernanke's speech in Jackson Hole scheduled
for 1400 GMT, with markets eager to hear what the Fed's plan is
to help a struggling U.S. economy, although the growing
consensus is that the Fed's options to stimulate the economy are
limited. 
 At last year's meeting, Bernanke hinted at what eventually
became a $600 billion quantitative easing bond-buying
programme, known as QE2.	
 Economic worries on the other side of the Atlantic also
continued to keep investors on edge.	
 European consumers are cutting spending and feeling gloomier
about the future as fears of a double-dip recession rise and
stock markets wobble, while an industry survey showed British
retail sales in August fell at their fastest pace in over a
year. 
 German consumer sentiment fell slightly going into
September, hitting a 10-month low as the euro zone debt crisis
and fears of another recession in Europe and the United States
weighed on consumer expectations, a survey
showed. 
 
 LIBYA, SYRIA SUPPLIES	
 In Libya, rebels stormed Tripoli's Abu Salim district, one
of the main holdouts of forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi after a
NATO airstrike on a building in the area, a Reuters
correspondent said. 
 The Libyan rebel government hopes to restart oil exports
within two to three months and reach full volumes in about a
year, Ali Tarhouni, the official in charge of financial and oil
matters told Reuters from Libya's oil ministry in Tripoli.

 On Syrian supplies, some traders say it has become more
difficult to sell the crude this month in the European spot
market due to U.S. sanctions on Syria and expectations EU
sanctions may follow. 
 But oil major Royal Dutch Shell is planning to continue
exporting Syrian oil in September despite fresh U.S. sanctions
and a looming EU embargo.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Brent crude was steady on
Friday, while U.S. futures edged down as investors worried the
Federal Reserve chief may not offer measures strong enough to
help the U.S. economy, the world's top oil consumer.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Spot gold was steady on
Friday, but was likely to register its first weekly drop after
seven straight weeks of gains as investors awaited a speech by
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke later in the day.	
 All eyes are on Bernanke's speech in Jackson Hole scheduled
for 1400 GMT, with markets eager to hear what the Fed's plan is
to help a struggling U.S. economy, although the growing
consensus is that the Fed's options to stimulate the economy are
limited. 
 Spot gold gained 0.3 percent to $1,774.20 by 0703 GMT
after a 1.1 percent rise on Thursday. It was on course for a
4.3-percent decline on the week, its sharpest weekly fall since
week ended May 8.	
 U.S. gold  gained 0.8 percent to $1,776.70.	
 ""There is still good physical demand, and good buying from
the Shanghai markets,"" said Peter Fung, head of dealing at Wing
Fung Precious Metals in Hong Kong.	
 The dip in the previous session to a 2-1/2-week low
of$1,702.44 triggered buying interest, but the upside is capped
at $1,800 as investors remained cautious ahead of the Bernanke
speech, Fung added.	
 The most-active Shanghai gold futures contract
closed at 367.80 yuan per gram, or $1,787.28, at a premium of
about $13 over spot prices.	
 Technical analysis showed that gold is likely to consolidate
between $1,702 and $1,774 for the next few days before resuming
the rally, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 
 Gold lost more than $200 over the past three sessions after
it hit a record high above $1,911 on Tuesday.	
 ""We believe this is a healthy correction for the market, and
barring further near term weakness, the longer-term uptrend
remains intact given the macro backdrop,"" said Barclays Capital
in a research note.	
 A number of banks have recently raised their gold price
forecast. 
 Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust remained unchanged at
1,232.314 tonnes, while holdings in the iShares Silver Trust
dropped more than 1 percent to 9,705.90 tonnes.	
 Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold's Indonesian workers
plan to stage another strike at its huge Grasberg mine in coming
days after talks with the management stalled. 
 Production disruption could potentially add to the
supportive factors in the gold market, including low interest
rates, fear of another recession and strong physical demand.	
 Spot silver lost 1.3 percent to $40.45 an ounce, but
was still up from a 1-1/2 week low of $38.73 hit in the previous
session. It was headed for a 6 percent weekly drop, its worst
week since early May.	
 Spot platinum edged up 0.3 percent to $1,816.74 an
ounce. 
 Japanese investors have been steadily boosting their
platinum investments over the last month, tempted by the
precious metal's stability relative to gold as they look to
diversify their commodity holdings with global markets in
turmoil.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD85.21 a barrel during early Asian trade, rising 0.32%, after hitting a daily low of USD84.88.
Hurricane Irene, the first major storm of the season to threaten the U.S. mainland, was expected to make landfall on the eastern seaboard over the weekend. 
The storm is on a path similar to Hurricane Gloria in 1985, which killed 11 people and caused USD900 million in damage. But unlike a storm in the Gulf of Mexico, home to 29% of U.S. oil production, an Atlantic seaboard hurricane does not threaten major U.S. crude and natural gas production.
Meanwhile, earlier in the week rebel forces in Libya took control of the capitol Tripoli, paving the way for the ouster of long-time leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi and the resumption of a flow of Libyan oil into global markets.
Gadhafi remained on the run but the Libyan rebel government hopes to restart oil exports within two weeks and reach full volumes in about a year, Ali Tarhouni, the official in charge of financial and oil matters told Reuters news. 
Earlier Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that the number of Americans filing for unemployment assistance rose by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 417,000, in the week ending August 19, dimming prospects for any short-term rise in U.S. energy demand.
Market expectations were for jobless claims to fall to 405,000 from 412,000 the previous week.
A falling U.S. dollar helped to support oil futures, as dollar-denominated futures contracts tend to rise when the dollar falls.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, fell 0.04% to 74.29. 
On the ICE Futures Exchange Brent oil futures for October delivery lost 0.07% to trade at USD110.39. "
1406,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 25, 2011 08:22PM ET</span>",Gold futures decline in early Asian trade,"Investing.com – Gold futures extended losses in Asian trade Friday, as higher trading fees  set in for dealers ahead of a much-anticipated speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,764.75 a troy ounce during early Asian trade, down USD4.80 or 0.27%. 
Late Wednesday, the CME Group Inc. announced it would be raising the amount of money needed to trade a gold contract for the second time this month, hiking the fee by 27%.
The CME, operator of the Comex, increased the so-called initial margin to USD9,450 per contract from USD7,425, in an effort to thin the market of speculative investors who must pay a higher fee to trade a futures contract.
Gold futures sank as much as 5% in the two days following the August 11 CME margin hike.
Investors meanwhile, await the outcome of a meeting of U.S. Federal Reserve officials in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for possible signs that the Fed may take additional measures to stimulate the faltering U.S. economy.
“As expectations of what Fed Chairman Bernanke can say at Jackson Hole tomorrow are scaled back, gold should be one of the assets that reacts most,"" UBS said in a report earlier Thursday.
""But there is also a positive aspect to this, in that gold appears to have already discounted disappointment at Jackson Hole.""
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver for September delivery fell 0.51% to trade at USD40.85 a troy ounce, while copper for September delivery eased 0.05% to trade at USD4.088 a pound.

 NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Thursday after
two days of sharp declines, as tumbling European and U.S.
equity markets on talk that Germany might enact a short-selling
ban prompted investors to buy bullion as a safe haven.
 Early in the session, bullion dropped as much as 3 percent
or more than $200 from Tuesday's record highs, as funds
liquidated positions due to CME Group's second margin hike this
month and technical weakness.
 Many market watchers remained long-term bulls on gold
although they said the precious metal could correct further
after rising as much as $400 since July on speculation the Fed
this week would announce new plans to stimulate a sluggish U.S.
economy.
 ""With that big sell-off in Germany, it spooked people about
the financial problems lurking in Europe and the European
banks. You will probably see gold pull back a little more, but
the (upward) trend would still be intact,"" said Evan Smith,
co-manager of Global Resources Fund at U.S. Global Investors,
which manages $2.5 billion in assets.
 Spot gold  was up 0.5 percent at $1,759.99 an ounce
by 2:32 PM EDT (1832 GMT) in choppy trade, about $60 above a
session low of $1,702.44, its lowest in nearly two weeks.
 U.S. December gold futures  settled up $5.90 an ounce
at $1,763.20. Trading volume was extremely heavy for a third
straight day, on pace to be one of the highest this year.
 Spot silver  rose 2.9 percent to $40.78 an ounce, now
nearly $2 off its session lows.
 Germany's DAX <.GDAXI> dropped as much as 4 percent on
rumors Germany could enact a short-selling ban following the
example of other European nations. A German Finance Ministry
spokesman told Reuters they were not planning a general
short-selling ban. [ID:nN1E77O0ZZ]
 Gold fell more than 1 percent early, after the CME Group
raised margins on gold futures by about 27 percent, the biggest
hike in more than 2-1/2 years and the second increase in a
month. [ID:nL4E7JO3UG]

 Investors have cashed in on gold's latest rally after the
yellow metal surged nearly 20 percent in early August to

gold futures also posted their sharpest price decline since
1980.

 BERNANKE EYED
 Investors had their eyes on Jackson Hole. Wyoming, where
Bernanke was due to give a speech on Friday. Some have
speculated the Fed chief will hint at a third round of
government debt purchases, or quantitative easing, to bolster a
sluggish economy. [ID:nFEDAHEAD]

largely have our gold exposure intact,"" said U.S. Global's

 By Gene Ramos
 NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Thursday due to
concerns about Hurricane Irene's impact on U.S. East Coast fuel
supplies and fighting in Libya.
 Crude supported by strong gains in gasoline and heating oil
futures as the market kept a close watch on powerful Hurricane
Irene, which threatened East Coast refineries.
 The storm was forecast hitting the U.S. eastern seaboard by
the weekend, and the U.S. Coast Guard was closely monitoring
its track but has yet to carry out any traffic restrictions on
the New York Harbor, the delivery hub for U.S.-traded gasoline
futures. [ID:nN1E77O17D]
 ""Products are leading the way as the East Coast refining
center is in the bullseye of Hurricane Irene."" said John
Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.
 ""We have not experienced a storm of this magnitude in quite
some time. The refining assets should come through in fine
shape, but some disruptions look likely now."" Kilduff added.
 In London, ICE Brent crude for October delivery 
settled 47 cents higher at $110.62 a barrel, off its session
and week's high of $111.45.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, October crude 
settled at $85.30, gaining 14 cents, climbing from a session
low of $83.01.
 U.S. gasoline futures for September delivery 
settled at $2.9679 a gallon, rising 8.95 cents, or 3.11
percent. [ID:nN1E77O1BQ]
 Volumes were moderate. with U.S. crude trading at
570,000 contracts, 17 percent below their 30-day average and
Brent crude at 450,000 contracts, 5 percent below their 30-day
average by 3:05 p.m. EDT.
 Unlike a storm in the Gulf of Mexico, an East Coast storm
does not threaten significant U.S. crude oil and natural gas
production.
 The East Coast is the second smallest of the five U.S.
refining regions, with just six refineries. Most of its fuel is
supplied by pipeline from the Gulf Coast or tanker ship from
Europe, which could be interrupted by the Irene.

 LIBYA
 In Libya, rebels stormed Tripoli's Abu Salim district, one
of the main holdouts of forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi after a
NATO airstrike on a building in the area, a Reuters
correspondent said. Markets are concerned about the speed at
which the OPEC nation's oil exports can be returned to markets.
[ID:nLDE77O0SH]
 ""We have not seen the end of fighting in Libya, so you see
Brent crude stronger as return of Libyan oil to the market may
not be as soon as earlier expected,"" said Chris Dillman,
analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
 The Libyan rebel government hopes to restart oil exports
within two weeks and reach full volumes in about a year, Ali
Tarhouni, the official in charge of financial and oil matters
told Reuters from Libya's oil ministry in Tripoli.
[ID:nL5E7JP2ZF]
 EYES ON BERNANKE
 Hopes of a further economic stimulus when U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke delivers a speech before central
bankers on Friday had helped push oil futures higher earlier.
 But some analysts doubted that Bernanke, who will speak at
an annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, may actually put
forth signs for a new package of quantitative easing, or QE3.
 ""Traders are biding their time, although there is some
buying interest ahead of the speech even though there is very
little in the way of a stimulus to be expected,"" said Matt
Smith, analyst at Summit Energy in Louisville, Kentucky.
 U.S. government data showed first-time jobless benefit
claims rose last week but the increase was due to a strike at a
major communications company, not a sign of job cuts, and oil
prices quickly recovered after a brief decline.
 Oil futures later fell to session lows as U.S. equities
slid, before heading higher, on very choppy trading.
 Wall Street opened higher after Bank of American 
said that billionaire Warren Buffett's investment vehicle,
Berkshire Hathaway  would take a $5 billion stake in
the bank, pulling up banking shares. [.N]

 LONDON, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil rose to around
$111 a barrel on Thursday, supported by a drop in U.S.
inventories and investor hopes that the Federal Reserve may
announce stimulus measures for the U.S. economy on Friday.	
 Fed chief Ben Bernanke is due to address central bankers at
an annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday. His
speech last year laid the groundwork for the Fed's $600 billion
bond-buying program to revive the U.S. economy. 
 At 0902 GMT, Brent crude  was up 75 cents at $110.90
a barrel, while U.S. crude  rose 67 cents to $85.83 a
barrel. Brent has gained 17 percent this year.	
 Oil also gained continued support from Wednesday's report
from the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration
showing crude stockpiles fell 2.21 million barrels. Analysts
expected an 800,000-barrel increase. 
 ""The market had expected crude stocks to build but the
report showed a drop in stocks,"" said Singapore-based Victor
Shum of energy consulting firm Purvin & Gertz. 
 Optimism ahead of the Jackson Hole speech also helped boost
equities. Gold prices tumbled and the dollar was down almost 0.2
percent against a basket of currencies. 
 In the Bahamas, energy companies planned to shut more than
28 million barrels of oil storage capacity ahead of Hurricane
Irene, while U.S. refineries were preparing for the storm.



 NO QE3?	
 Not all were confident that Bernanke will use his speech to
talk about further stimulus.	
 ""During last year's speech, Bernanke prepared the markets
for 'QE2,' but we do not think he will unveil anything of the
kind this time around,"" said Edward Meir, analyst at MF Global,
in a report.	
 ""The Fed's ability to manoeuvre at this stage is rather
limited and Bernanke knows it, especially after the previous
ease yielded mixed results.""	
 As well as the economic outlook, oil investors remain
focused on supply-side developments in North Africa and the
Middle East.	
 European Union governments are likely to adopt an embargo
against imports of Syrian oil by the end of next week as they
move to ratchet up pressure on President Bashar al-Assad, EU
diplomats said on Wednesday. 
 With Libyan rebels hailing the end of Muammar Gaddafi's
rule, the oil industry is weighing the implications of a restart
of Libyan supplies, which have slowed to a trickle during the
conflict.	
 Libya pumped 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) before the
war, almost 2 percent of world supply. Syria is a much smaller
producer with exports of a mere 150,000 bpd.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Gold fell more than 1 percent
on Thursday, extending the previous session's losses, after the
CME Group raised trading margins by the most in over two
and a half years to curb volatility in bullion that had surged
to dizzying heights.	
 Spot gold dropped by more than 4 percent on Wednesday, its
biggest drop since December 2008, as investors liquidated
positions after the precious metal surged nearly 35 percent this
year to a record high above $1,911 on Tuesday. 
 CME increased margin requirements on its gold futures
contract by 27 percent, the second hike in a month, following
similar moves by the Shanghai Gold Exchange and Hong Kong
Mercantile Exchange earlier this month. 
 Data suggesting the U.S. economy was facing a slowdown
instead of a recession also took the shine off safer assets like
gold.	
 ""A lot of hot money has entered the complex and the rally
was done too much in too short a time,"" said David Thurtell, an
analyst at Citigroup. 
 ""Last 24 hours there was definitely profit-taking. With the
margin hike, if speculators don't have the money to pull out as
extra margin they'll just cut their positions. That contributed
to the liquidation.""	
 Spot gold slipped as much as 1.3 percent to $1,728.59
an ounce, before recovering some ground to trade at $1,739.80 by
0617 GMT. On Wednesday, bullion dropped 4.3 percent, its biggest
daily drop since Dec. 1, 2008.	
 U.S. gold  fell 0.8 percent to $1,742.90, after
dropping 5.6 percent on Wednesday, the steepest daily drop since
March 2008. 
 Helping fuel Wednesday's sell-off was data showing new
orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose more than
expected in July, offering hopes that the ailing economy could
dodge another recession and boosting risk appetite across
markets. 
 Before this week's drop, bullion had surged more than $400
since July and scored consecutive record highs as a struggling
U.S. economy and crippling debt crisis in Europe boosted gold's
safe-haven appeal.	
 Spot gold has lost more than 8 percent from its all-time
high. The price surged nearly 10 percent in the six-day climb
before the decline.	
 
 
 NOT SAFE ANYMORE?	
 ""People always refer to gold as safe haven. When we
introduce volatility to the equation, it doesn't seem so safe
anymore,"" said a Singapore-based trader, but added that gold's
luster looks intact.	
 ""Many leveraged longs are going to leave it alone for a
while. And when prices come down like this, it might be a buying
opportunity for real money account like central banks.""	
 Technical charts suggest that a medium-term uptrend for gold
is intact even after the sharp drop over the past two sessions,
with a rebound likely to push it to $1,784, said Reuters market
analyst Wang Tao. 
 Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust dropped 2.2 percent on
the day to 1,232.314 tonnes by Aug. 24, its lowest in more than
a month and down 6 percent from a one-year high of 1,309.922
tonnes hit on Aug. 8.	
 ANZ has raised its forecast for gold prices, expecting
prices to peak at $2,200 in the second quarter of 2012, from a
previous forecast of $1,800.	
 ""The substantial revision has been propped up by an unusual
lack of support for the U.S. dollar under the current uncertain
financial market conditions - effectively channelling stronger
than normal safe-haven flows to gold,"" said ANZ analysts in a
research note.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose above $110.50
a barrel on Thursday, supported by reduced U.S. crude stocks and
positive manufacturing data but countered by economic growth
uncertainties. 
 A speech on Friday by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
looks set to be the main event of the week for all markets, as
investors wait to see if he will talk about more stimulus for
the faltering U.S. economy. 
 U.S. crude stockpiles fell 2.21 million barrels to 351.77
million barrels in the week to Aug. 19, data from the Energy
Information Administration showed, against a forecast for an
800,000 barrel build. 
 At 0643 GMT, Brent crude  was up 58 cents at $110.73
a barrel, while U.S. crude  rose 32 cents to $85.48 a
barrel. 
 The WTI-Brent crude spread  was slightly above
$25.00 
 ""The market had expected crude stocks to build but the
report showed a drop in stocks,"" said Singapore-based Victor
Shum of energy consulting firm Purvin & Gertz. 
 ""That surprised the market, even though, directionally the
results from the DOE for crude were consistent with the earlier
API report."" 
 Positive U.S. economic data in the form of a 4 percent jump
in durable goods orders in July bolstered sentiment. The rise
was double economists' expectations. 
 Durable goods are items from toasters to aircraft meant to
last three years or more. 
 ""We like the economic news and EIA weekly data received
recently and think that they suggest that the second half
economic rebound may still be a possibility,"" said MF Global in
its daily report. 
 Reuters' market analyst for commodities and energy
technicals Wang Tao said that U.S. oil is technically neutral in
a range of $84.55-$86.39 per barrel. 
 
 
 UNCERTAINTIES PERSIST	
 Investors' confidence that Bernanke will use his Jackson
Hole, Wyoming speech to talk about further stimulus seemed to be
wavering. 
 ""There was some earlier euphoria about Bernanke announcing
some quantitative easing measures, but in my opinion that is
more wishful thinking,"" said Shum.	
 ""Bernanke will likely say something supportive, but likely
there won't be much clarity on it.""	
 The oil market also continues to be buffeted by developments
in North Africa and the Middle East.	
 European Union governments are likely to adopt an embargo
against imports of Syrian oil by the end of next week, as they
move to ratchet up pressure on President Bashar al-Assad, EU
diplomats said on Wednesday. 
 The EU already has sanctions against dozens of Syrian
officials and several state entities but it has taken
incremental steps in broadening its measures, with some states
concerned about risking commercial interests in Syria. 
 The situation in Libya remains tense, with Muammar Gaddafi
nowhere to be found. 
 What will be critical for oil markets is how quickly the
country's production can return to pre-conflict levels of around
1.6 million barrels per day. 
 Rebel authorities on Wednesday called on oil workers to
return to the Ras Lanuf and Brega oil terminals in the east of
the country, which they gained control of earlier this week.

a barrel, while U.S. crude  was down 6 cents to $85.10 a
barrel. 
 The WTI-Brent crude spread  were slightly above

 ""The market had expected crude stocks to build but the
report showed a drop in stocks,"" said Singapore-based Victor
Shum of energy consulting firm Purvin & Gertz. 
 ""That surprised the market, even though, directionally the
results from the DOE for crude were consistent with the earlier
API report."" 
 Positive U.S. economic data in the form of a 4 percent jump
in durable goods orders in July bolstered sentiment. The rise
was double economists' expectations. 
 Durable goods are for items from toasters to aircraft meant
to last three years or more. 
 Reuters' market analyst for commodities and energy
technicals Wang Tao said that U.S. oil is technically neutral in
a range of $84.55-$86.39 per barrel. 
 
 
 UNCERTAINTIES PERSIST	
 Investors' confidence that Bernanke will use his Jackson
Hole, Wyoming speech to talk about further stimulus seemed to be
wavering. 
 ""There was some earlier euphoria about Bernanke announcing
some quantitative easing measures, but in my opinion that is
more wishful thinking,"" said Shum.	
 ""Bernanke will likely say something supportive, but likely
there won't be much clarity on it.""	
 The oil market also continues to be buffeted by developments
in North Africa and the Middle East.	
 European Union governments are likely to adopt an embargo
against imports of Syrian oil by the end of next week, as they
move to ratchet up pressure on President Bashar al-Assad, EU
diplomats said on Wednesday. 
 The EU already has sanctions against dozens of Syrian
officials and several state entities but it has taken
incremental steps in broadening its measures, with some states
concerned about risking commercial interests in Syria. 
 The situation in Libya remains tense, with Muammar Gaddafi
nowhere to be found. 
 What will be critical for oil markets is how quickly the
country's production can return to pre-conflict levels of around
1.6 million barrels per day. 
 Rebel authorities on Wednesday called on oil workers to
return to the Ras Lanuf and Brega oil terminals in the east of
the country, which they gained control of earlier this week.

1420,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 24, 2011 09:21PM ET</span>",Crude oil gains in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - Crude oil futures moved higher in Asian trade on Thursday, after dipping earlier in the session as U.S. government figures showed a unexpected drop in crude stockpiles last week.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD85.45 a barrel during early Asian trade, rising 0.33%, after hitting a daily low of USD85.04.
Early Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that crude oil stockpiles had declined by 2.2 million barrels for the week ending August 19, far below the forecast of a 0.8 million barrel decline.
The EIA added that gasoline supplies increased 1.4 million barrels during the same period.
Hopes were lifted earlier in the week for a resumption of Libyan oil production after rebel forces stormed the capitol Tripoli, paving the way for the ouster of long-time leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi. 
European refiners, in particular, have been hard-hit by the absence of Libyan oil since the onset of hostilities in February and have sought replacement supplies from other West and North African producers.
In Nigeria, Royal Dutch Shell PLC. declared “force majeure,” a legal term meaning the company would be unable to make scheduled deliveries, after an apparent sabotage attempt on one of the company’s pipelines.
The announcement was expected to reduce the company’s Nigerian exports by some 200,000 barrels per day.
A rising U.S. dollar helped to temper oil future gains, as dollar-denominated futures contracts tend to fall when the dollar rises.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose 0.04% to 74.12. 
On the ICE Futures Exchange Brent oil futures for October delivery rose 0.06% to trade at USD100.36. 
The U.S. government was scheduled to release weekly unemployment figures later Thursday, an indication of future demand from the world’s largest energy consumer.

1421,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 24, 2011 08:28PM ET</span>",Gold futures continue slide in Asian trade,"Investing.com – Gold futures extended losses in Asian trade Thursday, adding to sharp falls the previous session as rising U.S. equities and positive economic data sparked dealer enthusiasm in riskier assets. 
 
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,746.55 a troy ounce during early Asian trade, down USD16.20 or 0.91%. 
                  
Before the start of Wednesday’s session, the U.S. Census Bureau released its July figures for core durable goods orders, which leapt unexpectedly by 4% in the month.  Market forecasts were for a 0.4% retreat in goods orders in July.
 
On Tuesday, gold had plunged 3.65%, its biggest one-day drop since February of 2010, following strong gains by U.S. stocks and the prospects for additional quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve.
 
Pasting together a last minute surge, Wall Street shares posted their straight winning day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 1.3%, the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.9%, and the S&P 500 rose 1.3%.
 
Contributing to falling gold prices, the CME Group Inc. announced late Wednesday it would be raising the amount of money needed to trade a gold contract for the second time this month, hiking the fee by 27%.
 
The CME, operator of the Comex, increased the so-called initial margin to USD7,425 per contract from USD6,075. earlier this month. The higher rates were instituted to thin the market of speculative investors who must pay a higher fee to trade a futures contract.
 
The new CME price for trading gold contracts now stands at USD9,450 per 100-ounce contract.
 
Gold futures sank as much as 5% in the two days following the August 11 CME margin hike.
 
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver for September delivery fell 0.16% to trade at USD39.68 a troy ounce, while copper for September delivery eased 0.02% to trade at USD4.012 a pound.

 By David Sheppard
 NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Brent oil prices edged higher
in choppy trading on Wednesday, but U.S. prices slipped as
traders weighed expectations for the eventual return of Libyan
oil exports against a surprise dip in crude inventories in the
United States.
 The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said crude
stocks in the world's largest oil consumer fell by 2.2 million
barrels last week, surprising forecasters who had expected a
800,000 barrel rise. Both gasoline and distillate stocks rose,
however, which limited gains in crude prices. [EIA/S]
 Brent crude  settled 84 cents higher at $110.15 a
barrel, after hitting a high of $111.00. U.S. crude 
closed at $85.16, down 28 cents on the day, having earlier hit
a high of $86.59.
 ""The EIA data was supportive but not that bullish, so you
just saw some profit taking late for (U.S.) crude,"" said Dan
Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research, adding that developments in
Libya were making it harder to sustain rallies.
 Libyan rebel authorities in their eastern stronghold of
Benghazi have called on oil workers to return immediately to
the Ras Lanuf and Brega oil terminals after rebels fighters
wrenched control of them from Muammar Gaddafi forces earlier
this week.
 Prices drew support a force majeure declared on Tuesday by
Royal Dutch Shell  on some supplies of Nigerian sweet
crude that some European refiners have been using to replace
the 1.6 million barrels per day of Libyan output lost since
February.
 Financial markets are waiting for a speech from U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday, to see if the
central bank chief signals further monetary easing to stimulate
a sluggish U.S. economy.
 ""The market's not taking off, and I think it's going to be
real hard for us to put on any big positions anywhere when we
have this big looming meeting"" of central bankers in Jackson
Hole, Wyoming, said Richard Ilczyszyn, senior market strategist
at MF Global in Chicago.
 ""If we do get something perceived as positive, and equities
fly up, you could see U.S. crude run back up to the $90 price
band.""
 Volumes were relatively low, with the number of U.S. crude
contracts changing hands about a third lower than the average
over the past 30 days. Brent volumes were in line with the
30-day average.

 GOLD CORRECTS
 Traders said financial markets also were watching a sharp
correction in gold prices. Views were split as to whether this
would weigh on commodities as an asset class or indicated that
investors might be preparing to move into riskier assets.
 Gold  hit a record $1,911.46 an ounce on Tuesday but
has since fallen by around $150 or 8 percent, one of the
largest corrections on record.
 U.S. data showed stronger-than-expected U.S. durable goods
orders, and the U.S. Congressional Budget Office predicted a
decline in the deficit in coming years as a result of the
government's recent debt-reduction agreement.
 Equity markets edged up 1.3 percent while the U.S. dollar
index <.DXY> rose against a basket of currencies.
 A stronger dollar tends to weigh on oil and other
commodities priced in the greenback while oil traders have been
looking to equity markets for guidance on the strength of the
economic recovery.
 The S&P 500 index is down by about 13 percent since the end
of July, while Brent crude oil has slipped by about 6 percent
over the same period.
 LIBYA
 In Libya, rebels moved to consolidate their position in the
capital, Tripoli, and offered a $1.3 million bounty for Muammar
Gaddafi.
 Libya's rebel government will honour all energy contracts
granted legally under Gaddafi's 42-year rule, rebel
reconstruction leader Ahmed Jehani said on Monday, adding they
aimed to restore oil output to pre-war levels within a year.
 A Reuters survey of oil industry analysts and officials
last month suggested Libyan oil production could bounce back to
1 million bpd within months of the end of Gaddafi's rule.

 By Frank Tang and Jan Harvey
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Gold dropped 3 percent
on Wednesday as news of a sharp rise in U.S. durable goods
orders prompted more profit-taking on bullion's to record highs
ahead of a Federal Reserve gathering this week.
 Gold appeared headed for for its biggest two-day decline in
almost three years. It had rallied nearly 9 percent in six
sessions before Tuesday's fall on speculation the Federal
Reserve might be planning another round of stimulus for the
sluggish U.S. economy.
 Analysts said it's time for gold investors to take money
off the table after a safe-haven rally extended too far, too
fast in recent weeks. Bullion was up by as much as $400 since
July.
 ""The correction really should be taking place now, because
of all the (bets) on the table,"" said Ashok Shah, chief
investment officer at London & Capital.
 ""But the journey is not complete until Jackson Hole is
done,"" Shah said, referring to an annual central bank
conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming starting on Thursday
 Spot gold  was down 2.5 percent at $1,783.29 an ounce
by 11:03 a.m. EDT (1503 GMT), off its session low of $1,762.90.
On Tuesday, it dropped about 4 percent after an early rise to a
record $1,911.46.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  was down
$74.60 at $1,786.60 an ounce.
 Silver  dropped 2.8 percent to $40.64 an ounce.
 While analysts predicted gold would remain in a structural
uptrend, they said a sharp correction from this month's rally
was possible, especially if the central bank meeting at Jackson
Hole does not result in a Fed announcement of a third round of
government bond buying, or quantitative easing, also known as
QE3.
 ""Hopes that QE3 will continue to prop up commodity prices
are at best premature. Gold is perhaps most vulnerable to
disappointment,"" Capital Economics strategists said in a note.

 By Jessica Donati	
 LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up to $110 a
barrel on Wednesday with support from disruptions to supply
tempered by caution over demand and a key speech due from U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday.	
 Reduced crude U.S. stockpiles seen in data this week, a
still uncertain outlook for Libyan exports and a force majeure
declared on Tuesday by Royal Dutch Shell  on Bonny Light
sweet crude provided support for prices.	
 ""There is not a lot of impetus in either direction, with the
market caught between problems with supply on one side - with
Libyan exports offline and probably offline for some time - and
weak economic growth and slowing demand,"" said Tobias Merath,
Head of Private Banking Commodity Research at Credit Suisse.	
 Oil trading was likely to remain cautious at least until
Bernanke's speech, which could help clarify the outlook for the
U.S. economy and provide momentum, Merath added. 
 Bernanke is expected to express his disappointment over U.S.
growth and offer remedial action to kick-start the world's
largest economy and key oil consumer when he speaks to a central
bank conference on Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.	
 Brent crude  was up 97 cents at $110.28 a barrel at
1442 GMT. U.S. October crude  was up 91 cents at $86.35 a
barrel.	
 
 EIA SURPRISE	
 Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed crude
stocks fell a surprise 2.21 million barrels, against analyst
forecasts for an 800,000-barrel rise. The report was in line
with Tuesday's API data showing a 3.3 million barrel draw in the
week to Aug. 19. 
 ""The crude draw is a big number,"" said Carl Larry, director
of energy derivatives and research at brokerage Blue Ocean in
New York. ""We continue to draw and those numbers might only even
out as we head into turnarounds. Demand is still pretty solid
from an overall perspective."" 
 The outlook for Libya is still uncertain, where worries
remain about internal divisions within the opposition in the
post-Gaddafi era, potentially sparking a new period of
instability and further hampering oil exports. 
 On Monday Libya's former top oil official Shokri Ghanem said
it would take as long as 18 months for the country's oil flow to
reach the pre-war level of around 1.6 million barrels per day
(bpd), nearly 2 percent of global supply. 
 Supply from Africa took another hit on Tuesday with trade
sources reporting the entire Bonny Light programme - around
190,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September and 216,000 bpd in
October - had been withdrawn after a hacksaw attack on Tuesday.

 ""The force majeure in Nigeria is important, but not as
important as it was last time as demand has fallen since and
hence there should be room for the force majeure in the
supply/demand balance,"" said Thorbjørn Bak Jensen, an oil market
analyst at A/S Global Risk Management Ltd.	
 On the demand side, investors' hopes are pinned on the
Federal Reserve to rescue the U.S. and euro zone economies from
sliding back into recession. 
 German business sentiment added to gloom, dropping more than
expected in August in a further sign European growth is slowing.

 ""Currently it is wait and see for Friday's Jackson Hole
speech by Bernanke and the possible QE3 ahead,"" Jensen said.

 NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Gold futures fell more than
$100 on Wednesday, one of the steepest falls ever, as strong
U.S. economic data and expectations of more Federal Reserve
stimulus accelerated profit taking from the safe-haven record
high of a day ago.
 Selling spiraled out of control as money managers competed
to liquidate positions in COMEX futures, which experienced
their biggest single-day dollar loss since 1980. Volume looked
like a record.
 The price of gold bullion is now more than $150 below
Tuesday's all time high of $1,911.46 an ounce, downed by
intense speculation about whether the Fed will announce new
plans to ease monetary policy at a meeting late this week.
 Analysts said it was time for gold investors to take money
off the table after the rally extended too far, too fast in
recent weeks. Bullion rose as much as $400 since July.
 ""You have a commodity that retail investors, hedge funds
and everybody were long, and the technical indicators showed it
was overbought. It was just a matter of time before the market
starts cracking,"" said Mihir Dange, COMEX gold options floor
trader for Arbitrage LLC.
 Spot gold  was down 4.1 percent to $1,754.59 an ounce
by 3:37 p.m. EDT (1937 GMT), off its session low of $1,749.39.
 Before gold began recoiing Tuesday from above $1,900, it
had risen nearly 9 percent over six sessions.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled down
$104 at $1,757.30 an ounce. Reuters data showed that is the
biggest price drop of the continuous, front-month contract
since Jan. 22, 1980, when it tumbled almost $150. On a
percentage basis, it was the steepest fall since December 2008,
during the financial crisis.
 COMEX futures volume topped 430,000 lots, on pace to
surpass a record from Aug. 9, preliminary Reuters data showed.
 Silver  dropped 5.9 percent to $39.34 an ounce.
 Gold came under pressure after steadying overnight, after a
report showing new orders for U.S. durable goods orders rose 4
percent in July, more than expected and offering hope the
ailing economy could dodge a second recession. [ID:nN1E77N096]

 By Jessica Donati	
 LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Oil prices hovered at $109 a
barrel on Wednesday as supply disruptions balanced against
demand worries and investors remained cautious ahead of U.S.
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's speech at the end of the
week.	
 Bernanke is expected to express his disappointment over U.S.
growth and offer remedial action to kick-start the world's
largest economy and key oil consumer.	
 ""There is not a lot of impetus in either direction, with the
market caught between problems with supply on one side - Libyan
exports offline and probably offline for some time. On the
demand side (there is) weak economic growth and slowing demand,""
said Tobias Merath, Head of Private Banking Commodity Research
at Credit Suisse.	
 Oil trading was likely to remain cautious at least until
Bernanke's speech on Friday, which could help clarify the
outlook for U.S. economy and provide momentum, Merath added. 
 Brent crude  was down 15 cents at $109.16 a barrel at
0821 GMT, while U.S. October crude  was down 28 cents at
$85.16 a barrel.	
 
 FUNDAMENTAL WORRIES	
 Reduced crude stockpiles in the United States, a still
uncertain outlook for Libyan exports and a force majeure by
Royal Dutch Shell  on Bonny Light sweet crude declared
on Tuesday are providing support on the supply side.	
 Attention on Wednesday is focused on U.S. crude inventory
data due from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) at
1430 GMT, after API data showed stocks fell a surprise 3.3
million barrels in the week to Aug. 19, against analyst
forecasts for an 800,000-barrel rise. 
 Trade sources said the entire Bonny Light programme - around
190,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September and 216,000 bpd in
October - had been withdrawn after a hacksaw attack on Tuesday.

 In Libya, rebels appeared to deliver a decisive blow to
Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year rule after forcing him to flee his
compound in Tripoli. But worries remain about internal divisions
within the opposition sparking a new period of instability and
further hampering oil exports. 
 Libya's former top oil official Shokri Ghanem said on Monday
it would take as long as 18 months for the country's oil flow to
reach the pre-war level of around 1.6 million barrels per day
(bpd), nearly 2 percent of global supply. 
 On the demand side, investors' hopes remain pinned on the
Fed to rescue the U.S. and euro zone economies from sliding back
into recession. German business sentiment added to gloom,
dropping more than expected in August in a further sign European
growth is slowing.

 By Seng Li Peng	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Brent crude prices steadied
above $109 on Wednesday as investors pinned their hopes on the
U.S. Federal Reserve to inject fresh stimulus measures to boost
the world's largest economy.	
 Markets are betting that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke could use
his address later this week at a policymakers gathering in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to signal more quantitative easing
measures that could translate to more demand. 
 Reduced crude stockpiles in the U.S., uncertainty over when
the conflict in Libya will end and a force majeure by Royal
Dutch Shell  on Bonny Light sweet crude were also
supporting sentiment. 
 ""The oil market is trending higher, and you see this in the
equities market as well, but it's purely based on the prospects
of a QE2,"" Jonathan Barratt, managing director at Commodity
Broking Services in Sydney, said. 
 ""Hopefully they do come up with a QE3 of some sort. But will
this be just a short term gain? We have already seen a lot of
pain. We still have economic concerns and prospects of a double
dip.""	
 Brent crude  was about 18 cents higher at $109.49 a
barrel as of 0403 GMT, while U.S. October crude  was 27
cents higher at $85.71 a barrel.	
 Asian stocks fell on Wednesday as a rally fuelled by
speculation about the Fed ran out of steam, after a 3 percent
jump in U.S. stocks on Tuesday. 
 
 
 REDUCED SUPPLY	
 Shell said on Tuesday it has been forced to shut in its
Nigerian Bonny Light crude exports to repair pipeline damage
caused by a recent spate of hacksaw attacks. 
 Traders said Nigeria's total exports would fall from a
planned volume of about 2 million bpd in September and 1.85
million bpd in October. 
 U.S. crude inventories fell 3.3 million barrels in the week
to Aug. 19, against analyst forecasts for an 800,000-barrel
rise. 
 The Energy Information Administration (EIA) will issue its
own weekly data on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT). 
 In Libya, rebels sacked Muammar Gaddafi's Tripoli bastion,
seizing weapons and smashing symbols of a 42-year dictatorship. 
 Gaddafi said on Wednesday his withdrawal from his Bab
al-Aziziya headquarters was a ""tactical move"" after the compound
was levelled by 64 NATO air strikes.	
 Forces loyal to Gaddafi were shelling the towns of Zuara and
Ajelat west of Tripoli, Al-Arabiya television reported.	
 In Tripoli, Reuters correspondents said there still appeared
to be some hostile fire around the city centre as darkness
descended and looting broke out.

 Libya's former top oil official Shokri Ghamen had said on
Monday that it would take as long as 18 months for Libya's oil
flow to reach the pre-war of around 1.6 million barrels per day
(bpd), nearly 2 percent of global supply.	
 ""I actually feel that you are going to get more of an uptake
in Libya's production. The production of the light sweet on the
European market will come a lot sooner than what people expect,""
said Barratt, who estimated that Libya could be currently
producing 180,000-200,000 bpd.

 * Physical gold buying strong after price dip
 * Coming up: U.S. durable good orders, July; 1230 GMT
(Adds details, comments; updates prices)	
 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Gold rebounded more than 1
percent on Wednesday after posting its worst drop in 18 months,
as risk appetite retreated after Moody's downgraded Japan's debt
rating and strong buying interest in Asia's physical market lent
support.	
 The sharp drop in prices in the previous session triggered
strong buying interest as Asia opened business, sending spot
gold up 1.2 percent to $1,851.67 an ounce by 0303 GMT.	
 U.S. gold  trimmed early losses to $1,854.80.	
 ""A huge drop in prices triggered some buying interest,"" said
Ong Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures, adding that Moody's
downgrading Japan may spur some safe-haven interest in gold as
well. 
 Some gold bulls say it's time to take money off the table
after bullion prices rallied about $400 from the beginning of
July to a record high above $1,911 on Tuesday. 
 Ong said it would be premature to call Tuesday's price dip a
correction since prices have rebounded strongly, but said a
correction is long over-due and could be violent.	
 ""But there is quite a bit of downside risk if gold breaks
below $1,800 on a sustained basis. It may go lower to $1,700 or
so,"" said Ong.	
 
 Physical dealers were busy with a flood of orders from
countries including China, Indonesia and Thailand.	
 ""Everyone is hunting for physical gold now,"" said a
Singapore-based bullion dealer, adding that physical gold buying
sustained even when prices hit record highs over the past few
sessions.	
 India, the world's largest gold consumer, has yet to buy in
bulk. Its festival and wedding season starts in late September
and peaks during the Deepavali festival in late October.

 Investors are on the watch for potential margin requirement
hikes from the CME Group on U.S. gold, after the Shanghai Gold
Exchange raised margins and daily trading limits on some of its
gold forward contracts. 
 At a time of market turmoil, exchanges routinely increase
the margin requirements to cover the risk of a default.	
 Other precious metals also bounced back from Tuesday's fall.	
 Spot silver gained 1 percent to $42.25, after sliding
more than 4 percent in the previous session -- its worst in
nearly three weeks.	
 Spot platinum traded up 1.1 percent to $1,877.24,
after dropping more than 2 percent in the previous session.

1439,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 23, 2011 08:26PM ET</span>",Crude oil retreats in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - Crude oil pared gains in Asian trade Wednesday, falling back after a strong showing by Wall Street and hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve would soon vow action to boost the economy of the world’s largest energy consumer.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD85.58 a barrel during early Asian trade, falling 0.59%, after hitting a daily high of USD86.14.
Stocks on Wall Street rose for the second day, as dealers remained optimistic that the Federal Reserve would signal some additional movement on quantitative easing at its meeting later this week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. 
Further upward momentum for oil was boosted by news that rebels in Libya had failed to secure a victory and topple leader Moammar Gadhafi, further postponing any resumption of full oil production capacity in the North African country.
In Nigeria, production was reduced by operator Royal Dutch Shell after an attack on one of the company’s pipelines, reducing exports by some 200,000 barrels per day.
Meanwhile, the industry-backed American Petroleum Institute Tuesday said that U.S. supplies dropped by 3.34 million barrels to 347 million barrels last week.
A rising U.S. dollar contributed to lower oil prices as dollar-denominated oil futures contracts tend to fall when the dollar gains.
The dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, rose 0.15% to 73.98.

 NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Tuesday along with
equities on hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve might indicate
fresh stimulus measures later this week, with oil also drawing
support from fighting in Libya and disrupted Nigerian exports.
 U.S. major stocks indexes shot 3 percent higher as
investors jumped into the market before a highly anticipated

 Some investors expect Bernanke to signal more Fed
quantitative easing measures to come in order to stimulate a
sluggish U.S. economy.
 ""This is a rally driven on hopes of Bernanke saying
something about more stimulus,"" said Bill O'Grady of Confluence
Investment Management in St. Louis.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose toward $109
on Tuesday, while U.S. crude was up more than $1 as fighting in
Libya continued and in anticipation of a fall in U.S. crude
stockpiles.	
 Remnants of forces still loyal to Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi fought rebels in Tripoli on Tuesday, extending a
conflict that looked close to conclusion on Monday after rebels
swept into Tripoli in tandem with an uprising within the city.	
 Continued fighting surprised some in the market, after Brent
fell on Monday on hopes for a quick resolution and a speedy
restart in exports from the OPEC member.	
 Brent crude  rose 55 cents to $108.91 a barrel as of
0732 GMT, while U.S. October crude  was up $1.22 to $85.66
a barrel.	
 ""It could take months before oil can start to flow again
from Libya,"" said John Vautrain, a director at energy consulting
firm Purvin & Gertz. 
 ""I think there was a lot of euphoria on Monday. But the
whole country is not completely pacified yet and we don't have
an organised government. A lot is lacking.""	
 A son of Muammar Gaddafi -- who rebels said they had
captured -- appeared with cheering supporters in Tripoli, giving
a boost to forces loyal to the veteran leader. The whereabouts
of his father remained a mystery. 
 Libya would be able to restart some oil output in a few
months, the country's former top oil official said on Monday.
But it would take as long as 18 months to reach the pre-war
level, Shokri Ghamen said. 
 Before the conflict, the country pumped around 1.6 million
barrels per day (bpd), nearly two percent of global
output. 
 Most of Libya's high quality crude went to European
refiners. The prospect of an increase in supply of light sweet
crude into Europe has led to the spread between Brent and U.S.
crude narrowing.	
 Gaddafi's exit could also usher in a new era of instability
for the country, as it is still unknown what the new government
will look like, MF Global said in a report.	
 Questions may linger over whether individuals loyal to
Gaddafi would create havoc or sabotage near oil installations,
it added. MF Global is expecting the Brent-WTI spread to reach
$10 a barrel. 
 Current Brent's premium to U.S. crude  was below
$24 a barrel after scaling a record high of $26.69 on Friday.	
 A fall in U.S. crude stockpiles could lead to a further
contraction in the spread. U.S. crude inventories were forecast
to have fallen due to lower imports, a preliminary Reuters poll
showed on Monday ahead of weekly data. 
 Four of seven analysts polled expected crude stockpiles
dropped in the week to Aug. 19, with the average forecast
showing a drawdown of 200,000 barrels.	
 The latest storm in the Atlantic hurricane season poses no
threat to oil operations in the Gulf of Mexico, forecasters
said. Irene strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane as it swept
north of the Dominican Republic on Monday. 
 
 CONFIDENCE LEVEL IMPROVED	
 Investors' confidence may have improved after a senior U.S.
Federal Reserve official said the Fed would intervene if the
economy weakens and deflation appears.	
 St. Louis Fed president James Bullard told Japan's Nikkei
business daily that he expected stronger growth in the second
half of 2011 and going into 2012. 
 All eyes are now on Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who will make
a speech on Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, at an annual
gathering of policymakers and academics. 
 ""A lot of traders in commodities across the spectrum are
looking at this Jackson Hole summit, speculating what is going
to happen and what Bernanke's thoughts are,"" said Ben LeBrun, a
Sydney-based markets analyst at CMC Markets. 
 ""Part of his job is to talk up the economy, so I think he is
going to try and say something positive. It just depends what is
being factored in terms of forward prices.""	
 Recent market turmoil and signs of weaker U.S. growth have
boosted expectations Bernanke may raise the prospect of more
emergency stimulus for the world's largest economy and top oil
importer.	
 At last year's meeting, Bernanke hinted at what eventually
became a $600 billion quantitative easing bond-buying
programme, known as QE2. But some economists said Bernanke may
hold off on aggressive easing plans this year. 
 
 DOWNSIDE PERSISTS	
 Traders are also awaiting European Purchasing Managers'
Indices (PMI) due later on Tuesday, while HSBC's China Flash PMI
showed its factory sector is likely to slow slightly for a
second consecutive month in August as sluggish overseas demand
saps new orders. 
 China's trade outlook faces weak external demand and rising
costs and the debt problems of advanced economies would bring
challenges to the world's second-largest economy, Minister of
Commerce Jiang Yaoping said on Tuesday. 
 Demand growth from China has driven oil markets for over a
decade and is expected to provide the lion's share of the
increase in global fuel consumption again in 2011.

1449,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 22, 2011 09:21PM ET</span>",Gold futures add to record highs in early Asian trade,"Investing.com – Gold futures extended gains in Asian trade Tuesday, reaching record highs as dealers continue to covet the precious metal as a safe-haven investment in light of continued volatility in global equity markets.
  
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,906.45 a troy ounce during early Asian trade, rising 0.65%, after hitting the day’s low of USD1,894.25. 
 
Gold topped USD1,900 for the first time earlier in Monday U.S. trade, and has set record highs in five of the last six trading days.
 
U.S. shares posted modest gains on the day, ending a two-day losing streak but investors remain unconvinced of long-term strength in equities as U.S. economic indicators remain weak, and European leaders continue to grapple with the details of a rescue fund for debt-threatened euro-zone nations.
 
By the end of the U.S. trading session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.34%, to close at 10,854.70, the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.15% to 2,345.38, and the S&P 500 eked out a 0.03% rise to 1,123.82.
 
Earlier Monday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago reported that its national activity index had risen to minus 0.06 in July from minus 0.38 the previous month. Forecasts were for the Chicago Fed’s index to ease to minus 0.48 in July.
 
Meanwhile, market eyes were focused on a scheduled meeting by the U.S. Federal Reserve later this week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Pressure has been mounting on Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke to assure a shaken market that the central bank is prepared to move on further quantitative easing.
 
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver for September delivery fell 0.65% to trade at USD43.28 a troy ounce, while copper for September delivery added 0.4% to trade at USD3.960 a pound.

1450,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 22, 2011 08:44PM ET</span>",Crude oil futures fall in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - Crude oil futures retreated in Asian trade Tuesday, as the outlook for a near end to civil strife in Libya sparked expectations of a resumption of Libyan production and a rise in global stockpiles.
 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD84.06 a barrel during early Asian trade, falling 0.4%, after hitting a daily high of USD84.58.
 
Rebel forces in Libya over the weekend, converged on Tripoli in what was expected to be the beginning of the end for the country’s leader, Moammar Gadhafi, and his four-decade long hold on power.
 
Before the beginning of the conflict six months ago, Libya produced approximately 1.6 million barrels of oil a day, of which about 1.3 million barrels was targeted for export. Production halted to a near stand-still as Gadhafi loyalists battled with rebels for control of key oil production facilities.
 
The market has had a difficult time replacing the supply of Libya’s highly-coveted light, sweet oil blend as other Organization of Petroleum Exporting Country’s output is of a harder, more expensive variety to refine.
 
Analyst expected that it could take at least a month of relative political stability and a Libyan commitment to oil production before exports could resume.
 
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose against its counterparts, with the dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, adding 0.03% to 74.25.
 
Dollar-denominated oil futures tend to fall when the dollar gains, as it makes oil more expensive for buyers in other currencies.
 
On the ICE Futures Exchange Brent oil futures for October delivery rose 0.11% to trade at USD108.41. 
 
Dealers were expected to monitor developments in Libya, as well as pay close attention to a meeting later this week of U.S. Federal Reserve Bank officials.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Spot gold soared to an
all-time high above $1,910 on Tuesday, scoring a record top for
a fourth consecutive session, as persistent worries about global
economic growth burnished bullion's safe-haven appeal.	
 The precious metal was headed for a seventh straight session
of rise and a monthly gain of more than 16 percent, highest
since September 1999.	
 Spot gold gained 0.8 percent to strike an
unprecedented $1,911.46 an ounce, before easing to trade flat at
$1,897.05 by 0626 GMT.	
 U.S. gold  rose 1.4 percent to a record high of
$1,917.90, and retraced to $1,900.80.	
 Investors are waiting for flash purchasing managers' index
(PMI) data for Germany, France and the euro zone later in the
day, with a weak number likely to exacerbate fears about bailing
out the bloc's indebted peripheral states. 
 ""We are not hearing much good news out of Europe or the
United States,"" said Darren Heathcote, head of trading at
Investec Australia. 
 ""The picture looks pretty bleak in the short term... For the
time being investors are happy looking at gold as safe haven in
these troubled times, and will continue to do so until we see
something positive and sustainable.""	
 On the chart, gold has been in the overbought territory
since early August, with the Relative Strength Index hovering
about 83.	
 Technical analysis suggested gold could pull back to $1,860
during the day, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.

 
 
 SGE RAISES MARGINS, TRADING LIMITS; EYES ON COMEX	
 The Shanghai Gold Exchanges said it will raise trading
margins on three of its gold spot deferred contracts to 12
percent from 11 percent starting Aug. 26, and widen the daily
trading limits to 9 percent from 7 percent. 
 Shanghai gold T+D contract fell less than 2
yuan from a high of 391.85 yuan per gram at the news, but has
since stabilised around 391 yuan, or $1,900.02 an ounce.	
 Traders are eyeing potential hikes in U.S. gold futures
margins. They were last raised on Aug. 11 by 22 percent,
triggering a correction in gold prices. 
 But concerns about the world's economic growth soon offset
the impact of the margin hike, and gold embarked on another leg
of record-setting rally just a week later.	
 ""Everyone says that gold has been rising too fast, beware,
beware, beware!"" said Ronald Leung, a physical dealer at Lee
Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong. ""But there is no sign of gold
prices turning to point south.""	
 Leung said scrap selling was minimal and sellers are waiting
for higher prices, while investors continued to show buying
interest.	
 Market participants are eyeing an annual central bank
conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where the U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is scheduled to speak on Friday.

 Spot silver rose to $44.14, its strongest since early
May, tracking gold's strength. It was later trading at $43.44,
down 0.7 percent from the previous close.	
 Spot platinum hit a three-year high at $1,912 an
ounce, before easing to $1,904.24. 
 In other news, China's flash Purchasing Managers' Index,
designed to preview the country's factory output before official
data, edged up to 49.8 in August, from July's final reading of
49.3. 
 That leaves the index a touch under the 50-point mark that
demarcates expansion from contraction in activity. HSBC
publishes its final China PMI index for August on Sept 1.

 NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Brent crude edged lower on
Monday in choppy trading as investors hoped the process to
restart oil exports from OPEC member Libya would begin soon as
the country's six-month-old civil war neared an end.
 Brent pared losses, bouncing with rallying U.S. crude on
the day the September contract expired as rising Wall Street
equities provided a boost.
 Brent crude's forward curve flattened in the months through
early next year and its premium to U.S. crude fell on hopes
that a swift end to Libya's civil war would bring the country's
oil exports back to the market. [ID:nL5E7JM1QG]
 Some output will be able to restart in a few months, but it
will take as long as 18 months to reach prewar levels, Libya's
former top oil official Shokri Ghanem said. [ID:nWLA3995]
 Muammar Gaddafi was a hunted man as remnants of his forces
made a last-ditch stand in Libya's capital. [ID:nLDE77L0NB]
 ""While the Libyan leadership could be in the state of flux
for several more days or even a few weeks, developments thus
far strongly suggest a return of Libyan exports to the global
market place,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president at Ritterbusch &
Associates in Galena, Illinois, said in a note.
 U.S. crude prices had an early boost from dollar weakness
<.DXY> before the U.S. currency recovered as the euro fell
back. The dollar had been pressured on speculation that the
Federal Reserve this week might indicate a need to take
additional measures to support an ailing economy. [USD/]
 U.S. equities also seesawed, slipping early, bouncing and
pushing higher, then ending little changed as investors
remained cautious after recent sharp declines. [.N]
 Brent October crude  fell 26 cents to settle at
$108.36 a barrel, having bounced off a $105.15 low. Brent also
had technical support from its intraday recovery back above its
200-day moving average of $107.91.
 U.S. expiring September crude  rose $1.86 to settle
at $84.12 a barrel, having recovered from $81.13. More actively
traded October  crude rose $2.01 to settle at $84.42 a
barrel.
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude  narrowed to below
$24 a barrel, after reaching a record $26.69 on Friday.
 U.S. crude trading volumes slightly outpaced Brent. Both
topped 500,000 lots traded and Brent surpassed its 30-day
average.
 Part of U.S. crude divergence from Brent is because traders
are starting to bail out of their Brent/U.S. spread positions,
said Dominick Chirichella of the Energy Management Institute.
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude, partially blamed on the glut
of crude at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub, may linger as the
effort to build a pipeline to move crude to the refinery-rich
Houston area stalls.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Gold rallied almost 2
percent to a record near $1,900 an ounce on Monday as a
sputtering global economy boosted expectations for further
monetary easing, raising bullion's appeal as a hedge against
inflation.
 Bullion's six-session winning streak came as Wall Street
erased early gains. Global markets will focus on Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's speech on Friday in Wyoming's
Jackson Hole, where policymakers and academics meet once a year
to talk shop.
 Analysts said anything short of a third round of
quantitative easing would likely provide limited support for
gold as the Fed had already vowed to keep interest rates low
into 2013. Bullion could also correct sharply after it rose 6
percent in the last three sessions, and by $400 since July.
 ""Gold is driven by the expectation that at some point
inflation will come back, and a continuation of people looking
for a safe haven beside just the U.S. Treasury bonds,"" said Leo
Larkin, metals equity analyst at Standard & Poor's.
 ""It's still susceptible to a pretty big pullback as things
are overdone based on technical indicators.""
 Spot gold  was up 1.6 percent at $1,889.29 an ounce
by 2:41 PM EDT (1841 GMT), building on its strongest one-week
rise since February 2009. It is one of this year's
best-performing assets, now up 33 percent.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up

 OVERBOUGHT MARKET?
 Investors sought refuge in the yellow metal from the euro
zone debt crisis, weakness in the U.S. economy, and volatility
in the currency markets.
 Analysts are worried that bullion's over 15-percent rally
just in August has been overdone, as the relative strength

technical charts showed.
 ""People talk about gold as an insurance premium, but right

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Spot gold surged more than 1
percent to a third consecutive all-time high on Monday, as
investors fled to the safety of bullion amid fears of another
U.S. recession and the euro zone's debt crisis.	
 Spot gold struck a record at $1,888.90 an ounce,
after staging its biggest weekly gain in 2-1/2 years last week.
It traded at $1,888.76 by 0640 GMT.	
 U.S. gold  jumped more than 2 percent to an
unprecedented $1,895.3.	
 A murky economic outlook given a persistent flow of weak
macro data out of the United States and fears about the euro
zone's fiscal health have propelled gold up by more than a
quarter since July. 
 ""We are not expecting anything supporting the U.S. economy
or the macro data for at least a couple of months,"" said Tom
Price, Global Commodity Analyst at UBS.	
 ""Europe we regard as even weaker. We are thinking
$1,900-$2,000 over a very short period of time is a likely
target.""	
 Investors are waiting for signs of further stimulus from the
U.S. Federal Reserve when bankers gather in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, late this week, one year after Chairman Ben Bernanke
launched a second round of quantitative easing to revive the
economy.	
 Additional bond purchase by the Fed could raise the
inflation outlook and further boost gold, but many view the
chances of a third round of quantitative easing as limited and
expect the Fed to take gradual measures to boost the economy.

 Technical analysis suggested that gold could pierce through
$1,900 over the day, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.

 
 Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest
gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose to 1,290.762 tonnes by
Aug. 21, the highest in a week and half. 
 But speculators scaled back their bullish bets in U.S. gold
futures and options for a second week last week, as bullion's
rapid rally prompted some investors to liquidate positions, data
showed. 
 ""Key resistance in gold will be found at $1,946. However,
the market may need an extraordinary event to take it above that
level,"" said MF Global in a research note.	
 Other precious metals tracked gold's strength.	
 Spot silver rose as much as 2.5 percent to a
three-month high of $43.93, extending a 10-percent rise last
week -- its best week since December.	
 Spot platinum hit a three-year high of $1,890.25, on
course for its 10th consecutive session of rise.

 By Claire Milhench	
 LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell by more than a
dollar on Monday to around $107 a barrel with traders and
investors anticipating the resumption of oil exports from
OPEC-member Libya as a six-month civil war there appeared close
to an end.	
 Rebels swept into the heart of the capital Tripoli and
crowds took to the streets to celebrate what they saw as the end
of Muammar Gaddafi's four decades in power, with government
tanks and snipers putting up only scattered, last-ditch
resistance. 
 France and the UK have called on Gaddafi's supporters
to stop fighting.
Although oil prices fell on the rebels reaching
Tripoli, oil traders are sceptical about
how quickly Libyan output can be
restored. 
 Brent crude  was down $1.30 to $107.32 at 1200 GMT.
U.S. crude  rose $1.24 to $83.50 a barrel as the dollar
weakened against a basket of currencies . The front-month
September U.S. crude contract expires on Monday.	
 ""Brent is taking more of a battering but that's only to be
expected,"" said Christopher Bellew, a trader at Jefferies Bache.
""The divergence is just another graphic example of the
dislocation between (U.S. crude) WTI and Brent.""	
 Libya pumped around 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd),
nearly 2 percent of global supply, before the war cut its
output. Most of Libya's high-quality crude flowed to European
refiners, but after Libyan exports ceased, tighter supply drove
Brent to a two-year high of $127.02 in April. 
 Output has fallen to almost nothing during the conflict but
technical staff from Italy's oil and gas major ENI have
already arrived in Libya to look into restarting oil facilities.

 Libya's rebel oil firm Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO)
sa ys it is technically ready to start oil
output in its two eastern fields and can do so without the
presence of foreign oil workers. 
 Analysts are sceptical as to how quickly exports will rise,
however. Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt, said it could be about six months before output
climbed back to 1 million bpd or so, having examined what
happened in Iraq in 2003. 
 ""Output was close to zero in the months after the U.S.
invasion,"" he said. ""The big question is how much damage has
been done to the oil facilities in Libya where the fighting has
gone on much longer than in Iraq. There's a risk it may take a
bit longer in Libya.""	
 Olivier Jakob, oil analyst at Petromatrix, said he was not
expecting a flood of Libyan crude oil in the near term as some
of the early oil output will probably go to local refineries.	
 The Libyan rebels gained control of the 120,000 bpd Zawiyah
refinery last week . ""It was believed to be the
last operating refinery in the country and was providing Gaddafi
forces with fuel, but is now supplying rebels,"" analysts at JBC
Energy noted.	
 Tight supplies of Libya's light sweet crude in Europe helped
fuel a widening of the spread between Brent and U.S. crude. The
spread is already narrowing from a record $26.69 reached last
week, and could contract further with the prospect of a
resumption in Libyan supplies.	
 
 
 U.S. ECONOMY 
 Traders are awaiting a speech from the U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday at a lodge in Wyoming's Jackson
Hole, where policymakers and academics meet once a year.

 Fritsch said the possibility of a third round of
quantitative easing was keeping oil buoyant. ""Talk of QE3 will
prevent a steeper price drop for the moment. Prices will remain
above $100 for the time being."" 
 Michael Hewson, analyst at CMC Markets ,
said uncertainty about the U.S. economy
was probably helping to support U.S. crude.
""It has been trading in a range of $78-$88 and until
we get a clear idea of what the Fed will do on Friday it will
stay in that range."" 
 Bellew also pointed to U.S. sanctions against Syrian oil
exports, announced last week. The EU is also drawing up plans
for a possible oil embargo. 
 ""The next worry is that as fast as you see Libyan crude
returning to the market we could see Syrian crude disappearing.
That could be stopping it from falling so much,"" said Bellew.

A meeting between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel failed to dispel ongoing concerns involving debt-threatened euro-zone nations, as the two failed to agree on specifics for embellishing a bailout fund for the region.

 NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Gold rose more than 1 percent
on Friday, setting a record high for a second straight day and
posting its biggest one-week gain in 2-1/2 years on worries
about stalled U.S. growth and Europe's debt crisis.
 After rallying around 3 percent to a record $1,877 an ounce
earlier in the session, bullion sharply pared initial gains as
Wall Street briefly found its footing. Rising oil and commodity
prices also sapped some safety bids for gold after it had
gained 6 percent over the past five days.
 The bullion market is awaiting next week's conference of
central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Some analysts said
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke could unveil a third
round of quantitative easing to revive economic growth.
 ""Gold is driven by the uncertainty about a new global
recession ... and the possibility that Europe will engage in
additional quantitative easing,"" said James Dailey, portfolio
manager of TEAM Financial Asset Management, which oversees $200
million in assets.
 ""While an expected correction could be violent, I don't
think it may last too long.""
 Spot gold  was up 1.3 percent at $1,847.90 an ounce
by 3:00 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT). It is on track for its biggest
one-month rise in nearly 12 years in August and up 30 percent
so far this year.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$30.20 at $1,852.20 an ounce. Trading volume topped 270,000
lots, the highest this week but below last week's pace.
 Silver  rose 4.5 percent to $42.40 an ounce.
 A raft of global economic data this week including sluggish
German growth numbers and a weak U.S. manufacturing report
sparked heavy selling of equities and riskier assets such as
industrial commodities.
 Mounting economic fears prompted investors to dump stocks
and other risk assets for the perceived security of gold. The
inverse correlation between bullion and equities has tightened
to negative 0.5, and a ratio of the S&P 500 divided by gold
fell to its lowest in 23 years.

 GOLD VAULT STRAINS, MARGINS HIKE
 A near $400 rally in the price of the yellow metal has
caused some strains in gold vault storage space particularly in
the western United States, and some retail clients have had to
pay higher service fees, Savneet Singh, chief executive of Gold
Bullion International (GBI), told Reuters.
 Singh said the premium of small physical bullion bars is
now significantly above spot gold prices due to huge demand.
GBI sells physical precious metals and offers delivery and
storage services to institutional and retail investors.
 Gold's rally prompted the CEO of Canadian gold producer
Goldcorp  to warn of a minor correction in gold prices
before the end of this year even as the long-term outlook
remains strong. [ID:nN1E77I138]
 Speculation was also rife on Friday that the CME Group, the
world's largest commodity exchange, could raise margins on gold
futures once more, after a similar move this month dampened the
precious metal's sharp run higher.
 Gold once again traded briefly at a premium to platinum,
after doing so last week for the first time since 2008.
Concerns over economic growth, while lifting gold, are weighing
on industrial metals such as platinum. [ID:nL6E7J90UG]
 Platinum  rose to its highest since early May, up 1.7
percent at $1,868.50 an ounce. Palladium  bucked the
trend, falling 1.1 percent to $743.49 an ounce.

 NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Brent rose in choppy trading
on Friday, managing a small weekly gain as the dollar fell to a
record low against the yen.
 U.S. crude futures gave up gains in late trading to settle
lower, posting its fourth weekly loss.
 Limiting the revival of the inverse-correlation trade
between commodities and the dollar was a late-session equities
slump on Wall Street as fears the U.S. economy may be headed
for another recession pulled stocks lower.
 Even though U.S. crude limped into the close, its rally
from lows under $80 a barrel and Brent's rebound followed
helped shore up prices after another deep sell-off on Thursday
spurred by weak U.S. manufacturing data that revived fears of a
double-dip recession.
 Investors are now looking for any sign of Federal Reserve

month.
 ""The reversal of the dollar versus the euro, and of course
then the record low against the yen, sparked the oil rally,""
said Chris Dillman, analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford,
Connecticut.
 The dollar initially came under pressure after Spain said
it would temporarily cut the sales tax on new house purchases
in a move aimed at stimulating the construction sector. The
greenback later fell to a record low against the yen on a
newspaper report suggesting Japan did not plan to intervention
often. [FRX/] [USD/]

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2011 10:00PM ET</span>",UPDATE 2-Oil falls on renewed demand fears," * U.S. oil slips as low as $80.66; Brent falls to $106.05
 * Raft of weak economic U.S. data renews fear of recession

 SINGAPORE, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday,
extending the previous session's plunge, on renewed fears of
weak demand following a slew of lacklustre data from the world's
top oil consumer, the United States. 
 Brent  slipped to as low as $106.05, after breaking
below the 200-day moving average to settle at $106.99. Prices
dropped 89 cents to $106.10 at 0202 GMT.	
 The contract has slipped more than 9 percent this month, the
worst since a 15 percent drop in May 2010. 
 U.S. crude  slipped to as low as $80.66 a barrel and
traded $1.61 a barrel lower at $80.77. The contract slipped
nearly 6 percent to settle at $82.38 and has lost 15 percent so
far this month, the steepest since December 2008.	
 A raft of weak U.S. economic data and concerns about the
health of European banks renewed fears of a new recession,
triggering another round of selling across commodities and stock
markets similar to the violent sell-offs seen at the start of
the month as investors dumped riskier assets.	
""This short-term downturn is not done yet. It could take WTI
to as low as $75. The fundamental picture is not that bad but if
the overall economy remains weak it is very hard to make a case
for a bull run in oil,"" said Tony Nunan, a risk manager with
Mitsubishi Corporation in Japan.	
Brent oil could extend the current fall to $105.24 per
barrel, while U.S. oil is expected to slide more to $78.85 per
barrel, as the bearish momentum is strong, said Reuters market
analyst Wang Tao. 
 
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB , a global benchmark for
commodities, fell more than 2 percent on Thursday -- its largest
daily decline since Aug. 8, when energy, metals and agricultural
markets slumped following the Standard & Poor's downgrade of the
U.S. triple-A credit rating. 
The selling came after data showed factory activity in the
U.S. Mid-Atlantic region in August fell to the lowest level
since March 2009. The data from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve
Bank is viewed as a forward-looking indicator of national
manufacturing. 
An unexpected fall in existing U.S. home sales in July and a
greater-than-expected rise in new claims for jobless benefits in
the latest week added to growing fears that the U.S. economic
recovery could stall and slide into recession. 
Implied volatility in the oil market soared on Thursday, with
the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Oil Volatility Index
hitting its highest level in more than a week, snapping a steady
downtrend. 
The U.S. dollar was holding modest gains in Asia on Friday,
as the weak U.S. economic data and concerns about European banks
sent skittish investors piling into Treasuries.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Gold surged more than 1
percent to a record high above $1,850 an ounce on Friday, as
investors reached for the safety of bullion amid a worsening
economic outlook for the United States and concern about the
health of Europe's banks.	
 Disappointing U.S. manufacturing and housing data fuelled
worries that growth in the world's largest economy has stalled.	
 Renewed fears about the health of Europe's banks encouraged
the flight of investors from stocks to safe haven bets such as
gold. 
 Spot gold rose 1.6 percent to an all-time high of
$1,853.2 an ounce, and stood at $1,847.56 an ounce by 0632 GMT.
It was on course for a 5.9-percent weekly rise, its seventh gain
in a row and the largest since February 2009. 
 The metal had hit nine record highs, and risen nearly 14
percent so far this month -- its best month since September,
1999. 
 U.S. gold  rose to a record of $1,856.50, and eased
to $1,850.60, up 1.6 percent from the previous close.	
 ""It's not surprising in view of more concerns about Europe
and terrible data out of the U.S.,"" said Darren Heathcote, head
of trading at Investec Australia. 
 ""It looks unlikely that gold would fall particularly at the
present time, given there's so much uncertainty and nervousness
in the markets.""	
 The uncertainty in the global economy would likely boost the
prices of bullion further to $1,900 an ounce in the next six
months, said metals consultancy GFMS, a unit of Thomson Reuters.

 Gold had breached the bullish target of $1,850 for the
day. 
 
 The physical market saw thin trading, dealers said.	
 ""Clients are stunned by the rapid price rally and don't know
what to do,"" said a Singapore-based physical gold dealer. ""Most
of them are now waiting to see what is going to happen next.""	
 Gold's one-quarter gain from July has stoked expectations of
a correction in prices among some, but fear of another economic
recession will provide a strong floor for any price dip,
analysts and traders said.	
 ""The way the market is going, anything is possible,"" said
Heathcote of Investec.	
 ""We could see $1,900, we could see it back to $1,700 before
you know it, but it would take a very significant change in
sentiment to see the latter.""	
 Spot silver hit a two-week high of $41.13 an ounce,
headed for a 5-percent rise on the week, its strongest in a
month. 
 Spot platinum built on gains from the past eight
sessions, up 1 percent at $1,855.74. The platinum-gold spread
dipped towards parity from a premium of about $50 earlier in the
week.

 By Matthew Robinson and David Sheppard
 NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil fell nearly $4
a barrel on Thursday as a raft of weak U.S. economic data
provided a fresh blow to shaky investor confidence, while U.S.
crude's losses extended to 14 percent so far in August.
 Equities plunged, volatility jumped and gold hit a fresh
record as traders said fears of a new recession were growing
again, sparking another round of risk aversion reminiscent of
the violent sell-offs at the start of this month.
 Thursday's declines follow a short-lived rebound that had
seen Brent crude climb by around $9 in the previous six
sessions.
 ""It's much of the same -- concerns over European banks,
U.S. deficits weighing on economic growth and the possibility
of a global recession as the end result,"" said Chris Jarvis,
senior analyst for Caprock Risk Management in Hampton Falls,
New Hampshire.
 ""These cross currents are driving wild swings for riskier
asset classes such as equities and commodities, specifically
crude oil. Until clarity improves, we expect volatility to
remain elevated relative to historical norms.""
 Brent crude  fell $3.61 to settle at $106.99 a
barrel, breaking below the 200-day moving average, a key
technical indicator closely watched by traders.
 U.S. crude oil settled down $5.20, or nearly 6 percent, at
$82.38 a barrel. Selling accelerated after the settlement, with
prices dropping down to $81.15 a barrel.
 The losses pushed U.S. oil below 35 on the 14-day relative
strength index, approaching the 30 level which is frequently
seen as a sign of a commodity being oversold. U.S. crude's
discount to Brent widened to near $25 a barrel, but still off
the record over $26 hit earlier in August.
 Early pressure from disappointing U.S. weekly jobless
claims and July home sales reports sparked a steep sell-off
mid-morning. Selling then intensified after a report showed
factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region in August
dropped to the lowest level since March 2009. [ID:nN1E77H0E8]
 U.S. trading volumes were relatively strong, up 22 percent
over the 30-day average, topping 800,000 lots shortly after the
settlement. Brent trade was more subdued, slightly over that
average.
 Implied volatility in the oil market soared, with the
Chicago Board Options Exchange's Oil Volatility Index <.OVX>
hitting 54.23 percent, its highest level in more than a week
and snapping a steady downtrend. [ID:N1E77H0J2]
 SAFER HAVENS
 ""The market is in meltdown mode; the data continues to
stink. I don't know that there's much more to be said. We
continue to be in a soft patch,"" said Sal Catrini, managing
director for equities at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co in New York.
 The dollar rose and gold hit a new record of $1,825.99 an
ounce as investors sought safe havens away from equities and
industrial commodities.
 U.S. stocks tumbled 4 percent and the Reuters-Jefferies CRB
<.CRB>, an index tracking 19 commodities, was down 2.3 percent
in the steepest one-day loss since the U.S. credit downgrade
earlier this month by Standard and Poor's.
 Analysts have revised down forecasts for fuel consumption
in recent weeks as concerns about global growth rose, with
Morgan Stanley the latest bank to cut its forecast for global
gross domestic product in 2011 and 2012. [ID:nL3E7JI1LM]
 Concerned the European debt crisis might spread to U.S.
banks, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has asked for more
information about whether the U.S. units of big European
lenders have reliable access to funds needed to operate, the
Wall Street Journal reported. [ID:nL5E7JI0Q]
 LIBYA, SYRIA
 The oil market is also closely watching developments in
North Africa and the Middle East. In Libya, where around 1.6
million barrels per day (bpd) of crude production has been cut
by a six-month civil war, rebel forces took control of a
refinery and blocked a main highway, further isolating Muammar
Gaddafi's Tripoli stronghold. [ID:nL5E7JI049]
 U.S. President Barack Obama banned U.S. imports of Syrian
oil as part of a wider sanctions effort, and joined the
European Union in calling for President Bashar al-Assad to step
down after a five-month crackdown on protesters.
[ID:nL5E7JI2C8]
 Brent prices are up by almost 13 percent so far in 2011, in
part because of the Libyan outage, but are almost $20 a barrel
below the post-2008 peak they hit back in April as European
refiners scrambled to find alternatives to Libyan supplies.
 ""What was announced today will have a very limited impact
as it doesn't really prevent anyone from outside the U.S.
dealing with Syrian oil,"" said Greg Priddy, global oil analyst
at Eurasia Group in Washington.
 ""With 95 percent of Syrian oil exports going to the EU, you
might see more action there,"" he added.
 Syria produces about 400,000 bpd of oil, exporting most of
about 150,000 bpd to European countries, including the
Netherlands, Italy, France and Spain.
 About 10,000 bpd of Syrian oil products were exported to
the United States in the first five months of 2011, out of
total imports of near 9 million bpd.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Gold rallied 2 percent to a
new high above $1,820 an ounce on Thursday after U.S. data
pointed to a stalled economy, while renewed concern about the
health of European banks brought additional safe-haven buying.
 Bullion's fourth consecutive daily rise came after news
that factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region plummeted
and existing home sales unexpectedly dropped.
 Investors dumped stocks and other riskier assets for the
perceived security of gold and U.S. government bonds. The Dow
Jones industrial stock average <.DJI> fell 5 percent and crude
oil  plunged 7 percent. Bullion is headed for its seventh
straight weekly gain.
 However, a break above $2,000 an ounce could be difficult
due to weaker interest in gold exchange-traded funds and after
a $350 rally in the past 1-1/2 months, analysts said.
 ""We hold gold because we believe that inflation will be
part of the solution to address the problems of the world,""
said Axel Merk, portfolio manager of Merk Funds, which has $750
million in assets.
 ""We are potentially entering a stagflationary period,"" Merk
said, referring to persistent inflation combined with stagnant
growth and high unemployment.
 Spot gold  was up 2.1 percent at $1,825.60 an ounce
by 3:00 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT), having hit a record $1,828.50.
It is poised to log a 10 percent gain over the last two weeks,
its best two-week performance since mid-February 2009.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery 
settled up $28.20 at $1,822 an ounce. Trading volume topped
240,000 lots, the highest this week but below last week's
pace.
 Silver  rose 1.2 percent to $40.65 an ounce.
 In addition to the disappointing manufacturing and home
sales reports, U.S. Labor Department data showed that consumer
prices increased at the fastest pace in four months in July,
while weekly initial jobless claims rose. [ID:nLDE77H0MP]
[ID:nN1E77H0E8]
 Adding to market nervousness and interest in gold was a
Wall Street Journal report that the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank
is taking a closer look at the U.S. units of Europe's biggest
lenders. [ID:nN1E77H0E8] [ID:nL5E7JI0Q]
 Bullion rose broadly across major currencies, with gold
priced in Japanese yen  surging to a record, and
euro-priced  and sterling-priced  gold near
all-time highs.
 On the gold options front, the CBOE Gold ETF Volatility
Index <.GVZ>, which is often referred to as the ""Gold VIX"" and
is based on SPDR Gold Trust  options, spiked 5 percent,
the biggest jump in a week.
 ""Option dealers are buying a lot of calls and they are very
bullish,"" said Jonathan Jossen, independent COMEX gold options
floor trader. Investors are using option strategies such as
bull call spreads and fences to bet on the metal's upside, he
added.
 GOLD DEMAND FALLS
 Some analysts said gold could pull back as much as 30
percent. On charts, the relative strength index shows bullion
is well into overbought territory, and the metal has breached a
multi-year rising channel top, suggesting a correction is
possible.
 The World Gold Council said overall gold demand fell 17
percent in the second quarter as growing interest in jewelry,
coins and bars failed to offset a sharp decline in ETF buying.

 In addition, metals consultant GFMS, a unit of Thomson

crude's losses extended to 14 percent so far in August.
 Equities plunged, volatility jumped and gold hit a fresh
record as traders said fears of a new recession were growing
again, sparking another round of risk aversion reminiscent of
the violent sell-offs at the start of this month.
 Thursday's declines follow a short-lived rebound that had
seen Brent crude climb by around $9 in the previous six
sessions.
 ""It's much of the same -- concerns over European banks,
U.S. deficits weighing on economic growth and the possibility
of a global recession as the end result,"" said Chris Jarvis,
senior analyst for Caprock Risk Management in Hampton Falls,
New Hampshire.
 ""These cross currents are driving wild swings for riskier
asset classes such as equities and commodities, specifically
crude oil. Until clarity improves, we expect volatility to
remain elevated relative to historical norms.""
 Brent crude  fell $3.61 to settle at $106.99 a
barrel, breaking below the 200-day moving average, a key
technical indicator closely watched by traders.
 U.S. crude oil settled down $5.20, or nearly 6 percent, at
$82.38 a barrel. Selling accelerated after the settlement, with
prices dropping down to $81.15 a barrel.
 The losses pushed U.S. oil below 35 on the 14-day relative
strength index, approaching the 30 level which is frequently
seen as a sign of a commodity being oversold. U.S. crude's
discount to Brent widened to near $25 a barrel, but still off
the record over $26 hit earlier in August.
 Early pressure from disappointing U.S. weekly jobless
claims and July home sales reports sparked a steep sell-off
mid-morning. Selling then intensified after a report showed
factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region in August
dropped to the lowest level since March 2009. [ID:nN1E77H0E8]
 U.S. trading volumes were relatively strong, up 22 percent
over the 30-day average, topping 800,000 lots shortly after the
settlement. Brent trade was more subdued, slightly over that
average.
 Implied volatility in the oil market soared, with the
Chicago Board Options Exchange's Oil Volatility Index <.OVX>
hitting 54.23 percent, its highest level in more than a week
and snapping a steady downtrend. [ID:N1E77H0J2]
 SAFER HAVENS
 ""The market is in meltdown mode; the data continues to
stink. I don't know that there's much more to be said. We
continue to be in a soft patch,"" said Sal Catrini, managing
director for equities at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co in New York.
 The dollar rose and gold hit a new record of $1,825.99 an
ounce as investors sought safe havens away from equities and
industrial commodities.
 U.S. stocks tumbled 4 percent and the Reuters-Jefferies CRB
<.CRB>, an index tracking 19 commodities, was down 2.3 percent
in the steepest one-day loss since the U.S. credit downgrade
earlier this month by Standard and Poor's.
 Analysts have revised down forecasts for fuel consumption
in recent weeks as concerns about global growth rose, with
Morgan Stanley the latest bank to cut its forecast for global
gross domestic product in 2011 and 2012. [ID:nL3E7JI1LM]
 Concerned the European debt crisis might spread to U.S.
banks, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has asked for more
information about whether the U.S. units of big European
lenders have reliable access to funds needed to operate, the
Wall Street Journal reported. [ID:nL5E7JI0Q]
 LIBYA, SYRIA
 The oil market is also closely watching developments in
North Africa and the Middle East. In Libya, where around 1.6
million barrels per day (bpd) of crude production has been cut
by a six-month civil war, rebel forces took control of a
refinery and blocked a main highway, further isolating Muammar
Gaddafi's Tripoli stronghold. [ID:nL5E7JI049]
 U.S. President Barack Obama banned U.S. imports of Syrian
oil as part of a wider sanctions effort, and joined the
European Union in calling for President Bashar al-Assad to step
down after a five-month crackdown on protesters.
[ID:nL5E7JI2C8]
 Brent prices are up by almost 13 percent so far in 2011, in
part because of the Libyan outage, but are almost $20 a barrel
below the post-2008 peak they hit back in April as European
refiners scrambled to find alternatives to Libyan supplies.
 ""What was announced today will have a very limited impact
as it doesn't really prevent anyone from outside the U.S.
dealing with Syrian oil,"" said Greg Priddy, global oil analyst
at Eurasia Group in Washington.
 ""With 95 percent of Syrian oil exports going to the EU, you
might see more action there,"" he added.
 Syria produces about 400,000 bpd of oil, exporting most of
about 150,000 bpd to European countries, including the
Netherlands, Italy, France and Spain.
 About 10,000 bpd of Syrian oil products were exported to
the United States in the first five months of 2011, out of
total imports of near 9 million bpd.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Gold edged higher on Thursday
on persistent worries about euro zone debt woes and slower
global growth, defying a rebound in the dollar.	
 The dollar index rose nearly 0.4 percent, after
dropping to a three-week low in the previous session, as the
Swiss franc fell on talks that the Swiss National Bank stepped
up measures to curb the strength of the safe-haven
currency. 
 Investors, disappointed by this week's Franco-German summit
on the lack of an effective solution to the euro zone's debt
crisis and wary of sluggish global growth prospects, continued
to seek security in bullion.	
 Spot gold gained 0.3 percent to $1,793.70 an ounce by
0646 GMT, headed for a fourth session of gains. It was only 1.1
percent below its all-time high of $1,813.79 struck last week.	
 U.S. gold  edged up 0.2 percent to $1,796.80.	
 ""Gold is stabilising in the near term,"" said Ronald Leung, a
physical dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong. 
 ""But low interest rates in the United States and the messy
situation in Europe will push gold higher.""	
 Leung said physical buying was muted as prices advanced
towards the record high, with investors waiting for a price dip.	
 Gold-backed exchange-traded funds continued to draw
interest. Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's
largest gold ETF, rose by 0.72 percent on the day to 1,271.985
tonnes by Aug. 17. 
 The Relative Strength Index on spot gold remained above 70,
which suggests the underlying asset has been overbought,
although it has been in this territory for nearly two weeks.	
 Technical analysis suggested that gold faces resistance at
$1,793 an ounce, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.

 But gold's bull run still has momentum.	
 ""Although profit-taking, margin requirement hikes and
seasonally soft physical demand could temper the rally
intermittently, the external environment has turned increasingly
fertile for gold,"" said Barclays Capital in a research note.	
 Gold's fortunes could be altered in the case of rising real
interest rates, controlled inflation and a stable
macro-environment, it added.	
 Gold demand fell in the second quarter but is expected to
rise in the full year as Asian buyers add to holdings and safe
haven demand grows, said the World Gold Council. 
 Spot silver gained half a percent to $40.36 an ounce,
after closing above $40 for the first time in two weeks in the
previous session. 
 Holdings in the iShares Silver Trust , the world's
largest silver ETF, edged higher to 9,727.10 tonnes by Aug. 17,
the trust said.	
 ""The sentiment in silver is still weak even though prices
are climbing slowly,"" said a Tokyo-based trader.	
 He added that although a gold rally traditionally encourages
silver prices to rise, the poor economic outlook has weighed on
demand prospects of the metal, which has wide industrial
applications.	
 ""The 20-day moving average has been a decent support and the
rising channel seems in place, but it will be difficult for
silver to breach $42 unless gold advances towards $1,850.""	
 Spot platinum held steady at $1,836, after rising for
seven sessions straight.

 By Francis Kan	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Brent crude fell, staying
below $111 a barrel on Thursday as ongoing concerns over
Europe's debt crisis and a firmer dollar drew investors away
from riskier assets like oil and into the safe havens of gold
and the Swiss franc.	
 Brent crude  for October fell 10 cents to $110.50 by
0331 GMT, after settling $1.47 higher at $110.60 a barrel on
Tuesday. U.S. crude  was down 20 cents at $87.38 a barrel,
after closing up nearly a dollar in the previous session.	
 Oil has been under pressure this week after plans from
France and Germany to move toward fiscal union in 2012 failed to
reassure investors worried the region's debt crisis is
spiralling out of control, hitting growth and demand for oil.
Adding to the woes, the Swiss National Bank refrained from
introducing an exchange rate for the franc to cool the currency.	
 ""The market was disappointed when Swiss central bankers
didn't propose a euro peg, it sent a signal that they are
contented to let the franc appreciate and that led to a flight
to safety, away from assets like oil,"" said Gordon Kwan, head of
energy research at Mirae Asset Securities in Hong Kong.	
 The plight of the franc was part of a larger battle over
Europe's fiscal crisis, with the Swiss currency a beneficiary of
investors seeking safety in a currency other than the euro.	
 
 Prices were also depressed by a stronger dollar, which rose
as high as 0.35 percent against a basket of currencies on
Thursday, making dollar-denominated assets more expensive when
purchased in other currencies. 
 However, the dollar, which could hit record lows against the
Swiss franc in days ahead, will likely remain under pressure as
long as the U.S. economic recovery stays tenuous, analysts said.
 
 
 Brent crude  may hover in a range of $109.57-$112.13
per barrel for one trading session, while U.S. oil  is due
for a correction as it failed a strong resistance at $88.17,
Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said. 
 Further weighing on sentiment was government data showing an
unexpected jump in U.S. crude stockpiles, overshadowing a sharp
decline in gasoline inventories. 
 U.S. gasoline stocks fell 3.51 million barrels last week,
the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday,
surpassing analysts expectations for a 1.3 million barrel
drawdown. However, domestic crude inventories unexpectedly rose
4.23 million barrels last week. 
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, contributed to
rising global supply after it pumped 9.813 million barrels a day
(bpd) of crude in June, up about 918,000 bpd from May, while
exports rose to their highest since 2008, official Joint Data
Initiative figures show. 
 ""With Brent trading above $110 barrel, we do not expect any
OPEC members to move to reduce production, given healthy refiner
demand for OPEC crude,"" said analysts at J.P. Morgan in a
research note on Wednesday. 
While debt concerns in Europe and the U.S. hog the headlines,
a hard landing in China remains a key risk for oil demand,
analysts said.	
 ""China demand has been driving the markets since 2008 and
that could be derailed if there is over tightening, although a
hard landing for the economy doesn't look likely,"" said Kwan.

1491,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 17, 2011 11:06PM ET</span>",Gold futures advance in mid-day Asian trade,"Investing.com – Gold futures moved higher in Asian trade for the third straight day Thursday, as rising U.S. producer prices raised concerns of possible heightened inflationary pressures  
  
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for October delivery traded at USD1,792.05 a troy ounce during Asian mid-day trade, rising 0.04%, after hitting the day’s low of USD1,785.35. 
                  
According to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report Wednesday, the producer price inflation index rose by 0.2% in July, after a 0.4% decline the previous month. Market expectations were for a July increase of 0.1%.
 
The core PPI, which does not include food and energy, increased by 0.4% in July, suggesting that lower oil prices have not yet been digested throughout the U.S. economy.
 
Further strengthening demand for safe havens, Tuesday’s meeting between French and German leaders failed to quell concerns that Europe’s sovereign debt crisis is far from over.
 
Meanwhile, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Wednesday he intends to move forward and repatriate as much as USD11 billion in gold reserves held in the U.S. and Europe in order to nationalize the country’s gold holdings.
 
According to Chavez, Venezuela will transfer 99 tons of gold from the Bank of England to the country’s central bank. In addition, Venezuela holds gold at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc, Standard Chartered Plc and the Bank of Nova Scotia.
 
“It’s a healthy decision to bring the gold back to Venezuela,” Chavez said.
 
Elsewhere on the Comex, silver for September delivery fell 0.40% to trade at USD40.26 a troy ounce, while copper for September delivery eased down fractionally 0.01% to trade at USD4.041 a pound.

1493,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 17, 2011 08:43PM ET</span>",Crude oil futures surrender gains in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - Crude oil futures retreated in Asian trade Thursday, getting an earlier spike on reports that U.S. gasoline supplies fell to their lowest level since June of 2009.
 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD87.39 a barrel during early Asian trade, falling 0.27%, after hitting a daily high of USD87.71.
 
A U.S. Energy Information Administration report, released earlier Wednesday, showed a sharp drop in gasoline inventories last week, with supplies falling by 3.5 million barrels, far below economist’s forecasts of a 2 million barrel drop.
 
Crude oil inventories last week, however, rose by 4.2 million barrels, exceeding market expectations of a 0.5 million barrel decline.
 
Commercial crude inventories have been on the rise, as the U.S. government continues to release supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in effort to make up for diminished output from Libya due to ongoing military unrest.
 
Adding to concerns of a slowdown in global energy demand, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that its producer price inflation index rose by 0.2% in July, after a 0.4% decline the previous month. Market expectations were for a July increase of 0.1%.
 
The core PPI, which excludes food and energy costs, increased by 0.4% in July. suggesting that lower oil prices have not yet been digested throughout the U.S. economy and have therefore not had a chance to stimulate demand.
 
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose against its counterparts, with the dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, adding 0.16% to 73.92.
 
Dollar-denominated oil futures tend to fall when the dollar gains, as it makes oil more expensive for buyers in other currencies.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Gold rose on Wednesday on a
combination of increased inflationary pressure and ideas this
week's Franco-German proposals will not solve the euro zone
debt crisis.
 The metals third straight rise came as a report showed U.S.
core producer prices rose at their fastest pace in six months
in July. Also encouraging bullion buying were remarks by
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who said on State television
that he plans to nationalize the gold industry to pad the
country's international reserves.
 Analysts said that bullion is vulnerable for a sharp
pullback following a rally of as much as 4 percent in the last
two sessions.
 ""Gold looks like it's overbought based on various
technical-momentum indicators,"" said Leo Larkin, metals equity
analyst at Standard & Poor's.
 Larkin said that gold could sharply retreat to between
$1,450 and $1,550 in the coming months.
 Spot gold  was up 0.2 percent at $1,789.49 ounce by
3:10 PM EDT (1910 GMT), about $20 off last week's record
$1,813.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$8.80 at $1,793.80 an ounce. Trading volume was lower than
Tuesday's and sharply below last week's pace when the metal
rose to records amid high volatility.
 Silver  was up 1.2 percent at $40.34 an ounce.

 The U.S. Labor Department said its seasonally adjusted
index for prices paid at the farm and factory gate, excluding
food and energy, or core PPI, rose 0.4 percent -- the largest
increase since January. [ID:nN1E77G0BN]
 ""The recent U.S. PPI and price data elsewhere are clear
indications that inflation is tracking higher, which certainly
is another plus for the gold market,"" said Bill O'Neill,
partner of commodity investment firm LOGIC Advisors.
 Market anxiety supported safe-haven bids after
Franco-German proposals to boost fiscal convergence in the euro
zone got a cool response from other member states and failed to
convince investors the bloc's debt crisis was closer to being
solved.
 Analysts, however, said that gold is due for a pullback
after prices surged around $300 in the past 1.5 months.
 The relative strength index shows that, technically,
bullion is well into the overbought territory, and the metal
appears to be forming a climax top on weekly charts, suggested
a correction is possible.
 VENEZUELAN GOLD NATIONALIZATION
 Bullion's response was limited after Venezuela's President
Hugo Chavez said he plans to nationalize the country's gold
sector, including extraction and processing, and use the output
to boost the country's international reserves. [ID:nN1E77G0WN]
 ""I don't think that's new news. For some time, he has been
nationalizing a whole host of industries...I don't think
there's a lot of gold reserves in Venezuela,"" said S&P's
Larkin.
 Even though Venezuela has some of Latin America's largest
gold deposits in its south, the country's annual gold output is
equivalent to 0.2 percent of global world bullion production.
 The gold market has largely ignored market fundamentals as
bullion has been driven by strong investment demand amid stock
market turmoil and worries over U.S. and European debt levels.
 Among platinum group metals, platinum  was up 1.2
percent at $1,832.74 an ounce, supported by inflows into ETFs

 NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Crude oil rebounded on
Wednesday on a sharp decline in U.S. gasoline stocks, but
persistent worries about economic growth curbed gains.
 Prices rose in early trade to near two-week highs, lifted
by initial gains on Wall Street and a late Tuesday report by
American Petroleum Institute showing a steep drop in domestic
gasoline inventories last week. [API/S]
 Later, the market pared gains when the U.S. Energy
Information Administration confirmed the gasoline drawdown. EIA
data also showed a steep build in crude stockpiles, capping the
day's rally. [EIA/S]
 A downturn on U.S. equities in New York also weighed on
prices, as sentiment wavered after pushing higher on strong
earnings. [.N] Worries about the euro zone debt crisis and
mixed U.S. economic data have kept investors cautious for much
of August.
 In London, ICE Brent for October delivery  settled
$1.47 higher at $110.60 a barrel, having traded as high as
$111.74, the steepest hike since Aug. 4. It slipped to $98.74
on Aug. 9, the lowest since February, on concern about an
economic slowdown.
 U.S. crude for September delivery  closed at $87.58,
gaining 93 cents, after pushing to a session high of $89, also
the highest since Aug. 4.
 Brent's premium against the U.S. October crude contract
 closed at $22.87, widening from $22.29 on Tuesday. The
WTI/Brent spread hit a record $26.08 on Aug. 9.
 ""The Brent market reestablished an upside leadership role
today with the October contract making its debut as spot
month,"" said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch &
Associates in Galena, Illinois.
 ""Despite reports that Saudi production popped by more than
10 percent in June to 9.8 million barrels per day, the major
global crude benchmarks are showing signs of tightening with
Libya and Cushing providing primary catalysts in this regard,""
Ritterbusch added.
 Saudi Arabia produced 9.8 million bpd in June, rising more
than 900,000 from May, while exports rose to their highest
level since the financial crisis hit demand in 2008, data from
the Joint Data Initiative showed. [ID:nL5E7JHIKM]
 Improved risk sentiment pushed the Relative Strength Index
of U.S. crude to 43.96 percent, after dipping to 41.25 on
Tuesday. Recent buying has lifted the index from the 20.16 low
hit on Aug. 9, well below the 30 level that signifies oversold
conditions.
 In London, ICE Brent's RSI also improved to more than 48,
from 44.38 on Tuesday.
 GASOLINE DRAWDOWN LIFTS, EURO ZONE WORRY DRAGS
 U.S. gasoline stockpiles shrank 3.5 million barrels last
week, data from the U.S. Information Administration showed. The
drawdown was more than the forecast for a 1.3 million barrel
drawdown in a Reuters poll.
 That overshadowed an unexpected 4.2 million barrel rise in
U.S. commercial crude oil inventories, which was against the
forecast for a drawdown of 800,000 barrels. However, stocks
the key Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell nearly 900,000
barrels to 33.7 million barrels, their lowest level since
mid-November.
 Commercial crude stocks rose as the U.S. government
continued releasing supplies from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, part of a coordinated effort with members of the
International Energy Agency to cover barrels lost due to
fighting in Libya.
 A drop in refinery utilization and higher imports further
contributed to higher crude stocks, EIA data showed.
 A meeting between the French and German leaders on Tuesday
did not calm investor concern about Europe's sovereign debt
problems and some analysts said the worries could again prove a
drag on oil prices.

 LONDON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose on Wednesday
towards $110 a barrel after an industry report showed a
larger-than-expected decline in U.S. gasoline supplies and
upbeat economic data trumped concerns over the euro zone debt
crisis.	
 A meeting between French and German leaders on Tuesday did
not calm investor concern about Europe's sovereign debt
problems. Even so, better-than-expected U.S. industrial
production figures helped bolster sentiment. 
 Brent crude  for October rose 75 cents to $109.88 by
0832 GMT. It fell to $98.74 on Aug. 9, the lowest since
February, on concern about economic slowdown. U.S. crude 
was up 59 cents at $87.24 a barrel.	
 ""Oil has steadily, if not slowly recovered from its risk
aversion mode plunge that also took down equity markets,"" said
Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP
Paribas.	
 ""Increasingly, oil will look again at its own drivers. As
such this morning, the market is likely re-assured that we are
not accumulating gasoline inventories in the U.S., given the
steep draws reported yesterday evening by the API."" 
 U.S. stockpiles of gasoline fell 5.4 million barrels in the
week to Aug. 12, which was more than forecast, industry group
the American Petroleum Institute (API) said on Tuesday. 
 ""We will be looking to see if that number is confirmed in
the EIA release this afternoon,"" Tchilinguirian said.	
 Crude inventories will also be a focus, after the API said
they rose by 1.75 million barrels. The U.S. government's Energy
Information Administration releases its supply report at 1430
GMT. 
 European stocks turned flat after a fall in early trade,
following on from losses in Asia. Gold, attractive to some
investors as a safe haven, held steady near a record high.

 
 Barclays Capital technical analysts said the near-term Brent
outlook was bullish with the contract trading above the 200-day
moving average, while U.S. oil was set to push towards $90 where
it expected selling interest to cap the rally.	
 Concerns about the European debt crisis have weighed on oil
markets in recent weeks, adding to worries about weak U.S.
economic data that could hit fuel demand.	
 The euro zone economy slowed sharply in the second quarter,
hobbled by sluggish growth in Germany and stagnation in France,
raising fears of a longer-term dip. 
 Oil has gained support this year from the conflict in Libya
which has shut down fields that once pumped 1.6 million barrels
per day (bpd). The loss has bolstered Brent in particular as
most of Libya's oil was priced against it.	
 Much of Libya's output could be restored within months if
peace can be established, industry executives and analysts say.
Rebels fighting to topple Muammar Gaddafi denied reports of
secret talks with the Libyan leader on Tuesday.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Gold held steady near a record
high on Wednesday after a Franco-German summit failed to
convince investors that the euro zone debt crisis would be
solved effectively, supporting safe-haven demand for bullion.	
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel unveiled far-reaching plans for closer euro zone
integration, but stopped short of increasing the bloc's rescue
fund and said joint euro bonds may be a long-term solution.

 Adding to investors' anxiety, the euro zone economy slowed
sharply in the second quarter, hobbled by sluggish growth in
Germany and stagnation in France. 
 ""People are uncomfortable with what's happening in Europe
and the United States,"" said Dick Poon, manager of precious
metals at Heraeus in Hong Kong.	
 He added that strong investment demand has helped gold bar
premiums in Hong Kong remain steady at 50 cents to $1 an ounce
above spot prices, in line with reports from dealers in other
parts of Asia on muted scrap selling and resilient investment
interest despite high prices.	
 Spot gold was little changed at $1,787.80 an ounce by
0658 GMT. It was just 1.4 percent below the record high above
$1,813 struck last week.	
 U.S. gold  inched up 0.3 percent to $1,790.70.	
 The short-term gold technical outlook suggested that gold
could pull back to $1,772 an ounce, said Reuters market analyst
Wang Tao. 
 
 U.S. industrial output recorded its best gain in seven
months in July, and home building last month recorded a
smaller-than-expected decline, easing fears of a contracting
economy. 
 But the world's largest economy is not out of the woods yet,
and the Federal Reserve has pledged to keep interest rates near
zero at least through 2012, which would benefit gold.	
 ""The gold market's strength may be due to a continued focus
on events in the economy and the likelihood that low interest
rates remain a dominant theme,"" said MF Global in a research
note.	
 Holdings of the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest
gold-backed exchange-traded fund, edged up 0.2 percent from a
day earlier to 1,262.899 tonnes by Aug. 16. 
 This came after regulatory disclosure showed that large
hedge funds in the United States had held onto their gold bets
in the second quarter. 
 Spot platinum gained 0.2 percent to $1,815.75 an
ounce, on its way to a seventh session of gains as a dip in its
relative value versus gold triggered buying interest.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Brent crude rose on Wednesday,
staying above $109 a barrel as a larger-than-expected drawdown
in U.S gasoline stocks last week trumped ongoing concerns over
the euro zone debt crisis.	
 Brent crude  for October rose as much as $109.62 a
barrel, and traded 30 cents higher at $109.43 by 0328 GMT. U.S.
crude  was up 48 cents at $87.13 a barrel, after slipping
$1.23 to settle at $86.65.	
 In Europe, a meeting between French and German leaders
didn't result in any concrete measures to try and find a way out
of the region's sovereign debt problems and restore investor
confidence. Participants are worried the crisis would spread
globally, hitting demand for oil and other commodities. 
 
 ""The API numbers were quite supportive as gasoline supplies
have come down, but risks continue to be on the economic front,""
said Victor Shum, an analyst with energy consultancy Purvin and
Gertz. ""The meeting between Sarkozy and Merkel didn't amount to
too much and that will cap gains in oil futures."" 
 U.S. stockpiles of gasoline fell 5.4 million barrels in the
week to Aug. 12, well above analyst expectations for a 1.3
million barrel draw, data from the American Petroleum Institute
(API) showed on Tuesday. The U.S. Department of Energy
will release the inventory data later today. 
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel proposed a tax on financial transactions and
closer joint governance of economic policy, but did not propose
increasing the euro zone bailout fund or selling euro zone
bonds.	
 
 Asian shares fell on Wednesday and the euro wobbled after
the disappointing meeting, while the safe haven asset gold held
steady near a record high. 
 
 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK	
 Concerns about the debt crisis have weighed on oil markets
in recent weeks, adding to worries about weak U.S. economic data
that could hit fuel demand.	
 The euro zone economy slowed sharply in the second quarter,
hobbled by sluggish growth in Germany and stagnation in France,
raising fears of a longer-term dip. 
 There was more upbeat data out of the U.S., with industrial
output at the world's top oil consumer recording its best gain
in seven months in July. 
 Brent crude may end its rebound at around $109.57 a barrel,
while U.S. oil  is unlikely to reach $90 per barrel as it
faces a strong resistance at $88.17, Reuters technical analyst
Wang Tao said. 
 The conflict in Libya and Syria could further disrupt
supplies and support oil prices, analysts said.	
 ""The scale of disruption to Syrian oil production remains
unclear, but Syria is reportedly importing gasoline from
companies operating in the Mediterranean despite the existing
sanctions,"" said analysts at J.P. Morgan in a report on Tuesday.	
 ""As highlighted by recent statements by the US, even tougher
sanctions may be required to limit Syria's ability to
participate in the oil market."" 
 Syrian tanks fired on low-income Sunni Muslim districts in
the port city of Latakia on Tuesday, the fourth day of an
assault which has killed 36 people and forced thousands of
Palestinian refugees to flee, activists said on Tuesday.

1507,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 16, 2011 08:23PM ET</span>",Crude oil futures edge higher in early Asian trade,"Investing.com - Crude oil futures eked out marginal gains in Asian trade Tuesday, following a meeting between German and French leaders where talks failed to inspire the market on prospects for a turnaround in global energy demand.
 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD87.35 a barrel during early Asian trade, advancing 0.23%, after hitting a daily low of USD87.12.
 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy met in Paris earlier in the day, on details for a rescue fund for debt-threatened euro-zone members.
 
But specific details on the expansion of the USD633 billion fund failed to materialize and the leaders of Europe’s two biggest economies concentrated instead on new proposals for budget tightening in the region, as well as the establishment of a euro-zone council to coordinate belt-tightening among the 17 member nations.
 
Eurostat reported Tuesday that EU gross domestic product grew just 0.2% in the second quarter, under the 0.3% expected from the market.
 
And German GDP showed a scant 0.1% expansion in the second quarter, below forecasts of a 0.5% gain, and considerably lower than the previous quarter’s growth of 1.3%.
 
A rise in U.S. industrial production in July, however, helped to provide support for oil futures as the world’s largest energy consumer reported that industrial production had risen 0.9% for the month, outstripping analyst’s predictions of 0.5% gain. 
 
The U.S. industrial production figure measures the change in total outputs of the manufacturing, mining, electric and gas industries.
 
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose against its counterparts, with the dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, adding 0.24% to 74.22.
 
Dollar-denominated oil futures tend to fall when the dollar gains, as it makes oil more expensive for buyers in other currencies.
 
On the ICE Futures Exchange Brent oil futures for October delivery fell 0.03% to trade at USD109.33. 
 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration was scheduled to release weekly figures Wednesday for gasoline and crude oil inventories.

 LONDON/NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices fell
on Tuesday after a meeting between French and German leaders
failed to ease concerns about the euro zone debt crisis.

Angela Merkel proposed a tax on financial transactions and
closer joint governance of economic policy, but did not propose
increasing the euro zone bailout fund or selling euro zone

 Concerns about the debt crisis have weighed on oil markets
in recent weeks, adding to worries about weak U.S. economic
data that could hit fuel demand.
 ""It doesn't look like the two biggest items were seriously
discussed today -- the potential for a euro bond and the size
of the stabilization/bailout fund,"" said Edward Meir, senior
commodity analyst for MF Global in New York.
 Crude prices dropped before the meeting as data showed
sluggish German growth hobbled the euro zone, dragging down
U.S. stocks. The euro slid against the dollar. [USD/]
 September Brent crude futures  fell 44 cents to
settle at $109.47 a barrel in thin trading ahead of the
contract's expiry later on Tuesday. The more heavily traded
October contract gave up 71 cents to settle at $109.13.
 U.S. crude  traded down $1.23 to settle at $86.65 a
barrel, before paring losses to trade at $87.26 in
post-settlement activity after data from the American Petroleum
showed a steep drop in gasoline inventories last week.
 U.S. stockpiles of gasoline fell by 5.4 million barrels in
the week to Aug. 12, well above analyst expectations for a 1.3
million barrel drawdown. Crude oil inventories rose by 1.7
million barrels, while stockpiles at Cushing dropped by 1.4
million barrels.

 In late afternoon trade in New York, Brent crude trading
volumes were 21 percent below the 30-day moving average while
U.S. crude trading volumes were closer to average levels.
 Volumes had surged during the first two weeks of August,
rising as worries about the U.S. debt ceiling, the debt crisis
and a rash of weak economic data drove up trade after a quiet
July.
 ""It is still vacation, and we will likely remain
range-bound over the next two weeks,"" said Richard Ilczyszyn,
senior market strategist at MF Global in Chicago. ""Once we have
a direction for crude, we will see big money come back in.""
 High fuel prices and concerns about the economy have hit
demand in consumer nations, with MasterCard reporting U.S.
gasoline demand fell 4.6 percent last week compared with
year-ago levels, the biggest decline since February 2010.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose 1
percent Tuesday as investors turned to the safe haven after
comments by the leaders of France and Germany about closer euro
zone integration and deficit limits failed to ease worries
about that region's debt problems.
 Sluggish German growth data added to recession fears and as
well as to gold's appeal.
 Bullion extended gains on renewed fears about a European
debt crisis after French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German
Chancellor Angela Merkel stopped short of increasing the euro
zone rescue fund but vowed to defend the single currency.
 Gold had already benefited from a flight to safety as
global equity markets were trading sharply lower after data
showed Germany's gross domestic product expanded just 0.1
percent from April to June versus the previous quarter.
 Some analysts said that the metal was highly overbought and
long due for a pullback after it gained as much as 13 percent
in the last 15 days.
 ""At the end of the day, it (Sarkozy-Merkel news) is going
to put worries back into the market about the euro and euro
zone that may have been quieting down. It's going to add
additional volatility into the gold market,"" said Frank McGhee,
head precious metals trader at Integrated Brokerage Services
LLC.
 McGhee said that the Franco-German plan is likely to
sharply weaken the euro before any significant achievements.
 Spot gold  was up 1.1 percent at $1,784.99 an ounce
by 3:34 PM EDT (1934 GMT), just $30 below a record $1,813.79
set on Thursday. It is up 25 percent this year driven by
worries over U.S. and euro zone debt levels.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$27 at $1,785 an ounce. Trading volume totaled 160,000 lots,
higher than Monday but sharply slower than the last week's pace
when the metal rose to records amid high volatility.

 Gold was also underpinned as Wall Street remained lower
even as rating agency Fitch affirmed its triple-A rating on the
United States, in blatant disagreement with rival Standard &
Poor's.
 However, market watchers said that gold is vulnerable for a
severe pullback after the metal has rallied nearly $300 in the
last 1.5 months.
 ""There is little doubt in my mind that gold is at a bubble
which means that it will burst at any time,"" said Erik
Davidson, deputy chief investment officer for Wells Fargo
Private Bank, which has $210 billion assets under management.
 Davidson said he compared gold's rally to the recent U.S.
housing and technology stock bubbles. He added that gold's
correction could easily be at least 30 percent.
 PAULSON STAYS PUT WITH GOLD
 Buying sentiment also improved on news the largest gold
fund players, including hedge fund titan John Paulson, stuck
with their bullion bets in the second quarter, opting not to
follow George Soros who further reduced his gold ETF holdings.
[ID:nN1E77E1TB]
 Famed gold bull Paulson held his ground with his $4.6
billion stake in the large gold exchange-traded fund SPDR Gold
Trust in the second quarter, according to 13-F filings with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that provide the best
insight into where hedge funds are placing their bets.
 Soros, who dumped almost his entire $800 million stake in
bullion in the first quarter, further reduced his investment in
SPDR Gold Trust  by 13 percent to just over $6 million.
 Among other precious metals, silver  was up 0.5
percent at $40.05 an ounce. Platinum  was up 0.6 percent
at $1,813.50 an ounce, while palladium  was up 1.3
percent at $754.22 an ounce.

 By Zaida Espana	
 LONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Brent crude futures fell on
Tuesday, after rising nearly $2 a day earlier, as worries about
global economic growth and a stronger dollar tempered appetite
for risky assets.	
 The focus remained on the euro zone crisis ahead of a key
meeting between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German
Chancellor Angela Merkel on the future of the embattled single
currency area. 
 September Brent crude futures  were $1.40 lower
at$108.51 by 0856 GMT. U.S. crude  fell by $1.24 to $86.64
by the same time.	
 ""All eyes are on this European meeting today, so it's going
to be rather choppy and volatile ahead of that,"" GFT Global
market strategist David Morrison said. ""(Oil is) reacting to the
weakness in the euro, the strength in the dollar, and there is a
general risk off mode: nothing fundamental, just traders taking
money off the table.""	
 Manufacturing in the New York area contracted for the third
straight month in August, data showed on Monday, tempering any
lingering hopes for a rebound in the second half of the year. 
 The survey is one of the earliest regional guideposts to
U.S. factory conditions and analysts said it boded poorly for
the larger national survey due at the beginning of September.

 Worries about the faltering economic recovery also gained
prominence after data from Europe's powerhouse Germany showed
gross domestic product growth slowed more than expected in the
second quarter. 
 ""The overall feeling looking at the Germany data is that the
outlook for global growth doesn't look particularly good, in
which case the upside to oil is capped into the medium term,""
Morrison added.	
 Oil prices were also pushed lower by a stronger dollar,
which makes commodities priced in the greenback more expensive
for holders of other currencies. 
 The U.S. dollar strengthened, up 0.43 percent against a
basket of currencies by 0832 GMT. The greenback had
fallen to a near three-week low against the euro on Monday.	
 VTB Capital analyst Andrey Kryuchenkov said Brent prices
continued to trade in parallel with the UK blue chip index
performance.	
 ""Brent's monthly rolling correlation to the FTSE 100 index
remained at a more than one-year high, near 95%, with intraday
direction still dictated mostly by the equity markets at the
moment"", he wrote in a note. 
 
 The market will be watching for a slew of U.S. economic
reports that come out this week, including housing starts and
industrial production data later on Tuesday, for clues on the
health of the world's biggest economy.	
 Concerns over the U.S. recovery and the ongoing euro zone
crisis have dragged down oil prices this month. Brent surged on
Monday as hopes for a resolution to Europe's issues rose ahead
of a Tuesday meeting between French and German politicians.	
 While the risk of a new U.S. recession has risen over the
last couple of months, an outright contraction will most likely
be avoided, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis
Lockhart said on Monday. [ID: 
 The World Bank also called for national governments to seek
long-term debt curbs on Tuesday to solve the current sovereign
debt crises in Europe and the United States, but said it was too
early for special action by the Group of 20 nations.

 
 SUPPLY CONCERNS	
 The shutdown of a North Sea oil well at a Royal Dutch Shell
Plc  field after an oil leak looks unlikely to affect
supplies significantly from the home of the Brent oil benchmark,
oil traders said on Monday. 
 In the United States, crude oil stock piles are expected to
have fallen for a second straight week due to lower imports, a
preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday ahead of weekly
inventory data. 
 Supply disruptions caused by the ongoing fighting in Libya
should continue to underpin prices, despite the worries on the
macro-economic front.	
 Forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi will destroy the oil
terminal in Brega to prevent one of the country's most important
economic lifelines falling into the hands of advancing rebels,
the fighters said on Monday. 
 ""We continue to believe that the return of Libyan crude
supplies to the market will be seen in 2012 and as such any
sell-off associated with headlines of a regime change in the
country provide consumers with a good hedging opportunity,"" said
analysts at J.P. Morgan in a report on Monday.	
 In Syria, where a five-month-long street uprising against
President Bashar al-Assad's autocratic rule has so far had
little impact on the country's 400,000 barrels per day oil
production, the military broadened its assault over the weekend
to try to put down the protests.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Brent crude futures edged down
on Tuesday, after rising nearly $2 a day earlier, as soft U.S.
economic data renewed fears of weaker oil demand from the
world's top oil consumer and a rebound in the dollar spurred
selling.	
 Brent crude  for September fell 65 cents to $109.26
by 0550 GMT. U.S. crude  was down 62 cents at $87.26 a
barrel.	
 Manufacturing in the New York area contracted for the third
straight month in August, data showed on Monday, tempering any
lingering hopes for a rebound in the second half of the year. 
 The survey is one of the earliest regional guideposts to
U.S. factory conditions and analysts said it boded poorly for
the larger national survey due at the beginning of September.

 Separate U.S. data on Monday showed the housing sector
remained weak with a gauge of homebuilder sentiment stuck at
historic lows.	
 ""The manufacturing data took quite a hit, and that could
account for the weakness,"" said Ben Le Brun, CMC Markets analyst
in Sydney.	
 ""But it seems fears of the worst case scenario for the
global economy have receded. We're going to see weaker growth,
but growth nonetheless."" 
 Oil prices were also pushed lower by a stronger dollar,
which makes commodities priced in the greenback more expensive
for holders of other currencies. 
 The U.S. dollar was trading up 0.18 percent against a basket
of currencies . The greenback had fallen to a near
three-week low against the euro on Monday.

 Brent could move up to $111.30 a barrel after a shallow
retracement to $108.20, while a rebound for U.S. oil 
seems to be stronger than expected and it may continue to zigzag
up towards $90 per barrel, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao
said.

 Oil prices remain supported by the loss of around 1.6
million barrels per day of production in Libya since the start
of an uprising in February.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Spot gold held onto gains made
in the previous session on Tuesday, but hopes that a
Franco-German summit will make progress to help quell the
region's sovereign debt crisis are expected to keep a lid on
prices.	
 French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel meet in Paris from 1400 GMT to discuss what
measures they can take to contain Europe's debt crisis, which is
now spreading to the continent's core. A joint news conference
is due at 1600 GMT. 
 ""There seems to be quite a bit of optimism before the
meeting which has sent the euro to a three-week high to the
dollar,"" said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures.	
 ""So long as investors remain optimistic, chances are gold
will trade a bit lower.""	
 Leaders could potentially explore the issues such as
expanding the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) or issue
joint euro bonds, but any speedy agreement will be unlikely as
Merkel is under pressure from home to resist these measures, Ong
added.	
 Spot gold was little changed at $1,766.39 an ounce by
0650 GMT, after rising 1 percent in the previous session.	
 U.S. gold  gained 0.6 percent to $1,769.10.	
 Technical analysis echoed the sentiment in the market, and
suggested gold could retrace to $1,750 an ounce, said Reuters
market analyst Wang Tao. 
 The euro eased from the previous day's three-week high, with
the focus on whether a Franco-German summit will lay the
groundwork for further measures to help quell the euro zone's
sovereign debt crisis. 
 
 Southeast Asia's physical gold market took a breather from
the buying frenzy on Monday when prices saw an intraday drop of
1 percent, dealers said.	
 ""I was overwhelmed with physical demand out of Indonesia and
Thailand, but it has cooled off a bit today,"" said a
Singapore-based dealer, adding that there was some light demand
from Vietnam after the country approved 5 tonnes of gold imports
last week. 
 Traders and analysts expected gold to weaken in the short
term after a strong rally in July pushed bullion to consecutive
record highs, which would provide investors a more attractive
entry point.	
 Gold's longer-term allure remains untarnished, as global
growth outlook continues to be cloudy and a low-interest rate
environment will keep investors interested in gold.	
 The largest gold fund players including hedge fund titan
John Paulson stuck with their bullion bets in the second
quarter, opting not to follow George Soros who further reduced
his gold ETF holdings. 
 Holdings of the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest
gold-backed exchange-traded fund, stood at 1,260.173 tonnes by
Aug. 15, unchanged from Friday, off a one-year high of 1,309.922
tonnes hit last week. 
 Spot platinum gained 0.6 percent to $1,814.35, on
course for its sixth consecutive session of gains, its best run
since January. It hit a two-month high of $1,820.75 earlier.

1523,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 15, 2011 08:30PM ET</span>",Crude oil futures regain momentum in Asian trade,"Investing.com - Crude oil futures surged in early Asian trade Monday, rebounding from an earlier drop following the release of data showing weakness in U.S. manufacturing production. 
 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange light, sweet crude futures for October delivery traded at USD87.69 a barrel during early Asian trade, advancing 2.3%, after hitting a daily low of USD84.70.
 
New York’s Federal Reserve Bank reported Monday that its index of manufacturing conditions worsened in August, falling 3.9 points to minus 7.7, following a minus 3.8 figure in July.
 
The Empire State manufacturing index, which measures economic health in the manufacturing sector by surveying about 200 manufacturers in New York State, was forecast to improve slightly from July to minus 0.4.
 
But encouraging news from Japan helped to reverse losses in oil, as the world’s third largest economy reported its gross domestic product fell by 0.3% in the April to June quarter, from minus 0.9 the previous quarter. Although Japan’s GDP remained in negative territory, the quarterly figure was well below market expectations of a 0.6% fall.
 
The Japanese economy contracted by 3.6% in the January to March quarter, the period during which the country was hit by a devastating earthquake and tsunamis. Japan is the world’s third largest energy consumer after the United States and China.
 
Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell estimated that more than 54,000 gallons of oil had spilled into the North Sea from one of the company’s oil rigs near Scotland’s eastern coast. Shell co-owns the facility with Esso, a subsidiary of U.S. oil company Exxon Mobil.
 
While Shell said it was unclear at what point last week the leak had begun, the company said it was under control. The British government said the mishap was limited in scope compared to the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico last year, which resulted in over 200 million gallons of oil being dumped into the ocean.
 
On the ICE Futures Exchange Brent oil futures for October delivery added 1.84% to trade at USD109.59. 
 
Global financial service provider Barclays earlier maintained its forecast that Brent oil will average USD110 a barrel in the third quarter of 2011.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Gold rose 1 percent on
Monday, as a drop in the dollar and sharp gains in crude oil
and grains lifted bullion ahead of Tuesday's French-German
meeting to discuss the euro debt crisis.
 The gains also preceded U.S. regulatory filings that will
show changes in gold hedge funds' positions.
 Gold reversed initial losses but volume was muted as Wall
Street rose for a third straight session on news of U.S.
mergers and hopes that French and German politicians meeting in
Paris on Tuesday can restore some confidence in the battered
euro credit markets. [ID:nLDE77E0BE]
 A nearly $3 jump in crude oil and a contract high in corn
futures amid better risk appetite also boosted bullion's
inflation hedge appeal. The metal is around $50 below a record
$1,813.79 an ounce set on Thursday, as global equity markets
continued to recover from recent steep decline.
 Some analysts said that the metal was long due for a
pullback, after it gained as much as 13 percent in the last 12
sessions.
 ""I am always worried about a market that appears to have no
downside potential,"" said Sean McGillivray, head of asset
allocation of Great Pacific Wealth Management.
 ""Gold is going to have a bid under it, but trading in the
$1,600 area would be a much better buying opportunity for a run
and a retest of $1,800.""
 Spot gold  was up 0.9 percent at $1,761.24 an ounce
by 3:02 p.m. EDT (1902 GMT). It notched a gain of nearly 5
percent last week, its biggest weekly gain since early
November, while the S&P fell for a third straight week.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$15.4 an ounce at $1,758. COMEX gold futures volume was at
120,000 lots, sharply lower than last week's pace when bullion
rallied to record highs.
 Silver  was up 1.6 percent at $39.61 an ounce. Data
showed holdings of the world's largest silver-backed ETF, the
iShares Silver Trust , dropped 0.7 percent to 9705.90
tonnes on Friday.

 ""At this point, people are just looking for the next move.
If you are not long already, I don't see any point getting into
the market at these levels as gold appears to be waiting for a
pullback and reestablish a little lower,"" said Fred
Schoenstein, metals trader at Heraeus Precious Metals
Management.
 The gold market is awaiting U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) filings on Monday that will show changes in
investment holdings by hedge funds and institutional investors
in the second quarter. All eyes will be on John Paulson, the
biggest holder of the SPDR Gold Trust.
 Paulson's flagship fund performed poorly in July. As of
early August, his Paulson Advantage Plus fund is down 21.6
percent for the year, sources familiar with the firm said.
Paulson's Gold Fund, however, is up 2.5 percent for the year.
[ID:nN1E7731FP]
 Some analysts said the billionaire financier could have
liquidated his positions in SPDR Gold Trust to cover losses.
 ""I wouldn't be shocked if you had some folks especially in
the hedge fund side took profits and reduced gold positions
(during Q2). But they might be putting those back on with the
thought that the Fed will continue to keep their monetary
policy intact for the next few years,"" said McGillivray.
 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF GOLD STANDARD END
 Gold also has been supported by the prospect that Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke may announce a third round of
quantitative easing during a global central banker meeting in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming, late this month.
 Monday marks the 40th anniversary of the end of the Gold
Standard in place since the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944.
 Some gold advocates suggested that bringing back the
dollar-bullion peg could lessen the threat of inflation and
currency volatility. However, most economists said that such a
move, equivalent to the elimination of central banks' monetary
tools, would have catastrophic consequences for global growth.
 A 1-percent drop of the dollar against a basket of major
currencies, and speculation the Swiss National Bank could
further intervene also boosted gold's appeal as an alternative
currency.
 Among other precious metals, platinum  was little
changed at $1,794.24 an ounce, while spot palladium  was
up 0.4 percent at $746 an ounce.

 By David Sheppard
 NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Oil rose almost $2 a barrel on
Monday, supported by optimism that European leaders will come
up with solutions to the region's debt crisis and by broader
gains in global markets.
 Concerns about the euro zone crisis, along with a raft of
poor U.S. economic data, have dragged down oil prices this
month. Hopes for a resolution to Europe's issues rose ahead of
a Tuesday meeting between French and German politicians.
 The optimism spread throughout markets with U.S. stocks up
roughly 2 percent, helping offset weak U.S. manufacturing and
home builder sentiment data. [.N] The dollar weakened as
investors sought riskier assets. [USD/]
 ""It does look as if not only our (U.S.) debt problem but
also the European problem and some of the fears that drove
(U.S. oil down) to $75 a barrel have receded,"" said Gene
McGillian, analyst for Tradition Energy in Stamford,
Connecticut.
 ""Whether or not this is a temporary reprieve remains to be
seen.""
 Brent crude futures  for September rose $1.88 to
settle at $109.91 a barrel, having dipped to $107.40 earlier in
the session. U.S. crude  traded up $2.50 to settle at
$87.88 a barrel.
 Both crude benchmarks recorded their third straight weekly
loss in volatile trading last week. A downgrade of U.S. credit
worthiness by ratings agency Standard & Poor's and fears that
France might suffer the same fate sparked selling this month.
 Trade volume was light in New York on Monday, with U.S.
crude turnover at the lowest so far in August as of 4:45 p.m.
EDT (2045 GMT), 22 percent below the 30-day average. Brent
trade was about 7 percent below its 30-day average.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 Prices took support from a rebound in global stock markets
after last week's heavy losses, with data showing Japan's
economy shrank less than anticipated in the second quarter
following the devastating earthquake and tsunami in March.
 Gains were kept in check, however, by signs of ongoing
weakness in manufacturing in the United States, with the sector
contracting in New York state for the third month in a row.
 The survey of New York state manufacturing plants is one of
the earliest regional guideposts to U.S. factory conditions and
analysts said it boded poorly for the larger national survey
due at the beginning of September. [ID:nN1E77E0EK]
 SUPPLY THREATS
 Brent prices are around $18 a barrel, or 15 percent, below
the post-2008 high they hit in April of $127.02, as the
market's focus has shifted from supply disruptions in Libya to
concerns about the health of the global economy.
 But prices remain supported by the loss of around 1.6
million barrels per day of production in the North African
country since the start of an uprising against 41 years of
Muammar Gaddafi's rule in February.
 A dramatic advance on Saturday won rebels control of the
town of Zawiyah, 50 km (30 miles) west of Tripoli on the coast,
enabling them to halt food and fuel supplies from Tunisia.
 Unidentified envoys of Gaddafi's government were reported
to have held talks with rebels at a Tunisian island hotel on
Sunday, on a possible resolution of the six-month-old civil
war.
 Rebel forces warned, however, of a ""scorched earth"" policy
by Gaddafi's forces on the eastern front at the oil terminal in
Brega and said they believed Gaddafi's forces had already
sabotaged two large crude tanks over the weekend.
 ""We could be making $35 million a day from Brega port in
exports of oil,"" the rebels' military spokesman, Ahmed Bani,
told Reuters during a visit by reporters to the battle-scarred
section of the town the rebels hold.
 ""Because of that, Gaddafi will destroy it. Scorched earth.
We know his mentality,"" Bani said. [ID:nLDE77E0Q5]
 In Syria, where a five-month-long street uprising against
President Bashar al-Assad's autocratic rule has so far had
little impact on oil production, the military broadened its
assault over the weekend to try to put down the protests.
 Reports that Syrian forces shelled residential districts in
the city of Latakia, after assaults on Hama and the eastern
city of Deir al-Zor, have been met with increasing
international condemnation.
 The United States wants Europe and China to consider
sanctions on Syria's oil industry, a key source of hard
currency for the government. [ID:nL5E7JF0YE]
 Syria produces about 400,000 barrels of oil a day,
exporting about 150,000 barrels per day to European countries
including the Netherlands, Italy, France and Spain.

 By Francis Kan	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Brent crude futures rose on
Monday, as investors bought into riskier assets after positive
economic data from the U.S. and Japan helped ease panic in
financial markets.	
 Asian equities followed Wall Street higher and safe-haven
assets like gold and the Swiss franc fell as market players
cautiously returned to pick up bargains after last's week wild
ride. 
 U.S. retail sales posted their biggest gains in three months
in July, although this was partly overshadowed by a slump in
consumer confidence, a report on Friday showed. 
 In Japan, the economy shrank much less than expected in the
second quarter as companies made strides in restoring output
after the devastating earthquake in March, the government said
on Monday. 
 Brent crude  for September rose 25 cents to $108.28
by 0345 GMT, after falling to $108.00 earlier. U.S. crude 
was up 11 cents $85.49 a barrel.	
 ""At these levels, oil looks cheap and we could see some
buying activity. A lot of the bad news has been priced in and
there is an expectation that the weakness cannot be sustained,""
said Ben Westmore, a commodities analyst at National Australia
Bank.	
 Both benchmarks recorded their third straight weekly loss in
volatile trading last week, as a downgrade of U.S. credit
worthiness by ratings agency Standard & Poor's and fears that
France might suffer the same fate sparked off heavy selling.	
 While weak data out of the U.S. or Europe this week could
send prices spiralling again, the bar for disappointment has
been set much higher after last week's turmoil, Westmore said.	
 In the longer-term, economists worry that as a U.S. economic
rebound stalls and threatens to spiral into recession, oil
demand in the world's top consumer may be slipping into an
irreversible decline. 
 
 Brent oil  is expected to retrace to $104.43 per
barrel as the rebound that started from the Aug. 9 low of $98.74
is ending, while U.S. crude  could fall back to $81 per
barrel as it faces a strong resistance at $86.79 per barrel,
Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said. 
 
 MENA UNREST	
 Renewed fears of further supply disruptions in the
oil-producing region of North Africa and the Middle-East also
supported prices.	
 Libyan rebels raised their flag over a strategic town near
Tripoli on Sunday after their most dramatic advance in months
cut off Muammar Gaddafi's capital from its main link to the
outside world. 
 In Syria, tanks and navy ships shelled the main
Mediterranean port city of Latakia on Sunday, as the U.S. called
on nations to stop buying oil from the country. 
 ""The demand side is in focus now, but there are also
concerns over turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa. With
the rebel troops advancing, the situation in Libya doesn't look
like its going to be resolved any time soon, and that will help
oil,"" said Westmore.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Gold fell 0.4 percent on
Monday, on course for a third consecutive session of loss, as a
revived risk appetite drives investors to stocks and away from
safe havens.	
 Buying interest in Asia, especially from China, helped
offset some of the selling pressure, dragging spot gold back
from a 1-percent loss earlier in the day, traders and analysts
said.	
 ""Investors have switched from the buy-gold-sell-stocks mode
to sell-gold-buy-stocks mode as Asian stock markets have
performed better than gold,"" said a Hong Kong-based dealer.	
 Asian stocks bounced on Monday following Wall Street gains,
with Japan's Nikkei up 1.4 percent. 
 Spot gold traded down 0.4 percent to $1,738.46 an
ounce by 0645 GMT. U.S. gold  lost 0.1 percent to
$1,740.40.	
 The sharp decline in global spot prices opened up an
arbitrage window for Chinese market participants. The gold
forward contract on the Shanghai Gold Exchange
stood at 358.70 yuan a gram, or $1,745.79 an ounce.	
 ""We saw strong buying interest from Shanghai after the
markets opened there,"" said Peter Fung, head of dealing at Wing
Fung Precious Metals in Hong Kong.	
 The most-active Shanghai gold futures was last
quoted at 360.24 yuan a gram, equivalent to $1,753.28 an ounce.	
 The fall in gold-backed exchange-traded funds added to gold
bulls' concern. Holdings of the SPDR Gold Trust, the world's
largest gold ETF, dropped 1 percent on the day to 1,260.173
tonnes by Aug. 12, the lowest in a week and half.	
 In addition, data showed that speculators scaled back their
bullish bets in U.S. gold futures and options last week, even as
gold hit a record high of $1,813.79 on Aug. 11. 
 But technical analysis suggested that gold could rebound to
$1,768 an ounce in the next 24 hours, said Reuters market
analyst Wang Tao. 
 Gold rallied to a record high of $1,813.79 last Thursday, as
investors fled riskier assets to seek safe haven in bullion in
the aftermath of the U.S. credit downgrade.	
 The gold market is waiting for U.S. data on Monday that will
show changes in investment holdings by hedge funds and
institutional investors during the second quarter. 
 Eyes will be on John Paulson, the biggest holder of the SPDR
Gold Trust.	
 Spot platinum lost 0.2 percent to $1,789.99 an ounce,
after rising for four straight sessions.	
 ""The gold-platinum spread has gone from a premium in the
middle of last week to a discount of about $50,"" said a
Singapore-based trader. 
 ""If and when we get improving sentiment, we should see that
discount expanding to maybe $150.""	
 Ebbing panic in the markets is likely to help other
industrial metals, such as silver and palladium, he added.

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2011 07:40PM ET</span>",NYMEX-Crude stays mostly steady after slight fall," TOKYO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures were steady on
Monday after settling down slightly on Friday, taking cues from
a slump in consumer confidence in the United States. 
 
 FUNDAMENTALS	
 * NYMEX crude for September delivery  was up 9 cents
at $85.47 a barrel by 2309 GMT, after settling down 34 cents at
the end of last week.	
 The front-month contract lost $1.50, or 1.73 percent, last
week, but it has recovered from a $75.71 low, the weakest since
an intraday low of $75.60 on Sept. 29.	
 * London Brent crude for September delivery  was up 7
cents at $108.10 a barrel, after settling up a cent on Friday.	
 Brent lost $1.34, or 1.23 percent, last week, but recovered
from its $98.74 low. 
 * Oil futures and equities markets were buffeted at the
start of last week, after the downgrade of the U.S.
credit rating by Standard & Poor's. 
 The weekly U.S. oil inventory report lifted oil, showing
a surprise sharp drop in U.S. crude stockpiles and slips in
refined product stocks. 
 * Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and
options positions on NYMEX to the lowest in over eight months in
the week to Aug. 9, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
said on Friday. 
 * Tropical Storm Gert strengthened slowly on Sunday on its
course towards Bermuda and forecasters said the global
reinsurance hub could expect increased winds, rain and surf when
the storm passes on its eastern side. 
 Gert, the seventh named storm of what is proving as
predicted to be an active 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, formed
earlier on Sunday but its forecast ocean track will keep it well
away from the heavily populated U.S. east coast.	
 * Royal Dutch Shell Plc said a ruptured North Sea pipeline
continued to leak oil on Saturday and that it had been seeping
crude into the sea for two days before the company declared it.

Shell said it was continuing to reduce pressure in the
pipeline on Saturday, reducing the flow of oil. 
 * Iran hopes oil deliveries to India will return to a normal
level now a long-running payment problem has been resolved, the
head of international affairs at the National Iranian Oil Co.
said in an interview published on Sunday. 
Talking to the semi-official Fars news agency, Mohsen
Ghamsari, confirmed that all Indian customers had started to pay
debts that had built up over the year and said if there had been
a slowdown in supply in August due to the dispute, that was now
over.	
 * Iran reiterated to China on Saturday it could take back
control of a gas field being developed by its national oil
company unless it speeds up investment, one week after the new
Iranian oil minister said no foreign contractors were needed.

""Ultimatums will certainly be given to the China National
Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) if the delays in developing phase
11 of South Pars continues,"" Ahmad Qalebani, Head of National
Iranian Oil Co.(NIOC) was quoted as saying by the semi-official
Mehr news agency.

 MARKET NEWS	
 * U.S. stocks ended higher on Friday. But the market was
down for the week and posted its worst three-week decline since
March 2009 when it hit 12-year lows. 
 On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average gained
125.71 points, or 1.13 percent, to 11,269.02. The Standard &

July retail sales.
 Crude futures also closed the week lower, down for the
third straight week, as the consumer confidence data added to
fears that the economy may slide back into recession after last
week's U.S. credit downgrade.
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for September
delivery  settled at $85.38 a barrel, edging down 34
cents, or 0.4 percent, after trading between $84.02 to $87.37.
 For the week, the front-month contract was down $1.50, or
1.73 percent, from the $86.88 close on Aug. 5.

 NEW YORK/LONDON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Gold dropped 1.5
percent on Friday, falling further from the previous session's
record highs, as a rise in appetite for riskier assets prompted
profit-taking from bullion's sharp safe-haven rally this week.
 Bullion fell as global stock markets rallied after a ban on
short selling European financial shares, and mildly U.S upbeat
retail sales data offset a weak consumer sentiment data. Rising
U.S. Treasury prices, seen as a risk-free investment, also
undermined gold. [ID:nN1E77B08W] [MKTS/GLOB] [US/]
 Data from the U.S. futures regulator showed that managed
money in gold futures and options sharply cut their net length
by 14 percent despite a $100 rally last week, suggesting some
funds opted to take profits by liquidating long positions.
 Despite Friday's decline, gold gained nearly 5 percent this
week, its biggest weekly rise since early November, while the
S&P 500 fell for a third straight week on double-dip recession
fears. The metal has gained as much as 13 percent in the last
two weeks.
 ""Higher equity markets have reduced the safe-haven bid for
gold. Given the increase in margins this week, the market has
held up pretty well,"" said James Steel, chief commodity analyst
at HSBC.
 Spot gold  was down 1.4 percent $1,741.61 an ounce
3:51 PM EDT (1951 GMT), after hitting a session low of
$1,722.94. It has risen 22 percent so far this year on a potent
mix of concerns over U.S. and euro zone government debt levels
and economic growth.
 US gold futures for December delivery  settled down
$8.90 at $1,742.60 an ounce. Trading volume was lower than the
hectic turnover earlier this week in line with its 30-day
average.
 The rebound in stock markets since Wednesday's slide has
diverted money from gold, which at one point was up as much as
$150 this week, hitting a record $1,813.79 early Thursday.
 ""...The velocity of the recent move higher also opens the
door to a steep if temporary downward correction,"" Katherine
Spector, commodities analyst at CIBC wrote in a note.
 The CME Group's 22-percent margins hike earlier this week
could also put a short-term brake on gold's rally, she said.
 The CBOE Gold ETF Volatility Index <.GVZ>, which is often
referred to as the ""Gold VIX"" and is based on SPDR Gold Trust
 options, posted its biggest one-day drop since November
after a spike earlier this week during the market maelstrom.
 Managed money in gold futures and options reduced their net
length by 14 percent in the week up to Aug. 9 even as prices
rose, latest data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed.
 Frank McGhee, head precious metals trader at Integrated
Brokerage Services LLC, said the fact that gold futures settled
nearly $70 off its session high on Tuesday, the second straight
volatile session, triggered heavy liquidation.
""I wouldn't be surprised to see another round of liquidation
next week with the margin increases and the pullbacks from
all-time highs late this week,"" McGhee said.
 FALLING SCRAP SUPPLY UNDERPINS RALLY
 The latest surge in gold prices is failing to lure as many
people across the globe into selling their old old jewelry as
during the 2008 financial crisis, and dwindling supply of scrap
gold could further underpin gold's long-term bull run.

 By Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Brent crude prices inched up a
penny on Friday, fading late as a tumble in consumer sentiment
offset the lift provided by rising equities markets and data
showing higher U.S. retail sales in July.
 U.S. crude fell back and ended the day lower and both Brent
and U.S. contracts posted their third straight weekly losses.
 U.S. consumer sentiment fell sharply in early August, to
the lowest index level since 1980, even though retail sales
posted their biggest gains in three months in July, separate
reports showed. [ID:nN1E77B08W]
 The consumer gloom caused U.S. and European equities
markets to briefly pare gains after receiving a lift from the
promising retail sales data. Both equities markets finished the
day higher. [.N] [.EU]
 Equities received a lift earlier when a ban on
short-selling financial stocks in four European countries
including France took effect on Friday. [ID:nLDE77A05U]
 ""The consumer sentiment just took the wind out of crude's
sails,"" said Gene McGillian, analyst at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut.
 ""(U.S.) crude is trying to get back into the $85-$115 range
it had been in most of the year.""
 ICE Brent crude for September  edged up 1 cent to
settle at $108.03 a barrel, after swinging from a $106.86 low
to the week's high of $109.16.
 Brent's lost 1.23 percent for the week, but recovered from
its $98.74 low for the week.
 U.S. September crude  fell 34 cents to settle at
$85.38 a barrel, after gyrating from $84.02 to $87.37.
 The loss on the week was 1.73 percent, but U.S. crude
recovered from the week's $75.71 low, weakest since the
intraday low of $75.60 on Sept. 29.
 U.S. crude's Relative Strength Index, at 37.40, remained
above the 30 threshold that signifies oversold conditions,
having dipped below that level earlier in the week.
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude  stood at $22.39 a
barrel, below the record $26.08 posted intraday on Tuesday.
 Tepid trading volumes may have reflected uncertainty, with
Brent and U.S. volumes only approaching 600,000 lots in
post-settlement trading. U.S. volumes were lowest since late
July when the debt-limit fight in Congress was stalling
trading, after topping 1 million lots on Thursday.
 Total open interest continued to rise during the week,
despite the week's price plunges and volatility.
 ""Open interest rising could be new shorts or new longs. But
it's true that rising open interest in a down market is more
likely new shorts entering the market,"" said Tom Bentz,
director, BNP Paribas Commodities Futures Inc in New York.
 Money managers cut their net-long U.S. crude futures and
options positions to the lowest in over eight months in the
week to Tuesday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commision said
in a report released after oil futures settled.
[ID:nEMS20NDZ5]
 Other broker and hedge fund sources noted that with the
recent large price swings some investors may have hung on to
their positions instead of exiting prematurely.

 Oil futures and equities markets were buffeted this week,

 By Manash Goswami	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Brent slipped below $108 a
barrel on Friday, reversing direction after two straight days of
gains, as the dollar strengthened and demand concerns from
industrialised nations weighed on prices.	
 The strong U.S. jobs report, which helped oil gain as much
as 3 percent in the previous session, is not enough to keep
pushing prices higher, and wide swings will continue until the
market sees a clear demand trend emerging, analysts said.	
 The U.S. dollar gained further after posting its best day
ever against the Swiss franc on Thursday. 
 ""The market needs strong indicators to be convinced about
demand for oil and for prices to go up steadily towards $100,""
said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity derivatives manager at Japan's
Newedge brokerage. ""Till then, we are going to see big
volatility, and swings of up to $2 to $3 in a day.""	
 Brent crude  for September fell as low as $107.34 and
traded 52 cents lower at $107.50 by 0314 GMT. The benchmark is
poised to gain 1 percent on the week, reversing the previous
week's slump of 9.3 percent. 
 U.S. oil  slipped as low as $84.85 a barrel and traded
77 cents down at $84.95. In its third consecutive week of
decline, the contract is set to fall 2.6 percent on the week
versus a fall of 9 percent last week.	
 Crude rose on Thursday after a report from the Labor
Department showed the number of Americans claiming new jobless
benefits fell by 7,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted
395,000, the lowest since early April. The report offered hope
for an economy battered for days by a credit rating downgrade
and falling share prices. 
 
 
 
 Brent settled $1.34 higher at $108.02 a barrel, having swung
between $104.43 and $108.08, adding to the 4 percent leap on
Wednesday. U.S. crude settled up 3.41 percent at $85.72 a
barrel, bouncing from the day's low of $81.03. On Wednesday, it
rose 4.5 percent. 
 Oil trading volumes were also strong for a sixth straight
day as traders piled into riskier assets such as commodities and
equities. Gold dropped 1 percent, extending losses from a fall
of 1.6 percent in the previous session. 
 The rebound in Brent is approaching its end, as indicated by
a rising wedge, while U.S. oil  is expected to end the
current rebound below $86.79 per barrel, as a strong resistance
zone of $85.23-$86.79 would force it to drop, Reuters technical
analyst Wang Tao said. 
 ""The jobs report is just one indicator, and everyday we are
getting some indicators that are good and some that are bad,""
Hasegawa said. ""The market needs strong signs from both the U.S.
and Europe.""	
 The safe-haven Swiss franc nursed heavy losses in Asia on
Friday, having posted record one-day falls against the dollar
and euro after the Swiss National Bank threatened to step up its
fight to curb the franc's strength.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Spot gold pared early losses
on Friday, putting it on track for its best week since February
2009 as worries about the euro zone debt crisis and global
growth drive investors to safe havens.	
 Spot gold fell as much as 3.5 percent on Thursday, as stock
and commodities markets rebounded on reassuring U.S. jobless
claims data, and lost 1 percent earlier in the day.

 Spot gold stood at $1,763.25 an ounce by 0615 GMT,
down 0.2 percent from the previous close and off a session low
of $1,747.54.	
 The precious metal dropped more than 2 percent from its
record high of $1,813.79 set in the previous session, but was
still headed for a weekly rise of 6.1 percent, marking its best
week since February 2009.	
 U.S. gold  gained more than 1 percent to $1,770.9 and
eased to $1,766.30, on course for a sixth consecutive week of
gains, matching a similar run in August 2007.	
 ""We've seen some new investors getting in the market at high
price levels,"" said Dick Poon, manager of precious metals at
Heraeus in Hong Kong.	
 ""People don't seem to care about prices and just want to get
into safe havens.""	
 Reuters market analyst Wang Tao expects gold to stay above
Thursday's session-low of $1,732.10 per ounce. 
 
 
 
 Holdings in the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded
fund, SPDR Gold Trust , dropped 1.8 percent from the
previous session to 1,272.894 tonnes by Aug. 11, its biggest
one-day drop since late January. 
 
 TOKYO GOLD DISCOUNT LOWEST IN 2011	
 A rapid rally in gold prices over the past few days has
triggered gold scrap selling in Japan, pushing the discount in
Tokyo down to 75 cents an ounce below spot prices, its lowest
this year, a dealer at a large Tokyo-based bullion house said.	
 ""The general public is selling large quantities of gold
scrap,"" said the dealer, ""They are still selling today as prices
are higher than last week.""	
 Spot gold has risen 8.3 percent so far this month, compared
with a drop of 2.9 percent in silver, a dip of 0.9 percent in
platinum and a tumble of 11.6 percent in palladium.	
 The gold premium in Hong Kong remained steady in the range
of 50 cents to $1.20 an ounce over spot prices, as investment
demand remained strong, dealers said.	
 ""Investors are happy to buy gold at current levels, and we
haven't seen much scrap flow on the way up,"" said a Hong
Kong-based dealer.

 By Jonathan Leff
 NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Gold recoiled after tapping a
new record on Thursday, tumbling more than 2 percent as an
equities rebound and higher trading margins fanned
profit-taking from the biggest rally since 2008.
 Prices fell by as much as $82 from a new overnight record
of $1,813.79 in one of the biggest daily swings ever. Yet
analysts showed no sign of revising their bullish view of gold,
up nearly 20 percent since June as investors seek safe havens
amid global debt crises and a darker economic outlook.
 Concerns of a deepening European crisis and the possibility
of distress among French banks were set aside on Thursday as
equity investors took heart from a slight dip in weekly jobs
data and upbeat Cisco earnings. [.N] But debt concerns were
unlikely to disappear soon, analysts said.
 Traders said steeper margin requirements also would not
stop gold's long-term advance. Late on Wednesday, the CME Group
Inc  raised margin requirements for 100-ounce gold
futures by 22 percent, the biggest rise in about 1-1/2 years
and the first such rise since January. [ID:nL3E7JA52Y]
 ""Once again, gold's decline is indicative of a sell-off of
safe-haven assets, more of a risk-on type trade today,"" said
David Meger, director of metals trading at commodity broker
Vision Financial Markets in Chicago.
 ""The European sovereign debt issue is going to remain an
ongoing issue, and the economy moving forward is concerning.
All of the positive factors that have been supporting gold for
the last several months are not dissipating. Inevitably, we
view this as a pullback within an uptrend.""
 As Wall Street stocks extended an early rally to close
nearly 5 percent higher, gold plunged to session lows. The spot
price for bullion  fell 1.7 percent to $1,763 an ounce by
4:44 p.m. EDT (2044 GMT), reversing Wednesday's sharp gains. It
recovered from a session low $1,732.10.
 Gold futures  fell 1.8 percent to settle at $1,749.90
an ounce.
 The intraday trading range of over $80 an ounce was the
third-widest in Reuters data going back to 1983. Tuesday's
range was the sixth-biggest ever. Implied volatility for the
biggest exchange-traded fund, the SPDR GLD <.OVZ>, pulled back
slightly from Wednesday's 2-1/2-year high.
 COMEX gold trading volume cooled after Tuesday's
record-breaking 437,000 lots, with nearly 340,000 lots changing
hands -- still 50 percent more than the 30-day average.
 Heavy losses in the global stock markets have highlighted
gold's appeal as a safe store of value. After a wobbly start,
world shares rallied as U.S. markets firmed on relatively
positive weekly jobs data and solid results from Cisco. [.N]

 STOCKS BUOYED, GOLD SOLD
 Investors were cashing in gains from a four-day rally that
had boosted prices by nearly 9 percent. That run briefly
carried into Thursday, but was cut short by news the CME would
raise speculative margins to $5,500 per contract from $4,500,
effective from the close on Thursday. [ID:nL3E7JA52Y].
 Gold was ""overextended to an extent that requires a
setback"", said Ole Hansen, senior manager at Saxo Bank. ""The
CME has shown its hand, and given average daily price swings
have moved towards 3 percent, a margin of 5,500 still seems too
little, so we are expecting further hikes.""
 He said gold could fall toward $1,700 an ounce if this
moves gathers pace, ""considering how much hot money has come in
over the last week"".
 Traders also noted that the 14-day Relative Strength Index
(RSI) had surged to above 85 for the first time since last
October, deep into overbought territory. It pulled back on
Thursday to 71, at the top of its normal 30-70 band.
 After days of whipsaw volatility that had catapulted gold
deep into uncharted territory, some were struggling to call a
market that had broken through a host of technical barriers.
 After breaking two Fibonacci projection levels in its
run-up to beyond the $1,800 milestone, the next best resistance
mark may be its inflation-adjusted high of about $2,500, said
Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at broker MF Global.
 ""It's a hard market to call, it's still kind of choppy,"" he
said. ""I'm looking toward what'll come out tomorrow in terms of
U.S. retail sales and euro zone industrial production. Any
strength there will turn the market lower, because it's only
economic growth that will ease these debt problems.""
 Silver  held up better than bullion, falling only 1.5
percent to $38.70 an ounce as it drew some benefit from equity
gains that suggested a less-grim economic outlook.

 By Gene Ramos and Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose for a second
straight day on Thursday, gaining as much as 3 percent as a
strong U.S. jobs report trumped early concerns about French
banks and fears that Europe's debt crisis will spread.
 Investors welcomed data showing U.S. jobless benefit claims
fell to a four-month low last week, which eased some of the
concerns about the euro zone crisis, the U.S. credit downgrade
and weak economic data that weighed on markets over the past
week.
 Oil trading volumes were strong for an sixth straight day
as traders piled into riskier assets such as commodities and
equities, and U.S. stocks rose 4 percent. [.N]
 Grains and metals markets also rebounded, pushing the
Reuters Jefferies CRB Index <.CRB>, a global commodities
benchmark, up 1.84 percent to 326.34, its largest one-day gain
since May 18. [ID:nN1E77A1FA] Gold, which has hit a string of
record highs as a safe-haven investment, tumbled nearly 3
percent. [ID:nL6E7JB0V4]
 The jobless data helped erase losses for oil earlier in the
day, as speculation that France's credit rating would be
downgraded, although three ratings agencies reaffirmed its AAA
rating.
 ""Relative calm over the French bank situation is giving
equities and overall sentiment a lift, which has pushed crude
prices higher on lessened demand contraction fears,"" said John
Kilduff, partner at hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York.
 In London, ICE Brent crude for September  settled
$1.34 higher, or 1.26 percent, at $108.02 a barrel, having
swung between $104.43 and $108.08. The gain added to a 4
percent leap on Wednesday.
 U.S. September crude  settled up $2.83, or 3.41
percent, at $85.72 a barrel, bouncing from the day's low of
$81.03. Near the close, the contract rose further to hit a
session high of $85.90. On Wednesday, it rose 4.5 percent.
 Brent's trading volume rose to nearly 33 percent above the
30-day average in late afternoon activity, while U.S. crude's
volume reached 36 percent above the 30-day average.
 U.S. crude's Relative Strength Index (RSI) recovered
further, to 37.84, above the 30 threshold that signifies
oversold conditions, having dipped below that level earlier in
the week.
 Implied volatility for U.S. crude stood at 49.81 percent on
the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Oil Volatility Index
<.OVX>, down 9.64 percentage points from the settlement on
Wednesday, when it hit a two-year high of 70.37.
 ""It's risk premium coming out of the market. It was due for
a bounce. It is likely to do so heading into the weekend,"" said
Chris Jarvis, senior analyst at Caprock Risk Management in
Hampton Falls, New Hampshire.
 Despite weak U.S. gasoline demand and downward revisions to
consumption forecasts by the U.S. Energy Information
Administration and the International Energy Agency this week,
JPMorgan said it expects Brent to average $110 a barrel in the
third quarter, before rising to $115 in the next quarter.

 By James Regan and Rujun Shen	
 SYDNEY/SINGAPORE, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Gold eased on Thursday
from the session's record highs after the CME Group raised
margins on COMEX gold futures, but turmoil in the global
financial markets and fears of slower growth buoyed sentiment.	
 Spot gold hit an all-time high of $1,813.79, and U.S.
gold  rose to a record high of $1,817.6 early in the day.	
 Both eased after the CME Group raised margins on
U.S. gold futures by 22.2 percent, driving spot gold down to
$1,787.61 an ounce by 0624 GMT, off 0.4 percent from the
previous close. 
 U.S. gold traded up 0.3 percent at $1,789.90.	
 ""Historically when margins are raised significantly it tends
to cause a bit of sell-off,"" said Darren Heathcote, head of
trading at Investec Australia. 
 ""We've seen some of it now, but it's difficult to see a
great deal of selling, because we are in very, very volatile and
uncertain times when markets are moving very violently. Gold has
proven too much of an attraction as an alternative investment
and the margins may not have as much influence.""	
 On the relative strength index, spot gold fell to 82.7,
suggesting a heavily overbought market, although the index was
off its earlier level near 86, the highest since October 2010.
 The rapid rise in prices has prompted concern of a price
retracement.	
 ""Gold is overbought and things are looking a little risky,""
said a physical dealer in Hong Kong, who felt gold could fall
towards $1,750.	
 ""But as the debt worries linger and the stock market is
still on the downside, gold remains a safe haven.""	
 Technical analysis suggested gold could fall to $1,775 an
ounce, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.



 Gold's safe-haven allure has attracted investors fleeing the
risk of debt crisis contagion in Europe and slowing global
growth. Prices of cash gold have risen as much as 21 percent
since the end of June.	
 Stock market woes have helped push gold's ratio to the
S&P-500 stock index to its highest since 1988. But that
ratio remains far below its peaks of 1980 and the 1930s, and
gold is still below its inflation-adjusted record near $2,500.	
 Extreme market turmoil is forcing central banks to shift
policy. Central banks in Japan and Switzerland said they would
rein in the appreciation of their currencies, while the U.S.
Federal Reserve promised to keep rates near zero for at least
two more years. 
 ""With the authorities in both Japan and Switzerland
announcing intentions to intervene to weaken their currencies,
gold remains the last protection against the potential for
widescale money printing as governments seek to recapitalise
their banks and restimulate their economies,"" UBS said in a
research note.

 By Jonathan Leff and Jan Harvey
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Gold climbed to a third
record in a row over $1,800 an ounce on Wednesday, extending
its biggest rally since 2008 as a dive in French bank stocks
sent new shudders through anxious financial markets.
 Rising more than 2.5 percent to take its four-day winning
streak to nearly 8.5 percent, gold's long rally showed few
signs of letting up as the locus of traders' euro zone debt
fears shifted from Spain and Italy to France, which traders
fretted could be next in line for a debt crisis.
 The jitters overshadowed the U.S. Federal Reserve's
unprecedented decision to promise near-zero interest rates for
two years. The announcement was a double-edged sword for gold,
which retreated during Tuesday's late Wall Street rally but
would also benefit from a prolonged low-yield environment.
 Spot gold  rose more than 3 percent to hit a high of
$1,796.86 an ounce but pared gains at midday as stocks
attempted a rally. Bullion then rebounded, rising 2.6 percent
to $1,789 by 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) as Wall Street closed down
more than 4 percent. [.N]
 U.S. COMEX gold futures  briefly topped $1,800, then
settled at $1,784.30, up 2.4 percent. It also hit record highs
in euro and sterling terms.
 Gold has broken cleanly above technical resistance from a
near three-year trend-channel and putting its ratio to the
S&P-500 <.SPX> stock index at the highest since 1988. But that
ratio remains far below its peaks of 1980 and the 1930s, and
gold is still below its inflation-adjusted record near $2,500.
 (Ratio graphic: http://r.reuters.com/wam23s )
 ""We don't see anything out there that's going to reverse
the appetite for gold,"" said Deutsche Bank commodity strategist
Michael Lewis, whose team reaffirmed its forecast for $2,000 an
ounce next year, among the most bullish in the market based on
a Reuters poll in July. 
 ""Given gold is a financial asset, it's interesting that it
doesn't look that expensive at these sort of levels.""
 He said the risk of a run-up toward $3,000 an ounce --
which would put gold's ratio to the S&P on a par with where it
was in the 1930s -- wasn't part of Deutsche's economic outlook,
although that likelihood had increased in recent days.
 Friday's U.S. credit rating downgrade accelerated a slump
in risk assets amid expanding worries over euro zone debt and
an increasingly grim-looking U.S. economic outlook. After a
one-day respite thanks to the Fed comments, the rout resumed on
Wednesday with the S&P falling more than 2 percent.
 Over the past 24 hours, the inverse correlation between
gold and the U.S. stock market topped 70 percent, near the
tightest this year as investors spirited cash from one into the
other. (Graphic on correlation: http://r.reuters.com/kum23s )
 This time it was France, joining a long list of woes as
shares in its banks -- among the most exposed to Italian and
other peripheral euro zone government debt -- slumped as much
as 20 percent in afternoon trade as fears about the currency
bloc's debt crisis moved back to the forefront.
 Efforts to dispel those fears made only marginal impact. A
Standard & Poor's analyst said France's AAA rating was not at
risk because it was more serious than the United States in
addressing fiscal issues. [ID:nN1E77910H]
 Societe Generale , the bank at the center of
speculation whose shares tumbled 15 percent in Paris, dismissed
as ""absolutely rubbish"" rumors about its financial health.
[ID:nLDE77912I]
 FED PLEDGE
 The Fed's promise on to keep interest rates near zero for
at least two more years supported the view that the opportunity
cost of holding nonyielding gold would remain depressed. But it
also triggered a fleeting rally in stocks on Tuesday that
spurred a round of profit-taking in gold. [ID:nN1E7781WQ]
 Global holdings of gold-backed exchange-traded funds,
calculated by Reuters, fell 7.2 tonnes on Tuesday in their
first daily decline in thirteen sessions. [GOL/ETF]
 ""With very low interest rates for another two years, and
bond yields also very low, opportunity cost of holding gold is
very low,"" said Patricia Mohr, commodity market specialist at
Scotia Capital.
 Traders were also starting to build in a greater
possibility that the Fed will resort to a third round of
quantitative easing, perhaps signaling its intent at its annual
Jackson Hole get-together later this month -- exactly one year
after Ben Bernanke signaled QE2.
 Goldman Sachs predicted a more than 50 percent chance of a
third round of QE by early 2012. [ID:nL3E7JA1A7]

 TECHNICAL FLAGS
 Gold's rally has broken it clear of the ascending trend
channel that contained prices since late 2008 -- the last time
it staged an 8 percent gain over four days.
 But the Relative Strength Index was flashing overbought
status at 84, far above the 70 percent mark that often signals
a correction may be in store. Gold has pulled back both times
the index topped that level in the past 12 months. (Technical
chart of gold: http://r.reuters.com/xyk23s )
 ""When you have a metal that has three or four distinct
reasons why it has headed higher, it is very difficult not to
be bullish in that environment,"" said Mitsui Precious Metals
analyst David Jolliet. But he added: ""Given how far and how
quickly we've run up, the move seems somewhat overextended.""

 By Edward McAllister
 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Brent crude rebounded 4
percent on Wednesday, shaking off two days of losses as an
unexpected decline in U.S. oil inventories outweighed deepening
economic concerns.
 Oil extended gains in the afternoon in another heavy
trading session as the U.S. stock market pared earlier losses
due to concerns about the exposure of French banks to shaky
European debt fears of trouble in French banks. [.N]
 A steep decline in U.S. crude inventories as well as drops
in refined product stockpiles for the week to Aug. 5 reported
by the U.S. Energy Information Administration lifted prices in
early New York trading. [EIA/S]
 The drawdowns, which countered forecasts for increases in
U.S. stockpiles, helped counter the economic concerns that
helped push Brent prices down 6 percent following the downgrade
of U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor's on Friday.
 ""The inventory numbers showed that despite the fears of a
slowing economy, maybe demand might not be as bad as we
thought,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBEST Research in
Chicago.
 Brent crude  settled at $106.68 a barrel, gaining
$4.11, but was still down on the week after tumbling more than
6 percent last week.
 U.S. light crude  closed at $82.89, gaining $3.59, or
4.53 percent, after falling 8.7 percent in two prior trading
days. It slid nearly 9 percent last week.
 U.S. government data showed U.S. crude stocks fell by 5.2
million barrels last week, confounding forecasts for an

 Supplies dropped after Tropical Storm Don hit the U.S. Gulf
of Mexico last week, causing oil companies to reduce production
in the region as they evacuated workers from offshore
platforms.
 Crude stored at the Cushing, Oklahoma, U.S. delivery hub
fell 1.37 million barrels, its lowest level since November.
 Further support came after report from private forecaster
Accuweather that three potential tropical storms could spawn in
the Atlantic over the next couple of weeks, traders said.
[ID:nN1E7790WI]
 Brent's premium to U.S. futures held near record levels
after topping $26 a barrel on Tuesday.
 Brent futures have been supported in recent weeks by lower
North Sea output and the exports of sweet crude shut off by
Libya's civil war. However, North Sea crude oil output was
scheduled to rise by 19 percent in September due to a reduced
impact on supplies from maintenance. [ID:nL6E7JA1AO]
 Oil trading volumes, which were muted for much of July,
were strong for a fifth straight day, with Brent trade already
eclipsing the 30-day average by 42 percent in late afternoon
activity. U.S. crude trade rose 28 percent above its 30-day
average.
 In late trading, implied volatility for U.S. crude stood at
56.61 percent on the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Oil
Volatility Index <.OVX>, down 6.2 percentage points from
Tuesday's settlement, but still at two-year record highs. The
index has been erratic throughout the day, trading with an
upward bias in a wide range that eclipsed Tuesday's strong
range.
 The high for the index was 70.37 percent, achieved at 9:31
a.m. EDT (1331 GMT) as the U.S. equities markets opened under
Rule 48 provisions in anticipation of sharply lower stock
prices. Since that higher open, the index has traded closer to
Tuesday's settlement.
 U.S. crude's Relative Strength Index (RSI) rose back to
29.5, just below the 30 threshold that signals oversold
conditions, after sliding to 20.2 on Tuesday. The index began
falling below 30 on Thursday for the first time since May.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Gold held steady on Wednesday,
hovering near a lifetime high around $1,778 an ounce struck in
the previous session, but further gains could be capped by a
rebound in equities after the U.S. Federal Reserve's vow to keep
rates near zero.	
 Stocks bounced in Asia after U.S. shares jumped on the
Federal Reserve's unprecedented pledge to keep interest rates
near zero for at least two years, although the move confirmed
fears the U.S. economy will remain weak for far longer than
previously forecast. 
 Gold added $6.91 to $1,750.31 an ounce by 0620 GMT,
having hit a record at $1,778.29 on Tuesday, in its biggest
three-day rally since the financial crisis in late 2008 after
equities plunged on fears over the threat to economic growth
from the U.S. and euro debt crises.	
 ""Generally speaking, the panic is subsiding for the moment.
I would expect that (gold) will consolidate at these levels for
a while before we get any sort of clear idea of the sort of next
major moves,"" said Citigroup analyst David Thurtell.	
 ""I think there are enough concerns about sovereign debts
and weakening growth, that people will buy dips, so it should
remain supported.""	
 U.S. December gold futures  rose $9.5 to $1,752.5 an
ounce, within sight of Tuesday's record of about $1,782 an
ounce.	
 Tracking strong global prices, the most active gold contract
on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, June 2012 , hit a record
for a second consecutive day at 4,408 yen a gram.

 
 
 Global stock markets had been tumbling since the start of
August on fears the United States would slide back into
recession after a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating on Friday,
and on the ever-expanding euro zone debt crisis. 
 MSCI's all-country world stock index was
about 17 percent below its May peak on Wednesday, after slipping
as far as 20 percent, the generally accepted definition of a
bear market, on Tuesday. 
 ""We'll wait and see if stocks markets will continue to
stabilise, because if they will, then gold will drop down a
bit,"" said a physical dealer in Hong Kong.	
 ""But I think there's no change in sentiment for gold.
Interest rates in the U.S. will be kept low in the next two
years and it should benefit gold for the time being."" 
 Premiums for gold bars remained steady in Singapore and Hong
Kong, while dealers in Tokyo were offering excess gold bars to
trading houses in Southeast Asia after record bullion prices
triggered selling in Japan. 
 Gold bars were quoted at a discount of 25 cents in Tokyo.	
 ""The general public has been selling back their gold, so
that's why we are offering gold bars not only to Singapore, but
also to other countries in Southeast Asia,"" said a physical
dealer in Tokyo. 
 ""Southeast Asia is still buying gold at this moment."" 
 Vietnam approved 5 tonnes of gold imports on Tuesday and
could double the quantity soon as surging prices touched off a
frenzy at gold dealers and jewellers. 
 High bullion prices blunted demand in main consumer India,
but a correction could prompt bargain hunting from jewellers as
the busy wedding season resumes later this month. 
 Gold jewellery is an essential part of the dowry basket
parents give daughters at Indian weddings.	
 In the energy market, Brent crude rose more than $3 on
Wednesday after the Fed promised to extend near-zero interest
rates for two more years.

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Gold ticked higher on
Wednesday, hovering near a lifetime high around $1,778 an ounce
struck in the previous session, but further gains could be
capped by a rebound in equities after the U.S. Federal Reserve's
vow to keep rates near zero.	
 Stocks bounced in Asia after U.S. shares jumped on the
Federal Reserve's unprecedented pledge to keep interest rates
near zero for at least two years, although the move confirmed
fears the U.S. economy will remain weak for far longer than
previously forecast. 
 Gold added $11.89 to $1,755.29 an ounce by 0258
GMT, having hit a record at $1,778.29 on Tuesday, in its biggest
three-day rally since the financial crisis in late 2008 after
equities plunged on fears over the threat to economic growth
from the U.S. and euro debt crises.	
 ""Generally speaking, the panic is subsiding for the moment.
I would expect that (gold) will consolidate at these levels for
a while before we get any sort of clear idea of the sort of next
major moves,"" said Citigroup analyst David Thurtell.	
 ""I think there are enough concerns about sovereign debts
and weakening growth, that people will buy dips, so it should
remain supported.""	
 U.S. December gold futures  rose $24.4 to $1,767.4 an
ounce, within sight of Tuesday's record of about $1,782 an
ounce.	
 Tracking strong global prices, the most active gold contract
on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, June 2012 , hit a record
for a second consecutive day at 4,408 yen a gram.	
 The Fed pledged to hold benchmark rates at rock-bottom lows
until mid-2013, and opened the door to other tools to support
growth, saying that U.S. economic growth was proving
considerably weaker than expected. 
 
 
 Global stock markets had been tumbling since the start of
August on fears the United States would slide back into
recession after a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating on
Friday, and on the ever-expanding euro zone debt crisis. 
 MSCI's all-country world stock index
was about 17 percent below its May peak on Wednesday, after
slipping as far as 20 percent, the generally accepted definition
of a bear market, on Tuesday. 
 Premiums for gold bars remained steady in Asia, although
jewellers were on the sidelines as they closely watched
movements in the equities markets. 
 ""We'll wait and see if stocks markets will continue to
stabilise, because if it will, then gold will drop down a bit,""
said a physical dealer in Hong Kong.	
 ""But I think there's no change in sentiments for gold.
Interest rates in the U.S. will be kept low in the next two
years and it should benefit gold for the time being."" 
 High bullion prices turned off demand in main consumer
India, but a correction could prompt bargain hunting from
jewellers as the busy wedding season resumes later this month.

 Gold jewellery is an essential part of the dowry basket
parents give daughters at weddings.	
 In the energy market, Brent crude rose $2 after the Fed's
promise to extend near-zero interest rates for two more years
weighed on the dollar and helped reverse a steep slump in oil.

 NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Gold rallied for a second day
on Tuesday, hitting a record high early, then churning until it
finally settled more than 1 percent higher after the Federal
Reserve boosted Wall Street with a plan to keep U.S. rates
low.
 Trade was volatile as investors periodically took profits
on the rally of nearly 5 percent over the last two days --
among the biggest two-day advances for gold since November
2008, when the financial crisis was escalating.
 Both bullion and gold futures jumped more than 3 percent in
early and late trade -- hitting record highs of nearly $1,800
first on fears about the global economy and reapproaching those
levels after the Fed statement before paring gains.
 ""I think investors have got a lot smarter since 2008,"" said
Michael Daly, precious metals analyst at PFGBest in Chicago.
 ""They've come to realize that gold's one of the easiest
things to liquidate for profit in a crisis and that's why
everybody's piling into this market.""
 Since the end of June, gold has gained some 13 percent.
 At least one major investor, BlackRock , confirmed
analysts' theory that profits from gold were being used to
cover losses or enlarge stakes in other markets.
 James Holt, investment strategist at Blackrock, told
Reuters the world's largest money manager planned to use
returns from its gold and bonds investments to seek out
bargains in falling global equity markets. [ID:nL3E7J9144]
 The spot price of gold , which tracks trading in
bullion, was around $1,737 an ounce late Tuesday afternooon, up
about 1.2 percent from Monday's close. It traded above $1,750
after the Fed statement and hit a record high above $1,778
earlier.
 Spot gold priced in euros , sterling 
and yen  also hit record highs.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  stood just
above $1,740 in late trade on the New York Mercantile
Exchange's COMEX metals division. It rose above $1,750 post-Fed
and hit a record high above $1,782 earlier. December gold
settled Tuesday's official trading session at $1,743, versus
Monday's $1,713.20.
 Technically, the yellow metal appeared well supported for
further gains, albeit after a pullback, some said.
 ""We're well above all the daily-moving averages; the 21;
the 55; the 100; and the 200. So that suggests upside
momentum,"" said Eric Viloria, senior technical strategist at
forex.com.
 ""But it looks like gold's little exhausted in this area
even if the long-term trend still remains upward. We'll be
looking for a potential correction. But I'll also view any
correction as an opportunity to buy further.""

 ANZ's head of metal sales Peter Hillyard expressed a
similar sentiment.
 ""The market could come off from here, but it's headed in a
northerly direction. From where we are now, you might think we
could see some sort of pull-back. But I'm talking about a
momentary thing, a pull-back like the loading of a gun, which
then fires away.""
 The Fed, in an unprecedented move, said it will keep
interest rates near zero at least until 2013 and is considering
further action, which it did it not specify.
 Stocks on Wall Street surged, recovering partially from
Monday's battering, as many read the central bank's open-ended
action pledge as an indication that it might inject more money
into markets after the $600 billion stimulus that ended in
June. U.S. oil prices, however, fell sharply to below $80 per
barrel due to the lack of details in the Fed pledge. [.N]
[O/R]
 ""The statement was extremely negative in its outlook on the
economy,"" said Omer Esiner, chief market analysts at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
 ""By pegging the extraordinarily low interest rates to a
date in the distant future, the Fed has essentially said that
they see the current level of weakness lasting far longer than
previously expected.""
 A Reuters poll showed the United States faced a one-in-four
chance of slipping back into recession, and there was potential
for more Fed stimulus to avert that. [ECILT/US] [ECILT/WRAP]
""Anytime you have weak growth and money injection, it's a
recipe for a gold rally,"" said Daly at PFGBest.
 Reflecting the rush into gold, holdings of metal in
exchange-traded funds rose for a twelfth day to an all-time
high near 70 million ounces, equivalent about half of total
supply in 2010, based on World Gold Council data. [GOL/ETF]
 Among other precious metals, silver  fell around 3.5
percent on the day to just below $38 an ounce.
 Platinum  rose about 2 percent to around $1,748 an
ounce, while palladium  climbed 2.7 percent to around
$734 an ounce.

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Bullion gained more than 3
percent on Tuesday, roaring to all-time highs for a second
consecutive session to stand above $1,770 as equity markets
dived on growing fears of a global recession following last
week's U.S. credit downgrade. 
 Speculators resisted the temptation to cash in on gold's
rise as the global economy edged closer to calamity after
investors fled riskier assets on fears that political leaders
are unable to tackle debt crises in Europe and the United
States. 
 As investors departed stocks for bonds and bullion, holdings
of the SPDR Gold Trust posted their biggest one-day gain
in more than a year on Monday, sending the price of gold to a
premium over traditionally more expensive platinum.

 U.S. gold futures for December  struck a record
around $1,774 an ounce before shedding some of the gains, while
cash gold hit an all-time high about $1,771 an ounce, its
12th record in 20 sessions. 
 ""Markets are now worried about another global recession. Out
of Europe, French bond yields have widened on expectations of
sovereign debt downgrade because of the country's exposure to
peripheral European debt,"" said Natalie Robertson, a commodities
strategist at ANZ.	
 ""I think everyone was also looking at the 7 percent drop in
the S&P 500. The market was very concerned over the global
economy. Gold is now more expensive than platinum, and the last
time this happened was back in December 2008. That's an
interesting dynamic.""



 Premiums for gold bars were steady at between 50 cents and
$1 an ounce to spot London prices in Hong Kong as investors held
on to their bullion. It is a public holiday in Singapore,
another gold trading centre in Asia, where premiums were at 60
cents. 
 ""The physical side is very steady. I think jewellers already
covered stocks yesterday, so I don't expect much from them,""
said a dealer in Hong Kong. ""There's small buying by investors
on the physical side."" 
 Vietnam's central bank said on Tuesday it would allow
domestic companies to import another 5 tonnes of gold ""in coming
days"" to boost supply for domestic markets. The import will
follow 5 tonnes permitted for Tuesday's purchases.

 Gold rallied more than 3 percent on Monday, exceeding $1,700
an ounce for the first time after Standard & Poor's cut the U.S.
credit rating to AA-plus, setting off an investor stampede for
safety. 
 The cost of insuring French debt against default rose on
Monday after the downgrade raised questions over how long other
countries could hold onto their top-notch ratings.

 Silver hardly moved below $40 an ounce after Monday's
gains. Platinum and sister metal palladium tracked
equities lower on fears a global recession could slash demand
for automobile and also auto catalysts. 
 Adjusted for inflation, gold is one of the few elements of
the commodity complex trading below its all-time highs,
estimated at $2,500 an ounce. 
 The CBOE Gold ETF Volatility Index , often
referred to as the ""Gold VIX"" and based on SPDR Gold Trust
options, jumped 30 percent to its highest since late
2010.	
 Investors await the Federal Open Market Committee meeting,
which starts on Tuesday, for clues to whether the Fed might ease
monetary policy further.	
 ""The market's near-term focus will be on further ratings
downgrades to come,"" said Tom Pawlicki, precious metals and
energy analyst at MF Global.	
 ""The FOMC meeting is today, and any potential action to
implement further easing will also offer support. In the
background, support will come from central bank buying,
investment inflows, and weakness in economic data.""	
 Economists at top financial institutions have scaled back
expectations for U.S. economic growth this year and offer a
nearly one in three chance the Fed will embark on another round
of Treasuries purchases in the next two years, a Reuters poll
found. 
 JP Morgan said on Monday it expected spot gold to
climb to $2,500 an ounce or higher by year-end, on very high
volatility, following the downgrade of U.S. debt. The U.S. bank
said its previous estimate of $1,800 was ""too conservative"".

 The prospect of an even longer period of low U.S. interest
rates prompted Goldman Sachs to raise its three-month
forecast for the gold price by about $100.

 By Robert Gibbons
 NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Oil pulled out of its dive on
Tuesday in volatile trading as the Federal Reserve promised to
extend near-zero interest rates for two more years, fueling a
late Wall Street rally and dollar slump.
 Oil settled sharply lower immediately after the Fed
statement, which failed to pledge more concrete measures to get
the economy back on track, disappointing traders. But prices
turned positive as traders saw low rates as reason for hope.
 Industry data showing a shock 5.2 million barrel drop in
U.S. crude oil inventories added impetus to oil's
post-settlement rally, helping offset some of the economic
gloom that pushed Brent as much as 15 percent lower in a week.
 ""The (Federal Reserve signaled) an extended period of
diminished, if not negative, economic growth. This bodes poorly
for demand, but may indicate additional easing measures, which
we know from recent experience is supportive of asset prices,
especially commodities,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again
Capital LLC in New York.
 ICE Brent crude for September  ended post-settlement
trading up $1.76 at $105.50 a barrel. That was after it settled
at $102.57, down $1.17, the lowest close since Feb. 18.
 Brent bounced as high as $105.95 after falling $5 to
$98.74, the lowest intraday price since Feb. 8.
 U.S. September crude  rallied to end post-settlement
trading up 83 cents at $82.14 a barrel. It settled at $79.30,
down $2.01, having reached $83.05 after falling to $75.71, the
lowest since September 2010.
 Oil prices had traded near parity prior to the Fed
statement, having pulled out of deep losses after Wall Street
stocks rebounded early in the day.
 In a divided decision, the U.S. central bank also signaled
that it was prepared to do more if necessary, noting that it
still has tools available for spurring growth and will use them
if necessary. But it made no commitment to purchase government
debt in a third round of quantitative easing, or QE3.
[ID:nN1E7780FW]
 U.S. stocks rallied late after seesawing in reaction to the
Fed statement after a two-week slide by equities. The S&P 500
posted its best day in more than two years. [ID:nN1E7781N2]
 Amid the volatility, Brent's premium to U.S. crude
 jumped to $26.08, roaring past the previous record
of $23.57 reached on July 14.
 Trading volumes were strong, with Brent and U.S. crude
trading more than 50 percent above their 30-day averages.
 OPEC CUTS DEMAND GROWTH VIEW
 Ahead of the Fed comments, OPEC and the U.S. Energy
Information Administration cut demand growth forecasts for 2011
in separate monthly reports. [ID:nN1E7781JD]
 OPEC's expected oil demand growth increase for 2011 was
lowered by 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the previous
report to 1.21 million bpd, while the view for 2012 was lowered
only marginally, by 20,000 bpd to 1.30 million bpd.
 The EIA cut its 2011 demand growth forecast by 60,000 bpd
but raised its 2012 forecast.
 High prices helped push U.S. retail gasoline demand down
last week versus the previous week and the year-ago period,
MasterCard said in its report on Tuesday. [ID:nEGE7DB028]
 A weakening demand picture could bolster the view of Iran
and other OPEC price hawks, who at a meeting in June blocked a
Saudi Arabia-led proposal to increase output.
 ""What investors are worried about is what happens to the
global economy and the currency markets. But consumption will
certainly be affected should the U.S. go into recession again,""
said Bill O'Grady, chief investment strategist at Confluence
Investment Management in St. Louis.
 U.S. OIL INVENTORIES
 U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell 5.2 million barrels last
week, the industry group American Petroleum said late on
Tuesday, against a forecast for stocks to be down. [API/S]
 Gasoline stocks fell 1.0 million barrels and distillate
inventories fell 558,000 barrels, the API said.
 U.S. crude stocks were estimated to be up 1.5 million
barrels, according to a Reuters survey of analysts ahead of the
API report. [EIA/S]
 Distillate stocks were expected to be up 1.1 million
barrels and gasoline inventories up 500,000 barrels.
 The government report from the EIA will follow on Wednesday
at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT).

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Bullion gained 1.7 percent on
Tuesday, roaring to all-time highs for a second consecutive
session as equity markets dived on growing fears of a global
recession after last week's cut in the United States's credit
rating. 
 Stock markets in Asia plummeted and the Swiss franc held
near a record high after investors fled riskier assets in a
global sell-off ignited by fears that political leaders are
unable to tackle debt crises in Europe and the United States.

 As investors exited stocks for bonds and bullion, holdings
of the SPDR Gold Trust registered their biggest one-day
gain in more than a year on Monday, sending the price of gold to
a premium over traditionally more expensive platinum.

 U.S. gold futures for December  struck a record
around $1,746 an ounce, while cash gold hit an all-time
high about $1,742 an ounce, its 12th record in 20 sessions. 
 ""Markets are now worried about another global recession. Out
of Europe, French bond yields have widened on expectation of
sovereign debt downgrade because of the country's exposure to
peripheral European debt,"" said Natalie Robertson, a commodities
strategist at ANZ.	
 ""I think everyone was also looking at the 7 percent drop in
the S&P 500. The market was very concerned over the global
economy. Gold is now more expensive than platinum, and the last
time this happened was back in December 2008. That's an
interesting dynamic."" 
 Gold rallied more than 3 percent on Monday, exceeding $1,700
an ounce for the first time after Standard & Poor's cut the U.S.
credit rating to AA-plus, setting off an investor stampede for
safety. 
 The cost of insuring French debt against default rose on
Monday after the downgrade raised questions over how long other
countries could hold onto their top-notch ratings.

 


 Silver ticked down below $40 an ounce after Monday's
gains. Platinum and sister metal palladium tracked
equities lower because of their industrial use as auto catalysts
and fears a global recession could slash automobile demand. 
 Adjusted for inflation, gold is one of the few elements of
the commodity complex trading below its all-time highs,
estimated at $2,500 an ounce. 
 The CBOE Gold ETF Volatility Index , often
referred to as the ""Gold VIX"" and based on SPDR Gold Trust
options, jumped 30 percent to its highest since late
2010.	
 Investors await the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on
Tuesday for clues to whether the Fed might ease monetary policy
further.	
 ""The market's near-term focus will be on further ratings
downgrades to come,"" said Tom Pawlicki, precious metals and
energy analyst at MF Global.	
 ""The FOMC meeting is today, and any potential action to
implement further easing will also offer support. In the
background, support will come from central bank buying,
investment inflows, and weakness in economic data.""	
 Economists at top financial institutions have scaled back
expectations for U.S. economic growth this year and offer a
nearly one in three chance the Fed will embark on another round
of Treasuries purchases in the next two years, a Reuters poll
found. 
 JP Morgan said on Monday it expected spot gold to
climb to $2,500 an ounce or higher by year-end, on very high
volatility, following the downgrade of U.S. debt. The U.S. bank
said its previous estimate of $1,800 was ""too conservative"".

 The prospect of an even longer period of low U.S. interest
rates prompted Goldman Sachs to raise its three-month
forecast for the gold price by about $100.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Gold surged more than 3 percent
on Monday, surpassing $1,700 an ounce for the first time after
Standard & Poor's cut the top-notch AAA credit rating of the
United States, setting off an investor stampede for safety.
 In a rout reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis, Wall
Street plunged nearly 7 percent and other commodities collapsed
as panicky investors sought refuge in bullion and U.S.
Treasuries.
 Analysts scrambled to revise up gold forecasts and gold
volatility spiked as options traders put on bullish bets.
 News on Sunday of a European Central Bank bond-buying
program to help shore up Italian and Spanish debt proved too
little to soothe global market fears of a double-dip recession,
greater government intervention and further market turmoil, any
of which could extend gold's 15 percent rally since July.
 In the first session since S&P's downgrade, U.S. gold
futures  posted their biggest one-day gain since March
2009. Traders are now looking ahead to Tuesday's Federal
Reserve policy meeting, with growing expectations it may hint
at an even longer period of ultra-easy monetary policy.
 ""People are concerned about outright default of sovereign
debt in Europe, and inflation in the United States because of
money printing,"" said Evan Smith, a portfolio manager at U.S.
Global Investors, which has $2.5 billion in assets.
 ""Gold will continue to move higher ... It doesn't appear
that policies on government spending and debt reduction will
change in the near term,"" Smith said.
 Spot gold  was up 3.1 percent at $1,714.09 an ounce
by 3:51 p.m. EDT (1951 GMT), having hit a record $1,719.99 and
marking all-time highs when priced in sterling  and
the euro .
 Silver  rose 1.6 percent to $38.90 an ounce.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$61.40 at $1,713.20 an ounce. Trading volume was near 300,000
lots, one of the busiest sessions this year.
 Bullion's $50 gain was also its biggest one-day price
increase since November 2008, when equity markets plummeted
following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.
 Adjusted for inflation, bullion is one of the few in the
commodity complex trading below its adjusted all-time highs
estimated at $2,500 an ounce.
 JPMorgan  said on Monday it expects spot gold to
climb to $2,500 an ounce or higher by year-end, on very high
volatility, following the downgrade of U.S. debt. The U.S. bank
said its previous estimate of $1,800 was ""too conservative"".

 GOLD VOLATILITY SPIKES
 The CBOE Gold ETF Volatility Index <.GVZ>, which is often
referred to as the ""Gold VIX"" and is based on SPDR Gold Trust
 options, spiked 30 percent to its highest since May
2010.
 ""At any given moment the world's central banks could step
up in an effort to calm a frantic situation. Gold may have been
a one-way bet for some investors but as the risks to growth
reach boiling point, so too does the price of protecting
against a volatile movement in either direction,"" said Andrew
Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group.
 The share prices of gold producers, measured by the ARCA
Gold BUGS index <.HUI>, sharply lagged bullion as Wall Street
dived. Still, Barrick Gold's  shares were among the top
U.S. percentage gainers, while the price of SPDR Gold Trust
, the No. 1 gold exchange-traded fund which largely tracks
bullion's performance, rose sharply.
 Gold benefited from safe-haven buying even as the ECB
purchased about 2 billion euros in Italian and Spanish debt,
the first time the central bank broadened its bond-buying
program to include the euro zone's third- and fourth-biggest
economies, aiming to avert a financial meltdown. [GVD/EUR]
 ""Investors are looking upon the ECB bond-buying as the
first step towards the same kind of quantitative easing program
the Fed is doing,"" said James Rife, assistant portfolio manager
at Haber Trilix Advisors, which manages $2 billion in assets.
 ""So, gold acts as the only currency that you can't print
more of, and you are seeing a huge institutional demand for
it.""
 The price of the yellow metal rose above that of platinum
for the first time since December 2008. Platinum prices turned
lower on worries about demand from carmakers and were last up
0.1 percent at $1,713.49 an ounce .
 Palladium  was down 3.1 percent at $716.97. Palladium
has fallen about 14 percent in the last six sessions from a
five-month high, weighed down heavily by worries over auto
demand.

fourth record high in five days on Monday after pledges by the

with stability failed to calm investors.	
 Gold in euros rose to 1,196.83 euros an ounce,

earlier gains made after the ECB widened its bond-buying
programme to include debt from Spain and Italy, which has been

 By Lewa Pardomuan	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Bullion roared to record highs
above $1,700 an ounce on Monday as an unprecedented downgrade to
the U.S. credit rating sent investors scrambling out of riskier
assets, hammering equity markets and the dollar.	
 Both U.S. gold futures and cash gold could rise further if
pledges by the Group of Seven nations to support battered
financial markets fail to bear fruit as investors turn their
attention to the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee, the
FOMC, meeting on Tuesday. 
 The one notch downgrade by Standard & Poor's of the U.S.
long-term rating on Friday added to the threat of contagion from
the euro debt crisis, fears over recession in the United States
and even the possibility of a third round of U.S. quantitative
easing. 
 Spot gold touched a lifetime high around $1,714 an
ounce, its 11th record in 19 sessions -- lifting the price of
silver by more than 5 percent. The U.S. December gold
 contract also hit a record about $1,718 an ounce.	
 ""What people are realising is that dollar and euro
currencies have real problems and I think that's manifesting in
the gold price,"" said Dominic Schnider, an analyst at UBS Wealth
Management. 
 ""That's why we increased the gold price to $1,800, but I
would say the way things evolve right now I really could even
imagine $2,000 being in the cards. The chances have increased
that we'll reach $2,000 -- the forecast remains 12-month $1,800,
but the risk is that we will actually hit towards $2,000."" 
 Premiums for gold bars were mostly steady as purchases from
investors who are worried about the state of the global economy
helped the physical market offset pressure from record bullion
prices. Premiums for gold bars were at $1 in Hong Kong and 60
cents in Singapore. 
 
 
 Finance chiefs from the world's industrial powers pledged on
Sunday to take whatever actions were needed to steady financial
markets, spooked by the political wrangling in Europe and the
United States over slashing their huge budget deficits.

 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said U.S. Treasury debt
is as safe as it was before the S&P downgrade, urging European
leaders to ensure there is an ""unequivocal financial backstop""
for euro zone governments facing fiscal and debt problems.

 ""I guess the uncertainty in the financial markets is keeping
gold prices underpinned. It's essentially safe-haven buying,""
said Ong Yi Ling, investment analyst at Phillip Futures.	
 ""One of the events that investors will watch is of course
the FOMC meeting that is scheduled Tuesday ... investors will
scrutinise the statement on the assessment of the economy and
outlook for monetary policy."" 
 Investors are watching for any statement on whether the Fed
will ease monetary policy further. 
 Gold priced in sterling jumped to a record around
1,043 pounds following gains in dollar-priced gold. Bullion
priced in euro was also at an all-time high.	
 Shares tumbled on Monday despite efforts by global
policymakers to stem a collapse in investor confidence after S&P
downgraded the U.S. credit rating, but the euro jumped on hopes
the ECB will act to stop Europes's debt crisis from engulfing
Italy and Spain. 
 The lingering economic crisis has been a boon for safe
havens like gold, which has risen for six successive weeks and
is up 13 percent since the start of July.	
 Gold, which has gained more than 20 percent this year, had
shrugged off data showing the U.S. economy generated 117,000
jobs last month and unemployment fell to 9.1 percent. 
 The dip in the jobless rate reflected more of a contraction
in the size of the work force than an improved employment
picture. 
 ""I think troubles in Europe are also undermining markets.
Progress in dealing with Europe sovereign debt issues is
painfully slow,"" said Natalie Robertson, a commodities
strategist at ANZ.	
 ""But prices are overbought at the moment. If you look at the
RSI, it's above the 70 level. If you look at technicals, it
could be vulnerable to some profit taking."" 
 Data released by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed managed money in gold futures and options
raised their net length to a five-year high in the week up to
Aug. 2. 
 In the energy market, crude fell more than $2 a barrel on
Monday on the S&P downgrade.

 By Matthew Robinson
 NEW YORK, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Oil plunged 5 percent on
Monday, crashing below technical support levels as the
reduction of the top-tier U.S. credit rating hammered markets
and stoked concerns of an economic slowdown.
 Brent crude broke below the 200-day moving average,
extending a correction that has sent prices off more than 18
percent from 2011 peaks hit in April as traders weighed the
prospect of a second recession on the already shaky oil demand
outlook. Prices are down $13 a barrel since the start of August
alone.
 ""In the tumultuous aftermath of the U.S. downgrade from
S&P, the world also is downgrading the oil market,"" said Phil
Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago.
 Trading volumes spiked as the oil sell-off accelerated late
in the day, triggered as stock markets tumbled in the first
session since Standard & Poor's cut the AAA U.S. credit
rating.
 The S&P 500 Index slid 6 percent in its biggest daily drop
since Dec. 1, 2008, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost
5.55 percent. [ID:nN1E7771Q2]
 Brent crude  dropped $5.63 to settle at $103.74 a
barrel, substantially below the 200-day moving average of
$106.89 and down more than $23 from the 2011 peak over $127 a
barrel hit in April. [ID:nN1E77710N]
 U.S. crude  traded down $5.57 to settle at $81.31 a
barrel, the lowest close since Nov. 23. It then dropped as low
as $80.17 a barrel in post-settlement activity, down $34 from
the 2011 peak of $114 a barrel struck on May 2.
 ""There is so much uncertainty and fear about a double-dip
recession that it's hard to say we'll find any support at those
levels,"" said Gene McGillian, analyst for Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut, who added he was watching for a break
below $80 a barrel on U.S. crude.
 U.S. crude trading volumes were nearly 40 percent over the
30-day average and Brent volumes were 28 percent over that
average in late afternoon activity.
 Brent's premium to U.S. crude also blew out more than $1 to
$23.54 a barrel in late activity, just three cents shy of the
record hit in July.
 Investors again flocked to gold as a safe haven, sending
prices to a record over $1,700 an ounce, while selling off
other commodities including grains and copper. [ID:nL3E7J8033]
 U.S. Treasury prices also soared, with benchmark 10-year
notes  at one point rising over two points in price.
Yields fell as low as 2.33 percent, the lowest since February
2009. [ID:nN1E7771KE]
 DEMAND WORRIES
 The S&P downgrade added to concern about energy demand in
the world's top oil consumer. U.S. gasoline demand for July
fell to the lowest level since 2003, according to data from the
U.S. Energy Information Administration.
 ""Investors are looking at the weakness in the stock market
as it signals that oil demand will be hurt,"" said Joe
Posillico, broker for MF Global in New York City.
 Analysts polled by Reuters forecast weekly oil inventory
data would reinforce the bearish picture, with crude stockpiles
seen up 1.5 million barrels for the week to Aug. 5, with
gasoline and distillate stockpiles also expected to show a
build. [ID:nN1E7700IA]
 Oil company shares were slightly weaker than crude futures,
with the CBOE Oil Companies Index shedding 6.30 percent, led by
declines in EOG Resources , Apache Corp  and
Chevron Corp .

 Analysts warned oil prices could fall further if a second
recession takes hold, but both Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs
maintained their 2012 price forecasts. [ID:nL3E7J8125]
 ""We believe that WTI crude oil prices could briefly drop to
$50 under a recession scenario,"" Merrill Lynch said in a note,
but it maintained its 2012 average forecast for U.S. crude at
$102 a barrel and its forecast for Brent next year at $114.
 Technical indicators also suggested the selling may abate.
On the 14-day relative strength index, U.S. oil dropped to 22,
the lowest level since the third quarter of 2008 and well below
the 30 level often interpreted as a sign a commodity has been
oversold. Brent crude also dropped below 30 for the second time
this month.

 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures rose
slightly on Friday to end a five-day losing streak on a
positive jobs report and a pipeline fire in Iran.
 But for the week, crude futures suffered a loss of more

 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Friday, clawing
back from one of its biggest routs since the financial crisis,
as upbeat U.S. jobs data and news of an Italian austerity plan
offered hope for staving off a second recession that would dent
energy demand.
 An Iranian pipeline fire and a refinery fire in Memphis,
Tennessee, underpinned prices, which rebounded modestly. For
the week, U.S. crude fell 9 percent, its biggest weekly decine
since early May.
 Trade was volatile, with investors jittery over European
finances and the U.S. economy. Wall Street stocks vacillated,
but ended the day almost unchanged after rallying on news that
Italy had pledged to speed up austerity measure in return for
help with funding from the European Central Bank.

prices keep falling. [ID:nL6E7J50SQ]

 ICE Brent crude for September  rose $2.12 to settle
at $109.37 a barrel, having jumped to $110.26 in reaction to
the jobs data. For the week, Brent slumped 6.3 percent, having
touched a nearly six-week low of $104.30 on Thursday.
 U.S. September crude  rose 25 cents to settle at
$86.88 a barrel, ending a five-day string of losses, though it
continued to see-saw near flat in post-settlement trading.
 The settlement was well off a $88.32 peak reached after the
jobs report, having bounced off previous session trough of
$82.87, the lowest since Nov. 26, 2010.
 U.S. gasoline  and heating oil  futures rose on
Friday on Brent's strong rebound and news that a fire caused by

 NEW YORK, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Gold resumed its rally on
Friday as an unexpectedly upbeat U.S. payrolls report and
glimmers of hope for an end to the euro zone debt crisis failed
to entice investors back toward riskier assets.
 Gold was briefly hit on Thursday with a bout of liquidation
by traders scrambling to raise cash to meet margin calls in
battered stock markets, but by Friday it had found its footing
again as investors bet that nothing short of further government
intervention would stave off deepening woes.
 The possibility of more Japanese yen intervention, European
bond buying and even a third round of U.S. quantitative easing
left investors with few options besides gold, some traders
said. Bullion is up 12 percent after five weeks of gains.
 ""They just don't know what the next shoe to drop is,"" said
Bruce Dunn, vice president of trading at bullion dealer
Auramet. ""Other than piling into the Swiss franc, yen and
Treasuries, there is really nothing else to invest, so that's
why everybody is piling into gold.""
 Spot gold  was up 0.8 percent at $1,661.09 an ounce
by 3:55 PM EDT (1955 GMT), after it hit a record high of
$1,681.67 early on Thursday.
 U.S. December gold futures  settled down $7.20 at
$1,651.80 an ounce. Futures volume topped 200,000 lots for a
third straight day as investors sought safe havens.
 Data released by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission showed managed money in gold futures and options
raised their net length to a five-year high in the week up to
Aug. 2.

 Silver  fell 1.6 percent to $38.20 an ounce.
 Gold benefited from a surge in volatility among U.S. stocks
Friday. The S&P lost 10 percent in the last 10 sessions on
intense fears the U.S. and euro zone economy are tipping back
into recession. [.N]
 The inverse 25-day correlation log coefficient between gold
and the S&P 500 tightened to a 0.7, its strongest level in
eight years.
 Bullion firmed after sources close to the matter told
Reuters the European Central Bank is ready to buy Italian and
Spanish bonds if key structural reforms are brought forward by
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. [ID:nL3E7J5149]
 The news came a day after the ECB resumed buying government
bonds, marking a fresh round of central bank money easing.
 Independent investor Dennis Gartman, however, said a
bearish technical reversal and market preference for cash over
riskier assets had prompted him to cut his gold positions by
half. [ID:nN1E7740NX]
 RECESSION FEARS REMAIN, FOMC EYED
 Gold mostly held in positive territory even after U.S.
government data showed the economy generated 117,000 jobs last
month and unemployment fell to 9.1 percent. However, the dip in
the jobless rate reflected more of a contraction in the size of
the work force than an improved employment picture.
 The employment data eased pressure on the U.S. Federal
Reserve to take new action to boost growth after a string of
lackluster economic data this week. [ID:nN1E774089]
 ""Gold is reacting to a gloomy economic outlook and the
expected responses by governments, as it is very plausible to
expect that governments will keep printing paper money,"" said
James Dailey, portfolio manager of TEAM Financial Asset
Management, which oversees $200 million in assets.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 5 (Reuters) - U.S. crude extended losses on
Friday to below $86, heading for its biggest weekly drop since
early May, after fears of a global economic slowdown drove
investors to the exits in a commodities sell-off that has wiped
out oil's gains in 2011.	
 Brent has dropped by nearly 9 percent and U.S. crude by
about 10 percent this week. Fears of the U.S. sliding back
toward recession after disappointing economic indicators and
Europe's escalating debt crisis reignited concerns of a slowdown
in oil consumption. Traders now await July nonfarm payrolls,
which may increase by 85,000, after rising 18,000 in June.	
 U.S. crude  fell by as much as $1.40 to $85.23 a
barrel, the lowest prices since Feb. 17. It was down 85 cents at
$85.78 at 0211 GMT, after plunging almost 6 percent on Thursday,
the biggest daily drop since May 5. Brent  was unchanged
at $107.25, after dropping almost $6 on Thursday.	
 ""The U.S. economy appears headed for a double dip
recession,"" said Monty Guild, chief executive officer of Guild
Investment Management. ""Even though we expect weak economic
activity will lead to more money printing from central banks,
the markets are going through a rugged period which makes us
want to reduce our exposure.""	
 Guild recommended oil investors to take profits.	
 Commodities continued their slide, extending Thursday's rout
triggered by a global stampede away from riskier assets. Asian
stocks tumbled as much as 5 percent after the worst sell-off on
Wall Street since the global financial crisis. 
 Barclays Capital, one of the most bullish forecasters of oil
prices this year, now sees slower global demand growth this
year. In a report to be published in the next few days, Barclays
Capital now sees global oil demand increasing by 1.1 million
barrels per day (bpd) this year to 88.68 million bpd, to reflect
the dramatic economic slowdown. 
 The investment bank previously forecast a rise in oil demand
this year of 1.56 million bpd and two months ago expected the
increase to be as much as 1.7 million. The sharp reduction would
take it from one of the most bullish on growth to one of the
most bearish, according to a Reuters poll two months ago.	
 
 The European Central Bank resumed buying government bonds
after a four-month break and announced new longer-term funding
for liquidity-starved banks. But after a brief hiccup, Italian
and Spanish bond yields continued their inexorable climb towards
danger levels. 
 U.S. weekly jobless claims on Thursday suggested a marginal
improvement in the labor market, following disappointing
manufacturing and consumer spending data earlier this week. 
 
 DEMAND OUTLOOK 
 U.S. gasoline futures led Thursday's slump, with their
premium over U.S. crude falling to the lowest in a month after
stockpile data added to evidence that expensive fuel and a weak
economy have reduced demand in the world's top user. 
 As crude oil broke below its weeks-long trading range,
implied volatility in the options market spiked to the highest
since the May 5 melt-down. The so-called Oil VIX index
based on NYMEX options surged more than 26 percent. (Volatility

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Gold recoiled from a record
high in heavy volume on Thursday, as mounting recession fears
fed a global stock market maelstrom that forced investors to
liquidate bullion profits to cover losses elsewhere.
 As the global stock market sell-off accelerated and major
U.S. stock indexes tumbled 4 percent, safe-haven buying of gold
quickly gave way to liquidation as investors scrambled to meet
margins calls.
 In an abrupt midday reversal, gold slid as much as $40 from
an all-time high. This surprised some traders who had expected
gold to extend its record run on new government currency and
bond market interventions and a likely renewal of monetary
easing by the Federal Reserve to revive the U.S. economy.
 Silver slumped over 7 percent too in one of the biggest
risk asset sell-offs since early 2009, while U.S. Treasury
prices and the dollar soared in tandem as holdings of last
resort. Investors braced for a Friday U.S. payrolls report that
threatened to extend a run of gloomy economic data.
 ""You see the markets re-price all terms of risks and the
dollar is rallying. So, I don't see why gold would be a safe
haven today,"" said Jeffrey Sherman, commodities portfolio
manager at DoubleLine Capital, which oversees $13 billion in
assets.
 ""Gold looks completely out of steam. There is really no
benefit to owning gold right now because it's not that you are
worrying about inflation yet. There could be some worries about
government printing money but that's not imminent anymore.""
 Gold  was down 0.6 percent at $1,651.40 an ounce by
3:33 PM EDT (1933 GMT), having earlier hit a record $1,681.67.
Gold mining stocks measured by the Arca Gold BUGS index <.HUI>
slumped over 6 percent.
 U.S. gold futures for August delivery  settled down
$7.30 at $1,659 an ounce. Trading was frantic, with volume near
320,000 lots, set to be one of the strongest this year.
 The sudden fall from bullion's peak caused a surge in
demand for options to protect bullish positions. Gold option
volatility also spiked more than 12 percent to a 2011 high.
 Silver  plunged 7 percent to $38.76.
 As investors fled stocks, the S&P 500 index slid into
correction territory on mounting worry about the U.S. economy
and Europe. Oil tumbled 5 percent and other commodities also
slumped broadly. The dollar index surged 1.5 percent while the
yen fell sharply after Japan intervened. [.N] [O/R] [.CRB]
[FRX/]
 ""When you get outside markets down significantly, some
investors liquidate their winning positions in the gold and
silver market longs to raise margins and support their losing
trades,"" Phillip Streible, senior market strategist with
futures broker MF Global.
 Even as technical indicators showed the gold market was in
overbought territory, most analysts said any pullback would be
short-lived because there was enough safe-haven buying and
economic fears to put a floor on prices.
 ""The only thing that would stop the momentum in gold at
this point is an increase in margins. I bet that's coming
sooner or later,"" said independent investor Dennis Gartman.
 There was market chatter about an increase in margins for
gold futures after bullion's 12 percent rally since July. The
CME Group, which runs the U.S. futures market, has not made any
announcement about a margin hike in gold or silver.
 RALLY ON MONEY EASING VIEW FIZZLES
 Early in the session, bullion hit its third record in four
days on safe-haven demand after new U.S. claims for
unemployment benefits were little changed last week. A string
of lackluster U.S. data including disappointing manufacturing
and private-sector jobs reports earlier this week also pointed
to a halt in economic growth.
 Bullion also hit all-time highs in euro ,
sterling  and yen  in early trading.
 Gold initially benefited as the European Central Bank
resumed buying government bonds, marking a fresh round of
central bank money easing. The news failed to clam fears as
Italian and Spanish bond yields climbed towards danger levels.
 Investors are already jittery about a chaotic currency
market after interventions by Japan and Switzerland, a possible
downgrade to the U.S. AAA credit rating and a widening euro
debt crisis. The dollar and U.S. Treasury debt appeared to be
the only winners across a broadly lower global markets.
 Investor buying have underpinned bullion prices given
concerns Europe and the United States may tip back into
recession.

 NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Oil tumbled as much as 6
percent on Thursday, with U.S. crude crashing through technical
support to its lowest since February as mounting fears of a
stalled economy set off a global race from riskier assets.
 In one of the sharpest sell-offs since the financial
crisis, oil prices fell as European bond buying and Japanese
currency intervention fueled risk aversion across financial
markets. In-line weekly U.S. jobs data failed to quell anxiety
about slower growth that is already eroding oil demand.
 U.S. crude turned negative for the year, while other
commodities were also hammered as investors shed risky assets.
In late trading, the dollar <.DXY> rose 1.52 percent against a
basket of currencies and bonds rallied, while Wall Street dived
nearly 5 percent, its biggest slump in more than two years.
 ""A range of commodities are under selling pressure as a
general 'risk-off' flow continues from investors suddenly far
less complacent regarding the strength of the global economy,""
said Tim Evans, analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New
York.
 In London, ICE Brent for September delivery  settled
at $107.25 a barrel, falling $5.98, or 5.28 percent. It has
slumped nearly 8 percent in two days, and now faces a test of
key support at the 200-day moving average aorund $106.65.
 U.S. crude for September delivery  settled at $86.63
a barrel, sliding $5.30, or 5.77 percent, the biggest daily
percentage loss since May 5 and the lowest close since Feb. 18.
Prices are now some 24 percent off their late April, 2-1/2-year
high, crossing into technical bear market territory.
 On a settlement basis, the year's gains for U.S. crude have
been wiped out, as U.S. crude ended 2010 at $91.38.
 Losses accelerated around midday after breaking below key
support at the June triple-bottom low of $89.61, with technical
analysts now looking toward an $85 target.

 ""This week's sharp price decline has little to do with any
oil-specific headlines but much to do with speculative
liquidation, risk aversion, a major momentum reversal during
the past week, trend line violation, confidence crisis, U.S.
dollar strength and stock market weakness,"" said Jim
Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena,
Illinois.
 U.S. weekly jobless claims data suggested a marginal
improvement in the labor market, but not enough to ease fears
about the economy. Traders are now awaiting Friday's release of
U.S. jobs data July. Forecasters polled by Reuters expected
nonfarm payrolls rose 85,000, after rising 18,000 in June.

options activity spiked as traders rushed to manage positions.

 U.S. gasoline for September delivery  closed at
$2.7372 a gallon, down 19.41 cents, or 6.62 percent,
front-month gasoline's biggest one-day percentage loss since a
7.6 percent fall on May 11. The day's low of $2.7280 was the
lowest since the Feb. 28 intraday low of $2.70. From Monday,
the contract has fallen nearly 32 cents, or 10 percent.
 U.S. gasoline's crack spread -- the profit refiners make
per barrel after processing crude into motor fuel -- hit
$28.05, the narrowest since 27.23 on July 6. 
 As crude oil broke below its weeks-long trading range,
implied volatility in the options market spiked to the highest
since the May 5 melt-down. The so-called Oil VIX index <.OVX>
based on NYMEX options surged more than 26 percent. (Volatily

 SINGAPORE, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Gold, pressured on Thursday by
a surging dollar as Japan intervened to rein in its currency,
scaled back earlier gains but remained firmly supported by
worries about the widening euro zone debt crisis and slowing
global growth.	
 ""Gold seems to have wings at the moment as there are lots of
macro and sovereign debt uncertainties,"" said David Thurtell, an
analyst at Citigroup.	
 ""The price of $1,700 seems easy in the current climate, and
the market is probably targeting $2,000 now.""	
 Spot gold eased from an intra-day high of $1,668.76
to $1,662 an ounce by 0625 GMT, little changed from the previous
close. It hit a record of $1,672.65 in the previous session.	
 U.S. gold  edged down 0.1 percent to $1,664.6 an
ounce, off the all-time high of $1,675.9 on Wednesday.	
 The yen tumbled as Japan intervened to curb the strength of
its currency, sending the dollar surging 3 percent against the
yen and gaining nearly 0.8 percent versus a basket of
currencies . 
 Japan's move came a day after Switzerland unexpectedly cut
interest rates to counter the rally of Swiss franc, to which
investors have flocked for security from a spreading euro zone
debt crisis and a shaky global economic outlook.	
 The same sentiment has helped drive gold to nine record
highs in the past three weeks.	
 Technical analysis suggested that gold could rise to $1,679
an ounce in the short term, said Reuters market analyst Wang
Tao. 
 The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for gold, climbed to
near 75, its highest since the end of April during bullion's
previous record-setting rally. An RSI reading above 70 indicates
the market is overbought.	
 
 
 
 The European Central Bank is expected to halt its rate hike
cycle and probably signal a readiness to buy bonds again, as
investors closely watch Spain's bond auction later in the day.

 Investors are also eyeing the key U.S. payrolls data for
July due on Friday, after a recent spate of disappointing data,
including slowing manufacturing sector growth and faltering
consumer spending fueled fears of deteriorating economic
conditions. 
 Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest
gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose for a second day straight
to 1,286.30 tonnes on Wednesday, highest since late December. 
 The amount of gold held by the fund grew nearly 7 percent
since the beginning of July, compared to a 6-percent, or
72-tonne, outflow in the first half of the year. 
 Recent reports of central banks' gold purchases reassured
investors that gold's bull run may have a long way to go.

 ""Gold is not a punters' market, as there's real demand but
not just hot money that drives prices higher,"" said a
Singapore-based trader. 
 ""Every dip has found pretty secure demand, and I don't know
if we are going to see the long-awaited brutal sell-down people
seem to have been anticipating.""	
 Spot silver rose as high as $42, matching a three
month high set on Wednesday. Silver is far from breaking its
record of $49.51 set at the end of April, but led the precious
metals complex with a gain of 35 percent so far this year. It
lost 0.2 percent to $41.59.	
 Spot gold has risen about 17 percent so far this year.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Oil posted a modest rebound
from one-month lows on Thursday, tracking a bounce in Asian
stock markets ahead of key U.S. employment reports expected to
shed further light on whether a recovery in the world's largest
economy is faltering.	
 U.S. crude  rose 21 cents to $92.14 a barrel by 0239
GMT, after dipping for a fourth straight session on Wednesday to
$91.93, the lowest close since June 27. Brent  added 1
cent to $113.24, after slumping more than $3 a day earlier. 
 Investors are awaiting Thursday's U.S. jobless benefits
claims report and Friday's key nonfarm payrolls data that is
forecast to show the economy gained 85,000 jobs in July. ADP
data on Wednesday showed U.S. private employers added more jobs
than expected in July. 
 ""Today it's just a relief rebound after quite a drastic drop
in both crude benchmarks overnight,"" said Serene Lim, a
Singapore-based oil analyst at ANZ.	
 ""There is a mild risk-on investor sentiment after U.S.
stocks were stronger. ADP employment data was generally quite
positive, setting a positive stage for non-farm payrolls.""	
 Still, Lim said markets would remain jittery after
front-month Brent moved below its 100-day moving average price,
a key support level for chart watchers, adding that Brent had
""negative momentum."" The moving average now stands close to $117
a barrel, more than $3 higher than the current price.
 
 
 
 Gasoline futures led the oil complex lower on Wednesday
after government data showed U.S. stockpiles of the fuel rose
sharply last week while demand over the past four weeks fell 3.6
percent from a year ago. This stirred worries about tepid
consumption during the peak summer demand period. 
 U.S. gasoline inventories last week rose for the third
straight week, up 1.7 million barrels. Four-week average demand,
at 9.07 million barrels per day, was the lowest since the week
to May 20.	
 Still, crude stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery
point for the U.S. oil futures contract dropped to the lowest
level since December.	
 Brent's premium against U.S. crude , also known
as West Texas Intermediate and priced at Cushing, narrowed to
$21.33. The premium rose to $23.03 on Tuesday, which was the
widest since the $23.57 record set on July 14.  
 
 SLOWDOWN AND DEBT CRISIS	
 A closely-watched index of the vast U.S. services sector
unexpectedly fell in July from June, and new U.S. factory orders
fell in June, reducing the prospects of a rebound in the second
half of the year. 
 In other markets, Tokyo's Nikkei jumped on Thursday as the
yen fell broadly after Japanese authorities intervened to weaken
the currency, a day after the Swiss central bank surprised
markets by cutting interest rates to rein in the high-flying
franc. 
 Other Asian stock markets also drifted higher, but worries
about global growth were likely to limit investor enthusiasm.
The surge in safe-haven gold paused at $1,662 an ounce as
riskier assets made a tentative comeback.	
 The European Union acknowledged on Wednesday that investors
now doubt whether the euro zone can overcome its debt crisis and
Italy's Silvio Berlusconi called for more action to ward off
market attacks.

 * Gold at second successive record
 * U.S., European debt burdens in focus
 * Thailand, Russia buy gold in June

 By Amanda Cooper	
 LONDON, Aug 3 - (Reuters) - Gold hit a record for a second
straight day on Wednesday, powered by deepening fears over the
spread of the euro zone debt crisis, while the most recent batch
of U.S. data did not dispel concern about the world's biggest
economy.	
 The United States avoided an unprecedented debt default on
Tuesday with a last-minute deal on raising the country's
borrowing limit.	
 But credit ratings agencies are unconvinced over resilience
of U.S. finances, especially as growth has been patchy enough to
spark fresh market speculation about what policy measures the
Federal Reserve might use to boost the economy. 
 The nervousness over the U.S. economy was compounded by the
latest developments in Europe, where Italian bond yields rose to
their highest in over a decade above 6 percent, a level widely
viewed as unsustainable, adding to the lure of gold as a
safe-haven investment.	
 Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund's monthly report
on central bank reserves showed Thailand, Russia and Kazakhstan,
among others, added to their holdings of gold two months ago,
prolonging the trend in the official sector to put more of their
reserves into bullion rather than hard currencies.	
 Spot gold was last quoted at $1,668.06 an ounce, up
0.5 percent on the day at 1410 GMT, having hit a record
$1,672.65 earlier. U.S. gold futures  were last up 1.6
percent at $1,671.00 an ounce.	
 ""The current fundamentals in the gold market are supportive
of these higher prices. The key factors that have been driving
investment demand for gold - concerns about sovereign debt
burdens, the long-term value of certain reserve currencies and
fear of persistent inflation - are likely to continue for the
foreseeable future,"" said Tom Holl, co-manager of the BlackRock
World Resources Fund.	
 Data on Wednesday showed U.S. private employers added more
jobs than expected in July, though less than in June, but
planned layoffs rose to a 16-month high, and the services sector
grew at its slowest pace in 17 months.	
 In Europe, Italy sought political support from the European
Union as its stocks and bonds came under fire, while the Spanish
prime minister held crisis talks about the worrying spike in
yields.	
 ""If you look at the European bond markets, you will see
yields on Italian and Spanish bonds are back above 6 percent, so
this crisis, unfortunately, seems to be spreading to Italy and
Spain, which is also potentially more serious than Greece,
because they're much larger,"" said Jesper Dannesboe, senior
commodities strategist at Societe Generale.	
 ""Gold is reacting to this and that is the main driver right
now,"" he said.	
 Further unnerving the financial markets was the Swiss
National Bank's decision to cut rates to fight the strength of
the currency , which set the price of gold in Swiss francs
on course for its biggest one-day gain since May.

 Further bolstering gold, the IMF data showed Thailand
boosted its gold reserves for the third time in the last year,
by 18.66 tonnes in June to 127.524 tonnes. Korea said earlier
this week it bought gold for the first time in over 10 years in
June and July. 
 Gold is set for a 17 percent gain in 2011, which would mark
an eleventh successive year of price rises. 
 This increase has been driven largely by the U.S. Federal
Reserve's ultra-low monetary policy and concern that slow growth
and the burden to the economy from the country's debt could
derail the recovery process of the last two years.	
 Gold is on course for its strongest quarterly performance
since the second quarter of last year.	
 Holdings of gold in exchange-traded products rose for an
eighth day, to their highest level this year, after an inflow of
more than half a million ounces into the world's largest
bullion-backed ETF, the SPDR Gold Trust , which is now
showing a net inflow for the year for the first time.	
 ""The lack of a decent gold pullback has left many investors
feeling frustrated and patience for a better buying opportunity
is now wearing quite thin, which is why gold has attracted very
decent buying this week,"" said UBS strategist Edel Tully in a
note, adding the size of the speculative position in U.S. gold
futures posed a downside risk to gold.	
 ""But given that these are not ordinary times, ordinary
rules do not apply,"" she said, adding that the bank had raised
its three-month price forecast to $1,850, from $1,600.	
 In other precious metals, silver hovered near three
month highs, trading 1.9 percent higher on the day at $41.54 an
ounce, while platinum and palladium fell.	
 Spot platinum was last down 0.6 percent at $1,780.99
an ounce, while palladium was down 2.1 percent, having
released earlier gains, to trade at $804.97 an ounce.

 By Zaida Espana	
 LONDON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices fell on Wednesday
after ratings agency Moody's assigned a negative outlook to the
United States, stoking concern that demand may fall as the
world's top oil user faces longer-term fiscal and economic
challenges.	
 Worries are growing that major economies may slip back into
recession as Europe's debt crisis deepens and after global
manufacturing data proved disappointing. The slowdown is having
a direct impact on U.S. oil demand as consumer spending and
gasoline use crumble.	
 Brent  slid 81 cents to $115.65 a barrel by 0832 GMT,
almost $12 below this year's peak above $127. U.S. crude 
fell 44 cents to $93.35 a barrel, the lowest intraday price
since June 29. 
 The passing of a deal saving the U.S. from default triggered
fleeting relief amid investors, but focus remained to the
longer term challenges for the world's largest economy and the
euro zone's troubles. 
 ""Fears for demand destruction are ever-present, while weak
manufacturing PMI numbers from across the globe this week only
add fuel to economic concerns,"" VTB Capital's Andrey Kryuchenkov
said. ""The market is starting to look weak technically and
persistent risk aversion on the broader market could drive crude
lower in the short run. No one is prepared to go long just yet.""	
 Disappointing economic data also encouraged investors to
reduce exposure to risk and seek the safe havens of the Swiss
franc and gold.	
 ""Even if the debt ceiling issue in the U.S. has been
cleared, that is only successful in that it avoids a default,""
said Ken Hasegawa, a commodity derivatives manager at Japan's
Newedge brokerage.	
 ""The deficit is still a big problem and that is creating
financial fear. People are decreasing gasoline consumption,""
Hasegawa said.	
 Spanish and Italian 10-year government bond yield spreads
over the benchmark German bund widened further on Wednesday as
contagion from the euro zone debt crisis continued to spread
amid a bleak outlook for global growth. 
 In Spain, data from the dominant services sector showed a
sharp contraction in July, mirroring the weakness in factory
output and signalling that the fragile economy could contract in
the third quarter. 


 
 MOODY'S ASSIGNS NEGATIVE OUTLOOK	
 Moody's Investors Service late on Tuesday confirmed its Aaa
rating of the United States, citing the decision to raise the
debt limit, but assigned a negative outlook that could pressure
lawmakers to cut the deficit. 
 The decision by Moody's came a few hours after rival Fitch
Ratings upheld its AAA rating of the U.S. Fitch also warned the
world's largest economy must cut its debt burden to avoid a
future downgrade.	
 The greater need for fiscal discipline comes as the slowdown
of the U.S. economy intensifies.	
 U.S. consumer spending dropped in June for the first time in
nearly two years and incomes barely rose, signs the economy
lacked momentum as the second quarter drew to a close.

 The nation's retail gasoline demand fell 3.1 percent in the
week to July 29 from a year earlier, as price gains since the
beginning of July weighed on consumption, MasterCard said.

 Industry group the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday
said gasoline stocks jumped a bigger-than-expected 2.5 million
barrels and distillate stocks rose in line with forecasts by 1.4
million barrels. 
 U.S. crude inventories unexpectedly fell 3.3 million barrels
last week. Inventory statistics from the U.S. government's
Energy Information Administration will follow on Wednesday. 
 Tuesday's data followed weak manufacturing readings a day
earlier from the U.S., Europe and China and last week's
disappointing second-quarter U.S. GDP estimate, which reinforced
fears that slowing economic growth threatens to dampen oil
demand.
 A series of U.S. employment data releases from Wednesday
through Friday will be closely watched.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Gold hit a record high on
Wednesday, as investors made a beeline for bullion to shelter
from the impact of a deteriorating global economic outlook and
Europe's worsening debt crisis.	
 Spot gold rose to an all-time high of $1,671.39 an
ounce, hitting its ninth record in 16 trading sessions and up 17
percent so far this year. It was trading at $1,661.89 by 0632
GMT, up 0.2 percent from the previous close.	
 U.S. gold  scored a record high at $1,674.6, and
eased to $1,664.7.	
 Gold priced in sterling and euro also reached historical
highs. 
 In Japan, benchmark TOCOM gold futures contract  rose
to as high as 4,130 yen per gram ($1,664.39 per ounce), the
second highest since it hit a record at 4,326 yen on September
9, 1982, according to the exchange.	
 U.S. politicians completed a last-gasp deal to avoid a
default on Tuesday, but there was little relief for markets as
investors focused instead on how tighter fiscal policy could
constrict growth of the world's largest economy.	
 The size of the U.S. debt remained a concern for rating
agency Moody's. Moody's retained its triple-A rating for the
United States but assigned a negative outlook to it,
underscoring the threat of a future downgrade that would drive
up the cost of borrowing and could slow future growth.	
 ""People are gravely concerned over government credit and the
fact that the U.S. doesn't seem to be offering satisfying
measures to assure fiscal positions and there is the sense that
it will ultimately have some kind of real consequences in the
markets,"" said a Singapore-based trader.	
 ""We are seeing a fairly large scale of capital flight not
just out of the dollar, but out of other currencies as well. The
precious metals market has emerged as an instrument of default,
no pun intended."" 
 Gold jumped 2.6 percent in the previous session, its biggest
gain since early November just after the U.S. Federal Reserve
launched a second round of government debt purchases, or
quantitative easing.	
 Technical analysis suggested that gold's bull run might
extend to $1,679, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao.

 
 
 South Korea's central bank said on Tuesday it spent more
than $1 billion in its first gold purchase in more than a
decade, joining the trend among central banks to diversify their
foreign reserves amid global growth uncertainties.

 Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest
gold-backed exchange-traded fund, jumped 1.4 percent to 1,281.76
tonnes, highest since end of last year. 
 ""The momentum in gold in the short term will continue to run
strong, supported by worries about global economic growth, gold
purchase by South Korea's central bank announced yesterday and
rising in SPDR Gold Trust holdings,"" said Li Ning, an analyst at
Shanghai CIFCO Futures.	
 Li expected gold to test $1,680 in the short term.	
 The latest weak data from the United States, following a
batch of dour manufacturing surveys on Monday, added to fears
over a deteriorating global economy. U.S. consumer spending
dropped in June for the first time in nearly two years and
incomes barely rose. 
 Concerns about spreading sovereign debt crisis in the euro
zone underpinned gold's strength.	
 ""It seems to me that it hasn't reached the peak, and what
the authorities have tried to do is postponing rather than
preventing what the markets want to do with government credit in
euro zone and maybe in the U.S.,"" said the Singapore-based
trader.	
 Italy found itself dragged deeper into the euro zone debt
crisis on Tuesday, prompting emergency consultations in Rome and
among European capitals.

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, Aug 2 - (Reuters) - Gold surged over 2 percent to
all-time highs on Tuesday, as investors scrambled for a safe
haven from sliding stock markets, a sputtering economy and a
potential downgrade of the top-notch U.S. credit rating.
 Bullion notched its biggest daily gain since Nov. 5, just
after the U.S. Federal Reserve launched a second round of
government debt purchases, or quantitative easing. Some
investors believe the Fed may soon embark on a third round of
dollar-printing stimulus to revive the moribund U.S. economy.
 Wall Street stocks slid more than 2 percent, while safe
havens such as Swiss franc and U.S. Treasury debt rose sharply,
after data showed consumer spending fell for the first time
since September 2009.
 After weak manufacturing and second-quarter growth data in
recent days, the economic gloom overshadowed the U.S.
deficit-cutting package that finally buried the specter of a
government default. [.N] [US/]
 Bullion also got a boost from jitters about a possible
downgrade to the U.S. AAA credit rating and news that South
Korea had added gold to its foreign reserves for the first time
since the Asian crisis of the late 1990s.
 Euro zone debt fears also triggered gold buying by jittery
investors, as yields on Italian and Spanish bonds hit their
highest levels in 14 years.
 ""The debt ceiling distraction may now be behind the
markets, but the damage has been done,"" said John Kilduff,
partner at hedge fund Again Capital LLC.
 ""We are witnessing a quickly deteriorating economic
backdrop that will pressure all asset classes. Policymakers
need to next implement measures that will foster growth.""
 Spot gold  shot 2.4 percent higher to $1,656.69 an
ounce by 4:15 PM EDT (2015 GMT), having touched its ninth
record since July at above $1,650.
 U.S. gold futures for December delivery  settled up
$22.80 at $1,644.50 an ounce.
 Silver  rose 3.8 percent to $40.750 an ounce.
 Bullion has rallied around 17 percent so far this year, and
has gained more than 10 percent since the end of June when the
Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond-buying program ended.
 Some investors worried about the risk of a recession that
could prompt the Fed to use more stimulus, feeding inflation.
 ""With the worse-than-expected manufacturing index and
personal spending data, gold is starting to factor in the need
for further quantitative easing...and that's why it's pushed
into a record,"" said James Rife, an assistant portfolio manager
at Haber Trilix Advisors, which manages $2 billion in assets.
 U.S. consumer spending slipped 0.2 percent in June, the
Commerce Department reported, a day after another report showed
factory activity cooled in June and two days after GDP figures
showed the economy came close to contraction in the first
quarter.
 FOMC MEETING, CENBANK BUYING IN FOCUS
 Financial markets will watch the Fed's policy meeting next
week for any signs of new monetary stimulus. Some market
watchers suggested Chairman Ben Bernanke may take the
opportunity at the Fed's annual retreat in Wyoming later this
month to hint at economic stimulus through a third round of
central bank bond purchases, or quantitative easing.
 ""The stock markets after the Jackson Hole speech last
August have been pricing in a lot of good news and it's not
materializing. All these money have been printing but it does
not translate to huge growth,"" said Axel Merk, portfolio
manager of Merk Funds, which has $700 million in assets.
 Merk said doubts about the viability of the currency
markets also helped propel gold to record highs.
 Gold has hit record highs in dollars, euros, sterling,
South African rand and Canadian dollars, indicating investors'
distrust of volatile currencies. Central banks also remain
buyers of bullion, with South Korea saying on Tuesday it bought
25 tonnes of gold between June and July to diversify its
foreign reserves. It was its first purchase in more than a
decade, boosting gold holdings to 39.4 tonnes. [ID:nL3E7J12SC]
 Gold also benefited as investors sought safe-haven assets
such as the Swiss franc and U.S. Treasury debt at the expense
of riskier assets, while the dollar and euro hit record lows
against the franc.
 Platinum group metal prices were mixed as investors
digested news major automakers posted July U.S. sales that
ticked up from the slump of recent months, but failed to dispel
doubts about the economy and U.S. consumers. [ID:nN1E77012D]

 NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday as
more weak U.S. economic data fueled concern about the economy
even as Congress passed a U.S. debt-cutting measure in time to
avoid a default for the world's top oil consumer.
 Congress passed a deficit-cutting package that also raised
the nation's borrowing limit, but ending the debt-ceiling row
for the 2012 election cycle did not remove the possibility of a
credit-rating downgrade. [ID:nN1E77111G]
 ""The passing of the U.S. debt-ceiling bill should already
be priced into oil markets. Markets are more concerned about
the recent trend of weaker economic data,"" said Tom Bentz,
director at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures.
 A stronger dollar index <.DXY> also helped pressure
dollar-denominated oil prices.
 Brent crude's losses were limited by North Sea supply
disruptions, Libya's crude oil exports lost to civil war and a
fire at a refinery in Taiwan that also was supportive to gas
gas oil  and U.S. heating oil futures .
 ICE Brent crude for September  fell 35 cents to
settle at $116.46 a barrel, having traded from $115.53 to
$118.40.
 U.S. September crude  fell $1.10 to settle at $93.79
a barrel, the weakest close since June 28. U.S. crude dipped to
$93.08 in post-settlement trade, after an early $95.68 intraday
peak, crisscrossing its 200-day moving average of $95.00.
 Technical analysts said U.S. crude could face downside
pressure after breaking below the 200-day moving average on
Monday.
 ""We see a larger cluster of potential support stretching
from $92.96 to $92.48 to $91.96,"" said Brian Larose, analyst at
United-ICAP in Jersey City, New Jersey.
 ""If the zone can provide support, WTI would have the
ability to recover most, if not all, of this past week's
losses,"" he said.
 The trading volatility allowed Brent's premium to U.S.
crude  to reach $23.03 a barrel intraday.
 Crude trading volumes stayed relatively thin, slipping from
Monday and remaining below 30-day averages for Brent and U.S.
crude.

 API REPORTS LOWER CRUDE STOCKS
 Late on Tuesday, the industry group American Petroleum
Institute said U.S. crude inventories fell 3.3 million barrels
last week, against a forecast rise, helping crude futures pare
post-settlement losses. [API/S]
 Gasoline stocks jumped 2.5 million barrels and distillate
stocks rose 1.4 million barrels, according to the API.
 Ahead of the API report, U.S. crude stocks were expected to
be up 900,000 barrels, a Reuters analyst survey showed, with
supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve seen offsetting
any losses related to Tropical Storm Don. [EIA/S]
 Gasoline stockpiles were projected to be up slightly, by
100,000 barrels, while distillate stocks were expected to be up
1.5 million barrels.
 Inventory statistics from the U.S. government's Energy
Information Administration will follow on Wednesday.
 U.S. retail gasoline demand fell 3.1 percent in the week to
July 29 from a year earlier, while posting a 0.1 percent rise
from the previous week, as price gains since the beginning of
July weighed on consumption, MasterCard said. [ID:nN1E7711G5]
 As oil companies continued to restart Gulf of Mexico
operations halted last week by the now-departed Tropical Storm
Don, a new threat, Tropical Storm Emily, simmered over the
Caribbean. [ID:nN180088]
 WEAK ECONOMIC DATA
 Oil prices felt pressure on Tuesday from a report showing
U.S. consumer spending dropped in June for the first time in
nearly two years and incomes barely rose. [ID:nN1E7710A7]
 That data followed Monday's weak manufacturing figures from
the United States, Europe and China and last week's
disappointing second-quarter U.S. GDP estimate that reinforced
fears that slowing economic growth threatens to dampen oil
demand.
 ""The debt-ceiling distraction may now be behind the
markets, but the damage has been done,"" said John Kilduff,
partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.
 The key U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for July looms on
Friday.
 The S&P 500 turned negative for the year as worries about
the economy outweighed relief over avoiding a U.S. default. The
S&P 500's seventh straight lower finish was its longest down
streak since October 2008. [.N]

 By Zaida Espana	
 LONDON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Oil fell on Tuesday on continued
worries about the growth prospects of the world's largest crude
consumer after weak U.S. manufacturing data, which overshadowed
a deal to avert a debt default.	
 Brent  fell by 65 cents to $116.15 a barrel by 0811
GMT, having slipped as low as $115.53 a barrel earlier in the
session.	
 U.S. crude  was 57 cents lower at $94.32 after trading
as low as $93.42 on Monday, its lowest since late June, on news
that the world's manufacturing expanded at its weakest pace in
two years last month. 
 In Washington, the focus now turns to the Senate, where the
$2.1 trillion deficit-cutting plan is expected to be approved in
a vote on Tuesday, the deadline to lift the nation's debt limit.

 But analysts said that market sentiment is likely to remain
negative after the last two disappointing manufacturing and GDP
data readings. 
 ""Debt concerns about the US default are gone but now we have
growth concerns coming back after the very disappointing GDP
report on Friday and yesterday's ISM numbers, which were pretty
dismal,"" Commerzbank's Carsten Fritsch said.	
 ""This is weighing on general sentiment and on crude in
particular since the US is the largest oil consumer,"" adding:
""the stronger dollar also doesn't help today.""	
 The dollar index against a basket of major currencies
rose by 0.39 percent by 0844 GMT.	
 ""The market is going to be thinking about the fundamental
side of the economy, as well as what is going on in Washington,
so it should be volatile"" in coming days, said Jeremy Friesen,
commodity strategist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong.	
 Earlier, U.S. crude rebounded from a one-month low after the
House passed the budget deal, inspiring fleeting optimism to
markets battered by the disappointing economic data.	
 The U.S. Institute for Supply Management manufacturing
report, a gauge of factory activity in the world's largest
economy, fell to 50.9 in July, its lowest since July 2009 data
showed Monday. 
 


 RISING STOCKPILES	
 U.S. crude oil inventories probably rose by 1.2 million
barrels last week as increased supplies from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve offset losses due to Tropical Storm Don, a
Reuters poll showed on Monday. 
 Gasoline stockpiles were projected unchanged for the week,
the poll showed, while distillate stocks were expected to have
risen 1.5 million barrels.	
 Industry data on inventories from the American Petroleum
Institute (API) will be published on Tuesday, followed by
government statistics from the Energy Information Administration
on Wednesday.	
 In other markets, Asian and European shares fell on Tuesday
on concerns about the health of the global economy, while a
strengthening yen prompted speculation that Tokyo may intervene
in the markets to curb the currency's value.

 SINGAPORE, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Gold edged higher on Tuesday,
supported by a purchase of 25 tonnes of the precious metal by
South Korea's central bank, while investors watched the outcome
of a vote on the U.S. debt deal.	
 South Korea's central bank said it bought the gold between
June and July to diversify its foreign reserves despite high
prices, marking its first purchase in more than a decade and
taking its total gold holdings to 39.4 tonnes. 
 ""This news reiterates the fundamental view that most
investors, asset managers, and even central banks hold true --
that gold remains the quintessential currency hedge, a
stabilizing asset for portfolios, and a safe haven in uncertain
economic times,"" said David Meger, director of metals trading at
Vision Financial Markets, a futures broker based in Chicago.	
 Market reaction to the news was muted, as investors
continued to focus on the U.S. debt ceiling deal, which is
headed towards a congressional vote. 
 Spot gold added 0.35 percent to $1,623.79 an ounce by
0623 GMT, off an intraday low of $1,607.69 on Monday.	
 The physical market saw a mixture of buying and selling,
with premiums for gold bars in Singapore steady at between 20
and 80 cents to the spot London prices. 
 ""There's no clear direction. I am surprised that we still
some buying despite the high prices, but we also see sales of
physical gold,"" said a dealer in Singapore.	
 U.S. gold  inched up $4.5 to $1,626.2 an ounce.	
 ""The Bank of Korea purchase is absolutely no surprise,
because in the past two to three years we always heard that
Asian central banks had been buying gold,"" said a U.S.-based
trader. 
 ""It is positive for the market, but more for long-term
bulls.""
 
 
 
 Gold is expected to trade sideways during the day when
investors weigh the outcome of the U.S. debt deal vote against
the latest poor economic data, the trader added.	
 U.S. manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in two years in
July as new orders contracted, casting doubt on expectations the
faltering recovery would quickly regain steam. 
 Risk appetite might return after the U.S. Congress passed
the bill to raise the country's borrowing limit, but the gloomy
economic outlook in the world's largest economy combined with an
ongoing euro zone debt crisis could depress such sentiment,
traders and analysts said.	
 ""Gold should be lower after the U.S. debt ceiling deal is
reached, but it remains firm as people don't trust the dollar
and would still like to put their money in gold,"" said Peter
Fung, head of dealing at Wing Fung Precious Metals based in Hong
Kong.	
 The safe-haven Swiss franc gained on Tuesday on worries
about the global economy even as the U.S. looked to have averted
a debt default after the House of Representatives approved an
11th hour deal to raise the government's borrowing limit. 
 South African gold mine workers and producers were to resume
wage talks on Tuesday aimed at ending a strike that started last
week. 
 ""When prices are high, miners want to get a slice of the pie
not just in South Africa, but in Chile and elsewhere, which
could be a theme in the next few months as long as prices stay
high,"" said a Singapore-based trader.	
 ""If we see another sustained rally, scrap supply may dry up.
If mine supply decreases, things will start to look
interesting.""

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Gold ended lower on Monday, but
safe-haven buying by investors jittery about slow U.S.
manufacturing growth limited losses after a U.S. debt deal
shoved the precious metal sharply off record levels.
 In early trade, bullion dropped more than 1 percent as
global markets showed initial signs of relief that the United
States appeared to be dodging default. But the stock market
rally soon fizzled, and gold pared losses as investors shied
away from risky trades, fearing the country might still lose
its triple-A credit rating.
 Volume was down from last week, with some traders taking to
the sidelines as Congressional leaders scrambled for enough
votes to push through a deal to raise the U.S. borrowing limit
on the eve of the the Aug. 2 deadline.
 ""Investors have switched their emphasis from the debt deal
to a possible U.S. credit rating downgrade, bad manufacturing
data and the not-optimistic job report coming out later this
week,"" said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist with
futures broker MF Global.
 ""Gold should be bid up in the near term as investors are
still looking for a safety with the bad economic outlook.""
 Spot gold  slipped 0.4 percent at $1,620.49 an ounce
by 2:56 PM EDT (1856 GMT), having earlier traded within $1 of
Friday's record high of $1,632.30.
 Most-active U.S. December gold futures  settled down
$9.50 at $1,621.70 an ounce. U.S. trading volume was lower than
last week when the market rose to record highs.
 Spot silver  dropped 1.3 percent to $39.30 an ounce.

 INSTANT VIEW on debt deal [ID:nL3E7J103X]
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>
 Gold gained 8.5 percent last month, its second-best monthly
rise since 2009, as fears that a euro-zone debt crisis
spreading to Spain and Italy and frantic talks to avert a U.S.
default prompted investors to buy a safe haven.
 The precious metal remains vulnerable for a pullback if
investors perceive weak economic data and U.S. budget cuts as
deflationary, said Jeffrey Sherman, commodities portfolio
manager at DoubleLine Capital, which oversees $13 billion in
assets.
 Sherman said gold prices could be volatile, with investors
undecided about whether to worry more about disappointing U.S.
economic data or a possible ratings downgrade or default.
 Safe-haven buying in gold accelerated as U.S. stocks were
heading for a sixth consecutive loss after a strong opening as
relief over Washington's debt deal faded following a weak
reading on the manufacturing sector.
 U.S. manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in two years in
July as new orders contracted, a troubling development for the
faltering economy. [ID:nN1E7700MM]
 On Friday, gold rallied after U.S. government data showed
the economy stumbled in the first half of 2011 and came close
to contracting in the first quarter. Some investors worried
about the risk of a recession that could prompt the Fed to use
more stimulus, feeding inflation and boosting gold price
 U.S. DEBT DEAL VOTES EYED
 Bullion investors will watch votes later Monday in the U.S.
Congress on a plan to cut government spending, form a
congressional committee to recommend a deficit-reduction
package and raise the U.S. borrowing limit through 2013.
[ID:nN1E76U0F5]
 ""There is some short-term relief as the risk of an imminent
default (for the United States) does seem to have been
avoided,"" said Caroline Bain, senior commodities economist at
the Economist Intelligence Unit.
 ""But very soon the market will start to factor in that
there isn't that much being done with the fiscal deficit and
concerns will re-emerge,"" Bain said
 The dollar hit a record low against the Swiss franc and a
4-1/2 month trough versus the yen on Monday as optimism about
the U.S. evading a default were swiftly outweighed by fears
about the government's fiscal condition and a devastating
credit ratings downgrade.
 Bullion was pressured as the greenback, however, was 1
percent higher against the euro due to ongoing jitters about
the euro zone's debt crisis.
 Debt troubles in the euro zone were on investors' radar
screens, after ratings agency Moody's put Spain on review for
possible downgrade Friday.

 By Rujun Shen	
 SINGAPORE, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Gold fell more than 1 percent
on Monday after U.S. President Barack Obama said lawmakers had
reached a deal to cut the country's deficit, which, if approved,
would remove the threat of a default on debt that has driven
bullion to a record high.	
 But the hit to gold and relief in financial markets over the
deal may be short-lived due to a bleak macroeconomic outlook.	
 Gold's allure as a shelter from economic storms remains
strong as China's factories struggled with their weakest
activity in 28 months in July and sovereign debt concerns
continued to wrack the euro zone.	
 The most-active U.S. gold futures  fell more than 1
percent to $1,608.2, but recovered to trade down 0.9 percent at
$1,616 an ounce by 0634 GMT.	
 Spot gold fell 0.8 percent to $1,613.24, off a record
high of $1,632.30 set on Friday.	
 ""The fact that the framework is now available and lawmakers
are close to an agreement is reducing the safe-haven flow to
gold,"" said Ong Yi Ling, an analyst at Phillip Futures.	
 ""People are still waiting to see details and whether the
plan will pass the vote of the Congress.""	
 The U.S. Senate is likely to vote on Monday on the proposed
agreement between Democrats and Republican leaders to reduce the
U.S. deficit and avoid default. 
 ""People are selling gold as it seems a done deal now,"" said
a Singapore-based trader. 
 A firmer dollar following the end of the lengthy and
frustrating debt ceiling talks could further pressure gold
priced in the greenback. 
 While the deal removes the immediate threat of a first ever
U.S. default, the repercussions of the acrimonious talks are
likely to reverberate for years to come.	
 The U.S. still faces the prospect of paying more to service
its debt as it is unclear if the deal is enough to appease
credit ratings agency S&P, which has threatened to strip the
world's largest economy of its top-notch AAA rating.	
 Speculators sold ahead in anticipation that U.S. politicians
would cut a deal, reducing long positions in gold last week,
even as bullion rallied to record highs, the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data showed. 
 Gold rose 8.5 percent in July, its best month since April,
as investors sought safety from debt problems on both sides of
the Atlantic.
 
 
 
 GOLD RETAINS LONG-TERM APPEAL	
 ""Don't forget there's Europe in the background with problems
in Italy and Spain,"" said Natalie Robertson, a commodities
analyst at ANZ. ""There is still heightened risk aversion in the
market and gold will probably be volatile in the next few days.""	
 Last week, rating agency Moody's put Spain on review for a
possible downgrade, adding to concerns that a Greek rescue
package has done little to halt the spread of Europe's debt
crisis. 
 U.S. economic growth remains a concern. Data last week
showed that growth in the world's largest economy in the first
half of the year was much slower than expected. 
 The psychological $1,600-level is a key support for gold
prices. Gold could retrace another $20 to $30 if that level is
breached, traders and analysts said.	
 Bargain hunters would probably emerge if the price drops, as
economic woes lead some investors to bet on the long-term
bullish view on gold.	
 Platinum group metals declined, tracking the weakness in
gold. 
 Spot platinum dropped to a low of $1,771.49, before
gaining some lost ground to trade at $1,790.99, down 1.1 percent
from the previous close.	
 Spot palladium lost 0.4 percent to $836.97.

 By Joshua Schneyer
 NEW YORK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Brent crude edged higher on
Monday as North Sea oilfield maintenance and violence in the
Middle East helped offset weaker global factory data that fed
doubts about the energy demand outlook.
 U.S. crude fell to its lowest settlement in more than a
month as the dollar firmed, reversing earlier gains on optimism
about a pending deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling.
 Brent crude for September delivery recovered late in the
day to settle up 7 cents at $116.81 a barrel. It had seesawed
lower earlier, after briefly trading above $120 in the morning.
 U.S. crude for September  dropped 85 cents to settle
at $94.89 a barrel, its lowest closing price since late June.
 Brent turned positive in part due to pipeline and platform
maintenance in the North Sea that could affect European supply
this week. [ID:nL6E7J10JM]
 BP  said the North Sea Forties Pipeline System will
be closed for five days this week to allow workers to remove an
unexploded mine from World War II that was discovered submerged
in water near the pipeline. [ID:nL6E7J10JM]
 France's Total  shut its North Sea Elgin platform,
which pumps 104,000 barrels per day of condensate, for summer
maintenance, the company said without disclosing the duration
of the maintenance. [ID:nL6E7J118Q]
 ""The continued problems in the North Sea, Forties in
particular, are supporting Brent and helping boost its premium
to the U.S. counterpart,"" said Tom Bentz, director at BNP
Paribas Commodities Futures Inc in New York.
 In the latest escalation of turmoil in the Middle East,
Syrian military tanks shelled the city of Hama, bringing the
death toll from days of clashes there to at least 85, and
western leaders voiced outrage at the attacks. [ID:nL6E7J10N4]
 WEAK FACTORY DATA
 Oil futures jumped in early trade, buoyed by optimism over
a deal in Washington to stave off a U.S. debt default, But oil
later fell after a report showed the Institute for Supply
Management (ISM) U.S. manufacturing index dropped to its lowest
since July, 2009.
 Also, several surveyes from around the world showed the
global manufacturing sector expanded last month at the slowest
rate in two years. [ID:nL6E7J10Q9]
 The U.S. dollar firmed 0.5 percent against a basket of
foreign currencies, pushing up the cost of crude priced in
dollars for most foreign currency holders. <.DXY>
 Republican and Democratic party leaders agreed late Sunday
to the terms of a deficit reduction plan that would avoid
default and raise the U.S. debt ceiling. Congress still must
vote to approve the deal.
 ""The initial euphoria of the debt deal seems to be waning,""
said Gene McGillian of Tradition Energy in Connecticut.
 ""There's still plenty of uncertainty surrounding the debt
deal ahead of congressional votes, and a disappointing ISM
number has now taken some of the bidding out of the market.""
 After initially rising, stock markets also fell, with U.S.
equities dropping for a sixth consecutive session. [.N]

 Meteorologists were still watching a tropical wave in the

approaches the southern U.S. coastline by the end of the week.
 U.S. government figures showed that only around 2.3

 By Frank Tang
 NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Gold hit another all-time
high on Friday as investors sought a safe haven after anemic
U.S. growth data raised the specter that a potential recession
could spur the Federal Reserve to loosen monetary policy.
 Gold was helped by a sinking dollar, as investors fretted
over sovereign debt in the United States and Europe. U.S.
political leaders remained at odds over how to reduce the
deficit as the clock ticked toward an Aug. 2 deadline to raise
the government debt ceiling.
 ""The dollar is looking less and less attractive from a
growth, fiscal and monetary perspective,"" said Kathy Lien,
director of currency research at GFT Forex in New York.
 Bullion, which usually rises as the dollar weakens, hit its
third record in five days, notching a near 9 percent monthly
gain for July.
 Gold rallied after U.S. Commerce Department data showed the
economy stumbled in the first half of 2011 and came close to
contracting in the first quarter. Some investors worried about
the risk of a recession that could make the Fed more
accomodative, feeding inflation and boosting gold prices.
 ""The weak economic data suggests that you may see some form
of stimulus, certainly highly accommodative monetary policies,
and that will continue to put a bid on gold prices,"" said Mark
Luschini, chief investment strategist of broker-dealer Janney
Montgomery Scott, which oversees $54 billion in assets.
 ""As long as there is no re-normalization of a steady state
of economic or fiscal circumstances, gold will move higher.""
 But some investors worried that the U.S. economy could
enter a recession severe enough to depress prices in a round of
deflation. This could push gold prices down sharply. This fed
volatility in gold prices.
 Investors kept a close eye on Washington, because gold
prices could tumble if government leaders reach a U.S.
debt-ceiling deal that boosts investor confidence in other
financial markets, analysts said. But a ratings downgrade on
U.S. debt would force the world's largest institutional
investors to sell off U.S. Treasury holdings, and gold would be
the best refuge asset for the funds, said Peter Schiff, CEO of
Euro Pacific Precious Metals.
 Spot gold  touched an all-time peak of $1,632.30 an
ounce, and was up 0.5 percent at $1,623.99 by 2:51 p.m. EDT
(1851 GMT).
 On weekly charts, CitiFX strategists said bullion's monthly
close above $1,557.75 indicates that July is a bullish outside
month, confirming a 2011 target between $1,700 and 1,750.

 The U.S. December contract  settled up $15 at
$1,631.20 an ounce. Futures volumes were lower than the last
several sessions, as most investors had completed contract
rollover ahead of the August contract's first-notice day on
Friday.
 Silver  rose 0.8 percent to $39.97 an ounce, but was
off a more than two-month high of $41.42 hit this week. It
posted a gain of around 15 percent for July, its best month
since April.
 The CBOE Gold ETF Volatility Index <.GVZ>, which is often
referred to as the ""Gold VIX"" and is based on SPDR Gold Trust
 options, rose to its highest in over two months, as the
market braced for a swift pullback following the rally.
 Investor unease can also be seen in the holdings of the
world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold
Trust , which rose 1.5 percent on Thursday from a day
earlier to a six-month high of 1,262.98 tonnes. [GOL/ETF]
 DEBT UNEASE, RECESSION FEARS
 U.S. output increased at a 1.3 percent annual pace in the
second quarter as consumer spending barely rose. Other U.S.

 ""The catalyst to drive gold higher right now is the debt
ceiling, but the underlying fundamental reality is the growing
risk of a 2012 recession,"" said James Dailey, portfolio manager

 NEW YORK, July 29 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday,
posting a weekly loss after data showed weak U.S. economic
growth and as Congress kept wrangling before an Aug. 2 deadline
to raise the government debt ceiling and avoid default.
 The U.S. economy stumbled in the first half, according to a
Commerce Department report that showed a weaker-than-expected
1.3 percent expansion in the second quarter. [ID:nCAT005481]
 ""The slowdown in second-quarter economic activity has been
confirmed, and the reading will add to concerns about the
remainder of the year,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again
Capital LLC in New York.
 Two other reports showed business activity in the U.S.
Midwest grew less than expected this month as the labor market
weakened, while U.S. consumer sentiment fell in July to its
lowest point in more than two years. [ID:nN9E7ID003]
[ID:nN1E76S08H]
 ICE Brent crude for September  fell 62 cents to
settle at $116.70 a barrel, the lowest close since July 18,
after falling to $115.75 intraday. Brent lost 1.63 percent for
the week, but ended the month up 3.79 percent from June.
 U.S. September crude  fell $1.74 to settle at $95.70
a barrel, the lowest close in two weeks and with the $94.95
intraday low just above the 200-day moving average of $94.88.
 U.S. crude fell 4.2 percent for the week, snapping a string
of four weekly gains. For the month, front-month crude managed
a 28-cent gain.
 Crude futures trading volumes remained tepid, with Brent
and U.S. crude turnover well below 30-day averages.
 U.S. gasoline  and heating oil  futures also
slipped on Friday as front-month August contracts expired.
 Money managers raised net long U.S. crude futures and
options positions in the week to Tuesday and posted a sharp
rise in the Intercontinental Exchange's look-a-like U.S. crude
contract, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said.
[ID:nN1E76S1PO]
 Friday's choppy trading allowed Brent's premium to U.S.
crude  to push above $21 a barrel intraday.
 The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index <.CRB>, a global

two weeks.

 SINGAPORE, July 29 (Reuters) - Gold edged down on Friday as
the dollar regained strength on Moody's warning to downgrade
Spain, while investors continued to watch U.S. debt ceiling
talks after Republicans delayed a vote on a debt plan.	
 Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives decided not
to vote on a plan to raise the debt limit, fueling uncertainty
whether Washington could reach an agreement in time as the clock
ticks down to the Aug. 2 deadline. 
 The dollar rose against the euro after Moody's said it
placed Spain's credit rating for possible downgrade, pressuring
prices of gold. 
 But sentiment in bullion is supported as the U.S. debt
ceiling talks drag on, even though trading interest was low as
investors moved to the sideline of the market waiting for
further cues.	
 ""There is far too much uncertainty and no one is that keen
to take a position right now,"" said a Singapore-based trader.
""Even if the plan makes it through the House, it is not
guaranteed to pass the Senate and we'll be back to square one.""	
 Spot gold lost 0.2 percent to $1,613.46 an ounce by
0627 GMT, on course for a weekly rise of around 0.9 percent. It
was headed for a monthly gain of nearly 8 percent.	
 U.S. gold  was flat at $1,613.60. 
 ""The gold market is likely to continue its two-sided trade
in the near term, with the debt ceiling debate remaining the
central focus,"" said MF Global in a research note, adding that a
deal to avert a downgrade or default could result in a sharp
drop in prices.	
 Investors have fled riskier assets in recent weeks on
worries about U.S. debt talks and the euro zone crisis,
propelling gold to consecutive record highs. It reached an
all-time high at $1,628 on Wednesday.	
 The world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR
Gold Trust , said its holdings rose 1.5 percent from a day
earlier to a six-month high of 1,262.98 tonnes by July 28.

 Technical analysis suggested that gold may fall towards
$1,593, said Reuters market analyst Wang Tao. 
 
 
 
 Spot silver fell 0.4 percent to $39.51 an ounce, off
a more than two-month high of $41.42 hit this week. It was set
to rise nearly 14 percent in July, its best month since April.
But on the weekly chart, silver lagged behind gold, with a 1.3
percent drop.	
 U.S. silver  lost 0.6 percent to $39.55.	
 ""Some people are already pricing in the expectation that the
United States will eventually avert a default,"" said a
Tokyo-based trader, adding that high prices in recent weeks had
encouraged some Chinese smelters to export more silver.	
 ""Silver should have strong support around $38, while the
situation in Europe and the United States continues to buoy
appetite in gold and benefit silver.""	
 But silver is unlikely to score new highs in the absence of
new supportive factors, he said. 
 Spot palladium is heading for a monthly rise of
nearly 10 percent, its best this year. The metal, used mainly in
producing autocatalysts, was on course for a weekly gain of 2.5
percent, outperforming other precious metals.	
 Concerns about a labour dispute and potential supply squeeze
in South Africa, a major producer of platinum group metals, are
likely to keep sentiment in these metals supported.

 By Florence Tan	
 SINGAPORE, July 29 (Reuters) - Oil was heading on Friday for
its first rise in three months as investors focused on forecasts
of improved demand despite jitters over an elusive debt deal in
the United States to avert a default and a credit downgrade.	
 Prices also gained support from positive macroeconomic data
from the United States on Wednesday and about 7 percent of
output being shut in by producers in the Gulf of Mexico as
Tropical Storm Don approaches.	
 Brent crude  for September rose 6 cents to $117.42 a
barrel by 0151 GMT after closing down 7 cents at $117.36 a
barrel on Thursday. U.S. crude  for September was down 24
cents at $97.20 a barrel, but was on track to rise 1.8 percent
on the month, its first increase in three months.	
 A deal to avert an imminent and unprecedented debt default
by the world's largest economy was nowhere in sight as the
Republicans and Democrats continued to push their own proposals.

 ""The population across the globe is getting fed up with the
sabre-rattling,"" said Ben Le Brun, analyst at CMC Markets. ""It's
just a lot of uncertainty. Hopefully we'll see something during
the weekend that will resolve this issue.""	
 The head of the IMF and top officials at U.S. banks have
warned that a failure to raise the debt limit by the Aug. 2
deadline could trigger a payments crunch that would shake the
global financial system, cause the dollar to decline and tip the
United States back into recession.	
 The U.S. Treasury will unveil a plan as soon as Friday
evening showing how the government will function and pay its
bills if it looks like Congress will not raise the debt ceiling
in a timely manner.

 
 
 Political wrangling over the debt issue overshadowed
Thursday's data showing an improvement in U.S. unemployment
claims and home sales that briefly lifted markets.	
 Americans claiming new unemployment benefits last week
dropped below the 400,000 level for the first time since early
April, a hopeful sign for the anemic U.S. economy while pending
sales of existing homes rose unexpectedly in June.

 ""The biggest concern in the United States was the jobs
market,"" Le Brun said, adding that the positive data could bring
more good news on the U.S. macroeconomic front.	
 ""We do have a good backlog of economic data. I expect a
significant rally across a number of asset classes once the debt
issue is put to bed,"" he said.	
 The storm situation in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico also
supported oil prices.	
 Producers reduced oil and natural gas output on Thursday as
Tropical Storm Don churned northwest toward the Texas coast,
where it could make landfall by the weekend. 
 Although Don had cut a small 7 percent of U.S. Gulf of
Mexico crude output and 3 percent of natgas output according to
government data by midday Thursday, analysts said the storm's
relative weakness and position in the Gulf of Mexico made it
unlikely to cause prolonged production outages or energy
infrastructure damage.	
 Investors are bullish on oil prices as they expect demand to
rise later in the second half of the year, tightening supply.	
 OPEC is expected to pump oil output in July to its highest
in almost three years, mainly on extra oil from Saudi Arabia and
Angola, a Reuters survey found. 
 Shell  chief executive Peter Voser told Reuters
Insider Television that oil prices remained strong because the
market believed OPEC spare capacity was eroding fast and had
probably fallen below 2 million barrels per day. 
 Oil could also find further support from China as the
central bank looks poised to end a streak of lifting bank
reserve requirements every month since November since a slowdown
in foreign capital inflows gives it room to relieve very tight
money market conditions. 
 ""Such a move could help maintain growth in both the economy
and consumers' disposable income and should be favourable for
oil from the demand side,"" MF Global analysts wrote in a note.

 NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - Gold paused on Thursday after
the previous session's run to a record high, as investors
sidelined themselves ahead of a close U.S. House vote on a
controversial Republican deficit-reduction plan.
 Silver dropped over 1 percent as Wall Street rose ahead of
the vote on a proposal presented by U.S. Rep. John Boehner, the
top Republican in Congress.
 If it passes the Republican-controlled House, it faces
defeat in the Democrat-dominated Senate, after which hopes are
pinned on compromise bill emerging to ease worries about a U.S.
government default or ratings downgrade. [ID:nN1E76R004]
 Gold remains up around 8 percent in July on concerns over
the euro zone debt crisis and uncertainty ahead of the Aug. 2
deadline to raise the $14.3 trillion U.S. debt ceiling. It
could tumble if a debt-ceiling deal eases fears in other
financial markets and investors perceive the related spending
cuts and tax increases as deflationary, analysts said.
 ""The market as a whole is starting to get more optimistic
that there will be some resolution of the US debt ceiling. If
we were to see a resolution, there will be a short-term pull
back of the precious metals because of the more certainty,""
said James Rife, an assistant portfolio manager at Haber Trilix
Advisors, which manages $2 billion in assets.
 Spot gold  was down 41 cents at $1,612.59 an ounce by
2:08 PM EDT (1808 GMT). It hit a record $1,628 an ounce on
Wednesday, its second all-time highs this week, before
correcting sharply later in the day.
 U.S. gold futures  for August delivery settled down
$1.70 an ounce at $1,613.40. Volume was heavy for a second day,
as the market stayed volatile after investors exercised a large
number of in-the-money calls at Tuesday's option expiration.
 Silver  was down 1.3 percent at $39.67 an ounce.
 In early trade, gold briefly rose above $1,620 an ounce.
But it quickly retreated as investors grew less risk-averse
after news that U.S. jobless claims hit a three-month low last
week while contracts to buy existing homes rose in June.
[ID:nN1E76R0BE]
 On weekly charts, a monthly close above $1,557.75 would
suggest that July will be a bullish outside month, confirming a
2011 target between $1,700 and 1,750, CitiFX strategists said.

 NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - Oil edged up on Thursday as a
tropical storm heading toward the Texas coast forced producers
in the Gulf of Mexico to begin shutting in production and
evacuating support staff.
 Gains were limited as uncertainty over Washington's ability
to agree on a plan to raise the U.S. debt ceiling before an
Aug. 2 deadline has kept investors on edge over a possible debt
default or a credit rating downgrade. [ID:nN1E76O1XU]
 ""The storm is expected to have limited effect and concerns
over the economy are keeping prices in check,"" said John
Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.
 ""The slight improvement in weekly jobless claims is not
enough to offset the potential default concerns.""
 U.S. crude for September delivery  settled 4 cents

 Brent's premium against U.S. crude steadied at around $20,
after closing Wednesday at $20.03. 
 Early support came from data showing that first-time claims
for U.S. unemployment benefits dropped 24,000 to just below

sign for the economy. [ID:nN1E76R0BE]

 Energy companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico shut in
94,962 barrels, or 6.8 percent of oil output from the region
and 148 million cubic feet per day, or 2.8 percent of natural
gas production there ahead of the storm, a U.S. government
report showed. [ID:nN1E76R19W]
 The Gulf's top oil producers -- BP Plc , Exxon Mobil
Corp  and Anadarko Petroleum Corp  -- have begun
shutting in oil and natural gas production, while other
companies were evacuating support personnel.

 OPEC SPARE CAPACITY, WASHINGTON DEADLOCK
 Oil prices remain strong because the market believes OPEC
spare capacity is eroding fast and has probably fallen below 2
million barrels per day, Shell  chief executive Peter
Voser told Reuters Insider Television. [ID:nL6E7IS158]
 ""It (oil price) reflects the expectations that demand will
go up and supply will remain in a catch-up mode. It also
reflects that OPEC spare capacity is now below 2 million
barrels (per day), according to the latest numbers,"" he said.
 But oil prices have seen a seesaw pattern in the past week
as oil traders grapple with the possibility of a dreaded U.S.
credit downgrade, should Washington fail to agree to raise the
nation's debt limit by the deadline.
 The U.S. House of Representatives is tentatively scheduled
to vote between 5:45 p.m. and 6:25 p.m. EDT (2145-2225 GMT)
Thursday on a Republican bill to cut the U.S. deficit. The vote
was predicted to be close, but an approval would break an
inertia over the U.S. debt crisis. [ID:nN1E76R004]
 ""There's so much uncertainty out there on the debt limit
talks in Washington,"" said Bill O'Grady, chief investment
strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis,
Missouri.

 By Florence Tan	
 SINGAPORE, July 28 (Reuters) - U.S. oil fell for a second
session on Thursday as the United States struggled to reach an
agreement on raising the debt ceiling to avoid a default, while
the first release of crude stocks in the country unexpectedly
boosted inventories. 
 U.S. crude  for September fell 16 cents to $97.24 a
barrel by 0353 GMT, hitting a 7-session low of $96.51 earlier.
It settled down $2.19 at $97.40 a barrel on Wednesday. Brent
September crude  rose 41 cents to $117.84 a barrel.	
 Oil is unlikely to slide much further even with the economic
uncertainty surrounding the U.S. and Europe as demand is
expected to grow steadily amid reduced global output, analysts
said. The U.S. hurricane season may also put a floor on prices
over concerns of disruption in output.	
 ""Despite the negative macroeconomic context, supply side
impacts appear to be supporting prices,"" Natalie Robertson, an
analyst at ANZ, said. ""The first storms of the Atlantic
hurricane season have hit the headlines, reminding the market of
potential supply disruptions from an expected active hurricane
season.""	
 Top Republicans and Democrats worked behind the scenes on a
compromise to avert the first default by the U.S. in its
history. U.S. stocks suffered their worst day in eight weeks
partly because of the stalemate while gold stayed near its
all-time high. 
 Limited investment appetite amid the macroeconomic
uncertainty prompted ANZ to trim its third-quarter forecast for
Brent by $3 to $120 a barrel, and cut the outlook for U.S. oil
to $100 from $112, analysts at the bank said in a note.

 
 
 ""Few believe that the crisis will continue without some
resolution before Aug. 2, but it is now starting to look
increasingly likely that the U.S. credit rating will be
lowered,"" Peter Beutel, president of trading advisory Cameron
Hanover said in a note. ""That could cost the country billions in
higher credit costs.""	
 The oil market remains ""extremely range-bound,"" according to
analysts at Barclays Capital. 
 ""The lack of direction is associated, in our view, with the
series of rolling macroeconomic concerns, with the U.S. debt
stand-off the latest trend-defeating and dominating backdrop for
the market,"" analysts from the bank wrote in a note.	
 Oil data from the United States in July remained fairly
weak, they added.	
 Crude stockpiles rose unexpectedly as a release of strategic
reserves and higher imports kicked in while refiners slowed
operations. Gasoline and distillates stocks also rose more than
expected. 
 
 DEMAND OUTLOOK	
 Average gasoline demand in the last four weeks fell 3.3
percent from year-ago levels, the EIA said.	
 ""In terms of inventories, the long reduction in the
inventory overhang has stalled, but not reversed, and gasoline
demand indications in particular have remained subpar,"" Barclays
Capital said in a note.	
 Economic growth slowed in much of the United States in June
and early July, the Federal Reserve said in a report on
Wednesday that cast doubt on prospects for a pickup in activity
in the second half of the year. 
 Wednesday's data showed new orders for long-lasting U.S.
manufactured goods fell unexpectedly in June, and a gauge of
business spending plans slipped. 
 The market is keeping a close watch on possible disruption
to supply in the Gulf of Mexico, home to 29 percent of U.S. oil
production, as Tropical Storm Don approaches. 
 Shell Oil Co,  Apache Corp, and Anadarko
Petroleum Corp said they were evacuating support workers
primarily from western Gulf operations. BHP Billiton and BP Plc
were evacuating support workers from central Gulf
platforms.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2011 08:44PM ET</span>",PRECIOUS-Gold pauses after hitting records; US debt in focus," SINGAPORE, July 28 (Reuters) - Spot gold took a breather on
Thursday after hitting record highs for two sessions this week,
as sentiment remained supported by the deadlocked U.S. debt
ceiling talks, as top leaders of both parties worked to hammer
out a compromise.	
 
 FUNDAMENTALS	
 * Spot gold edged up 0.1 percent to $1,614.59 an
ounce by 0027 GMT, off an all-time high of $1,628 set on
Wednesday.	
 * U.S. gold  was flat at $1,614.90.	
 * Top Republicans and Democrats worked behind the scenes on
Wednesday on a compromise to avert a crippling U.S. default,
looking to salvage a last-minute deal from rival debt plans that
have little chance of winning broad congressional approval on
their own. 
 * With the August 2 deadline just days away, the possibility
of a downgrade of U.S. debt has increased even if an agreement
is reached.	
 * Adding to the safe haven demand, Standard & Poor's cut
Greece's sovereign credit rating further into junk territory,
saying the European Union's proposed debt restructuring would
put the country into ""selective default"". 
 * Gold retreated from the record high on Wednesday as
investors sold bullion to cover losses elsewhere, but sentiment
in the precious metal remains bullish as long as the U.S. debt
talks drag on.
