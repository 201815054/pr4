Gold for June delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange shed $7.17, or 0.57%, to $1,249.89 a troy ounce by 12:42 EDT.
Gold continued to trade close to three-week lows, after better than expected jobs and services sector growth data fuelled expectations that the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates in June.
The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to 57.5 in April from 55.2 in March. The reading was above economists’ forecasts of 55.8.
A report from ADP and Moody's Analytics showed U.S. companies created 177,000 new positions for the month, slightly above expectations of 175,000.
According to investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool, about 60% of traders expect the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates in June.
Meanwhile, focus shifted towards the Fed rate decision and statement, scheduled for release today at 14:00 EDT. 
Although the majority of market participants expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged, investors remained cautious of any change in tone from the Fed statement concerning future interest rate hikes. 
The Federal Reserve has previously indicated that three total rate hikes in 2017 would be appropriate, should economic data, mainly jobs and inflation, continue to show steady growth.
Treasury yields eased ahead of the Federal Reserve interest rate decision, with the U.S. 10-Year at 2.293, down 0.14%. 
Meanwhile, on the political front, investors looked ahead to a televised French election debate, on Wednesday, between pro-EU candidate Emmanuel Macron and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
According to the latest polls, pro-EU candidate Emmanuel Macron holds a healthy lead, about 20 percentage points, over far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.
In other precious metals trading, silver futures lost 1.31% to $16.611 a troy ounce while platinum traded at $904.50, down 2.32%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower Wednesday after U.S. government data showed a smaller-than-expected decline in domestic crude inventories and weak demand for gasoline, feeding concerns about a supply glut.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) was down 18 cents at $47.48 a barrel at 11:33 EST. Benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 8 cents at $50.38 a barrel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said weekly crude stocks fell by 930,000 barrels to 527.8 million, less than half the 2.3 million-barrel draw that had been forecast.
""U.S. domestic production rose again, and continues its steady climb,"" said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital in New York. He noted that a sharp decline in imports turned what would have been an increase in stocks into a small drawdown.
EIA data also showed gasoline stocks rose by 191,000 barrels, which was much less than the 1.3 million-barrel gain that had been forecast. However, gasoline demand slipped 2.7 percent over the last four weeks from the same period a year ago. 
""This is continuing a trend since the beginning of the year in which sales have been lower and that is casting a shadow on the market and pressuring crude oil prices,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, 
""Gasoline demand is going to be the story going forward.""
While the market remains fixated on U.S. production, oil investors continue to watch whether producing countries have been complying with their 2016 deal to cut output around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) by the middle of the year.
Russia, contributing the largest production cut outside OPEC, said that as of May 1, it had curbed output by more than 300,000 bpd since hitting peak production in October.
This means Russia has achieved its reduction target a month ahead of schedule, just as the latest Reuters survey of OPEC production showed the group's compliance had fallen slightly.
More oil from Angola and higher UAE output than originally thought meant OPEC compliance with its production-cutting deal slipped to 90 percent in April from a revised 92 percent in March, the Reuters survey showed.

""Although OPEC is expected to extend a self-imposed output cap by another six months, it would be a challenge convincing several non-OPEC members to join the endeavor,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.

(Reuters) - U.S. crude stockpiles fell less than expected last week, while gasoline inventories grew as demand remained weak, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, keeping concerns about global supply on a simmer.
Crude inventories  fell by 930,000 barrels in the week to April 28, much less than analysts' expectations for a decrease of 2.3 million barrels. Although crude stocks have steadily declined for the last four weeks, at 527.8 million barrels they still 3 percent higher from this time a year ago.
""It has been another fairly uninspiring report for the bulls,"" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.
The oil markets turned negative immediately after the report. U.S. crude futures (CLc1) was down 16 cents at $47.50 a barrel by 10:50 a.m. EDT, while Brent (LCOc1) fell 10 cents to $50.36 a barrel. 
Analysts said the declines came in part after Tuesday's data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute, which showed bigger drawdowns. 
Stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures  fell 728,000 barrels, EIA said.
U.S. crude production rose modestly again, and currently sits at 9.29 million barrels a day, highest since August 2015, while imports  fell by 34,000 bpd. 
Gasoline stocks  rose by 191,000 barrels, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.3 million-barrel gain.
Stocks of the motor fuel, at 241.2 million barrels, were still 10 percent higher than the seasonal average over the past decade, as gasoline demand for the past four weeks was down by 2.7 percent from the year-ago period.
""This is continuing a trend since the beginning of the year in which sales have been lower and that is casting a shadow on the market and pressuring crude oil prices,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.
Refinery crude runs  inched down from record highs, slipping 108,000 barrels per day, to 17.2 million bpd, as utilization rates  fell 0.8 percentage points to 93.3 percent of capacity, EIA data showed. 
Distillate stockpiles , which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 562,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 723,000 barrel-increase, the EIA data showed.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude June contract shed 17 cents, or around 0.3%, to $47.51 a barrel by 10:35AM ET (14:35GMT) after falling to $47.34, a level not seen since March 27. Prices were at around $47.98 prior to the release of the inventory data.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for July delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 22 cents to $50.23 a barrel, after sliding to $50.14 in the prior session, its deepest trough since March 27.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 930,000 barrels in the week ended April 28.
Market analysts' expected a crude-stock decline of 2.3 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply-drop of 4.1 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 728,000 barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 527.8 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be at the upper limit of the average range for this time of year.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 191,000 barrels, compared to expectations for a gain of 1.3 million barrels.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a decline of 562,000 barrels.
Crude has been under pressure in recent weeks amid fears that an ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production is derailing efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 15th week in a row, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead. The U.S. rig count rose by 9 to 697, extending an 11-month drilling recovery to the highest level since August 2015.
The relentless increase in U.S. output has overshadowed pledged output cuts by major producers.
In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January and June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for June slumped 2.3 cents, or 1.5%, to $1.512 a gallon, while June heating oil slipped 0.6 cents to $1.461 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for June delivery inched up 1.2 cents to $3.207 per million British thermal units.

The head of Oil and Gas UK told May in a letter seen by Reuters that yearly oil trade costs could rise to 1.1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion), from around 600 million pounds now, if Britain reverts to World Trade Organization rules after Brexit.
May, whose government is negotiating the terms of Britain's exit from the EU, has said not reaching an agreement with the bloc would be better than signing a bad deal, leaving open the possibility of reverting to default WTO rules from March 2019.
""Our request of government is that any change, whether domestic or European, is managed in a manner that minimises risk to the oil and gas industry,"" Oil and Gas UK Chief Executive Deirdre Michie wrote in the letter dated May 1.
Michie also said her association's research showed that if Britain agreed minimal tariffs with EU member states and improved terms with other countries, trade costs could fall by around 100 million pounds a year.
Britain's oil and gas trade with the world is worth about 73 billion pounds a year.
Michie called for ""frictionless access"" to the EU's labor market as around 5 percent of Britain's oil and gas workforce are non-British EU nationals, many of whom fill roles the association deems critical.

U.S. natural gas for June delivery slipped around 1.0 cent, or about 0.3%, to $3.187 per million British thermal units by 9:10AM ET (13:10GMT).
Prices of the heating fuel fell for the second consecutive session on Tuesday.
A strong spring storm tracking through the southeastern U.S. with heavy showers and thunderstorms will push across the Great Lakes and Northeast this weekend into early next week to keep below normal temperatures in place.
Overall, natural gas demand will be slightly stronger than normal well into next week, according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting outlooks on spring demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.189 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 14.0% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 13.7% above the five-year average for this time of year.
The EIA's next storage report due Thursday is expected to show a build in a range between 57 and 65 billion cubic feet in the week ended April 28.
That compares with a gain of 74 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, an increase of 68 billion a year earlier and a five-year average rise of 63 billion cubic feet.

LONDON (Reuters) - An extension of OPEC-led oil production cuts into the second half of 2017 would help bring global crude inventories back to a five-year average by the end of the year and support prices at about $55 a barrel, BP's chief financial officer said Tuesday.
Oil stocks have steadily built for nearly three years amid sharp production increases in the United States, Iraq, Iran, Brazil and other regions, sparking a slide in oil prices from above $100 in 2014 to $30 last year.
To reduce inventories to their five-year average, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers agreed to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017, a deal that helped lift prices to their current level of about $52. 
With stockpiles still high, OPEC states have indicated those cuts could be extended to December.
""If OPEC cuts roll into the second half of the year we anticipate crude oil stocks would get back into the top end of the historical range,""  BP  (LON:BP) Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary said after the company reported a jump in profit.
""I wouldn't describe it as being majorly bullish, but it would certainly firm up and underpin prices from where they are today,"" he told Reuters. ""If you look at total stocks right now, they are starting to decline.""
Oil stockpiles in industrialized nations were 3.055 billion barrels at the end of February, about 330 million barrels above the five-year average but with the market showing more balance, the International Energy Agency said last month. 
""If the OPEC cuts get rolled into the second half of the year that will underpin oil prices. If they don't get rolled into the second half of the year we will continue to see more volatility,"" Gilvary said.
OPEC and non-OPEC states meet on May 25 to discuss whether to extend cuts for another six months after June.
""From BP's perspective we're managing things around $50-55 a barrel, that's probably the range we would expect for the rest of the year,"" he said, adding that prices could climb to the upper end of the range around $55 if the cuts were extended.

Global oil demand is expected to grow by 1.3 million barrels per day this year, he added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil slipped more than 1 percent on Monday, as rising crude output with Libya hitting its highest production since 2014 and increased U.S. drilling countered OPEC-led production cuts aimed at clearing a supply glut.
Signs of slower-than-expected growth in manufacturing in China and a weaker figure for U.S. manufacturing sentiment also weighed on expectations for oil demand and the market. 
Global benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) for July was down 54 cents at $51.51 a barrel by 11:50 a.m. EDT (1550 GMT). U.S. crude for June (CLc1) dropped 53 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $48.81 a barrel.
""The market continues to hunt for a bottom,"" said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
U.S. crude has lost nearly 9 percent since April 11, weighed down by the market's impatience with the slow pace of inventory drawdown around the world even after major oil producers agreed late last year to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day for the first half of 2017.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and participating non-OPEC countries meet on May 25 to discuss whether to extend that reduction. Given that inventories remain high and prices are half their mid-2014 level, OPEC members including top exporter Saudi Arabia support prolonging the curbs.
Libya's National Oil Company said production has risen above 760,000 bpd, highest since December 2014, with plans to keep boosting production. That OPEC member had been excluded from production cut estimates because armed conflict had sapped overall production.
Despite OPEC's efforts, the oil glut has been slow to shift.
""With four months of the cutting in effect we haven't seen a sizable reduction in global oil fuel inventories,"" Tradition's McGillian said. ""It's not sizable enough to see some proof, and the market is having trouble holding most of its gains since 2016.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia is expected to cut the price of its flagship Arab Light by 40-50 cents a barrel in June to the lowest in nine months, a survey of Asian refiners showed.
Official selling prices (OSPs) are expected to fall across the board for Saudi crudes sold to Asia in June, after a fall in the Middle East benchmark Dubai crude due to ample oil supplies, the survey of five refiners found.
""We expect Saudi OSPs to fall as the spot market has collapsed amid oversupply,"" an analyst with a North Asian refiner said, adding that the June Arab Light OSP will drop by at least 50 cents a barrel.
Reflecting weak demand, the spread for first and third month cash Dubai prices widened in contango in April from a month ago, traders said.
In a contango market, prompt prices are lower than those in future months as ample supplies weigh on the spot market.
Last month, almost all grades of Middle East crude loading in June traded at discounts to their price markers as they faced stiff competition from record flows of oil shipped to Asia from Europe and the United States in recent months, particuarly as U.S. shale production grows.
Demand from China and Japan has also slowed as some refining units have yet to return from maintenance, while independent Chinese refiners are waiting for more import quotas to be issued by Beijing.
Most of the survey respondents expect Arab Light crude to be cut by 40 cents in June. The respondents expect smaller price cuts for Arab Medium and Arab Heavy crude as Saudi Arabia could continue to tighten exports of these grades to comply with a deal by OPEC and some non-OPEC producers to cut output.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will decide in late May whether it will extend output cuts for another six months in a bid to draw down global inventories.Saudi crude OSPs are usually released around the fifth of each month, and set the trend for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi prices, affecting more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude bound for Asia.
State oil giant Saudi Aramco sets its crude prices based on recommendations from customers and after calculating the change in the value of its oil over the past month, based on yields and product prices.
Saudi Aramco officials as a matter of policy do not comment on the kingdom's monthly OSPs.

31,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 30, 2017 05:51AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Futures - Weekly Outlook: May 1 - 5,"Investing.com - Oil futures settled a bit higher on Friday, but still registered a weekly and monthly loss as signs of further gains in U.S. crude output and doubts over whether OPEC will extend output cuts at its May meeting pressured prices.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude June contract tacked on 36 cents, or around 0.7%, to end at $49.33 a barrel by close of trade Friday. It fell to its lowest since March 28 at $48.20 on Thursday.
The U.S. benchmark lost 35 cents, or almost 0.6%, on the week. For April, it fell around 3%, the second straight monthly decline.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for July delivery ticked up 23 cents to settle at $52.05 a barrel by close of trade. The global benchmark sank to $51.01 a day earlier, a level not seen since March 27.
For the week, London-traded Brent futures recorded a loss of 38 cents, or nearly 0.5%. The benchmark ended about 2% lower for the month.
Crude has been under pressure in recent weeks amid fears that an ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production is derailing efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 15th week in a row, data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed on Friday, implying that further gains in domestic production are ahead.
The U.S. rig count rose by 9 to 697, extending an 11-month drilling recovery to the highest level since August 2015.
The relentless increase in U.S. output has overshadowed pledged output cuts by major producers.
In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January and June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Friday that it was important to try and agree on an extension of a global oil cuts deal into the second half of the year with both OPEC and non-OPEC members.
Non-OPEC member Russia said it would define its position on whether to extend its cuts by May 24, a day before OPEC meets in Vienna.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for June lost 0.6 cents, or about 0.4% to end at its lowest since February 28 at $1.548 on Friday. It closed down around 6% for the week and about 9.5% for the month on concern over lackluster demand.
June heating oil fell 0.4 cents to finish at $1.507 a gallon, not far from a more than one-month low. For the week, the fuel lost roughly 3.2%. For April, it was down around 4.5%.
Natural gas futures for June delivery rose 3.7 cents to $3.276 per million British thermal units, up 1.2% for the session and about 5.7% higher for the week. Prices traded roughly 2.5% higher for the month.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Meanwhile, traders will also continue to pay close attention to comments from global oil producers for further evidence that they are complying with their agreement to reduce output this year.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.
Tuesday, May 2
The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, is to publish its weekly report on U.S. oil supplies.

32,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2017 08:48PM ET</span>","Trump aims to expand U.S. offshore drilling, despite low industry demand","By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday to extend offshore oil and gas drilling to areas that have been off limits - a move meant to boost domestic production but which could fall flat due to weak industry demand for the acreage.
The order could open up swathes of the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic oceans, as well as the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, that former President Barack Obama had sought to protect from development after a huge  BP  (L:BP) oil spill in 2010.
""We're opening it up....Today we're unleashing American energy and clearing the way for thousands and thousands of high-paying American energy jobs,"" Trump said as he signed the order.
Trump had campaigned on a promise to do away with Obama-era environmental protections that he said were hobbling energy development without providing tangible benefits, pleasing industry and enraging environmental advocates.
But the executive order, called the America-First Offshore Energy Strategy, comes as low oil prices and soaring onshore production have pushed industry demand for offshore leases near their lowest level in years, raising questions over the impact.
A Reuters review of government data showed the amount of money that oil companies spent in the central Gulf of Mexico's annual lease sale dropped more than 75 percent between 2012 and 2017. Dollars bid per acre and the percentage of acreage receiving bids both declined more than 50 percent.
The figures were similar in the western Gulf of Mexico, the only other zone that got offers for leases during that period, according to the figures from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.
""The Trump administration’s hasty move today toward expanding offshore oil drilling ... defies market realities and is as reckless as it is unnecessary,"" said David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, a non-profit conservation group.
""Why on earth would someone choose to push drilling in the riskiest and most expensive places on the planet when the current oil glut will make such ventures unprofitable for the foreseeable future?"" he said. 
The president of the American Petroleum Institute trade group welcomed the order in a statement, while an API official said the order could help the industry over the long term. The official did not respond to a request for comment directly about current offshore lease demand.
""In order to meet U.S. energy needs, it is important to keep options open for the long term, so industry can start planning for and determining where the best prospects are and then make those investments the global economy will require over time,"" the official said, asking not to be named. 
The order directs the U.S. Department of Interior to review and replace the Obama administration's most recent five-year oil and gas development plan for the outer continental shelf, which includes federal waters off all U.S. coasts.
Weeks before leaving office, Obama had banned new oil and gas drilling in federal waters in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, protecting 115 million acres (46.5 million hectares) of waters off Alaska and 3.8 million acres in the Atlantic from New England to the Chesapeake Bay.
LEGAL BATTLE LOOMS
In addition to requiring a new five-year drilling plan, the order reverses Obama's decision to place certain parts of the Arctic permanently off limits to drilling. It also requires Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to review previous presidents' designations of marine national monuments and sanctuaries.
Jill McLeod, a partner at international law firm Dorsey & Whitney, said Trump's order was a positive signal to the oil industry but was unlikely to trigger a surge in exploration in the near term given the costs.
""The lifting of the ban does not necessarily make drilling in the Arctic a compelling proposition,"" she said.  
Environmental groups, including Oceana and the Center for Biological Diversity, criticized the order and promised to fight it in court. Democratic senators also opposed the order, saying it could threaten the fishing and tourism industries.

Friday's order came on the heels of a separate decree by Trump this week triggering a review of federally managed land to determine if they were improperly designated as national monuments by former presidents. The move is intended to expand federal areas available for development.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for June delivery added 36 cents to settle at $49.33 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 7 cents to trade at 51.89 a barrel.
Crude futures mounted a recovery on Friday, after sliding to a one-month low in the previous session, as Russia said its close to meeting its pledged 300,000 barrels-a-day cut amid concerns over rising U.S. production.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported its weekly U.S. rig count rose by 9 to 697, the highest rig count since April 2015.
Despite the record compliance with the supply-cut agreement in March, inventories in industrial countries remained above the five-year average, which is a key metric OPEC monitors.
Earlier this week, Saudi oil chief Khalid al-Falih acknowledged that the first quarter of cuts failed to stem the glut in supply to below the five-year average but hinted at the possibility of extending the supply-cut agreement beyond June.
“Consensus is building [concerning a possible deal extension], but it is not done yet,” Khalid al-Falih said last week.
In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). The deal to cut supply started in January this year for a period of six months until June.
OPEC will decide at talks on May 25 whether to extend production cuts beyond June."

Libyan forces frequently capture vessels smuggling oil and arms off the coast and the North African state has become a haven for migrant smugglers who take advantage of the country's turmoil to ship people across to Europe.
Ayoub Qassem, a spokesman for the Libyan naval forces, said Ukraine-flagged tanker Routa and a vessel with an unspecified African nation's flag named Stark were captured early Friday.
""Clashes lasted for three hours, but the two tankers were successfully seized,"" Qassem said.
The incident occurred in the Sidi Said area west of Tripoli. Qassem did not report any casualties or give details on what happened to the crew of the vessels or their nationalities.
Six years after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, Libya is still caught in turmoil among rival military factions who once fought against the former leader but then turned against one another in a multi-sided power struggle.
A U.N.-backed government in Tripoli is struggling to assert control since arriving in Libya more than a year ago. Libya's oil infrastructure is also often targeted by fighting or blockades as rival groups seek to gain wealth or leverage.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Rising crude prices helped  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) easily beat analysts' quarterly profit expectations on Friday, setting an upbeat tone as the two companies press ahead with shale oil expansions.
While cost cuts and asset sales provided a boost to both companies, the results highlighted the slowly improving dynamics for the energy industry as oil prices (CLc1) (LCOc1) have climbed more than 50 percent since early 2016.
First-quarter results were especially robust at Exxon, with quarterly profit more than doubling to $4.01 billion, even as production fell 4 percent. 
Chevron swung to a $2.68 billion quarterly profit and turned cash flow positive, earning more than it spent, a milestone Wall Street analysts had long sought. Cash flow should continue to rise further, Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington told investors on a Friday conference call.
Chevron's results were helped by $2.1 billion in asset sales. The company has sold more than $5 billion in assets since last year and is seeking buyers for its Canadian oil sands business, sources have told Reuters.
If Chevron sells the business, ""we'd want to make sure we got full value for it,"" Yarrington said.
Shares of both Exxon and Chevron rose less than 1 percent in afternoon trading as U.S. oil prices traded flat near $49 per barrel. 
Their energy peers,  BP  Plc (L:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa), are set to report quarterly results next week.
Looming over the large international oil companies, though, is uncertainty over whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will extend a production cut past June when it meets next month in Vienna. Should the cut not be continued, oil prices would likely drop, pushing the sector back into recession.
'NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS'
Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's head of investor relations, said while the company believes underlying global oil demand remains strong, high inventories and new supplies coming into the market ""indicates a need to be cautious."" 
Chevron and Exxon expanded production in their American shale portfolios during the quarter, with both deciding the low-cost fields offered an easy opportunity to boost profit. They have laid out plans to increase drilling in those fields this year.
Chevron, the second largest leaseholder in the Permian Basin, which is the largest American oilfield, has devoted much of its 2017 capital budget to shale projects. Chief Executive Officer John Watson told Reuters earlier this month the Permian was vital to Chevron's growth. 
Exxon doubled its acreage holdings in the Permian Basin of West Texas earlier this year in a deal worth up to $6.6 billion. It was the U.S. oil industry's largest deal in the first quarter, and Exxon said it plans to drill its first well on the acreage soon.
""We see unique value that we're going to bring to that Permian acreage,"" Woodbury said on a conference call with investors on Friday. 
In Asia, both companies expanded liquefied natural gas operations. Chevron brought a third processing facility online at its Gorgon LNG project in Australia, and Exxon bought InterOil in a $2.5 billion deal to expand in Papua New Guinea.
Chevron still expects the Wheatstone LNG project in Australia to come online by the middle of the year, executives said.

Exxon also bought a 25 percent stake in a Mozambique gas field last month in a deal worth up to $2.8 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Friday in a see-saw session, retreating from session highs and headed for weekly declines on lingering questions about whether OPEC will extend output cuts at its May meeting and whether it will reduce a global crude glut enough to boost prices.
U.S. oil prices have lost ground in eight of the last 11 sessions. On Thursday, prices fell sharply on news that oilfields in Libya resumed production.
Most analysts polled by Reuters expect the deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers struck in December to be extended to the end of this year, but concerns remain about increased U.S. production.
U.S. light crude (CLc1) rose 19 cents to $49.16 a barrel as of 1:08 p.m. EDT (1708 GMT), off the day's high of $49.76. Benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) futures were up 16 cents to $51.60 a barrel. Both benchmarks were headed for weekly and monthly losses.
Non-OPEC member Russia said it would meet its end-April target of cutting output by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd), which supported crude prices. Russia said it would define its position on whether to extend its cuts by May 24, a day before OPEC meets in Vienna.
Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said the Russia output cuts are ""probably not enough because in the end there are only a few months left in the deal.""
U.S. crude is down 0.8 percent on the week and 2.7 percent on the month. Brent has lost 0.6 percent on the week and 2.2 percent on the month.
U.S. crude production for February rose 193,000 barrels per day to 9.03 million bpd. Weekly figures show production reaching levels not seen since August 2015.
“We’ve seen pretty meaningful room to ramp up production,"" Haworth said. Shale producers have ""been well able to hedge out price risk for further production.""
U.S. rig counts rose by nine to 697 total rigs on the week, according to Baker Hughes data, marking 15 straight weeks of increases. 
An uptick in prices since the output deal has increased profits at U.S. oil majors ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX). Both reported better-than-expected results, and both have plans to increase shale drilling. Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's head of investor relations, did say high inventories and new supply ""indicates a need to be cautious.""
U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order to allow offshore oil and gas drilling in more locations, though these projects tend to take years. Offshore lease activity is now near five-year lows. 

A Reuters poll showed analysts expect oil supply and demand to balance by the end of this year, if producing countries extend the output cut. Most analysts cut their average yearly price forecasts, with Brent expected to average $57.04 a barrel, compared with last month's forecast of $57.25.

39,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2017 10:06AM ET</span>",How North Korea gets its oil from China: lifeline in question at U.N. meeting,"By Chen Aizhu
BEIJING (Reuters) - As the United Nations Security Council decides whether to tighten the sanctions screws on North Korea, the country's increasingly isolated government could lose a lifeline provided by state-owned China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC).
For decades, the Chinese oil giant has sent small cargoes of jet fuel, diesel and gasoline from two large refineries in the northeastern city of Dalian and other nearby plants across the Yellow Sea to North Korea's western port of Nampo, five sources familiar with the business told Reuters. Nampo serves North Korea's capital, Pyongyang.
CNPC also controls the export of crude oil to North Korea, an aid program that began about 40 years ago. The sources said the crude is transported through an ageing pipeline that runs from the border town of Dandong to feed North Korea's single operational oil refinery, the Ponghwa Chemical factory in Sinuiju on the other side of the Yalu river, which splits the two nations.
The plant makes low-grade gasoline and diesel, the Chinese sources said.
The five people outlined previously unreported details about CNPC's deals with Pyongyang and how it came to dominate that business, giving insight into the two countries' relationship and what's at stake as decades of close ties sour badly because of growing concerns about North Korea's missile programs and development of nuclear weapons.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will press the U.N. Security Council on Friday to swiftly impose stronger sanctions in the event of further provocations by the reclusive state, including a long-range missile launch or sixth nuclear test.
President Donald Trump's administration is focusing its North Korea strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including an oil embargo, a global ban on its airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang, U.S. officials told Reuters earlier this month.
North Korea imports all its oil needs, mostly from China and a much smaller amount from Russia.
It bought about 270,000 tonnes of fuel, from gasoline to diesel, last year, according to China's customs data.
Crude oil exports from China to North Korea have not been disclosed by customs for several years, but the sources say it's about 520,000 tonnes a year.
OIL EMBARGO
In North Korea, diesel has been critical for farming, especially at this time of year, ahead of the planting season and also around October for harvesting. Gasoline is mainly used by the transport industry and the military, experts say.
Earlier this month, the Global Times, an influential Chinese tabloid whose stance does not necessarily reflect official policy, raised the possibility of cutting oil shipments to North Korea if it were to conduct another nuclear test.
Most analysts argue such a harsh policy would be potentially destabilizing to the regime of Kim Jong Un and say curbing oil imports may be a more realistic option.
""China could potentially be convinced to cap volumes like they did with coal, at the UNSC (United Nations Security Council) as part of a new sanctions resolution following another nuclear test,"" said Bonnie Glaser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
Any loss of the North Korea trade will have only a tiny effect on Dalian. Dalian's two refineries having a combined capacity to process over 600,000 barrels of crude oil per day, about 40 times North Korea's requirements.
CNPC, which controls both refineries, started to dominate the North Korea business in the late 1990s.
Wang Lihua, who ran CNPC's trading arm from 1998 until her retirement this month, was the mastermind behind the dealmaking, beating out state rivals like Sinochem, the sources said.
""CNPC has all along been the most politically minded among state energy firms, aiming for that role of North Korea's dominant supplier even if the business makes little money,"" said one of the sources, who is close to CNPC.
CNPC and Sinochem did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Pyongyang's increasing nuclear and ballistic missile tests have already put the brakes on the trade. Beijing quietly suspended a decades-long aid program of 50,000 tonnes annually of aviation fuel in 2013. The government officially announced a ban on jet fuel only last June.
Russia appears to have replaced China as the top supplier of jet fuel, according to sources in China familiar with the trade.
But experts are skeptical whether Moscow would be willing to become Pyongyang's lifeline for other fuels given the country's financial straits.

""They might fill some of the gap, but I'd be shocked if Russia wanted the burden of becoming a lifeline to North Korea,"" said Glaser.

U.S. crude futures for June delivery were up 0.67% at $49.30 a barrel.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the June Brent contract advanced 0.60% to $52.13 a barrel.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia originally pledged to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of the year.
However, crude prices have recently been supported by hopes OPEC will extend those cuts until the end of 2017 in order to counter rising supplies elsewhere.
Meanwhile, concerns over a global supply glut continue as U.S. crude oil production is now up 10% since mid-2016 at 9.27 million barrels per day, at comparable levels to the peak oil glut between late 2014 and early 2016."
42,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2017 06:34AM ET</span>",Next battleground: An aging Great Lakes pipeline stirs new protest,"By Nia Williams
CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The growing protest movement against U.S. oil and gas pipelines has so far focused on stopping or delaying new construction, with some high-profile successes.
Now, in Michigan, a broad coalition of opponents is entering a new frontier: Pushing to rip out and reroute an existing pipeline -  Enbridge  Inc.'s (TO:ENB) aging Line 5, which crosses the Straits of Mackinac.
They fear the pipeline will leak into the Great Lakes, which contain about a fifth of the world’s fresh water and sustain the state’s second- and third-largest industries, agriculture and tourism.
Those concerns - which are shared by two likely candidates for governor - also have far-reaching implications for energy firms and consumers.
Spanning 645 miles, Line 5 carries 540,000 barrels per day of light Canadian crude and refined products between Wisconsin and Ontario, making it a key link in Enbridge's network transporting western Canadian oil to eastern refineries. It also delivers about half the propane used to heat Michigan homes. 
Moving the pipeline, built in 1953, would cost Enbridge $4.2 million per mile - or about $2.7 billion total, according to an estimate from IHS Markit analyst Phil Hopkins.
Enbridge spokesman Ryan Duffy said that the line is structurally sound and constantly monitored, tested and inspected to prevent leaks. The firm plans to add 18 additional supports in the Straits this summer, he said.
The unprecedented demands to move an existing pipeline present steep political and regulatory challenges, said Dirk Lever, an analyst with AltaCorp Capital in Calgary.
""Move it? The question is where,"" he said. ""And good luck with building a new pipeline.""
The Michigan controversy is only the latest pipeline fight.
Last year, protests by North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux, a Native American tribe, garnered national attention and delayed the opening of Energy Transfer Partners’ (N:ETP) Dakota Access Pipeline, which finally won approval in February. 
Another ETP pipeline proposed in Louisiana has drawn protests from flood protection advocates and commercial fishermen.
The Keystone XL pipeline, planned by  TransCanada Corp  (TO:TRP), now faces a political showdown over route approval in Nebraska amid protests from farmers and ranchers. 
CAMPAIGN ISSUE 
In Michigan, pipeline opponents include regional businesses and churches, as well as local and national environmental groups.
State officials have ordered two independent reports, expected in June - one on the pipeline's reliability and another on potential alternatives if the state moves to revoke easements that allow Line 5 to operate. The reports could fuel a debate that is expected to intensify in the 2018 governor's race.
Many opponents argue the 64-year-old Enbridge pipeline has already outlived its predicted life span. They cite a 2015 interview with an engineer on the original project, Bruce Trudgen, who said that, at the time of construction, the pipeline was expected to last 50 years.
""Common sense dictates that a pipeline which is already 28 percent past its viable life will eventually be decommissioned,"" said Gretchen Whitmer, a former Michigan senator now campaigning for the Democratic nomination for governor. ""Government would be wise to plan for that proactively - before disaster strikes.""
Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, widely expected to run for governor as a Republican, has also expressed concerns about pipeline.
Enbridge, which operates more than 17,000 miles (28,000 kilometres) of oil and gas pipeline across North America, disputes the assertion that Line 5 has any specific life expectancy. 
Regardless of initial predications, Duffy said, new technology developed since the 1950s can now keep pipelines in better condition for longer.
A 1950s ENGINEERING FEAT
Michigan's debate over whether Line 5's age equates to a safety hazard could resonate across a nation crisscrossed with decades-old pipelines. More than half of U.S. pipelines were built in the 1950s or 1960s, according the U.S. Department of Transportation.
When the Enbridge line reaches the Straits of Mackinac, which connect lakes Huron and Michigan, it splits into twin 20-inch diameter steel pipes, hailed as a feat of modern engineering when they were installed in 1953.
Now, opponents here view them as the product of an era in which the damage from oil spills was not well-understood. 
Enbridge is still working to overcome public concern over the 2010 failure of its Line 6B pipeline, which leaked 20,000 barrels of crude into Michigan's Kalamazoo River in one of the largest inland spills in U.S. history.
The Straits - five miles wide and 120 feet deep - swirl with strong currents that would disperse contaminants from an oil spill faster than anywhere else in the Great Lakes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The line has never spilled under the Straits, but has leaked at least eight times at other points between 1980 and October 2015, according to the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). None of the leaks were larger than 100 barrels. 
The leak that raised the most concern was a February 2012 incident in central Michigan that environmentalists contend exposed a flaw in the original construction.
The leak of about 20 barrels was traced to a tear in the pipeline that was estimated to have originated at about the time the line was constructed, according to a PHMSA report on the spill. The tear later spread into a larger crack, causing the leak.
""The nature of the problem is a defect in the pipeline traced to the entire construction period in 1953, so that raised a lot of doubts,"" said David Holtz, a member of environmental group Sierra Club.
Enbridge declined to comment on the leaks. 
The pipeline’s age is only one factor in considering whether it poses an environmental hazard, said Jim Feather, a former president of the National Association of Corrosion Experts and a retired ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp engineering advisor.
Line 5 has done well in its regular in-line inspections, he said, and has ample protections in place.
""Just because something is old does not mean it's at much greater risk of failure,"" Feather said.

45,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2017 01:20AM ET</span>",U.S. refiners bet on strong exports to balance market,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. refiners have come out of maintenance season betting that big exports to Mexico and South America will help alleviate high product inventories and boost margins as the critical summer driving season nears.
The first wave of earnings results from several large independent U.S. refiners showed that they are not chasing U.S. gasoline profits, due to already high inventories and steady-but-not-spectacular demand. Instead, they are taking advantage of demand from places like Mexico and South America, where sputtering local refineries cannot meet customer needs. 
Marathon Petroleum Corp (N:MPC), which just completed its largest-ever quarter of turnaround projects at its three Gulf Coast refineries, expects to process more crude than ever in the second quarter, the company said in its earnings release on Thursday. 
""The export book continues to be strong,"" Marathon CEO Gary Heminger said Thursday, noting that he expects company exports to grow from about 200,000 bpd earlier this year to 300,000 bpd in the second quarter. It is expected to process about 1.82 million bpd in the second quarter.
 Valero Energy  Corp  (N:VLO), the largest U.S. independent refiner by capacity, said it expected its 15 refineries to run up to 96 percent of their combined capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in the second quarter.
There is concern, however, that high run rates might exceed the ability of refiners to export products. U.S. gasoline inventories, which had been drawing down, have rebounded to uncommonly high levels for the season, sapping refining margins.
Jack Lipinski, CEO of  CVR Energy Inc  (N:CVI), said he fears a repeat of last year, when high inventories crushed margins. The company's two refineries are landlocked and have no direct access to export markets.
""Even though we are seeing exports increasing, the increase in production is offsetting that,"" Lipinski said on an earnings call Thursday. 
Refinery crude runs  hit a record 17.3 million bpd last week and capacity utilization rates hit their highest level since November 2015. [EIA/S]
""Right now, we are running at summer peak levels. If we stay at this level for several months, rising inventories will overwhelm exports,"" said Mark Broadbent, a refinery analyst at Wood Mackenzie. ""If we stay at lower levels, then exports can help balance inventories.""
The four-week average for exports of finished motor gasoline jumped to 643,000 bpd from 395,000 bpd a year ago while exports of distillate fuel oil climbed to 1.11 million bpd versus 1.01 million bpd a year earlier, EIA data showed. 
However, March's middle distillate export loadings were at an 11-month low, while gasoline export loadings to Latin America have been anchored in the 600,000-bpd range for the past couple of months, said Matt Smith, who tracks cargoes for New York-based Clipperdata.
U.S. refiners, particularly in the Gulf Coast, have cashed in on soaring demand for refined products from Mexico, even as margins  have languished at the lowest levels in about seven years seasonally. 
The silver lining has been diesel markets. East Coast refiners are stepping up exports of diesel despite a regional deficit of the fuel as strong overseas demand, particularly in Europe, is proving more profitable.

""It's a distillate world out there,"" said Scott Shelton, energy futures broker with ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Durham, North Carolina. He said ultimately the narrowing in gasoline's premium to diesel  should prompt more diesel refining, tightening gasoline supplies. That spread hit a four-year seasonal low on Thursday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude prices were slightly lower after a volatile session on Thursday, as the restart of two key Libyan oilfields and concerns about lackluster gasoline demand fed concern over whether major oil producers can alleviate the glut of global inventories.
Libya's Sharara and El Feel oilfields, which can produce nearly 400,000 barrels per day (bpd), returned to production after protests blocking pipelines ended.
U.S. gasoline futures led the energy complex lower in choppy trading, at one point hitting its lowest level seasonally in eight years after data on Wednesday showed inventories rose by the most in nearly three months.
Brent crude (LCOc1) settled down 14 cents a barrel at $51.68. U.S. light crude (CLc1) was down 37 cents to $49.25 a barrel.
“Gasoline is kind of keeping crude from going up very much,"" said James Williams, president of energy consultant WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas.
U.S. gasoline (RBc1) tumbled almost 2 percent to $1.559 a gallon. 
""Gasoline is leading the way lower with ample stocks, lower demand compared to last year, and an increase in gas(oline) stocks on the east coast,"" said Anthony Headrick of CHS Hedging.
“For the last four weeks gas demand is down 1.8 percent from last year.” 
Global crude oil inventories have remained high, in part because of increased production from the United States. At 9.27 million bpd it is at its highest since August 2015, according to government data. 
Amid concerns about the persistent global oil glut the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia are in talks to extend a six-month deal to cut 1.8 million bpd into the second half of the year.
OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said although the oil oversupply was declining, stocks needed to fall further, in comments that pointed to an extension in cuts.
Barkindo did not comment directly on whether the cut would be extended, but he said efforts were under way led by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who is OPEC president in 2017, to get a consensus before ministers meet in Vienna on May 25.

The International Energy Agency said in its latest monthly market report that oil stocks in industrialized countries stood at around 3.06 billion barrels at the end of February, some 336 million barrels above the five-year average.

54,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2017 09:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Fear of regulation causes big swings in London's silver benchmark,"By Peter Hobson and Jan Harvey
LONDON (Reuters) - London's silver price benchmark is plagued by big, unpredictable fluctuations that risk undermining its credibility and may complicate efforts by the London Bullion Market Association to find a new operator, according to a Reuters analysis of trading data and 10 industry sources.
The benchmark is used by silver producers and consumers around the world, including jewelers and electronics firms, to price their contracts in the multi-billion-dollar a day trade.
The figure generated at noon London time is intended to be a fair and accurate daily snapshot of the wider, fast-moving ""spot"" market. However, it has diverged widely from the spot price on a number of occasions since at least January 2016, leaving buyers and sellers with unexpected gains or losses, according to the Reuters analysis using Thomson Reuters data. 
Between January 2016 and March this year volumes have risen as high as 12.9 million ounces and fallen as low as 200,000 ounces, while on seven occasions the benchmark has diverged from the underlying spot price by 10 cents or more. It has diverged by more than 5 cents on more than two dozen occasions, including five times in late March alone. This is highly unusual as the average divergence for the electronic auction is about 1 cent.
At the core of the problem are low volumes and the unwillingness of seven banks that execute trading orders to add liquidity by buying or selling silver during the auction to ensure the benchmark stayed close to the spot price.
Traditionally banks did so, but many changed their approach after the scandal over the manipulation of the Libor interest rate benchmark, according to the 10 industry sources. Banks are now unwilling to intervene beyond putting in orders beforehand, fearing this might be construed as price manipulation by regulators, the sources said.
When asked about the volatility and its implications for the credibility of the of the benchmark, the LBMA said: ""The LBMA takes seriously any incident that undermines the credibility of the benchmark auction.""
""It is recognized that some banks' reluctance to amend orders once the auction has started has been an issue for the benchmark. The LBMA is hoping potential new operators can propose ways to enhance the auction process.""
The seven banks are: HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Scotiabank, Toronto-Dominion Bank, UBS and China Construction Bank. Scotiabank and China Construction Bank did not respond to requests for comment, while the other five banks declined to comment. The UK financial regulator also declined to comment.
DENTING CONFIDENCE
The banks' decision not to add liquidity has reduced the volume of orders in the auction and its flexibility, making the benchmark volatile.
The problems come at a time when the LBMA is looking for a new operator for the benchmark after exchange platform provider CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) and information and technology company Thomson Reuters announced their intention to quit last month, saying new regulations had prompted a review of their involvement, without elaborating.
CME and Thomson Reuters told Reuters in a joint statement on Wednesday that they were committed to upholding the integrity of the LBMA Silver Price, and were working with all stakeholders to ensure its smooth operation through the transition to a new provider. 
The administrators attempted to stabilize the auction in March this year by widening the acceptable gap between buy and sell orders, making it easier to set a price.
The price anomalies are denting confidence in the auction. One European silver trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said many of his clients now preferred to execute trades at spot prices rather than use the more volatile auction.
On March 20, Toronto-Dominion Bank scaled back its exposure, according to three sources who said the bank told financial clients it would no longer take their orders to the auction because it feared the benchmark could lose liquidity and become more unpredictable.
Toronto-Dominion Bank declined to comment.
Against this backdrop of uncertainty, the LBMA launched a tender for a new operator in mid-April and wants a new company or companies in place by autumn. 
Many market participants had speculated three years ago that a key attraction was that a successful bid could swiftly be followed by deals to run the much higher profile gold benchmark.
That carrot doesn't exist this time. The LBMA Gold price auction was awarded to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in 2015.
""Everybody thought that silver was going to lead to getting gold, but now ICE has got the gold,"" said Michael Greenacre, chief executive of Autilla, which took part in a bid to operate the silver benchmark in 2014. ""The cherry on the pie has gone.""
Industry sources said there were likely to be far fewer bidders than the seven attracted when the electronic auction was launched 2014 and that it would be a far tougher sell because of the volatility problems and the lack of the gold incentive. 
The LBMA denies that, saying it has been approached by interested parties. It declined to give numbers or names.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude June contract slumped to a session low of $48.68, a level not seen since March 29. It was last at $48.63 by 8:05AM ET (12:05GMT), down 99 cents, or about 2%.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for July delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London lost $1.06 to $51.34 a barrel, after touching its lowest since March 28 at $51.26 earlier.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 3.6 million barrels in the week ended April 21, a larger draw than expected.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 3.4 million barrels, disappointing expectations for a drop 1.0 million barrels, as refiners produced more fuel than the market could consume.
Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil production continued its relentless rise, and is now up 10% since mid-2016 at 9.27 million barrels per day, at comparable levels to the peak oil glut between late 2014 and early 2016.
The increase in U.S. output has overshadowed pledged output cuts by major producers.

57,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2017 05:56AM ET</span>",Iraq says will go with consensus at next OPEC meeting,"By Alex Lawler
PARIS (Reuters) - Iraq will go with the consensus reached by OPEC when the oil exporter group meets in Vienna next month to discuss extending production cuts, the country's oil minister said on Thursday. 
""Now we're going on the 25th of May to OPEC and we're definitely going to be in line with OPEC's final decision and collective decisions,"" Jabar al-Luaibi told a conference in Paris.
Iraq, the second-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, was in full compliance with the OPEC-led supply pact reached last year and has achieved about 97 percent of its output reduction target, Luaibi said.
""Iraq is fully committed and Iraq is in full compliance with OPEC members,"" Luaibi said.
He added that the OPEC-led cuts were gradually leading to a long-awaited rebalancing of the oil market. 
OPEC, Russia and other producers originally agreed to cut production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) for six months from Jan. 1 to support the market and to bring a supply glut into check. 
The producers are expected to prolong the pact for a further six months when they meet in May.
Luaibi said the OPEC decision to cut did not mean countries should stop developing their oil industries.

Earlier this month, Luaibi said Iraq planned to raise its oil output capacity to 5 million bpd before the end of the year.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude June contract shed 45 cents, or around 0.9%, to $49.16 a barrel by 4:10AM ET (08:10GMT). The U.S. benchmark gained 6 cents on Wednesday.
It hit its weakest level since March 29 at $48.87 earlier in the week.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for July delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 45 cents to $51.96 a barrel, not far from a four-week low of $51.30 touched on Monday.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 3.6 million barrels in the week ended April 21, a larger draw than expected.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 3.4 million barrels, disappointing expectations for a drop 1.0 million barrels, as refiners produced more fuel than the market could consume.
Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil production continued its relentless rise, and is now up 10% since mid-2016 at 9.27 million barrels per day, at comparable levels to the peak oil glut between late 2014 and early 2016.
The increase in U.S. shale output has overshadowed pledged output cuts by major producers.

59,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2017 03:30AM ET</span>",Fast-rising U.S. shale oil output puts OPEC cut at risk: Rystad,"By Mark Tay and Florence Tan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Shale oil output in the United States is rising much faster than expected and gaining market share globally, increasing the risk of a ""volume war"" with OPEC and weaker oil prices, the founder of oil and gas consultancy Rystad Energy said.
Rystad Energy expects U.S. shale oil output to grow by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) each month for the rest of this year and into 2018 if oil prices hold around $50-$55 a barrel, well above estimates by the U.S. Energy Information Administration for monthly gains of about 29,000 bpd in 2017 and 57,000 bpd in 2018. 
""We see a risk for a weaker oil price towards the end of the year ... because shale is delivering so much oil and OPEC might fight back,"" Jarand Rystad told Reuters earlier this week.
Strong returns in the shale sector are pulling in fresh investment, while round-the-clock drilling and new rigs are boosting production, he said.
Fast-growing shale oil output is adding to the dilemma faced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other non-OPEC countries like Russia as they consider whether to extend output cuts into the second half of this year or boost volumes in a bid to regain market share.
""A volume war is if they do not extend the production cuts and bring all the fields back into production,"" Rystad said, referring to oilfields that have been shut for maintenance as Middle East producers comply with production cuts.
A boost in Middle East output would most likely hit mature basins in Southeast Asia or in the UK North Sea more than U.S. shale producers because of their high investment costs, said Wood Mackenzie's global exploration analyst Andrew Latham.
""It will take an almighty price war to really shut down the sweet spots of the (U.S.) Permian because the well production is so good and the breakevens are so low,"" Latham said.
U.S. shale oil output was set for its biggest monthly rise in more than two years in May, government data showed this month, jumping by 123,000 bpd to 5.19 million bpd.

Total chief executive Patrick Pouyanne warned last week that the rapid increase in shale output could push oil prices down again by year-end.

(Reuters) - U.S. crude oil inventories fell sharply and stockpiles of gasoline and distillates jumped last week as refiners hiked production rates to the highest since November 2015 to process a record amount of crude, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.
Crude inventories  fell 3.6 million barrels in the week to April 21, compared with analyst expectations for a decrease of 1.7 million barrels. 
That marks the third straight week of drawdowns in crude stocks, which will help reduce the glut of supply that has kept oil trading in a range between the high-$40s and mid-$50s per barrel.
As seasonal spring maintenance has ended, refiners ramped up production ahead of the high-demand summer driving season. 
Refinery crude runs  rose by 347,000 barrels per day to a record 17.3 million bpd and utilization rates  rose by 1.2 percentage points to 94.1 percent of total capacity, the highest rate since November 2015, EIA data showed. 
""The report was somewhat supportive for prices, due to the overall crude oil inventory drawdown resulting from a further rise in the refinery utilization rate and large upward spike in crude oil exports,"" said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York.
U.S. crude imports  rose last week by 515,000 bpd to 7.8 million bpd as exports increased 587,000 bpd to 1.2 million bpd, the highest rate since Feb. 17. 
Consumption, however was a concern as total product demand over past four weeks at 19.5 mln bpd was off 2.2 percent from a year ago.
""Demand for refined products remains weak for this time of the year, which will be a cause for concern over the coming weeks if demand fails to recover,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy's Global Gas Analytics in London. 
Gasoline stocks  rose 3.4 million barrels, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1 million-barrel drop. U.S. inventories of gasoline have rebounded in the last two weeks of figures, putting them about on par with 2016's levels at this time, which is seasonally high. 
Distillate stockpiles , which include diesel and heating oil, rose 2.7 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.
Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures  fell 1.2 million barrels, EIA said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Some of North Korea's state-run petrol stations are restricting sales or appear to have closed, visitors said on Wednesday, ahead of a U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss tougher sanctions on the isolated state that could include curbs on oil imports.
Nevertheless, diesel and petrol prices quoted by private traders are stable, with supply continuing uninterrupted, according to data compiled by Reuters and interviews with North Korean defectors.
""I've noticed a few (state-owned) gas stations around town that are closed,"" said Rowan Beard of Young Pioneer Tours, a China-based company that takes Western tourists to North Korea. 
""Cars now have a limit of 15 kg (about 20 liters) of fuel. It's been like this for 15 days. Vehicles which are used for work purposes have special exceptions,"" Beard told Reuters in a message from North Korea.
Another source traveling in the remote northeast area of Rason, who asked not to be named, said that official gasoline prices there had surged or that fuel was being rationed.
But a Reuters analysis of data collected by Daily NK, a website run by defectors who collect prices via phone calls with North Korean fuel traders, said the price of gasoline sold by private dealers in Pyongyang and the northern border cities of Sinuiju and Hyesan had remained relatively stable since late last year at around $1 per kg (about $1.34 per liter).
The price of diesel has averaged at 58 U.S. cents per kg (about 68 cents per liter) as of April 21, compared to 68 cents at the beginning of the year, according to the data.
Fuel is sold by weight in North Korea. 
The North Korean government is likely the country's largest consumer of fuel products, but most gasoline and diesel bought by ordinary North Koreans is supplied by private dealers and smugglers, experts say.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will chair a ministerial meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Friday to discuss tougher sanctions on North Korea to deter it from pursuing nuclear and ballistic missiles programs. U.S. officials have said this could include an oil embargo.
North Korea consumes relatively little oil, but curbing or cutting off its supplies in retaliation for further nuclear or long-range missile tests would be painful and potentially destabilizing to the regime of Kim Jong Un.
North Korean domestic fuel prices have surged in the past over fears that sanctions could affect supply. In March 2016, even private fuel prices rose by over 45 percent just before U.N. sanctions were imposed following Pyongyang's fourth nuclear test.
OTHER FACTORS
But there could be other factors at play for the current short supply at government-owned pumps.
Fuel in North Korea is often prioritized for government or military vehicles, especially ahead of national holidays, of which there have been two recently: April 15 to commemorate the birth anniversary of state founder Kim Il Sung, and April 25, the 85th anniversary of the founding of its military.
Prices also tend to rise ahead of the rice planting season, traditionally the first week of May, defectors speaking to sources inside North Korean markets said.
China supplies most of North Korea's fuel needs, with some coming from Russia.
Sources familiar with China's fuel exports to North Korea said there are no signs of China cutting back gasoline shipments, and any petrol rationing could be caused by a shortfall of foreign currency in North Korea as a result of China's coal embargo.
China stopped buying coal from North Korea in February as part of its efforts to implement U.N. sanctions.
""The coal ban is fatal as it should be its top revenue earner, which means they're running short of foreign exchange to buy gasoline,"" said one source.
China supplies crude oil and diesel under aid programs to North Korea, but Chinese suppliers normally receive advance hard cash before deliveries of gasoline, said the source.    
The stability of market prices, despite the lack of state supply, could also be because North Korea is quietly encouraging fuel smuggling in the fear that an official embargo may be in the works, said Kang Mi-jin, a defector who speaks regularly to market sources inside North Korea and reports commodity prices for Daily NK.
""When there's concern about supplies of fuel or other products, North Korea naturally opens the door to smuggling,"" said Kang, who spoke to a fuel smuggler by phone on the North Korean-Chinese border on Wednesday.
Kang said none of her sources inside North Korea had reported a significant rise in fuel prices.

73,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2017 07:12AM ET</span>","Oil prices slip on bulging U.S. crude stockpiles, ample supplies","By Sabina Zawadzki
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Wednesday as ample global supplies and data showing a rise in U.S. crude inventories cast doubt on OPEC's ability to tighten the market with output cuts.
Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, eased 26 cents to $51.84 per barrel at 1054 GMT. Brent is now around 8.5 percent below its April peak.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was trading down 24 cents at $49.32 per barrel, heading for its eighth fall in nine sessions.
U.S. inventory data issued late on Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute (API) weighed on prices.
The report showed crude stockpiles rose 897,000 barrels in the week to April 21, defying expectations of a fall of 1.7 million barrels, and also showed a large build in gasoline stocks, unusual for this time of the year.
""Should these figures be mirrored by the EIA, widespread concerns over stubbornly high OECD oil stocks will have been justified in what would be a setback to the global oil rebalancing process,"" analysts at PVM said.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will issue its inventory data at 1430 GMT on Wednesday. [EIA/S]
Brent and WTI found some support from Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who said he was interested in talks between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers to stabilize prices.
OPEC and a handful of big producers, including Russia, pledged to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017. Gulf and some other producers have indicated cuts could be extended to the end of 2017.
An extension will be discussed when OPEC meets in May.
""The market remains heavy with doubts about OPEC's ability to achieve a successful extension of the current deal with Russia adopting a lukewarm 'wait and see' approach,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.
He said a bearish EIA report could prompt prices to challenge support levels but they were unlikely to break below the low in March, when Brent dipped under $50.
The average value of the Brent crude forward curve <0#LCO:> has fallen by over $5 per barrel since the start of the year, when an OPEC-led supply cut started.
The slump in Brent is a result of record crude oil volumes in circulation on ships around the world. Thomson Reuters Eikon shipping data showed 50 million bpd were booked for shipment on tankers this month, up 10 percent since December.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude June contract shed 21 cents, or around 0.4%, to $49.35 a barrel by 4:00AM ET (08:00GMT).
The U.S. benchmark settled higher for the first time in seven sessions on Tuesday after hitting its weakest level since March 29 at $48.87.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for July delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 17 cents to $52.40 a barrel after sliding to $51.30 in the prior session, its deepest trough since March 28.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories unexpectedly rose by 897,000 barrels in the week ended April 21.
The API report also showed a gain of 4.4 million barrels in gasoline stocks, widely missing an expected fall, while distillate stocks declined by a less-than-forecast 36,000 barrels.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report at 10:30AM ET (14:30GMT) Wednesday. There are often sharp divergences between the API estimates and the official figures from EIA.
If the build is confirmed, it would be the first increase after two consecutive drawdowns.
Crude has been under heavy selling pressure in recent days amid fears that an ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 14th week in a row, data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed on Friday, extending a 10-month drilling recovery. That brought the total count to 688, the most since September 2015.
The increase in U.S. output has overshadowed pledged output cuts by major producers. In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January and June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled slightly higher on Tuesday in volatile trading, then were mixed after hours when an industry group's preliminary report showed a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories.
Oil prices seesawed throughout the day after falling sharply over the previous six sessions. Prices have been pressured as rising U.S. crude production has offset much of the output cuts by OPEC and other countries trying to reduce a global glut in crude.
“We’ve seen rigs increase for the last 14 weeks and if we continue to see that it could put pressure on crude oil prices,"" said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors.
Prices dipped after the market settled. The American Petroleum Institute said its data showed U.S. crude oil stocks rose 897,000 barrels in the latest week. Analysts had expected a draw of 1.6 million barrels.
The API also said U.S. gasoline inventories increased. The market will watch closely Wednesday morning to see whether official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration confirms the API numbers. [EIA/S]
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) settled up 33 cents to $49.56 a barrel, breaking a streak that saw the benchmark lose 7.4 percent. Brent crude (LCOc1) settled up 50 cents at $52.10 a barrel. Both crude contracts fell after the API report, but U.S. crude bounced back to its settlement price.
The API said gasoline stocks rose 4.4 million barrels. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 1 million-barrel decline, as U.S. summer driving season approaches. 
""We're seeing less demand last week which could be allowing a build, and it could be furthering that as the weeks go on,"" Zahir said. 
Brent is down about 5 percent since early December, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia agreed to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of the year. 
On Tuesday, the Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvokovich as saying Russia may increase oil production.
Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky noted that global crude loadings ""continue to tick higher"" and added that the glut probably will not abate ""until we see the oil on the water falling."" 

Georgi Slavov, head of research at Marex Spectron, said supply should tighten over the next couple of weeks, ""not only in the Arabian Gulf but also with Russian oil. Russia is not going to pump and export as much oil as they did in the last couple of weeks.""

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude June contract rose 13 cents, or around 0.3%, to $49.36 a barrel by 4:45AM ET (08:45GMT).
The U.S. benchmark settled lower for the sixth session in a row on Monday after hitting its weakest level since March 29 at $49.03.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for June delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London tacked on 16 cents to $52.29 a barrel after sliding to $51.42 in the prior session, its deepest trough since March 29.
Investors looked ahead to weekly data from the U.S. on stockpiles of crude and refined products.
Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (20:30GMT) later on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of 1.3 million barrels.
Crude has been under heavy selling pressure in recent days amid fears that an ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
U.S. drillers last week added rigs for the 14th week in a row, data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed on Friday, extending a 10-month drilling recovery. That brought the total count to 688, the most since September 2015.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump will sign several executive orders on energy and the environment this week, which would make it easier for the U.S. to develop energy on and offshore, a White House official said on Sunday.
The increase in U.S. output has overshadowed pledged output cuts by major producers. In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January and June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
Russia said on Monday that its oil output could climb to the highest rate in 30 years if OPEC and non-OPEC producers do not extend a supply reduction deal beyond June 30.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for June inched down 0.2 cents, or about 0.2%, to $1.624 a gallon, while June heating oil added 0.2 cents to $1.550 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for June delivery was little changed at $3.159 per million British thermal units.

90,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 25, 2017 01:20AM ET</span>",East Coast refiners eye Texas oil as North Dakota alternative,"By Catherine Ngai and Jarrett Renshaw
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. East Coast refiners are looking to buy increasing volumes of domestic crude oil from the Gulf Coast, two sources said, the latest twist in a trade flow upheaval in the wake of the opening of the Dakota Access pipeline.
Major U.S. East Coast refiners profited from railing hundreds of thousands of barrels of discounted Bakken crude to their plants daily from 2013 until 2015. But as more and more pipelines were built in North Dakota, the discount began to disappear, and so did the rail cars.
Now, at least two East Coast refiners, Phillips 66 (N:PSX) and Delta Air Lines Inc's (N:DAL) subsidiary Monroe Energy, are looking to move more crude by ship from Texas into the Philadelphia area. The Dakota Access pipeline starts up in May, giving the Gulf access to the Bakken shale play, and will likely sap any lingering economic incentive for Bakken-by-rail, which is more expensive. 
This option is more expensive than oil imported to the East Coast, typically from Nigeria. Analysts and traders expected that once the Dakota line came into service, East Coast and West Coast refiners would rely on foreign barrels.
In 2016, 13 million barrels of crude went from the U.S. Gulf to the East Coast, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. By comparison, the East Coast took in 323 million barrels of imported crude last year. 
Shipping sources say that costs could range between $2.60 to $3.50 a barrel for the two-week round trip on a U.S. flagged vessel. That is lower than the peak, brokers said, because a number of spare vessels are available. Taking a cargo of Nigerian Bonny Light to Philadelphia costs about $1.40 a barrel, brokers said. 
Brokers interviewed said bringing U.S. oil via tanker to the East Coast gives refiners access to a variety of crude grades available in Texas, where most U.S. oil ends up now. 
""It's about optimizing assets. From Texas, you could bring up Eagle Ford, Permian or even Bakken crude,"" said one source. 
That journey could guarantee a steady supply of domestic crude, as both Phillips 66 and Monroe Energy already have U.S.-flagged Jones Act tankers contracted, brokers said, so bringing that crude would not be difficult. Phillips 66 and other refiners use their tankers to shuffle products to higher margin regions or to bring crude to their refineries.
Even with added Gulf shipments to the East Coast, refiners there should still receive the bulk of their supply from foreign sources due to economics, said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research for Morningstar.
West Africa produces crude that is ""gasoline rich,"" he said, important for East Coast refiners. He said he doubts sending Jones Act tankers makes a lot of sense financially because the spread between global benchmark Brent (LCOc1) and U.S. West Texas crude (CLc1) futures is not enough to justify the shift. 
In an earnings call last year, Phillips 66 President Tim Taylor said the combination of the Dakota pipeline and water could potentially supply the 285,000 barrel per day Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey.

Moving crude by water from the Gulf up the Eastern Seaboard is not unheard of. Since October, NARL Refining LP has booked at least seven cargoes from Texas ports to its 130,000 bpd Come-By-Chance refinery in Newfoundland, in eastern Canada. In the previous 10 months, NARL booked just four Texas cargoes, according to Reuters Eikon shipping data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped nearly 1 percent on Monday, extending last week's decline, on lack of confirmation that OPEC will extend output cuts till the end of 2017 and as Russia indicated it can lift output if the deal on curbs lapses.
Russian oil output could climb to its highest rate in 30 years if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers do not extend a six-month supply reduction deal beyond June 30, according to comments by Russian officials and details of investment plans released by oil firms.
""We think an extension is highly likely, with a growing OPEC consensus in support of that policy, but the market seems to be attributing last week's decline to the lack of a firm agreement,"" Tim Evans, Citi Futures' energy futures specialist, said in a note.
""In our view, the drop had more to do with correcting the prior excess optimism and speculative excess, than with any shift in the underlying fundamental scenario, but those requiring a fundamental explanation ... will focus on OPEC or U.S. production growth instead.""
Last week, prices plummeted about 7 percent partly on signs that rising U.S. shale production offset efforts by OPEC and other producers to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of the year.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) fell 34 cents by 2:11 p.m. EDT (1811 GMT) to $51.62 per barrel after hitting a session high of $52.57 a barrel.

Traders and brokers also noted that crude markets were lower despite a relief rally over the French election, with the U.S. dollar (DXY) noticeably weaker. [USD/] This reflects the prevailing bearish market sentiment, they said. 
U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) fell about 1.2 percent, leading the energy complex lower, as refiners ramp up production after seasonal maintenance and on demand worries, traders said.

In the week to April 21, U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a 14th week in a row, to 688 rigs, extending an 11-month recovery that is expected to boost U.S. shale production in May by the biggest monthly increase in more than two years.
U.S. crude production is at 9.3 million bpd , up almost 10 percent since mid-2016, approaching the level of OPEC's top exporter Saudi Arabia.

101,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2017 06:07AM ET</span>","Trump to set new executive orders on environment, energy this week","By David Shepardson and Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump this week will sign new executive orders before he completes his first 100 days in office, including two on energy and the environment, which would make it easier for the United States to develop energy on and offshore, a White House official said on Sunday.
""This builds on previous executive actions that have cleared the way for job-creating pipelines, innovations in energy production, and reduced unnecessary burden on energy producers,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.  
On Wednesday, Trump is expected to sign an executive order related to the 1906 Antiquities Act, which enables the president to designate federal areas of land and water as national monuments to protect them from drilling, mining and development, the source said.
On Friday, Trump is expected to sign an order to review areas available for offshore oil and gas exploration, as well as rules governing offshore drilling.
The new measures would build on a number of energy- and environment-related executive orders signed by Trump seeking to gut most of the climate change regulations put in place by predecessor President Barack Obama.
A summary of the forthcoming orders, seen by Reuters, say past administrations ""overused"" the Antiquities Act, putting more federal areas under protection than necessary.
Obama had used the Antiquities Act more than any other president, his White House said in December, when he designated over 1.6 million acres of land in Utah and Nevada as national monuments, protecting two areas rich in Native American artifacts from mining, oil and gas drilling.
The summary also says previous administrations have been ""overly restrictive"" of offshore drilling.
Late in Obama's second term, he banned new drilling in federal waters in parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using a 1950s-era law that environmental groups say would require a drawn out court challenge to reverse.
Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said during his January confirmation hearing that Trump could “amend” Obama’s monument designations but any move to rescind a designation would immediately be challenged.
Last month, Trump signed an order calling for a review of Obama's Clean Power Plan, and reversed a ban on coal leasing on federal lands.
In addition to the energy-related orders, Trump is also expected this week to sign an order to create an office of accountability in the Veterans Affairs department.

He is also expected to create a rural America interagency task force to recommend policies to address issues facing agricultural states.

109,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2017 12:04PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Vomitoxin makes nasty appearance for U.S. farm sector,"By P.J. Huffstutter and Michael Hirtzer
CHICAGO (Reuters) - A fungus that causes “vomitoxin” has been found in some U.S. corn harvested last year, forcing poultry and pork farmers to test their grain, and giving headaches to grain growers already wrestling with massive supplies and low prices.
The plant toxin sickens livestock and can also make humans and pets fall ill.
The appearance of vomitoxin and other toxins produced by fungi is affecting ethanol markets and prompting grain processors to seek alternative sources of feed supplies.
Researchers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture first isolated the toxin in 1973 after an unusually wet winter in the Midwest. The compound was given what researchers described as the “trivial name” vomitoxin because pigs were refusing to eat the infected corn or vomiting after consuming it. The U.S. Corn Belt had earlier outbreaks of infection from the toxin in 1966 and 1928.
A vessel carrying a shipment of corn from Paraguay is due next month at a North Carolina port used by Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL] (HK:0288), the world's largest pork producer. 
The spread of vomitoxin is concentrated in Indiana, Wisconsin, Ohio, and parts of Iowa and Michigan, and its full impact is not yet known, according to state officials and data gathered by food testing firm  Neogen Corp . (O:NEOG)
In Indiana, 40 of 92 counties had at least one load of corn harvested last fall that has tested positive for vomitoxin, according to the Office of Indiana State Chemist's county survey. In 2015 and 2014, no more than four counties saw grain affected by the fungus. 
And in a ""considerable"" share of corn crops tested in Michigan, Wisconsin and Indiana since last fall's harvest, the vomitoxin levels have tested high enough to be considered too toxic for humans, pets, hogs, chickens and dairy cattle, according to public and private data compiled by Neogen. The company did not state what percent of each state's corn crop was tested.
Smithfield would not confirm it had ordered the corn from Paraguay, but two independent grain trading sources said Smithfield was the likely buyer. A company source said corn Smithfield has brought in from Indiana and Ohio, to feed pigs in North Carolina, has been ""horrible quality” due to the presence of mycotoxins. 
TOXIN LEVELS 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows vomitoxin levels of up to 1 part per million (ppm) in human and pet foods and recommends levels under 5 ppm in grain for hogs, 10 ppm for chickens and dairy cattle. Beef cattle can withstand toxin levels up to 30 ppm.
Alltech Inc, a Kentucky-based feed supplement company, said 73 percent of feed samples it has tested this year have vomitoxin. The company analyzed samples sent by farmers whose animals have fallen ill. 
""We know there is lots of bad corn out there, because corn byproducts keep getting worse,"" said Max Hawkins, a nutritionist with Alltech. 
Neogen, which sells grain testing supplies, reported a 29 percent jump in global sales for toxin tests - with strong demand for vomitoxin tests - in their fiscal third quarter, ending Feb. 28. 
""We're polling our customers and continually talking to them about the levels they're seeing. Those levels are not going down,"" said Pat Frasco, director of sales for Neogen's milling, grain and pet food business. 
The problem, stemming from heavy rain before and during the 2016 harvest, prompted farmers to store wet grain, said farmers, ethanol makers and grain inspectors.
The issue was compounded by farmers and grain elevators storing corn on the ground and other improvised spaces, sometimes covering the grain piles with plastic tarps. Grain buyers say they will have a clearer picture of the problem later this spring, as more farm-stored grain is moved to market.
Iowa State University grain quality expert Charles Hurburgh said the sheer size of the harvest in 2016 – the largest in U.S. history – complicates the job of managing toxins in grain, especially in the core Midwest.
""Mycotoxins are very hard to handle in high volume,"" he said. ""You can't test every truckload, or if you do, you are only going to unload 20 trucks in a day.” By comparison, corn processors in Iowa unload 400 or more trucks a day. 
BIOFUEL IMPACTS
Ethanol makers already are feeling the impact. Turning corn into ethanol creates a byproduct called distillers dried grains (DDGs), which is sold as animal feed. With fuel prices low, the DDGs can boost profitability. 
But the refining process triples the concentration of mycotoxins, making the feed byproduct less attractive. DDG prices in Indiana fell to $92.50 per ton in February, the lowest since 2009, and now are selling for $97.50 per ton, according to USDA.
Many ethanol plants are testing nearly every load of corn they receive for the presence of vomitoxin, said Indiana grain inspector Doug Titus, whose company has labs at  The Andersons  Inc (O:ANDE), a grain handler, and energy company  Valero Energy  (VLO) sites. 
The Andersons in a February call with analysts said vomitoxin has hurt results at three of its refineries in the eastern U.S. ""That will be with us for some time,"" Andersons' chief executive Pat Bowe said.
Missouri grain farmer Doug Roth, who put grain into storage after last year’s wet harvest, has seen a few loads of corn rejected by clients who make pet food after the grain tested positive for low levels of fumonisin, a type of mycotoxin.
Roth said he paid to reroute the grain to livestock producers in Arkansas, who planned to blend it with unaffected grain in order to mitigate the effect of the toxins. 
""As long as this doesn’t become a widespread problem, we're all fine,"" said Roth, who said toxins have shown up in less than 1 percent of the grain loads he has sold.
U.S. farmers with clean corn are reaping a price bump. A Cardinal Ethanol plant in Union City, Indiana, is offering grain sellers a 10-cent per bushel premium for corn with less than one-part-per-million (ppm) or less of vomitoxin in it, according to the company's website.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for June delivery shed $1.09 to settle at $49.62 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent shed $1.13 cents to trade at $51.86 a barrel.
Crude oil prices posted a nearly 7% loss for the week, falling below the key $50 a barrel level, after Saudi Oil Minister Khalid Al-Falih expressed concerns that rising U.S. oil output would undermine the effectiveness of extending the current OPEC-led deal to cut supply, beyond June.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said earlier during the week, “there is consensus building [concerning a possible extension to the OPEC-led deal] but it’s not done yet”.
Meanwhile, U.S. drilling activity didn’t show any sign of a slowdown, after Oilfield services firm Barker Hughes reported Friday, its weekly U.S. rig count rose by 5 to 688.
Concerns over rising levels of U.S. oil production resumed this week, after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported bearish crude inventories earlier this week, and released a report, which showed U.S. shale production was set to rise to 5.19 million barrels a day in May.
Market participants remained hopeful that OPEC members and other oil producers would agree to extend the current deal to cut supply beyond June at the next meeting, scheduled for May 25.
In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). The deal to cut supply came into effect in January this year for a period of six-months until June."

112,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2017 08:40AM ET</span>",Is China too tough a steel beast for Trump to tame?,"By Manolo Serapio Jr and Muyu Xu
MANILA/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's first shot across China's bow over its steel exports, escalating a years-long brawl over trade between the world's top two economies, may not pull up Beijing. 
China exported 620,000 tonnes of steel direct to the United States last year, a fraction of the 800 million tonnes it produces each year, equal to about half of world output. 
Repeated allegations that the world's top steelmaker is dumping excess output on world markets may hit harder closer to home - in Japan and South Korea where steel sectors have borne the brunt of China's rampant sales abroad. 
Speaking in the U.S. capitol at IMF and World Bank meetings after Trump launched a trade probe against China and other exporters of cheap steel, Japan's finance minister Taro Aso laid the blame squarely on China, saying its vast exports are hurting U.S., Indian and Japanese steel industries. 
China's steel exports hit a record 112.4 million tonnes in 2015, then dropped slightly to 108.49 million tonnes last year, as mills have been chastened by threats of a trade dispute and better demand at home, experts said. 
Exports fell to a three-year low of 5.75 million tonnes in February, recovering slightly to 7.56 million tonnes in March. 
Still Trump's salvo will renew concerns that China may retaliate, with U.S. farmers fearing they would be in the crosshairs of any dispute. 
""Trump will do what's best for America, but China will do what's best for China,"" said Roberto Cola, vice president of the ASEAN Iron and Steel Council. 
If Trump slaps new tariffs on steel exports from China and elsewhere, that will trigger anti-dumping and countervailing measures from these countries, said Cola. 
""It seems we're going back to the protectionist era."" 
(For a graphic on U.S. steel products imports, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2oPeo1z)
SCALE AND SOPHISTICATION
Two events this week illustrated the challenge and complexity in trying to force China to curb excess steel capacity and cheap exports, an issue which also plagued Trump's predecessor for years. 
Customs data showed on Monday that Chinese mills in March churned out a record 72 million tonnes of crude steel, mainly used in construction and infrastructure. 
Then, underscoring the scale and sophistication of China's vast export machine, the government on Wednesday published a roadmap outlining its plan to triple its export from almost 80 industries, including steel. 
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Friday the country needed to ascertain the direction of any U.S. investigation before it could make a judgment. 
Chinese steel executives repeated their mantra that overcapacity is not just China's problem and it needs global coordination to resolve it, but also said it would be tough to rein in the sector. 
""The Chinese government will not set export limits for the steel mills and could not keep track of every mill,"" said Li Xinchuang, vice chairman of the China Iron and Steel Association. 
""It will not be a good thing for U.S. steel industry and consumers if Trump decides to adopt protectionism."" 
About a third of China's steel exports flow into ASEAN, or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which last year reached 34.3 million tonnes, based on data compiled by UK-based consultancy MEPS, which has been tracking China's steel industry since the late 1990s. 
South Korea is the top market for Chinese exports where 12.3 million tonnes were shipped last year, followed by Vietnam. 
GAMING THE SYSTEM
China's massive steel industry, with an army of millions and largely subsidized by the state, is unlikely to be deterred by Trump's attempt to probe into its cheap exports, as Beijing begins its global campaign to boost overall export shipments. 
For years, Chinese steel exporters have been gaming the nation's tax system to pump ever greater amounts of surplus steel into world markets, crafting slightly different alloys to ensure their products sidestep Beijing's cutbacks to trade subsidies. 
In China, a rebate system to reward exporters selling more value-added steel has been exploited for years, allowing even shipments that contain just tiny amounts of alloy elements to be given rebates. 
The rebates which range between 9 and 13 percent are ""in addition to subsidies for state-owned enterprises, which many of China's steel mills are,"" said Cola. 
The rebates are helping many Chinese steel mills deeply undercut rivals overseas although some domestic producers say exports have dropped as demand at home strengthened. 
Still, an early-year surge in Chinese steel prices has lifted prices of its export products and China has lost its competitiveness with rivals like India and Russia, said Kevin Bai from CRU consultancy. 
""But domestic prices have since dropped quite significantly and close to cost and mills have started to carry out maintenance to try to control output and maintain prices,"" said Bai, adding that mills could boost exports if demand at home does not pick up. 

""The government doesn't want to see higher exports, but I think that's debatable.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil held near $53 a barrel on Friday, but was on course for its biggest weekly drop in a month due to doubts that an OPEC-led production cut will restore balance to an oversupplied market.
Brent futures (LCOc1) were at $53.01 a barrel at 1107 GMT, up 2 cents from their last close and set for a 5.15 percent weekly drop, their biggest fall since the week of March 10.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1), which rolled over on Friday, were at $50.66 a barrel, down 5 cents and on course for a 4.8 percent weekly decline, also the most since March 10.
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, key members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, favour extending their production-limiting deal with non-member producers into the second half of the year.
Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak, however, declined to say whether the top oil producer would adhere to an extension before a joint meeting on May 25, saying global stocks were declining.
""The situation has gradually been improving since the beginning of March,"" Novak said.
Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at Nordic bank SEB, does not expect OPEC to roll over its cuts.
""Not only is there no need for it, but it would also create a risk for more stimulus of the U.S. shale oil sector, which might make it difficult for OPEC to re-enter the market again with its full volume at a later stage,"" Schieldrop said. 
Both oil benchmarks fell this week as doubts emerged over the effect of the OPEC/non-OPEC production cut by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of the year.
Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows that a record 48 million bpd of crude is being shipped across ocean waters in April, up 5.8 percent since December.
The market is taking note: The value of the Brent forward curve <0#LCO:> has slumped steadily since the start of the OPEC-led cuts in January. The two-year calendar strip for Brent futures, or the average value of all contracts over that period, is down more than $4 since January at around $54.10 a barrel.
Demand for crude oil is however set to rise in the coming weeks as refineries around the world return from seasonal maintenance ahead of peak summer demand.
Also supporting the market, exports from OPEC member Iran, which was exempt from the cuts, are set to hit a 14-month low in May, suggesting the country is struggling to raise exports after clearing out stocks stored on tankers.
Other producers that are not involved in the supply-curbing pact have increased exports. U.S. output has jumped almost 10 percent since mid-2016 to 9.25 million bpd , close to that of the world's top two producers, Saudi Arabia and Russia.
The chief executive of France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) warned this week that prices could fall further due to rising U.S. production.
""The cut, even if it's extended, is not going to make much difference,"" said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of energy consultancy Trifecta.

He pointed to elevated crude stocks as the main reason for oversupply. .

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices ended mixed on Thursday after a seesaw trading session, as investors weighed rising U.S. production against geopolitical uncertainties and comments from leading Gulf oil producers that an extension to OPEC-led supply cuts was likely.
The benchmark U.S. crude contract, West Texas Intermediate futures, settled down 17 cents for a fourth straight day of losses, to $50.27 a barrel. Brent futures posted modest gains, however, ending up 6 cents to $52.99 a barrel. 
OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Kuwait signaled that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, would likely extend their oil output cut beyond June.
At a press conference in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said that ""there is consensus building but it's not done yet.""
James Williams, president of energy consultant WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas, said the minister's bullish statement did not lift prices much because of growing U.S. shale production.
“You would have thought that that would have reversed yesterday’s fall, but it didn’t,"" he said. ""We’re getting a little bit of price recovery, but it's still not enough to reverse the shale threat.” 
On Wednesday, crude prices tumbled more than 3.5 percent as U.S. government data showed domestic crude stocks fell less than expected in the latest week and gasoline stocks posted a surprising 1.5-million-barrel build. 
U.S. crude oil production rose to 9.25 million barrels per day, official data showed, up almost 10 percent since mid-2016. U.S. inventories of 532 million barrels remained near all-time records reached in March. 
At the close of trading, the monthly expiration for May contracts, futures trading was light, with traders afraid to make big bets.

Consensus is growing among oil producers that their supply restraint agreement should be extended after its initial six-month term, but there is as yet no agreement, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Thursday.
""There is consensus building but it's not done yet,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in the United Arab Emirates. Asked about non-OPEC producer Russia, Falih replied: ""We are talking to all countries. We have not reached an agreement for sure, but the consensus is building.""
Kuwait's oil minister Essam al-Marzouq, at the same event, said he expected to see an extension of the agreement.
""We have a noticeable increase in compliance from non-OPEC, which shows the importance of extending the agreement,"" Marzouq said.
""Russia is on board preliminarily ... Compliance from Russia is very good. Everyone will continue on the same level,"" he said. 
If OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers decide to extend their six-month agreement, the cuts may become less deep as oil demand is expected to be stronger for seasonal reasons in the second half of 2017, Marzouq said.
He said OPEC would extend the deal if there was consensus among non-OPEC producers, and that producers were always looking for more non-OPEC members to join the agreement.
One African country has expressed interest in joining, Marzouq said, without identifying it.
OPEC is keen that non-OPEC play its part in reducing world inventories to support a price rise that has stalled near $55 a barrel. Crude is up from lows last year below $30.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meets on May 25 to discuss extending supply curbs with non-OPEC countries that total 1.8 million barrels daily, two-thirds of that from OPEC. 
Falih said there was ""an initial agreement"" that the oil cuts may need extending to drain high global inventories. He said talks were ongoing.
""Our target is the level of inventories. This is the main indicator for the success of the initiative,"" Falih said.
While inventories held at sea and in producer countries have dropped, they remain stubbornly high in consumer regions, particularly in Asia and the United States.
The International Energy Agency said last week that inventories in industrialised countries were still 10 percent above the five-year average, a key gauge for OPEC. 
Omani Oil and Gas Minister Mohammad bin Hamad al-Rumhy said a ""quite high"" number of producers favoured extending the supply restraint agreement.
""The number of countries that are supporting the extension I think would be quite high, percentage-wise,"" Rumhy told reporters.
However, Iraq may seek to be exempt and ask to boost its own output, the leader of the nation's Shi'ite ruling coalition Ammar al-Hakim told Reuters.
Speaking in Cairo, Hakim cautioned that Baghdad could ask to be exempted from taking part in the supply curbs as the nation needed its oil income to fight Islamic State.
""Given these sensitive circumstances, it is the right of Iraq to hope for an exemption by the other OPEC member states and have an opportunity to increase its production,"" Hakim, an influential cleric, said in an interview late on Wednesday. 
""But we are with the principle of reducing the overall OPEC supply to lift prices.""

A joint committee of ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will meet in late April to present its recommendation on the fate of the pact. A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
Brent oil for June delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London tacked on 38 cents, or around 0.7%, to $53.31 a barrel by 3:20AM ET (07:20GMT), after falling $1.96 in the prior session.
Elsewhere, the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude June contract rose 34 cents to $51.18 a barrel.
The U.S. benchmark lost $2.00 on Wednesday after hitting its lowest since March 31 at $50.51, after weekly supply data showed U.S. gasoline supplies increased for the first time since February, while crude output keeps rising.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories fell by 1.0 million barrels in the week ended April 14, a smaller draw than expected.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 1.5 million barrels, disappointing expectations for a drop 1.9 million barrels, despite heavier refining activity.
Oil has been stuck in a familiar trading range since the start of the year amid concern that an ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production and swelling stockpiles in the U.S. could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for May inched up 0.7 cents, or about 0.5%, to $1.669 a gallon, while May heating oil added 0.8 cents to $1.589 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for May delivery tacked on 0.6 cents to $3.191 per million British thermal units, as traders looked ahead to weekly storage data due later in the global day.

135,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2017 04:01PM ET</span>",Oil slides 3.8 percent to two-week low on U.S. gasoline build,"By Julia Simon
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil fell to a two-week low on Wednesday, after a surprising build in U.S. gasoline inventories and a rise in domestic crude output that is partially offsetting cutbacks by other countries trying to reduce a global glut. 
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) settled down $1.97 to $50.44 a barrel, a 3.8 percent drop, the biggest one-day decline since March 8. Brent crude settled down 3.6 percent, or $1.96 a barrel, to $52.93.
U.S. crude stocks fell 1 million barrels in the latest week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said, a smaller draw than expected. Gasoline stocks posted a counter-seasonal build of 1.5 million barrels, despite heavier refining activity.
The surprise gasoline build, along with an increase in U.S. production and imports from OPEC nations, pressured prices. Weekly imports from OPEC nations rose by 900,000 barrels, the EIA said. [EIA/D]
“Inventories remain stubbornly high,"" said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. He added that as the United States is approaching the summer driving season, ""the build in gasoline points to the fact demand isn’t as strong as we expected.”
The global crude glut has persisted even as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing countries have worked to reduce output almost 1.8 million barrels per day in the first half of 2017.
“Rising U.S. production levels are offsetting more than a third of the six-month agreement of the 1.8 million barrel-per-day cut,” McGillian said. ""It's the warning bell to the strength of the market.”
""They drop production, we add production, and so at end of the day it's ugly,"" said Robert Yawger, energy futures strategist at Mizuho Americas.
U.S. production rose to 9.252 million barrels a day in the latest week, highest since August 2015. Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said some in the market were concerned about the rapid recovery in shale production.
""Perhaps the amount coming out of the ground might be more than we anticipate,” he said.
Expectations for tighter supply boosted front-month futures contracts earlier this year against later-dated contracts. That trend has reversed. 
On Wednesday, front-month Brent was 53 cents cheaper than the next month  Wednesday; it was 29 cents at the beginning of the month. This condition, known as contango, suggests traders are less confident the glut is being reduced.

""Why is the whole curve in free-fall when supplies are supposedly tightening? It gets reported endlessly that the situation is rebalancing and the Brent curve continues to go deeper into contango,"" he said.

136,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2017 03:04PM ET</span>",Last stand: Nebraska farmers could derail Keystone XL pipeline,"By Valerie Volcovici
Neligh, NEBRASKA (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump handed TransCanada Pipeline Co. a permit for its Keystone XL pipeline last month, he said the company could now build the long-delayed and divisive project ""with efficiency and with speed.""
But Trump and the firm will have to get through Nebraska farmer Art Tanderup first, along with about 90 other landowners in the path of the pipeline. 
They are mostly farmers and ranchers, making a last stand against the pipeline - the fate of which now rests with an obscure state regulatory board, the Nebraska Public Service Commission.
The group is fine-tuning an economic argument it hopes will resonate better in this politically conservative state than the environmental concerns that dominated the successful push to block Keystone under former President Barack Obama. 
Backed by conservation groups, the Nebraska opponents plan to cast the project as a threat to prime farming and grazing lands - vital to Nebraska's economy - and a foreign company's attempt to seize American private property.
They contend the pipeline will provide mainly temporary jobs that will vanish once construction ends, and limited tax revenues that will decline over time.
They face a considerable challenge. Supporters of the pipeline as economic development include Republican Governor, Pete Ricketts, most of the state’s senators, its labor unions and chamber of commerce.
""It’s depressing to start again after Obama rejected the pipeline two years ago, but we need keep our coalition energized and strong,"" said Tanderup, who grows rye, corn and soybeans on his 160-acre property.
Now Tanderup and others are gearing up for another round of battle - on a decidedly more local stage, but with potentially international impact on energy firms and consumers. 
The latest Keystone XL showdown underscores the increasingly well-organized and diverse resistance to pipelines nationwide, which now stretches well beyond the environmental movement. 
Last year, North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux, a Native American tribe, galvanized national opposition to the Energy Transfer Partners Dakota Access Pipeline. Another ETP pipeline in Louisiana has drawn protests from flood protection advocates and commercial fishermen.
The Keystone XL pipeline would cut through Tanderup's family farm, near the two-story farmhouse built in the 1920s by his wife Helen's grandfather. 
The Tanderups have plastered the walls with aerial photos of three ""#NoKXL"" crop art installations they staged from 2014 to 2016. Faded signs around the farm still advertise the concert Willie Nelson and Neil Young played here in 2014 to raise money for the protests. 
The stakes for the energy industry are high as the Keystone XL combatants focus on Nebraska, especially for Canadian producers that have struggled for decades to move more of that nation's landlocked oil reserves to market. Keystone offers a path to get heavy crude from the Canada oil sands to refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast equipped to handle it.
TransCanada has route approval in all of the U.S. states the line will cross except Nebraska, where the company says it has been unable to negotiate easements with landowners on about 9 percent of the 300-mile crossing.
So the dispute now falls to Nebraska's five-member utility commission, an elected board with independent authority over TransCanada’s proposed route. 
The commission has scheduled a public hearing in May, along with a week of testimony by pipeline supporters and opponents in August. Members face a deadline set by state law to take a vote by November.
""TENS OF THOUSANDS"" OF JOBS
TransCanada has said on its website that the pipeline would create ""tens of thousands"" of jobs and tens of millions in tax dollars for the three states it would cross - Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska.
TransCanada declined to comment in response to Reuters inquiries seeking a more precise number and description of the jobs, including the proportion of them that are temporary - for construction - versus permanent. 
Trump has been more specific, saying the project would create 28,000 U.S. jobs. But a 2014 State Department study predicted just 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs. 
Asked about the discrepancy, White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not explain where Trump came up with his 28,000 figure, but pointed out that the State Department study also estimates that the pipeline would indirectly create thousands of additional jobs. 
The study indicates those jobs would be temporary, including some 16,100 at firms with contracts for goods and services during construction, and another 26,000, depending on how workers from the original jobs spend their wages. 
TransCanada estimates that state taxes on the pipeline and pumping stations would total $55.6 million across the three states during the first year. 
The firm will pay property taxes on the pumping stations along the route, but not the land. It would pay a different - and lower - ""personal property"" tax on the pipeline itself, said Brian Jorde, a partner in the Omaha-based law firm Domina Law Group, which represents the opposition. 
The personal property taxes, he said, would decline over a seven-year period and eventually disappear.      
TRUMP: 'I'll CALL NEBRASKA'
The Nebraska utilities commission faces tremendous political pressure from well beyond the state it regulates.
""The commissioners know it is game time, and everybody is looking,"" said Jane Kleeb, Nebraska's Democratic party chair and head of the conservation group Bold Alliance, which is coordinating resistance from the landowners, Native American tribes and environmental groups.
The alliance plans to target the commissioners and their electoral districts with town halls, letter-writing campaigns, and billboards.
During the televised ceremony where Trump awarded the federal permit for the pipeline, he promised to weigh in on the Nebraska debate. 
""Nebraska? I'll call Nebraska,"" he said after TransCanada Chief Executive Russell Girling said the company faced opposition there.
Love, the White House spokeswoman, said she did not know if Trump had called Nebraska officials.
The commission members - one Democrat and four Republicans - have ties to a wide range of conflicting interests in the debate, making it difficult to predict their decision.
According to state filings, one of the commissioners, Democrat Crystal Rhoades, is a member of the Sierra Club - an environmental group opposing the pipeline. 
Another, Republican Rod Johnson, has a long history of campaign donations from oil and gas firms.
The others are Republicans with ties to the farming and ranching sectors - including one member that raises cattle in an area near where the pipeline would cross.
All five members declined requests for comment. 
    
PREPPING THE WITNESSES
TransCanada has been trying since 2008 to build the 1,100-mile line - from Hardisty, Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would connect to a network feeding the Midwest and Gulf Coast refining regions. The firm had its federal permit application rejected in 2015 by the Obama administration.
Opponents want the pipeline, if not rejected outright, to be re-routed well away from Nebraska's Sandhills region, named for its sandy soil, which overlies one of the largest freshwater aquifers in the United States. 
The Ogallala aquifer supplies large-scale crop irrigation and cattle-watering operations.
“It all comes down to water,” said Terry Steskal, whose family farm lies in the pipeline's path. 
Steskal dug his boot into the ground on his property, kicking up sand to demonstrate his biggest concern about the pipeline. If the pipeline leaks, oil can easily seep through the region's porous soil into the water, which lies near the surface.
TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said the company has a good environmental record with its existing Keystone pipeline network in Nebraska, which runs east of the proposed Keystone XL. 
The company, however, has reported at least two big pipeline spills in other states since 2011, including some 400 barrels of oil spilled in South Dakota last year.
The Domina Law Group is helping the opposition by preparing the landowners, including the Tanderups and Steskals, for the August hearings, much as they would prepare witnesses for trial. 
If the route is approved, Jorde said the firm plans to file legal challenges, potentially challenging TransCanada's right to use eminent domain law to seize property. 
Eminent domain allows for the government to expropriate private land in the public interest. But Jorde said he thinks TransCanada would struggle to meet that threshold in Nebraska.

""Some temporary jobs and some taxes is not enough to win the public interest argument,"" he said.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2017 03:01PM ET</span>",Trump's EPA to reconsider oil and gas emissions rule,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will reconsider a rule on greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas operations and delay its compliance date, the agency said on Wednesday in the Trump administration's latest move to reduce regulations.
Oil interest groups, including the American Petroleum Institute and the Texas Oil and Gas Association, had petitioned the EPA a year ago to reconsider the rule limiting emissions of methane and other pollutants from new and revamped oil and gas wells and systems. 
The EPA said in a statement that it would delay the rule's June 3 compliance date by 90 days and take public comments during that period.
Under Democratic President Barack Obama, the EPA released the first methane limits on the facilities in May 2016, saying it would cost energy companies $530 million, but would lead to $690 million in benefits, including lowering medical bills. 
Scott Pruitt, the EPA chief in the administration of Republican President Donald Trump, joined dozens of other states in challenging the rule when he was attorney general of oil-producing Oklahoma. Pruitt has said he does not believe that greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of climate change. 
Energy companies had complained that the methane rule would add costs to wells that were not producing much oil and gas, and that it was duplicative as the sector had already reduced the emissions.
Environmentalists believe limiting methane, a gas about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat, is a low-hanging fruit in efforts to curb climate change. 
Michelle Robinson, director of the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said EPA was favoring industry over science. ""Instead of looking backwards to review well-reasoned rules based on clear science, the administration should be moving forward,"" and extend methane limits, she said. 
Wednesday's move signaled another retreat from climate change action after the Trump administration in March halted an effort to gather methane data from existing oil and gas operations to rein in leaks of the powerful greenhouse gas.
In late March, Trump signed an order to undo climate regulations, following up on a campaign promise. 

Pruitt said the EPA is continuing to follow through with Trump's order. ""American businesses should have the opportunity to review new requirements, assess economic impacts and report back, before those new requirements are finalized,” he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC plans to meet with non-OPEC oil producers on the same day as its scheduled May 25 conference, sources familiar with the arrangements said, as they decide whether to extend supply cuts into the second half of the year.
Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will convene at their Vienna headquarters. Joint talks with non-OPEC oil ministers will also take place that day, two sources said.
A number of key OPEC members including top exporter Saudi Arabia support extending their supply cut into the second half of 2017 if all participating producers, including Russia and other non-OPEC countries, agree, OPEC sources have told Reuters.
""It all depends on Russia's position,"" an OPEC delegate said on Wednesday.
Moscow has not stated whether it supports prolonging the curbs, although Energy Minister Alexander Novak said this month that Russia would soon start consultations with its own oil producers about the possibility of doing so.
The plan for same-day meetings suggests the issue will be settled more quickly than last year, when the deal was agreed. OPEC met on Nov. 30 to decide its own output cuts, and a gathering with non-OPEC took place more than a week later.
The schedule for May 25 is not final and could be changed nearer the time, the sources said.
Under the deal, OPEC is curbing its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day from Jan. 1 for six months in an attempt to eradicate a supply glut. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers agreed to cut half as much.

The accord has lifted oil prices, which are near $55 a barrel. However, still-large inventories and higher output from some producers such as the United States - which is not participating in the supply accord - have limited the rally.

It lost 1.8 cents on Tuesday after hitting its lowest since March 29 at $3.114.
Weather patterns are expected to be rather bearish through Thursday due to mostly mild temperatures dominating much of the country beside the far northern U.S., according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
However, a colder weather system will track over the southern and eastern U.S. from Friday through next Wednesday to bring an increase in demand to stronger levels.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting forecasts on early-spring demand.

151,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2017 12:40AM ET</span>",East Coast refiner shuns Bakken delivery as Dakota Access Pipeline starts,"By Jarrett Renshaw
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Philadelphia Energy Solutions Inc, the largest refiner on the U.S. East Coast, will not be taking any rail deliveries of North Dakota's Bakken crude oil in June, a source familiar with delivery schedules said on Tuesday - a sign that the impending start of the Dakota Access Pipeline is upending trade flows.
At its peak, PES would have routinely taken about 3 miles' worth of trains filled with Bakken oil each day. But after the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline begins interstate crude oil delivery on May 14, it will be more lucrative for producers to transport oil to refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
The long-delayed pipeline will provide a boost for Bakken prices and unofficially end the crude-by-rail boom that revived U.S. East Coast refining operations several years ago.
""It's the new reality,"" said Taylor Robinson, president of PLG Consulting. ""Unless there's an unforeseen event, like a supply disruption, there will be no economic incentive to rail Bakken to the East Coast.""
PES declined to comment for this story.
The 1,172-mile (1,885-km) Dakota Access line runs from western North Dakota to a transfer point in Patoka, Illinois. From there, the 450,000 barrel per day line will connect to large refineries in the Nederland and Port Arthur, Texas, area. 
The project became a focus of international attention, drawing protesters from around the world, after a Native American tribe sued to block completion of the final link of the pipeline through a remote part of North Dakota.
The Standing Rock Sioux tribe said the pipeline would desecrate a sacred burial ground and that any oil leak would poison the tribe's water supply. 
But after U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January, one of his first acts was to sign an executive order that reversed a decision by the Obama administration to delay approval of the pipeline. The tribe also lost several lawsuits aimed at stopping the project led by Energy Transfer Partners LP.
PES has scheduled just five rail deliveries of crude for May and none for June at its facility in Philadelphia, according to the source familiar with the plant's operations, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak about company operations. Deliveries are often scheduled months in advance to manage logistics like storage and manpower.
In recent months, PES was getting roughly one unit train per day, the equivalent of 75,000 barrels a day. During the boom years between 2013 and 2015, PES would routinely receive three trains a day of Bakken.
PES and other refiners built large rail terminals on the East Coast in recent years to accommodate cheap Bakken flowing from North Dakota. The PES refinery terminal, which opened in 2013, was able to handle roughly 280,000 barrels a day, making it the largest on the U.S. East Coast.
Rail volumes of Bakken crude peaked at 420,000 bpd, resulting in bumper profits for those refiners. But Bakken crude's discount to U.S. crude slowly eroded as pipeline capacity out of North Dakota expanded, increasing competition for the heavy oil. 
That forced the East Coast to rely more heavily on foreign, waterborne crude. Currently, Bakken barrels at the delivery point in Nederland, Texas, in June are trading around $1.25 to $1.50 a barrel over U.S. crude futures. Higher rail costs would boost those barrels to $7 to $8 more than U.S. crude. 
The East Coast has averaged roughly 100,000 bpd of crude rail deliveries in recent weeks, according to energy industry intelligence service Genscape.
Monroe Energy, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), stopped receiving Bakken by rail for its 185,000 bpd refinery outside Philadelphia in January of last year. East Coast refineries operated by Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) and PBF Energy are still receiving modest volumes of Bakken crude.

""At this point, there are no good reasons to rail crude to the East Coast,"" said Sarah Emerson, a managing principal at ESAI Energy LLC, a consultancy.

OPEC agreed in November last year to curb its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day between January and June. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 barrels per day.

163,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2017 01:30AM ET</span>",Banned at sea: Venezuela's crude-stained oil tankers,"By Marianna Parraga and Mircely Guanipa
HOUSTON/PUNTO FIJO, Venezuela (Reuters) - In the scorching heat of the Caribbean Sea, workers in scuba suits scrub crude oil by hand from the hull of the Caspian Galaxy, a tanker so filthy it can't set sail in international waters.
The vessel is among many that are constantly contaminated at two major export terminals where they load crude from Venezuela's state-run oil company, PDVSA. The water here has an oily sheen from leaks in the rusty pipelines under the surface. 
That means the tankers have to be cleaned before traveling to many foreign ports, which won't admit crude-stained ships for fear of environmental damage to their harbors, port facilities or other vessels. 
The laborious hand-cleaning operation is one of many causes of chronic delays for dozens of tankers that deliver Venezuela's principle export to customers worldwide, according to three executives of the state-run firm, eight employees of maritime firms that contract with PDVSA and Thomson Reuters vessel-tracking data. Other reasons include delayed repairs and impoundments by service providers that are owed money by cash-strapped PDVSA.
Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela's Oil Ministry responded to requests for comment about the firm's maritime operations.
The tankers sidelined for cleaning provide a vivid example of the firm's downward spiral: Lacking the cash to properly maintain ships, refineries and production operations - or to pay business partners on time - PDVSA can't boost exports, which is its only option for raising more cash.
The lagging exports crimp the flow of cash back to the country's crippled socialist economy, as citizens struggle daily amid soaring inflation and shortages of food and medicine. Because Venezuela relies on oil for more than 90 percent of export revenues, the problems of its state-run oil company pose a national crisis.
Venezuela's crude exports declined 8 percent to 1.69 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter versus the same period in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.
When oil prices were high, crude and fuel exports almost entirely financed an elaborate system of government price controls and social subsidies that maintained the popularity of late President Hugo Chavez, the socialist firebrand.
Although embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro insists the government has maintained social programs, he has publicly acknowledged that lower oil prices have left the government with less money to finance them. 
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment about the nation's social spending.
THOUSANDS OF BRUSH STROKES
At oil export terminals around the world - where crude leaks like those in Venezuela are relatively rare - an oil-stained tanker would normally be taken out of the water and cleaned with industrial equipment in a dry dock. 
But Venezuela has just one small dry dock and lacks the cash or the time to send its soiled tankers there for proper cleaning, according to the PDVSA executives, ship captains and two workers from tanker cleaning companies. 
So workers on a small fishing boat clean the giant tanker with thousands of scrub-brush strokes. The work - which involves scouring ships above and below the water line - can take up to ten days per vessel, a worker involved in the cleaning said.
In a scene witnessed by Reuters in April, workers wearing scuba suits baked on the deck of a small boat as they reached out with brushes to scrub the Caspian Galaxy, a tanker leased for one trip by a PDVSA customer.
The workers labored just offshore from Amuay beach, near a tourist hub and PDVSA's largest refinery. The crews here have washed so many vessels in recent months that they have dubbed their operation ""the boatwash"". 
In nearby Maracaibo Lake - where tankers are stained at the export terminals - a scuba diver died in an accident this week while inspecting a leaking pipeline. 
Jose Bermudez, a 40-year-old father of two, drowned after the line connected to his air supply got tangled in the propeller on his boat, according to union representatives.
The Professional Union of Scuba Divers and Marine Staff from Zulia state had previously requested that PDVSA replace the propellers with a different propulsion system, the organization said.
A supervisor at PDVSA's Western division on Monday confirmed the accident but declined to answer further questions.
PDVSA's maritime crisis is uniquely dire, said George Los, a senior tanker market analyst at U.S. ship brokerage Charles R. Weber Company.
""I can't think of any situation similar to this anywhere else in the world right now,"" he said. 
LEASES AT $1 MILLION PER MONTH
Eighteen of the 31 oil tankers PDVSA owns were out of commission at the end of March, according to Thomson Reuters vessel-tracking data and six maritime industry employees, who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Several needed cleaning, while others need repairs, according to the data.
To keep oil flowing, PDVSA leases more than 50 tankers - each at a cost of between $800,000 to $1 million per month, according to three captains and ship brokers involved in lease contracts with PDVSA and Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data.
That is more than double the number of vessels it typically leases to complement its own fleet of tankers, according to the sources. 
It's a short-term fix that is driving up costs and exposing PDVSA to further detentions or seizures of vessels when it does not pay leasing fees on time.
Several ship owners, exasperated by payment delays, have sought court orders to have the oil on board the tankers impounded, according to three sources involved in some of the disputes and a court document seen by Reuters.
Russian shipping conglomerate Sovcomflot in October won a court order to seize a $20 million Venezuelan crude cargo from a Sovcomflot tanker as partial payment on a $30 million debt.
The tanker was carrying crude to the Caribbean island of St. Eustatius. [L2N1HD1MI]
Sovcomflot did not respond to requests for comment.
Six other PDVSA vessels are stuck in yards in Portugal, Turkey and Curacao, either for lack of payment or because PDVSA has not supplied the necessary parts for repairs, according to two shippers and an executive of a firm supplying equipment to PDV Marina, PDVSA's maritime branch. 
THE 'VENEZUELA CLAUSE'
Most port owners have to pay fees if they delay tankers from loading or unloading at their docks. But PDVSA, which operates terminals in Venezuela, has traditionally refused to include such penalties - known as demurrage fees - in its contracts with shipping companies that move Venezuelan oil. 
At least five major shipping companies, however, are now pushing back on that practice, according to oil traders and contracts signed by PDVSA. The shippers now include a so-called ""Venezuela clause"" in their contracts.
The penalties can be as much as $23,500 per day, according to recent shipping contracts with PDVSA seen by Reuters.
One contract specifies that PDVSA must pay demurrage for delays resulting from workers strikes, the late arrival of tug boats and even for drug inspections - a nod to international investigations into Venezuela's role in the global drug trade. 
Some tanker-leasing companies and service providers also charge PDVSA above-market rates because of the risk of delayed payments, two shipbrokers told Reuters.
Similar operational problems plague PDVSA's oil drilling and refining operations. Once the pride of the country's economy, the state-run firm saw crude production plummet last year to a 23-year low.
The crisis has now reached the point where state-run PDVSA can't buy spare parts to keep oil fields pumping, pay workers enough to feed their families, or keep its tankers on the water, the PDVSA executives and maritime company employees told Reuters.

The rising costs and falling exports, in turn, are depriving the firm - and the country - of the commodity it needs most: dollars.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil prices slipped 1 percent on Monday in subdued trading after a long Easter holiday weekend, on news of rising U.S. shale production and profit-taking following three straight weeks of gains.
On Monday, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) said U.S. shale production in May was set for its biggest monthly increase in more than two years, adding to worries that these increases would undermine efforts of the world's top producers to rein in a glut.
Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Americas said market conditions encouraged profit taking. Speculators in the week to April 11 also increased bets on strong performance in both contracts. 
""The market was overbought so these people are definitely booking profits at this point,"" Yawger said.
Benchmark Brent crude futures ended the session 53 cents lower at $55.36 while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled down 53 cents at $52.65 a barrel.
Volumes were thin, with about 152,000 Brent futures contracts and about 296,000 WTI contracts changing hands, less than half of Thursday's trading volumes. 
With financial markets closed across Europe, the focus was on geopolitical tensions.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet on May 25 to consider extending output cuts beyond June to reduce a glut that has depressed prices. Iran fed hopes that OPEC and non-OPEC producers would extend the cuts, but Saudi Arabia's energy minister said it was too early to discuss an extension.
""While the Saudis and the Russians have been complying with their cuts we've seen Iraq and a number of other countries produce more than their share of the quota,"" Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said.
""So that gives the market pause at how effective they're going to be at taking oil out of the market.""
Another source of instability is in North Korea. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Monday warned North Korea that U.S. strikes in Afghanistan and Syria, one of North Korea's few close allies, showed that the country should not test the resolve of President Donald Trump.
Fighting in Libya has cut oil output, but state oil company National Oil Corporation has reopened at least one field. 
Many analysts remained positive on oil prices.
""We remain constructive on oil prices for the balance of 2017 as second quarter 2017 should see markets tighten as a result of the current OPEC/non-OPEC deal whilst an expected extension of the deal on May 25th should keep oil inventories drawing in the second half of the year,"" Citi analysts said in a note.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. crude futures for May delivery fell 0.26% to $53.04 by 8:37AM ET (12:37GMT), while Brent oil for June delivery on London's Intercontinental Exchange lost 0.16% to $55.80.
Late Thursday (prior to the Easter holiday period), oilfield services firm Barker Hughes reported its weekly U.S. rig count rose by 11 to 683. That was the thirteenth straight weekly increase to its highest level in nearly two years.
Investors have been concerned that increasing U.S. output would derail major oil producers’ attempts to cut production.
Saudi Arabian energy minister Khalid al-Falih once again insisted on Monday that there was a consensus within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties (OPEC) to stabilize the oil market and that producers would do whatever was necessary to achieve that goal.
In November of last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day during the first half of 2017.
Most oil producers support an extension of output cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC countries, and Iran would also back such a move, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying last week.
However, al-Falih also said Monday that it was too early to discuss whether extending the deal to cut production beyond June was necessary.
OPEC energy ministers have suggested that a decision will be reached at their official meeting in Vienna on May 25."

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for June delivery gained 0.16% to $1.290.50 a troy ounce.
Gold also benefitted Monday from a weaker dollar as the greenback felt pressure from Friday's release of weak U.S. retail sales and inflation data.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell 0.30% at 100.19 by 4:02AM ET (8:02GMT).
A weak dollar usually supports gold prices, as it bolsters the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more attractive to holders of other currencies.
Geopolitical tension surrounding North Korea also remained on markets’ radar, supporting demand for safe haven assets, a day after the country’s attempted launch on Sunday of a ballistic missile failed.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Investors who took a hit last year when dozens of U.S. shale producers filed for bankruptcy are already making big new bets on the industry's resurgence.
In the first quarter, private equity funds raised $19.8 billion for energy ventures - nearly three times the total in the same period last year, according to financial data provider Preqin. 
The quickening pace of investments from private equity, along with hedge funds and investment banks, comes even as the recovery in oil prices (CLc1) from an 8-year low has stalled at just over $50 per barrel amid a stubborn global supply glut.
The shale sector has become increasingly attractive to investors not because of rising oil prices, but rather because producers have achieved startling cost reductions - slashing up to half the cost of pumping a barrel in the past two years. Investors also believe the glut will dissipate as demand for oil steadily rises. 
That gives financiers confidence that they can squeeze increasing returns from shale fields - without price gains - as technology continues to cut costs. So they are backing shale-oil veterans and assembling companies that can quickly start pumping.
""Shale funders look at the economics today and see a lot of projects that work in the $40 to $55 range"" per barrel of oil, said Howard Newman, head of private equity fund Pine Brook Road Partners, which last month committed to invest $300 million in startup Admiral Permian Resources LLC to drill in West Texas.
Data on investments by hedge funds and other nonpublic investment firms is scant, but the rush of new private equity money indicates broader enthusiasm in shale plays.
""Demand for oil has been more robust than anyone imagined three years ago,"" said Mark Papa, chief executive of Centennial Resource Development Inc (O:CDEV). 
Papa referred to the beginning of an international oil price crash in 2014, which took many firms in the shale sector to the brink of bankruptcy.
Centennial is a Permian oil producer backed by private equity fund Riverstone. Papa, a well-known shale industry entrepreneur, built EOG Resources Inc (N:EOG) into one of the most profitable U.S. shale producers before he retired in 2013.
The chance to further develop the Permian, he said, was enough for him to come out of retirement to deliver one of its bigger recent successes. The value of Riverstone's original $500 million investment has grown nearly four times since Centennial's initial public offering last fall.
'A TON OF PRIVATE CAPITAL' 
Riverstone this year copied the Centennial model, putting experienced managers atop a startup charged with acquiring operations or assets. The equity fund hired Jim Hackett - the former head of shale producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp (N:APC) - to run the newly created  Silver Run Acquisition Corp  II (O:SRUNU).
Hedge funds Highfields Capital Management LP and Adage Capital Management have taken stakes in the new company, which has a valuation of about $1 billion after going public last month. 
Private equity fund NGP Natural Resources XI LP invested $524 million last fall in Luxe Energy LLC, a shale producer formed in 2015 by former  Statoil  (OL:STL) executives. 
NGP's investment was effectively a bet that Luxe could repeat its success of early 2016. 
Then, NGP contributed about $250 million to Luxe, which used the money to acquire land in the Permian - and sold it seven months later for a double-digit profit.
This year's drilling rush could be tested if global supplies grow too fast or if demand cools. The U.S. drilling rig count is rising at its fastest pace in six years and U.S. crude stockpile are close to 533 million barrels - near an all-time high and enough to supply the United States for 25 days. 
But some investors say even a decline of $10 in the oil price would not dissuade them.
""There is a ton of private capital to invest in the U.S. oil industry,"" said Gerrit Nicholas, co-founder of private equity fund Orion Energy Partners. 
Nicholas said he is comfortable lending even if oil prices fall to $40 per barrel.
Orion this month helped finance the expansion of a Florida oil-storage terminal, a move predicated in part on growth in U.S. oil exports. Since the U.S. lifted its oil export ban last year, crude exports have climbed to about 746,000 barrels per day, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. 
BETTING ON OPEC'S SELF-INTEREST
The oil industry has seen boom-and-bust cycles since the first well was drilled about 160 years ago, and industry and government have sought to tame the volatility for just as long. 
Texas regulators set output quotas from the 1920s through the 1970s, a practice that served as a model for the creation of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
The U.S. boom has caused concern among OPEC member nations ahead of its meeting next month in Vienna, where they will consider extending oil production cuts that first took effect in January. Investors believe the cartel's members will extend the cuts because it is in OPEC's financial interest to prevent a steep drop in oil prices. 
That likely will keep money flowing to nimble U.S. oil producers and the companies that provide them with services and equipment. Investors see the United States as the new swing producer, having the ability to quickly increase supply in response to any sudden increase in demand.
""The U.S., with its substantial inventory capacity and swing oil producer status, should see strong onshore activity for the next few years,"" said Charlie Leykum, founder of private equity fund CSL Capital Management LLC, in an interview.
CSL has invested in several oilfield service business in the past year. It partnered with Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and  Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI), for instance, to create a shale services company.
Centennial's Papa expects the flood of fresh capital to push U.S. production up 23 percent to 11.3 million barrels a day (bpd) by 2020, based on strong demand for oil.
""We're still in a hydrocarbon-based economy,"" said Papa.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A bomb blast hit a bus convoy waiting to cross into government-held Aleppo in Syria on Saturday, killing and wounding dozens of people evacuated from two Shi'ite villages the day before in a deal between warring sides.
The agreement had stalled, leaving thousands of people from both government-besieged and rebel-besieged areas stranded at two transit points on the city's outskirts, before the explosion occurred.
Late on Saturday buses from the convoy hit by the bombing began crossing into government-held territory as the deal resumed, pro-Damascus media outlets reported.
But the incident underscored the difficulty carrying out any agreement between warring sides in a volatile and complex Syrian conflict which, in its seventh year, shows no signs of easing.
A media unit run by Damascus ally Hezbollah said the attack was carried out by a suicide car bomb and killed at least 40 people. The Observatory said more than 24 were killed.
Footage on state TV showed bodies lying next to charred buses with their windows blown out, and vehicles in flames. 
The blast hit buses in the Rashidin area on Aleppo's outskirts. The vehicles had been waiting since Friday to cross from rebel-held territory into the government-controlled city itself. Ambulances later took the wounded to hospital in Aleppo.
The convoy was carrying residents and pro-government fighters from the rebel-besieged Shi'ite villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in nearby Idlib province. 
They had left under a deal where, in exchange, hundreds of Sunni insurgents and their families were granted safe passage from Madaya, a government-besieged town near Damascus.
But a delay in the agreement had left all those evacuated stuck at transit points on Aleppo's outskirts since late on Friday.
Residents of al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting in the Rashidin area.
Rebels and residents of Madaya, near Damascus, were meanwhile waiting at the government-held Ramousah bus garage, a few miles away. They were to be transported to the opposition stronghold of Idlib province.
People waiting in the Ramousah garage heard the blast, and said they feared revenge attacks by pro-government forces. They circulated a statement on social media imploring ""international organizations"" to intervene so the situation did not escalate.
The evacuation deal is one of several over recent months that has seen President Bashar al-Assad's government take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies.
The deals are unpopular with the Syrian opposition, who say they amount to forced displacement of Assad's opponents from Syria's main urban centers in the west of the country.
They are also causing demographic changes because those who are displaced are usually Sunni Muslims, like most of the opposition. Assad is from the minority Alawite sect and is supported by Shi'ite regional allies.
It was unclear who carried out Saturday's bombing attack.
The exact reasons for the delay in completing the evacuation deal were also unclear.
'FORCED DISPLACEMENT'
The Observatory said the delay was caused by the fact that rebels from Zabadani, another town near Damascus included in the deal, had not yet been granted safe passage out.
A pro-opposition activist said insurgents blamed the delay partly on the fact that a smaller number of pro-government fighters had left the Shi'ite villages than was agreed.
Earlier on Saturday, at the transit point where the buses from al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting, one resident said he was not yet sure where he would live.
""After Aleppo I'll see what the rest of the group is doing, if there are any preparations. My house, land and belongings are all in al-Foua,"" Mehdi Tahhan said.
A Madaya resident, speaking from the bus garage inside Aleppo, said people had been waiting there since late on Friday, and were not being allowed to leave.
""There's no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so there's not much space to move around,"" Ahmed, 24, said.
""We're sad and angry about what has happened,"" he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave,"" he said.
""There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya.""
Other evacuation deals in recent months have included areas of Aleppo and a district in the city of Homs.
Syria's population is mostly Sunni. Assad's Alawite religious minority is often considered an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam.
He has been backed militarily by Russia, and by Shi'ite fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syria's six-year-old conflict.

Assad has the military advantage over rebels in the west thanks to Russia's intervention in 2015, although the insurgents are still fighting back and have made gains in some areas.

Facing an election in May where he hopes to secure a second four-year term, Rouhani has had to defend himself from opponents who say he has been too eager to appease the West, after agreeing to curb Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.
U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized the nuclear deal and said during his election campaign he would stop Iran's missile program. After Iran test-fired a new ballistic missile in January, Trump tweeted that it was ""playing with fire"".
Addressing an event showcasing some locally built military hardware, broadcast on state TV, Rouhani said: ""The strengthening of the capability of the Iranian armed forces ... is only for defending the country and we will ask no one's permission to build up the armed forces, and to build missiles and aircraft."" 
He said Iran has never had ""aggressive aims, but peace is not a one-way road and if we decide to be peaceful the other party ... may not. So there is a need for vigilance."" 
A bill to impose new sanctions on Iran over ballistic missile launches and other non-nuclear activities has been delayed in the U.S. Senate due to concerns about the presidential election.

Iran says its missile tests are not covered by the nuclear deal.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The oil market is rebalancing in the short term, and demand will continue to grow in the long term, Saudi Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser said at the Columbia University Energy Summit on Friday.
In the short term, the oil market has a surplus, but Nasser said that supplies are falling behind what will be required in coming years.
""The future market situation will be increasingly on firmer grounds, though volatility could continue until the rebalancing takes firmer hold and inventory withdrawals assume a more consistent trend,"" he said. 
In both 2018 and 2019, Aramco expects demand to continue to grow, and Nasser said he expects the growth will continue into the years ahead.
""I believe that peak demand is not in sight,"" he said, when asked whether the market was approaching peak demand.
Nasser expects demand for hydrocarbons to increase with many more traditional fuel vehicles than electric cars to be added in coming years even as more efficient engines emerge and renewables are used for some light transportation. 
Oil prices have begun to emerge from a two-year rout as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has cut production this year, following an agreement in November aimed at reducing an overhang of stockpiles. Still, concerns about U.S. production overhang the market. [O/R] 
Nasser said the count of rigs operating in U.S. shale formations and bounces in inventory figures have depressed the market. 
Aramco approves investment projects based on a long-term view, spanning decades, and sees demand growth continuing to support expanded refining and marketing in the United States, Asia and other markets. Asia already accounts for 60 to 70 percent of Aramco's exports and is seen as continuing to be a growth market, he said.
The company is also increasing its gas production and expects to double it to about 23 billion standard cubic feet daily over the coming decade.
Aramco is gearing up for a share listing next year, aiming to get a valuation of up to $2 trillion in what could be the world's biggest initial public offering.

Nasser said that offering is ""on track.""

182,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2017 11:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Ukraine could miss out on up to $3.65 billion of China energy loans,"By Karin Strohecker and Pavel Polityuk
LONDON/KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine could miss out on energy sector funding from China worth up to $3.65 billion because squabbles between ministries and the state-run energy firm Naftogaz have held up project proposals, according to interviews with officials.
Ukraine signed the loan agreement with the China Development Bank (CDB) in 2012 and it must submit proposals for projects by June to receive funding. 
But with the deadline looming, Naftogaz and the relevant government departments have yet to sign off on any of the coal or gas projects that were due to be funded by the loan. 
The government says the proposal for at least one of the projects will be ready by the deadline. It is not clear whether CDB will allow Ukraine to access part of the funding if proposals for the full amount are not ready. 
Failure to secure all of it would deprive Ukraine of much-needed funds to upgrade energy infrastructure. It would also send a poor signal about efficiency and transparency to foreign investors whose cash is vital for economic recovery after conflict over Crimea and eastern Ukraine.
The head of Naftogaz coal and gas subsidiary, Uglesintezgaz, does not expect all the proposals to be ready in time. 
""The sum is huge and the loan is under (Ukrainian) state guarantee. A project of this size is political, due to this the issue needs a joint position of the economy, energy and finance ministries,"" Uglesintezgaz chief Andriy Suprun told Reuters.
""There is a certain lack of convergence in the positions of us (Uglesintezgaz) and the energy ministry,"" he said, without elaborating on their differences.
Spokespeople for the economy, energy and finance ministries did not respond to requests for comment about the status of the loan or reason for the delays. A spokeswoman for Naftogaz referred queries on the loan to Suprun. CBD did not respond to requests for a comment.
Ukraine's Deputy Finance Minister Yuriy Butsa also said the proposals would not all be ready by the deadline but he was confident that Ukraine would secure some of the funding.
""We have every intention to use those funds. I know there is some serious work going on at Naftogaz, so I believe in the nearest time we will see some progress,"" he told Reuters.
""The loan was signed under different conditions, in different times, for different purposes. Our intention is to use the opportunity to finance the projects which are needed at this point of time and the needs have changed much."" 
Asked whether at least one project would be submitted before the June deadline, he said: ""I believe it will happen.""
The loan agreement was first mapped out in 2012 under ousted president Viktor Yanukovich. Many of the projects he had earmarked for the money were in the east of Ukraine, his heartland and a coal-mining area. 
But with the east unstable and Ukraine run by President Petro Poroshenko the plans under consideration have changed. 
Suprun said they include building two new coal-fired power stations in Kiev and the western city of Lviv and an upgrade in drilling capacity at a Naftogaz subsidiary. They would replace Soviet-era power production facilities, which run on mainly expensively imported gas, with units that run on coal.
INVESTIGATION
In March, the General Prosecutor's office asked the government to explain the reasons for the delays, accusing officials at Naftogaz and Uglesintezgaz of ""official negligence"", according to a document seen by Reuters.
Suprun said his office and home had been searched by the prosecutor's investigators. He denied any wrongdoing.
A spokesman for the prosecutor's office declined to comment on questions from Reuters about the case. A spokeswoman for Naftogaz declined immediate comment on the investigation. 
Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman at a meeting on March 17 had also demanded project plans be finalised as soon as possible so he could present them to the Chinese side, Suprun said.
Groysman's office did not respond to a request for comment.
According to letters seen by Reuters, Ukraine's Ambassador to China Oleh Dyomin wrote to Kiev at least twice in 2016 to warn of Chinese concern and doubt that the loan deadline would be met. 
""This is expected to provoke a negative reaction for Chinese partners,"" Dyomin wrote in a letter to Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin last October, without spelling out what would happen if the proposals did not arrive on time. 
""We ask you to convey the concern of the Chinese side about the situation to the Ukrainian agencies involved in order to speed up the decision-making process and settling of the problems.""
The Ukrainian foreign ministry did not respond to requests for a comment. The Chinese embassy did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters. 
The need for foreign investment is acute. According to economy ministry estimates, Ukraine must attract at least $7 billion from abroad per year to spur fledgling economic growth after a separatist conflict in eastern industrial regions plunged the country into two years of recession in 2014. 
But Ukraine has a track record of not meeting its deadlines.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for May delivery gained 7 cents to settle at $53.18 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent added 1 cents to trade at $55.87 a barrel.
The IEA said the global oil market is close to balance, after three years of excess supply, as oil stockpiles across The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries fell by 17.2 million barrels in March.
The drop in production, resulted in a marginal increase of 38.5 million barrels for the first quarter of the year.
""The net result is that global stocks might have marginally increased in the first quarter, versus an implied draw of about 0.2 million barrels per day,"" the IEA said.
The bullish comments from the IEA came a day after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) new monthly report on Wednesday, revealed its members cut oil output in March more than anticipated.

Crude prices have notched three straight weeks of gains to recover from the slump in March, when prices fell to a four-month low of $47.01, on the back of concerns that a ramp up in U.S. oil production would dampen OPEC’s efforts to drain the glut in supply.
In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of this year.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Crude oil futures were largely unchanged on Thursday, with the market torn between rising U.S. production and the output cuts being made by OPEC and other producers. 
Benchmark Brent crude futures were flat at $55.86 a barrel by 0657. The market had climbed to a one-month high of $56.65 on Wednesday before losing ground. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 6 cents at $53.05 a barrel. They touched their highest since March 7 at $53.76 barrel in the previous session.
Traders focused on preliminary U.S. production estimates in the weekly Energy Information Administration (EIA) report that suggested domestic output is still climbing. The report also showed stockpiles at the U.S. crude hub at Cushing, Oklahoma, rose 276,000 barrels in the week ended April 7. 
Still, data showed an unexpected drop in overall U.S. crude inventories, which fell last week by 2.2 million barrels as imports declined by 717,000 barrels a day.
""We saw a bit of a reversal in oil prices (on Wednesday) and it came despite some positive news,"" chief market strategist at Sydney's CMC Markets. ""It does appear that there is bit of focus on the data that came alongside inventory numbers which showed further increase in U.S. production.""
Brent and WTI have rallied in recent sessions after Saudi Arabia was reported to be pushing fellow members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some rivals to prolong supply cuts beyond June.

Also supporting oil markets was customs data showing that China imported a record 9.17 million barrels of crude in March, making it the top importer for the year so far. 

But OPEC also raised its forecast for supplies from non-member countries in 2017 as higher prices encourage U.S. shale drillers to pump more, reducing demand for OPEC's oil this year.

195,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2017 05:10PM ET</span>",Investors eye midstream sector as production ramps up,"By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Investors are placing bets that demand for U.S. energy pipelines, storage and processing facilities will outstrip supply in the next few years as the resurgence in shale oil and gas production increases.
With U.S. oil prices mostly above $50 a barrel for several months and a jump in drilling activity this year, new projects are moving off the drawing boards, and backers are lining up customers. There also has been a spate of deals involving existing transportation and storage networks.
The deals should ensure that production growth coming from shale basins has new outlets to market. The amount of money moving off the sidelines also is spurring valuations that potential investors say could trip up some deals.
Several long-haul pipelines have been proposed in recent months to move natural gas and liquids from West Texas to the Gulf Coast, including one by private-equity-backed NAmerico Partners. Its multibillion-dollar line would ferry 1.85 billion cubic feet of gas per day from the Permian to Corpus Christi. 
The NAmerico project and a similar line announced by  Kinder Morgan  (NYSE:KMI) are ""indicative of the type of supply growth we're going to see,"" said Billy Lemmons, managing partner and founder at private equity fund EnCap Flatrock Midstream. 
For every dollar invested in production, another 15 cents to 35 cents is required for pipelines, processing plants and other midstream infrastructure, he said.
Many investors favor such projects because they are fee-collecting businesses and face less commodity price risk than exploration and production investments. Stable oil prices also have alleviated worries that shippers won't meet their pipeline commitments. 
In the Delaware Basin region of the Permian, private equity firms have accounted for more than 46 percent of growth in new gas processing systems, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC). 
GREATER COMPETITION 
In active drilling areas, operators are trying to get 10 times to 12 times estimated 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on pipeline and other assets. 
""Auctions have become very pricey,"" said Lex Hochner, vice president at Haddington Ventures, a private equity fund backing a massive salt dome oil storage project in Houston.
Targa Resources Corp (N:TRGP) in January agreed to buy Outrigger Energy LLC's Permian Basin gathering and processing assets for $1.5 billion, the same month  Plains All American Pipeline  (N:PAA) paid $1.2 billion to  Concho Resources Inc  (N:CXO) and Frontier Midstream Solutions for a pipeline system.
Private equity firms also bid on those assets but could not compete on the rich valuation, said one source familiar with the deals.
This week, pipeline operator NuStar Energy (S:NS) agreed to pay $1.48 billion for Navigator Energy Services to get a foothold in the Permian. 
Pipeline transactions are percolating elsewhere. 
An arm of Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) plc in December acquired interests in three pipelines from  BP  plc (LON:BP) for undisclosed amounts. BP earlier sold one of its Gulf of Mexico pipelines to American Midstream Partners (N:AMID).
Investors also are acquiring preferred equity in companies. Last August, pension fund Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo) agreed to take up to $500 million in preferred stock units from infrastructure provider Howard Energy Partners.

""The longer commodity price recovery continues, the better the balance sheets of midstream companies look,"" said Kirkland & Ellis partner Adam Larson, who advised on the AIMCo and Howard Energy deal.

Both contracts had jumped to the highest in more than a month after Saudi Arabia was reported to be pushing fellow OPEC members and some rivals to prolong supply cuts beyond June.
Analysts and traders said long-term fundamentals remained strong and more stockpile draw-downs are likely as refiners exit maintenance season.

Fearing a loss of market share, Saudi Arabia is shielding its most important customers in Asia from the cuts, continuing to supply them with all contractual volumes.

204,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2017 09:50AM ET</span>",OPEC sees rivals' oil output rising as it over-delivers on cuts,"By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC cut oil output in March by more than pledged under a supply reduction deal and said oil inventories had fallen in February, suggesting that its effort to clear a supply glut that has weighed on world oil prices is succeeding.
But the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also raised its forecast for supplies from non-member countries in 2017 as higher oil prices encourage U.S. shale drillers to pump more, reducing demand for OPEC's oil this year.
OPEC is curbing its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1 for six months, the first reduction in eight years, to get rid of a supply glut. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers agreed to cut half as much.
Oil prices pared gains on Wednesday after the report was released to trade at around $56 a barrel (LCOc1). Prices are still up from about $42 a barrel a year ago, and OPEC was upbeat on the outlook for the market.
""Despite some downside risks, general expectations for demand growth for oil products in the coming months remain bullish,"" said the report, which made a minor upward revision to its global demand forecast this year.
""The return of refineries from seasonal maintenance and healthy demand, together with the high conformity observed in OPEC and non-OPEC production adjustments, should enhance market stability and reduce the volatility seen in recent weeks.""
In the report, OPEC pointed to an increase in its members' compliance with the deal and said oil stocks in industrialized nations fell in February - although they are still 268 million barrels above the five-year average. 
Supply from the 11 OPEC members with production targets under the accord - all except Libya and Nigeria - fell to 29.761 million bpd last month, according to figures from secondary sources that OPEC uses to monitor output.
That means OPEC has complied 104 percent with the plan, according to a Reuters calculation. OPEC did not publish a compliance number, but OPEC figures seen by Reuters on Tuesday also put adherence at 104 percent.
But OPEC revised up its estimate of oil supply growth from producers outside the group this year to 580,000 bpd, as higher oil prices following the supply cut help spur a revival in U.S. shale drilling.
""With the pick-up in drilling activity, as well as increasing cashflows in the tight oil industry, U.S. tight crude output is expected to rise quickly and increase 335,000 bpd for the overall of 2017,"" OPEC said, using another term for shale.
SAUDI PUMPS BELOW TARGET
OPEC said its production, including Nigeria and Libya, fell about 150,000 bpd in March to 31.93 million bpd, as Saudi Arabia continued to make a larger cut than called for by the deal.
While the OPEC secondary sources said Saudi output rose in March to 9.994 million bpd, Saudi Arabia reported to OPEC that it fell to 9.90 million bpd. In any case, both figures are below Riyadh's OPEC output target.
Due to the higher expectations from outside producers, OPEC trimmed forecast demand for its crude in 2017 to 32.22 million bpd - 130,000 less than last month but more than current production, suggesting stocks will drop if output does not rise.
A further rise in supply outside the group could weigh on prices and hinder OPEC efforts to clear the glut, although OPEC officials have said they believe the market can deal with renewed shale growth. 
""Shale oil production has defied forecasts in the past and its economics are still improving and evolving,"" Ibrahim al-Muhanna, a former Saudi oil official said in a speech.
""However, with all the importance and media attention given to it, shale oil is not a primary source of energy.""

OPEC meets on May 25 and is considering whether to extend the supply cut deal beyond June. Most members, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, are leaning towards this if all producers, including non-OPEC, also agree, OPEC sources told Reuters last month.

213,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2017 06:00PM ET</span>",Chevron executive pay rises in 2016 on value of pensions,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Compensation for three of  Chevron  Corp's (N:CVX) senior leaders, including Chief Executive John Watson, rose last year due to a change in how the value of pensions are calculated. 
The disclosure, required by U.S. regulators, comes as the oil industry grapples with low prices and Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, tries to bounce back after posting an annual loss last year, its first since 1987.
Chevron's shareholders will meet May 31 in Midland, Texas, for a nonbinding vote on the executive payouts. They will also consider resolutions related to climate change, lobbying and corporate governance. 
Much of the executive compensation boost was due to the rise in value of pension plans tied partly to Chevron's stock, which climbed 28 percent last year as oil prices (CLc1) increased 47 percent. Age and other factors can effect actuarial calculations of a pension's value. 
Watson, CEO since 2010, saw his compensation rise 12 percent to $24.7 million, fueled largely by the pension value increase. The value of stock and stock options awarded to Watson fell, as did the value of perquisites, including personal use of the company jet and home security. Watson's salary stayed nearly flat at $1.9 million.
Mike Wirth, head of the company's midstream division who became vice chairman earlier this year, saw his compensation rise 12 percent to $9.1 million. Wirth's salary rose but the value of his stock and stock option awards fell. The value of perquisites he received rose due to air travel. 
Pat Yarrington, Chevron's chief financial officer, saw her compensation fall 11 percent to $6.5 million as the value of her pension fell, the only top executive to see a drop in pension value. Yarrington's salary rose but the value of her stock and stock option awards fell. The value of perquisites Yarrington received slid as she did not record any personal use of the company jet. 
Jay Johnson, head of the company's oil and gas exploration division, saw his compensation rise 5 percent due to an increase in salary, stock options and the value of his pension. The value of perquisites Johnson received dropped by nearly 50 percent due to the cost of a home security system in the prior year.

Watson, Wirth and Johnson took their spouses on a September 2016 trip to Chevron's liquefied natural gas projects in Australia, costing $2,299, $16,014 and $2,243, respectively.

In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). Production cuts began in January for a period of six-months until June.
A fresh batch of inventories data from the American Petroleum Institute at 16:30 EDT, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration  at 10:30 EDT on Wednesday is expected to show U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 0.087 million barrels.
Market participants are hopeful that the advent of the U.S. ‘summer driving season’, will stem the rise in U.S. crude inventories to record highs.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) says that gasoline demand is typically about a million barrels per day higher at its summer peak than at its low point for the year, which is generally in January."

217,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2017 12:27PM ET</span>",Exclusive: OPEC figures show oil output cuts exceed pledge in March - sources,"By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC states cut oil output in March by more than they pledged under supply curbs, according to figures the exporter group uses to monitor its supply, extending a record of higher-than-expected adherence to its first production cut in eight years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) for six months from Jan. 1 to prop up prices and reduce a glut. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC states agreed to cut half as much.
Production from the 11 OPEC members with output targets under the deal has averaged 29.757 million bpd in March, according to average assessments of secondary sources OPEC uses to monitor its output. The figures were seen by Reuters.
OPEC pledged to reduce output by the 11 countries to 29.804 million bpd. This means production has fallen by more than OPEC said it would and amounts to 104 percent adherence to the supply cut regime, according to an OPEC calculation.
""OPEC's compliance has been more than anticipated,"" an OPEC delegate said. ""For non-OPEC, it is satisfactory and getting better.""
The supply cut is supporting oil prices which are trading around $56 a barrel, up from $42 a year ago.
OPEC expects the output cuts to reduce excess supply weighing on the market.
""We are gradually but steadily on course to seeing a return to balanced oil markets,"" OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told Reuters, adding that OPEC and non-OPEC states were seeking ""sustainable stability"" in the market.
Including Nigeria and Libya, the two members exempt from the deal to cut supply, output by all 13 OPEC members in March fell to 31.939 million bpd, two sources said. That would be down 19,000 bpd from OPEC's published February figure.
OPEC is scheduled to publish the assessment of March output based on secondary sources in its monthly oil market report on Wednesday. The figures could be revised before publication as more secondary-source estimates are added, OPEC sources said.
The 11 non-OPEC producers that joined the deal have not cut as much production, partly because of phased implementation of the agreement by Russia, the largest non-OPEC producer that is cooperating with the organization.
But compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC together is expected to rise in March from February's level of 94 percent, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq said on Monday.
OPEC uses two sets of figures to monitor its output -- figures provided by each country and those provided by secondary sources that include industry media. This is a legacy of old disputes over real production levels.
The production cut agreed last year was from levels as assessed by the secondary sources.

The six secondary sources used by OPEC are the International Energy Agency, oil-pricing agencies Platts and Argus, ‎the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) and industry newsletter Petroleum Intelligence Weekly (PIW).

218,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 11, 2017 09:24AM ET</span>",Oil struggles to continue rally ahead of inventories,"Investing.com – Oil prices underwent choppy trade on Tuesday as black gold struggled to maintain a nearly week-long rally that have pushed prices up around 5% as markets looked ahead to data on U.S. crude stockpiles. 
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude May contract was last at $53.09 by 9:22AM ET (13:22GMT), up 0.02%, or $0.01, after rising to $53.23 earlier in the session. The NYMEX barrel has pocketed gains of 5.4% since its last down day on April 3 when it closed at $50.24. 
Elsewhere, Brent oil for June delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London slipped on 5 cents to $55.93 a barrel after hitting an intraday high at $56.16. The global benchmark has risen nearly 6% so far in April. 
Bullish investors have been betting that the production cuts that major oil producers have already agreed to are not only effective, but could be extended beyond the current June cutoff. 
Russia oil minister Alexander Novak said that his country’s oil output would be cut by 250,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) by mid-April and that Moscow will begin talking to Russian oil producers about the possibility of extending the production cut in agreement with OPEC, according to the TASS news agency. 
Saudi Arabia also decreased production to 9.9 million bdp in March from the 10 million reported the prior month, according to Bloomberg, adding that the direct reporting numbers also revealed that Nigeria had reduced production to 1.27 million bpd from 1.43 million and Venezuela had cut to 2.235 million from 2.248 million. However, Qatar had increased production to 621,000 bpd in March from the prior 545,000, according to the news agency.
Meanwhile, Libya’s output was reported to drop to 490,000 bpd as production at its biggest oil field was halted. 
OPEC agreed in November last year to curb its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day between January and June. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 barrels per day.
In total, they agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the first six months of the year.
A joint committee of ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will meet in late April to present its recommendation on the fate of the pact. A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
In the meantime, investors were keeping an eye on U.S. drilling activity that has been steadily increasing even as other major oil producers reduce production in an attempt to reduce the global supply glut and push prices higher.
Late Friday, data from oil services provider Baker Hughes showed that the number of active rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. rose by 10 to 672. That was the 12th straight weekly increase to the highest number since August 2015.
Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to the American Petroleum Institute’s weekly report on crude inventories at 4:30PM ET (20:30GMT) Tuesday.
Official government figures will be released on Wednesday amid expectations for a build of 0.316 million barrels."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Crude oil eased from a five-week high on Tuesday as rising U.S. shale oil production offset concerns over geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and output cuts being made to support prices.
The international benchmark for oil prices, Brent crude futures (LCOc1), were down 20 cents, or 0.36 percent, from its previous close at $55.78 per barrel at 0702 GMT. Earlier, Brent had climbed to its highest since March 7 at $56.16 a barrel. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (CLc1) gave up 15 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $52.93 a barrel, after having touched a five-week high of $53.23 a barrel.
Brent has risen in each of the previous six sessions, while WTI gained for the last five days. 
""We are getting into the high risk part of this rally. It has been going on for a long time,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.
""I wouldn't be surprised to see a bit of book squaring going on now, ahead of the U.S. inventory data which is due on Thursday morning Asia time,"" he said, also noting that current prices have attracted shale oil producers in the past. 
U.S. crude inventories have touched record highs at both the U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, and in the U.S. Gulf Coast in recent weeks, according to U.S. government data.
But the market had been pushed higher by tensions following a U.S. missile strike on Syria and a another shutdown at Libya's largest oilfield. 
Libya's Sharara oilfield was shut on Sunday after a group blocked a pipeline linking it to an oil terminal, a Libyan oil source said. The field had only just returned to production, after a week-long stoppage ending in early April.
The outage added to a rally that started late last week after the United States fired missiles at a Syrian government air base.
While Syria produces only small volumes of oil, the Middle East is home to more than a quarter of the world's oil output.
The focus is also turning to the start of the U.S. summer driving season, which could support prices. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers have pledged to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day in the first six months of 2017, to get rid of excess supply. 

But trading data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that for the majority of 2017 supplies have been exceeding demand despite the OPEC and non-OPEC supply cuts.

222,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2017 02:30AM ET</span>","Exclusive - Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO","By Ron Bousso, Dmitry Zhdannikov and Rania El Gamal
LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and international oil companies have discussed gas venture opportunities inside the kingdom and abroad as part of the top crude-exporting country's drive to diversify investments before the listing of national energy giant Saudi Aramco.
Saudi officials explored investment opportunities with firms including  BP  (L:BP) and  Chevron  (N:CVX) to help develop its gas reserves, the world's sixth largest, at a time of booming energy demand at home, four industry sources told Reuters.
Aramco has also looked into investing in gas ventures abroad, including with Italy's Eni (MI:ENI), the sources said.
The development revives memories of talks between Aramco and global majors at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s, known as the Saudi gas initiative. Most of those talks collapsed as the parties disagreed over returns on investment.
This time, Aramco is gearing up for a share listing next year, aiming to get a valuation of up to $2 trillion in what could be the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO).
Chevron, BP, Aramco and Eni declined to comment on talks.
""We have a long-standing relationship with Saudi Arabia, so it is not uncommon for us to talk to them. We're always having discussions about business development. I don't have anything particular to say about Saudi Arabia,"" Chevron CEO John Watson told Reuters last week.
BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley, who traveled to Saudi Arabia at the end of last year, said this year he wouldn't rule out ""creative partnerships"" with Aramco but that an outright investment by BP in the IPO was unlikely.
The kingdom has a long-term goal of increasing the use of gas for domestic power generation, thus reducing oil burning at home and freeing up more crude for export.
This could help increase Aramco's valuation as it generates more revenue from exports than selling oil at lower domestic prices - Saudi Arabia is the world's fifth-biggest oil consumer despite being only the 20th-biggest economy.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who is also Aramco's chairman, said last year that Aramco was interested in investing in international upstream ventures, particularly gas, and could invest in importing gas into the kingdom.
Diversifying gas assets abroad would help Aramco achieve a better valuation and is attractive for investors, industry sources said. Riyadh also plans to raise domestic gas prices, a move seen as an incentive for foreign companies.
NEW GAS STRATEGY 
Aramco is preparing to reveal in the next few months a new gas strategy aimed at developing resources to keep pace with rising domestic demand, sources familiar with the discussions said. 
It comes as part of the kingdom's push to diversify its economy away from oil, a strategy known as ""Vision 2030"", amid a global drive to phase out the most polluting fossil fuels.
Aramco wants nearly to double gas production to 23 billion standard cubic feet a day in the next decade.
""IOCs (international oil companies) are waiting for that (strategy) to make their decisions,"" one industry source familiar with the matter said.
Another industry source said Energy Minister Falih had said in private meetings with Western oil executives that he wanted Aramco to partner with other companies in upstream projects.
Two Saudi-based industry sources familiar with the discussions said BP's Dudley had expressed an interest in investing in gas exploration in the Red Sea. However, the two sides have yet to hold any talks on the project.
Aramco controls gas reserves in excess of 8 trillion cubic metres, according to BP's annual energy review. The Saudi company has said it wants to explore for gas in the shallow waters of the Red Sea as well as onshore shale gas.
    
SOUR MEMORIES
Since gradually renationalizing the industry in the 1970s, Saudi Arabia has not allowed the majors to develop its oil.
The Saudi gas initiative of the 1990s was effectively an effort by the then-minister for oil, Ali al-Naimi, to thwart attempts by companies such as  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) to partner with Riyadh in oil developments.
In a book published last year, Naimi said he was convinced that as part of gas talks during that decade, oil majors hoped to acquire cheap Saudi reserves of gas condensate, a high-quality form of crude oil.
The $25 billion gas initiative offered in 1997-98 had some of the world's top oil companies such as Exxon and Shell (LON:RDSa) expressing interest but struggling to agree terms.
Riyadh later invited investors in 2003-2004 to find and produce gas in Rub Al Khail, a desert in the country's southeast.
Companies including Russia's Lukoil (MM:LKOH), Shell and China's Sinopec formed ventures with Aramco but have failed to find commercially viable deposits. They also complained about low domestic gas prices and high extraction costs.
Russia's Lukoil (MM:LKOH) was the most recent foreign company to quit Saudi Arabia's search for gas. 
However, Saudi Arabia last month slashed income tax on energy companies operating in the kingdom to make energy investments more attractive.

    ""The terms will be better now,"" an oil executive said.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2017 02:10AM ET</span>",Oil majors' reserves are shrinking and investors don't mind,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - As crude prices recover, oil majors face a dilemma – how quickly should they seek to replenish reserves?
It’s the same question the cyclical oil industry has tackled many times before: go too fast and risk spending too much for little reward, go too slowly and your rivals will be better positioned to grab market share should oil prices rise.
New data revealed by a Reuters analysis shows the oil and gas reserves of global majors have fallen sharply. 
Reserve life - the number of years that a company can keep production stable with its reserves - has decreased for  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), Shell (LON:RDSa), Total and  Statoil  (OL:STL), according to the Reuters analysis of the firms' annual reports. 
 BP  (LON:BP) and Italy's Eni saw a slight increase. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2nGfmte)
In the case of Exxon, the world's top publicly listed oil company, reserve life dropped in 2016 to 13 years, the lowest since 1997, after it wrote down Canadian oil sands.
Shell has its lowest reserve life since 2008 despite buying rival BG last year.
In the past, the trend may have caused alarm among investors. 
But, focused on stock market returns, investors have clear advice: be cautious, do not overspend. 
That, they say, is because the rise of oil production from shale and the growth of renewable energy mean oil majors should actively avoid storing volumes of oil underground they would have held in previous cycles. 
Rohan Murphy, energy analyst at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, which holds shares in Shell, BP, Total and Statoil, sees a reserve life of eight to 10 years as ""quite a healthy level"".
""I don't think these companies should have a reserve life much above eight to 10 years, especially when we are trying to get to grips with what oil demand will be in 10 years from now.""
PEAK DEMAND
The global transition away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy in coming decades further reduces the need for a larger reserve life, said Murphy. 
That contrasts sharply with fears about peak supply, so widespread only a decade ago, when investors were eagerly watching for news about majors' reserve replacement.
Over the past decade, the world has changed so much that Saudi Arabia now plans to list its national champion Saudi Aramco in what is widely seen by the market as an attempt to cash in on the country's huge reserves before demand peaks.
Oil companies are required to report their reserves every year based on an annual average oil price. With an average 2016 price of around $44 a barrel, the lowest in over a decade, firms were forced to remove reserves from high-cost projects.
Jonathan Waghorn, energy fund co-manager at Guinness Asset Management, which holds shares in a number of oil majors, says lower reserves are not his big concern at the moment: ""The focus is on cutting costs and living within cash flows so that they survive for the future.""
To offset the shrinkage, companies could opt to acquire other oil firms or sign production-sharing deals with countries that hold large reserves, similar to what BP and Total did with Abu Dhabi last year,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Martijn Rats said.
Companies have also taken advantage of the rout to buy acreage for future exploration, such as Total's investment in Brazil and Uganda and BP's buy into Eni's Egyptian field Zohr.
""It has never been cheaper to buy reserves or find them yourself ... it is very much a buyers' market if you want to replace reserves,"" Allianz's Murphy said.
LOOMING SUPPLY SHORTFALL
The drop in reserves comes not only as oil prices fell but also because companies sharply cut spending in recent years, shelving many expensive, large-scale developments.
""We may be starting to witness the effect of significant capex cuts. The oil market is becoming increasingly undersupplied, which should move the oil price higher,"" said Kirill Pyshkin from Mirabaud, who has Shell in his portfolio.
Last year, 10 billion barrels of oil were discovered, around one third of global consumption, including well-appraisal activity, according to Per Magnus Nysveen, head of analysis at Oslo-based consultancy Rystad Energy.
Oil majors have made only a handful of large discoveries in recent years, including Zohr, Exxon's Liza field in Guyana and BP's Tortue discovery in west Mauritania and Senegal. 
Since 2010, less than 2 billion barrels of oil has been discovered by majors per year and most of this in existing fields, Nysveen said.
""The shortcoming of oil replacement by the drillbit has been quite drastic ... Discoveries are not keeping up with production,"" said Nysveen, adding that supply could fall short by up to 2 million barrels per day within seven to eight years.

224,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2017 02:10AM ET</span>",Diversify or die: China's independent oil refiners adapt to new challenges,"By Chen Aizhu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Cut off from lucrative fuel export markets and seeing their margins squeezed by new taxes, China's independent oil refiners are branching out into new sectors from clean energy and lumber as well as expanding their trading to overcome the challenges. 
These independents, known as ""teapots"" since they are smaller companies than their state-owned rivals, are scrambling to survive shifting government policies at the same time domestic oil demand growth is slowing, undermining their ability to expand by just serving their home market. In 2016, China's annual fuel demand growth was at a three-year low.
""The good days won't last much longer, as China's oil demand has been shrinking,"" said Zhang Liucheng, vice president of Shandong Dongming Petrochemical Group, the country's largest independent refiner.
Late last year, Beijing suspended fuel export quotas for the independents, handing control of diesel and gasoline exports to the dominant state refiners.
Other government moves may also squeeze the independent's margins. Top state refiner Sinopec overhauled its fuel buying policy by centralizing all purchases at its Beijing headquarters and China plans to slap consumption taxes on refinery by-products such as light cycle oil, sold as diesel, and mixed aromatics, which are added to gasoline to improve fuel quality.
""They had already been diversified and nimble at working around the various government mandates...now they are definitely looking for ways to step up their game and have better people, global access and financing to do so,"" said Michal Meidan, analyst at consultants Energy Aspects.
Executives at some of China's top independent refiners outlined to Reuters their plans to diversify to endure these changes.
Dongming, for example, plans to add a 800,000 tons-per-year naphtha cracker, extending its business from transportation fuels to higher value plastics and synthetic rubber as well as fine chemicals, said Zhang.
The 260,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) refiner is also looking to invest in small-scale onshore fields, said Zhang. 
Zhang also aims to boost trading operations by combining physical oil and gas trading with financial services such as offering credit facilities for fellow teapots at better rates than banks.
Underscoring how much Beijing has prioritized clean energy, Shandong Haike Group said it will open this month a factory that makes electrolytes used in lithium batteries for electric vehicles.
The company said the plant will be the country's largest with the capacity to produce 100,000 tons a year. It also plans to grow its pharmaceutical business but has no plans to expand its refining capacity.
UNCERTAIN FUTURE FOR TEAPOTS
Shandong Chambroad Group plans to move into lumber processing to develop a special building material for villa cottages and gardens, said chairman Ma Yunsheng.
In addition to the policy actions against them, the teapots have lost a major advocate with the departure of Shandong provincial governor Guo Shuqing, which further shrouds their future, said Energy Aspects' Meidan.
Newly installed Shandong party chief Liu Jiayi could try to tackle overcapacity and pollution in the province, which would add to pressure on the independents, she said. 
For some, the expansions are an opportunity to move from a small local operation into a global company. 
Shandong Hengyuan Petrochemical Co, a refiner backed by a local government and the first teapot to own a refinery abroad, wants to become a regional player, combining assets at its home base in Shandong with the refinery in Port Dickson, Malaysia, that it recently acquired from Shell (L:RDSa).
As part of the expansion, it will set up a trading desk in Kuala Lumpur to secure crude for the two plants with a combined capacity of 160,000 bpd and also supply 4 millions of tons of fuel annually to Shell under a 10-year pact. 

""Without differentiating yourself, the competition will be tough,"" said Hengyuan's chairman Wang Youde.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for May delivery rose 0.17% to $53.17 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 0.21% to $56.10 a barrel.
Later Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute (API) will report estimates of inventories for crude and refined products at the end of last week, followed by official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday. The two sets of figures diverged sharply last week with API showing a crude draw and EIA a build.
Analysts expect a 316,000 barrels build in crude supplies, and a drop in gasoline stocks of 1.761 million barrels and a decline in distillate supplies of 896,000 barrels.
Overnight, crude settled higher on Monday, after production halted at Libya’s largest oilfield for the second time in as many weeks while rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East lifted sentiment.
Libya's Sharara oilfield was shut on Sunday, after a group blocked a pipeline linking it to an oil terminal, a Libyan oil source said. Crude prices continued to trade with upside bias, after last week’s U.S. missile strike on an airbase in Syria, underpinned a rally in oil prices, as investors worried about potential supply disruptions in the region.
Although, Syria is no longer a significant oil producer, it neighbors and has relationships with big oil producers in the oil-rich region.
A rise in geopolitical tensions and potential supply disruptions overshadowed concerns that rising levels of global oil supply, particular in the U.S., would dampened OPEC’s effort to drain the glut in supply.
Meanwhile, Kuwait oil chief, Essam al-Marzouq, fuelled expectations that OPEC would reveal further cuts in March compared to previous months, after he said he expected producers’ level of compliance with the deal to cut global supply would “be higher than the previous couple of months”.
Essam al Marzouq’s bullish comments came amid renewed hopes that OPEC would extend its current deal to cut production beyond June, after Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich expressed his concern on Friday, that the deal to cut supply hasn’t delivered as much as expected.
In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd).

""We want to be ahead of the curve and not behind it.""
Overnight, gold prices traded below breakeven on Monday, as increased expectations the Federal Reserve would hike rates in June offset a rise in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Korea.
Dollar denominated assets such as gold are sensitive to moves in the dollar, as a strengthening greenback, tends to lessen demand for the yellow metal, making it more expensive for foreign buyers.
Trading volumes across markets remained thin, as investors paused to reflect on rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, after last week’s U.S. missile strike on an airbase in Syria. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions in Asia surfaced, following the U.S decision to move a Navy strike group toward the Korean peninsula amid continued missile tests by North Korea.
Expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike rates in June continued to limit upside for gold prices.

Despite a near tripling of new well permits, to 1,310 wells compared with 511 during the same month last year, the Texas Railroad Commission data also showed a decline in the number of well completions, the final step before production can begin. 
""This is a clear indication that drilling activity will increase at a steady pace compared to last year,"" said Ed Longanecker, president of trade group Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association. 
Natural gas well completions fell 60 percent to 77 from 194 in the same month a year ago. Oil completions fell 44 percent to 533 wells versus 947 wells a year earlier. 
""Operators will begin to build DUC (drilled but uncompleted) inventory and evaluate each location for completion based on commodity prices, service costs and production potential,"" Longanecker said, even though completions fell in March. 

Texas's 418 active drilling rigs accounts for about half of the U.S. rig counts, according to the latest Baker Hughes rig count data.

233,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2017 06:02AM ET</span>","Oil rises further above $55 on Libyan field shutdown, Syria","By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose further above $55 a barrel on Monday, supported by another shutdown at Libya's largest oilfield and heightened tension over Syria following the U.S. missile strike.
Libya's Sharara oilfield was shut on Sunday after a group blocked a pipeline linking it to an oil terminal, a Libyan oil source said. The field had only just returned to production, after a week-long stoppage ending in early April. 
""It means that at least one potential source of additional supply has fallen away for the time being,"" said Carsten Fritsch of Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), referring to the Libyan outage.
Brent crude (LCOc1), the global benchmark, rose 48 cents to $55.72 at 0947 GMT, not far from the one-month high of $56.08 reached on Friday. U.S. crude (CLc1) was up 37 cents at $52.61.
Oil also climbed on heightened tension in the Middle East, a region that is home to more than a quarter of the world's oil output. Crude rallied last week after the United States fired missiles at a Syrian government air base.
""The developments in Syria should be factored in as an additional risk premium in the oil price going forward, especially now that oil inventories are drawing down and the market is no longer in massive surplus,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, analyst at SEB.
He expects Brent average $57.50 in the second quarter, ""which means we are likely to see $60 printed at times during this period.""
Libya's Sharara field was previously shut for a week until April 2. The OPEC state has been pumping a fraction of potential output for most of the time since the 2011 civil war because of conflict and unrest.
Oil prices have also been supported by a deal led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day for the first six months of 2017. Libya, and another OPEC member Nigeria, are exempt from cuts.
Last week's rise in prices was due to ""the relatively high OPEC adherence to the supply cut agreement and the general belief that the deal will be extended and, secondly, because of geopolitical developments,"" Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM said.
However, the price rally has been limited, as oil price gains have encouraged production in other countries such as the United States, filling some of the gap left by OPEC-led cuts.

U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a 12th straight week, Baker Hughes said on Friday, as energy companies boost spending on new production.

234,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2017 05:40AM ET</span>",Oil surplus or scarcity? Shale makes it even harder to predict,"By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - The shale oil boom has transformed the U.S. and global energy sector to such an extent that it has upended traditional supply dynamics and made forecasts far more polarized. 
Investment banks, many of which finance new projects, along with oil majors such as Total and Eni, have warned that huge spending cuts caused by a plunge in oil prices since 2014 would lead to a supply crunch in the next two years.
Yet Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), the only bank to make more than $1 billion a year from commodities trading, believes a looming recovery in U.S. output on the back of higher oil prices combined with an avalanche of new conventional projects will create a substantial surplus by 2019.
Prior to the shale revolution, conventional oil was the only game in town. Estimating future supply essentially involved calculating the project pipeline and factoring in the ""unknown knowns"" such as political risk in oil-producing nations.
The ability of the shale sector to adapt quickly and nimbly to a lower-price environment means production cycles have shortened as fields can be switched on and off in a matter of weeks.
Most forecasters including OPEC and the International Energy Agency underestimated shale's decline during the oil price collapse and its production increases as prices recovered.
Goldman predicts the coming two years will see a huge burst of development, complicating OPEC's efforts to rebalance the market and ease a global glut with the help of output cuts. 
""This long lead-time wave of projects and a short-cycle revival, led by U.S. shales, could create a material oversupply in 2018-19,"" Goldman's equity research team said last month. 
""As OPEC prepares for its May 25 meeting, it is likely to weigh the relative benefit of stability (extend cut) versus the risk of long-term share loss.""
Goldman estimates that new projects and rising shale output could add 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to global supply by 2018-2019.
The forecast contrasts with those of consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which foresees a supply gap of 20 million bpd by 2025, and Goldman's rival  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), which believes a surge in U.S. production this year will not derail the rebalancing. 
""OPEC has successfully constrained output, and although drilling activity in U.S. shale is picking up rapidly, this will probably not come quick enough to prevent a period of sizeable inventory draws late this year,"" Morgan Stanley said.
""By 2020, we estimate that (around) 1.5 million bpd of demand will need to come from projects that have not been sanctioned yet, but that have break-even oil prices of $70-75 a barrel,"" the bank said. 
BLACK HOLES 
Goldman advises anyone from institutional investors such as pension funds, to oil producers and it seems the oil market is listening.
Brent crude futures show prices for oil deliverable up to 2019 trading below those for prompt delivery, before reverting to the contango structure of low prompt prices and higher futures prices that is typical of an oversupplied market.
Goldman stands by its prediction that supply and demand will fall into line this year, even though global crude inventories in developed economies alone top 3 billion barrels, some 300 million barrels above the five-year average that OPEC is targeting with its supply cuts.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some of its biggest rivals including Russia, agreed in late2016 to cut output jointly by 1.8 million bpd for the first half of this year to tackle the overhang. 
UBS, meanwhile, sees a potential 4 million bpd hole by 2020, even though a higher crude price this year has prompted some companies to bring forward their exploration and development plans. 
""Beyond 2017, the impact of a collapse in longer-cycle conventional investment over 2014-16 begins to be felt. 2015 saw just six major upstream projects totaling (some) 0.6 million bpd ... versus the 3-4 million bpd average, and 2016 has seen just one major liquids project sanctioned,"" UBS strategist Jon Rigby said.
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch points out that along with the collapse in spending, the global rig count, a measure of production activity, shows no sign of picking up outside the United States. 

According to oil services company Baker Hughes, the number of non-U.S. oil rigs has risen by just 29 since hitting an 11-year low of 666 in November last year, compared with a rise of 346 in U.S. rigs in just 10 months.

Investors also largely shrugged off Friday’s disappointing U.S. employment data, which was not seen as impacting rate hike expectations.

Oil pared some of the gains later in the session as concerns about a wider escalation in the region faded and U.S. economic data weighed on global markets.

The collapse in oil prices after mid-2014 has pushed Saudi Arabia to contemplate a radical overhaul of all parts of its economy, including new taxes, privatizations, a changed investment strategy and sharp cuts in government spending.
Mohammed al-Jadaan sought in a statement carried by state news agency SPA to allay concern that people would be taxed as part of the ambitious reform plan. Saudis currently do not pay any income tax, nor are Saudi companies taxed on their profits.
He also said a value-added tax planned for 2018 would ""not be raised above 5 percent before 2020"".
The six Arab monarchies of the Gulf Cooperation Council are aiming to introduce a 5 percent value-added tax at the start of next year to raise non-oil revenues. But economists and officials in some countries have said privately that simultaneous introduction in all countries may not be feasible.

That is because of the complexity of creating the administrative infrastructure to collect the tax and the difficulty of training companies to comply with it in a region where taxation is minimal.

242,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 09, 2017 05:53AM ET</span>",Crude Oil Futures - Weekly Outlook: April 10 - 14,"Investing.com - Oil futures settled higher for the fourth session in a row on Friday, extending a rally to the strongest level in around a month after the U.S. fired missiles at a Syrian government air base.
Oil pared some of the gains later in the session as concerns about a wider escalation in the region faded and U.S. economic data weighed on global markets.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for June delivery tacked on 35 cents, or around 0.7%, to settle at $55.24 a barrel by close of trade. The global benchmark hit $56.08 earlier Friday, the most since March 7.
London-traded Brent futures logged a gain of $1.71, or about 3.1%, on the week, the second weekly increase in a row.
Elsewhere, the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude May contract inched up 54 cents to end at $52.24 a barrel by close of trade. It touched its highest since March 7 at $52.94 earlier in the session.
For the week, the U.S. benchmark rose $1.64, or around 3.1%.
Crude prices jumped overnight after two U.S. destroyers based in the Eastern Mediterranean fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air base, which the U.S. said was in retaliation to Bashar al-Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons against his own people.
But analysts said the initial knee-jerk reaction to the airstrike may have been overdone given Syria’s role as a very minor oil producer and after U.S. officials described the attack as a one-off event that would not lead to wider escalation.
Meanwhile, oil traders continued to focus on the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production, which could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand remained in focus.
Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by 10 last week, the 12th weekly increase in a row. That brought the total count to 672, the most since September 2015.
Earlier in the week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that crude oil inventories increased by 1.57 million barrels to yet another all-time high of 535.5 million.
It was the 13th weekly build in U.S. stockpiles in the past 15 weeks, feeding concerns about a global glut.
Market participants, however, remained optimistic that OPEC would extend its current deal with non-OPEC producers to cut output beyond June in an effort to rebalance the market.
In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day between January and June.
A joint committee of ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will meet in late April to present its recommendation on the fate of the pact. A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for May tacked on 1.6 cents, or about 1% to end at its highest since August 2015 at $1.746 on Friday. It closed up around 2.7% for the week.
May heating oil added 1.5 cents to finish at $1.628 a gallon, the most since March 1. For the week, the fuel gained roughly 3.5%.
Natural gas futures for May delivery dropped 7.0 cents to $3.261 per million British thermal units, trimming its weekly gain to around 2.2%.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Meanwhile, investors will keep an eye out for monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency to gauge global supply and demand levels.
Traders will also continue to pay close attention to comments from global oil producers for further evidence that they are complying with their agreement to reduce output this year.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.

In January, Iran named 29 companies from more than a dozen countries as being allowed to bid for oil and gas projects under the IPC, which Tehran hopes will boost production after years of sanctions.
But the IPC model has been delayed several times due to opposition from hardline rivals of President Hassan Rouhani.
""The new oil contracts (IPCs) are currently being reviewed by the Supreme National Security Council,"" Zanganeh told parliament, the students' news agency ISNA reported.
Zanganeh did not elaborate or say how long the review might take, ISNA and other agencies reported.
The IPC model ends a buy-back system dating back more than 20 years under which Iran did not allow foreign firms to book reserves or take equity stakes in Iranian companies.
Oil majors have said they would only go back to Iran if it makes major changes to the buy-back contracts, which companies such as France's Total or Italy's Eni have said made them no money or even incurred losses.

The IPC has more flexible terms that take into account oil price fluctuations and investment risks, a senior Iranian oil official told Reuters in November.

244,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2017 05:15PM ET</span>",SEC halts some enforcement of conflict minerals rule amid review,"By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday it is suspending enforcement of the costliest requirements of its ""conflict minerals"" rule, after a court remanded it back to the regulator because part of it violates the U.S. Constitution.
Acting SEC Chairman Mike Piwowar, a Republican, said he has asked staff for a recommendation on how to proceed with the rule, which requires companies to disclose if their products contain certain minerals from a war-torn part of Africa.
For now, he added, companies will not be required to conduct a due diligence review or an audit, which are both part of the process used to determine the origin of the minerals.
""Until these issues are resolved, it is difficult to conceive of a circumstance that would counsel in favor of enforcing"" the due diligence requirements, he said in a statement.
The move sparked backlash from SEC Democratic Commissioner Kara Stein, who accused Piwowar of acting beyond his authority to gut the meat of a rule mandated by Congress, adopted by the SEC and reviewed by the courts.
“It is unprecedented for one commissioner, acting alone and without official notice and comment, to engage in de facto rulemaking,"" she said.
""It represents a troubling attack not only on the Commission process, but also on the restraints of government power.”
The conflict minerals rule was required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and is supported by human rights groups that want companies to tell investors if their products contain tantalum, tin, gold or tungsten mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the hope that such disclosures will curb funding to armed groups.
Business groups have contended that it forces companies to furnish politically charged information that is irrelevant to making investment decisions and that it costs too much for companies to trace the source of minerals through the supply chain.
In 2014, a U.S. appeals court struck down part of the conflict minerals law after the Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers sued the SEC over it.
The court found part of it violated free speech rights of companies by forcing them to publicly state that their products were not conflict free.
The rest of the rule was left intact. 
Since then, companies have furnished reports with SEC and conducted due diligence, though they were granted a reprieve from the audit requirement and the labeling of the minerals themselves. 
The litigation formally came to an end on Monday, when the lower court remanded the rule back to the SEC to address the First Amendment concerns.
The appeals court did not say whether the Dodd-Frank law itself or the SEC's implementation of the rule violated the Constitution, a matter that the SEC will now need to determine. 

Companies will still need to file required forms with the SEC and do origin inquiries, as they have been doing.

Although, Syria is no longer a significant oil producer, investors fretted over potential supply disruptions in the region, as Syria neighbors and has relationships with big oil producers in the oil-rich region.
The concerns over a disruption is supply overshadowed renewed fears that rising U.S. crude and shale production could weigh on OPEC’s efforts to reduce a glut in supply, after U.S. crude inventories rose to record high on Wednesday.
Market participants, however, remained optimistic that OPEC would extend its current deal with non-OPEC members to cut production beyond June, after Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich expressed his concern that the deal to cut supply hasn’t delivered as much as expected.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday, trading near a one-month high after the United States fired missiles at a Syrian government air base, roiling global markets and raising concern that the conflict could spread in the oil-rich region.
The toughest U.S. action yet in Syria's six-year-old civil war has ramped up geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East. This supported oil futures, which were on track for a 3 percent weekly increase on signs of higher U.S. demand and lower product inventories.
""Oil markets are back in bullish mode after the setback of the previous weeks. This news flow seems to bring geopolitical risks back on the radar,"" said Frank Klumpp, oil analyst at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, based in Stuttgart, Germany.
The market could get a further boost when the Baker Hughes U.S. rig count is released on Friday afternoon, if it shows a slower pace of increase in oil drilling. [RIG/U]
Although Syria has limited oil production, any escalation of the conflict feeds fears about oil supplies due to the country's location and alliances with big oil producers in the region.
Oil, gold, foreign exchange and bond markets reacted strongly to the attack but reversed some of the sharp moves after monthly U.S. employment figures came in weaker than expected. [MKTS/GLOB]
Brent crude futures were up 28 cents at $55.17 a barrel by 11:33 a.m. EDT (1533 GMT) after reaching an intraday peak of $56.08, the highest since March 7, shortly after the U.S. missile strike was announced.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 37 cents at $52.07 a barrel, having reached an intraday high of $52.94.
Oil came off session highs as U.S. economic data weighed on global markets. Some analysts said the conflict in Syria had no bearing on oil fundamentals and the political risk premium could vanish quickly.
""This might just be a speculative move higher because there's nothing fundamental that's supporting this rise,"" said Hamza Khan, head of commodities strategy at ING.
Traders eyed news from Canada, where two oil sands producers have cut production due to a shortage of synthetic crude following a plant fire.
""The production outages in Canada will ... continue to have a price-supportive effect,"" said Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
In bearish news, non-OPEC producer Kazakhstan raised production last month despite its pledge to cut output by 20,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2017.

Preliminary government data showed a 2 percent month-on-month rise in March.

250,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2017 05:02AM ET</span>","Weak crude oil stunts U.S. energy IPOs, boosts outlook for M&A","By Clara Denina and David French
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The stream of U.S. energy companies going public at the start of 2017 has dried up on concerns over the future direction of oil prices, but private buyers seeking mergers and acquisitions are ready to take advantage of the volatility to secure cheap deals.
Texas-based FTS International and Select Energy Services are among six U.S. energy companies that filed for listings in the first quarter but delayed, even after receiving the green light from local regulators, Thomson Reuters data showed.
Four U.S. oil and gas companies went public in January, when more stable crude prices gave them confidence to tap into investor demand after a barren listings period that followed a slump in U.S. crude prices in late 2015.
Share prices for that quartet tumbled 14 percent on average by March 31, according to Thomson Reuters data, as crude prices retreated to end the first quarter 6.5 percent lower, the biggest quarterly decline since late 2015.
Two Canadian oilfield services firms, STEP Energy Services and Source Energy, pulled their March public offerings due to adverse market conditions, further undermining the case for energy IPOs.
""There was talk of upwards of 20 IPOs getting ready to go at the start of the year, but now everyone is slowing down their processes as share prices have gone down as rapidly increasing production raised concerns about how fast and how far the recovery in oilfield activity would go,” said Brian Williams, managing director at Carl Marks Advisors.
Most are in the oilfield services sector, with many looking to relist and raise fresh capital after going through bankruptcy proceedings during the last oil price downturn.
With the sharp cost cutting by oil producers in the last 18 months continuing to hurt profits at service firms, companies that listed in 2017 often did so based on expected performance for coming years. Sliding crude prices in March undermined hopes for future growth.
""The market was looking past current conditions to 2018 and 2019 projections with valuations of eight or nine times 2018 EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), on the assumption that if you wanted to get in ahead of the future upside, you'd have to pay now,"" said Williams.
SWITCHING TRACK
Bankers said that lower IPO valuations and lingering caution on oil prices would encourage energy companies to sell themselves to private buyers instead.
Some are owned by distressed debt investors and hedge funds that bought them out of bankruptcy and could still secure a substantial profit even though valuations have declined in recent weeks.
Such a switch in focus should not be too difficult. Many IPO processes have been run as dual-track, where concurrent attempts to list and sell the company are made by advisors. Private equity and similar investors seeking energy assets have adequate capital. 
""In the current market, when the IPO valuations start to come down, if buyers are still optimistic, the sale proceeds might be more attractive to sellers than what they would get in an IPO,"" said Jeffery Malonson, a capital markets partner at King & Spalding.
He noted the owners would also secure the benefit of a full exit from their investment as opposed to a partial one through a listing.
Companies could also use the delay in listing plans to bulk up their own operations using acquisitions, which will mean they have bigger and more valuable companies when they eventually go public.
This is particularly true for oilfield services and equipment providers, which need to cut costs in the face of stalling cash flows and shrinking capex, bankers said.
Improved scale was seen as one of the main drivers of Schlumberger NV's agreement last month to form a $535 million joint venture with Weatherford International Plc to deliver oilfield products and services for unconventional resource plays in the United States and Canada.

While some could fund deals with their own reserves, others will need to borrow cash. With banks likely reluctant to lend substantial sums to recently-restructured companies, private equity firms and other non-bank lenders could step in here as well. However, terms for borrowers would be more onerous than they would get at banks.

Gold futures eased from a session high $1,260.65, after the U.S. Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims decreased by 25,000 to 234,000 in the week ending April 1 from the previous week’s revised total of 259,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to drop by 8,000 to 250,000 last week.
Meanwhile, expectations of June rate hike grew, after the Federal Reserve released the minutes from its March meeting on Wednesday.
The Federal Reserve said that it would start to unwind its $4.5 trillion balance sheet “later this year” and maintained its view, rate hikes would be gradual.
Some analysts supported the idea that the Federal Reserve is poised to increase interest rates in June.
“We have expressed a strong conviction that, unless the data deteriorate or financial conditions ratchet tighter, the Fed will next hike rates at its June meeting.” Morgan Stanley noted in a research report to clients.
According to investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool, 58% of traders expect a rate hike in June compared to 50% of traders prior to the release of the Fed minutes.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. 
Meanwhile, a two-day summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later today, is expected to be closely watched by investors, as a negative outcome could weigh on China-U.S. trade relations.
Silver futures, tacked on 0.39% to $18.258, a troy ounce while copper lost 0.71% to trade at $2.661.

U.S. natural gas for May delivery tacked on 5.0 cents, or around 1.5%, to $3.316 per million British thermal units by 10:35AM ET (14:35GMT). Futures were at around $3.290 prior to the release of the supply data.
It settled lower on Wednesday after touching its strongest January 27 at $3.347.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 2 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 31, compared to forecasts for a build of 7 billion.
That compared with a withdrawal of 43 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a gain of 12 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 13 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.051 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 17.2% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 12.9% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, traders monitored shifting weather forecasts to assess the outlook for early-spring demand and supply levels.
Overall, an active spring pattern is expected the next two weeks across most parts of the U.S. with swings in demand between slightly lighter and stronger than normal every few days, according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting forecasts on early-spring demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude May contract tacked on 25 cents, or around 0.5%, to $51.41 a barrel by 8:40AM ET (12:40GMT), recovering from an overnight low of $50.80.
It settled higher for the second session in a row on Wednesday after hitting its strongest since March 8 at $51.88.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for June delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London inched up 31 cents to $54.67 a barrel. The global benchmark touched its highest since March 8 at $55.09 in the prior session.
Oil prices reached a four-week high on Wednesday amid increasing optimism that OPEC’s supply curbs are beginning to rebalance the market.
OPEC agreed in November last year to curb its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day between January and June. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 barrels per day.
In total, they agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the first six months of the year.
A joint committee of ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will meet in late April to present its recommendation on the fate of the pact. A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
Prices were pulled lower after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said that crude oil inventories increased by 1.57 million barrels last week to yet another all-time high of 535.5 million.
It was the 13th weekly build in U.S. stockpiles in the past 15 weeks, feeding concerns about a global glut.
The record crude inventories came as U.S. oil production rose 52,000 barrels per day to 9.2 million last week, levels last seen at the start of the market slump in late 2014 and early 2015.
The figures offset optimism that OPEC and its allies have been following through on their commitment to cut production.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for May added 0.3 cents, or 0.2%, to $1.712 a gallon, while May heating oil rose 0.7 cents to $1.611 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for May delivery was little changed at $3.260 per million British thermal units, as traders looked ahead to weekly storage data due later in the global day.

Also on the Comex, silver futures for May delivery inched up 4.0 cents, or about 0.2%, to $18.22 a troy ounce. It fell 13.6 cents in the prior session.
The main focus of the market on Thursday is the highly-anticipated meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later in the day at Trump's Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida.
The two-day summit between the world's two most powerful leaders is expected to cover differences over trade, currencies and North Korea.
Trump has repeatedly criticized China's economic policies and pledged to label China a currency manipulator on the first day of his administration, but so far he has not.
Meanwhile, investors continued to digest minutes from the Federal Reserve's March policy meeting released on Wednesday, which was viewed as relatively hawkish.
The minutes showed most policymakers thought the central bank should start unwinding its massive balance sheet later this year, much sooner than many had expected.
The Fed currently holds $4.5 trillion in bonds and actions to trim the balance sheet could have a major impact on markets given its magnitude. Fed Chair Janet Yellen indicated that such a move would be akin to a rate hike.
The Fed's next policy meeting is scheduled for May 2-3 while investors currently expect another rate hike in June, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

261,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2017 06:42AM ET</span>",Traders bet their oil storage assets that OPEC cuts will work,"By Julia Payne
LONDON (Reuters) - The jury is still out on whether OPEC can rein in a global oil glut but top commodity traders are betting it can by selling stakes in storage tank businesses that profited from oversupply.
Since January,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), Vitol and Gunvor have completed or have been seeking to sell parts of their holdings in storage firms.
Vitol's deal was agreed in October, before the Nov. 30 announcement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that it would cut output from Jan. 1. Vitol's deal was completed in January, and others have lined up sales since.
""The traders picked the right time to sell,"" Jean-François Lambert of Lambert Commodities consultancy said, adding an oil price recovery and prospects for a more balanced market were partly behind the timing, alongside factors such as freeing up cash to trade.
""If you have an opportunity to sell assets to lighten your balance sheet without losing control then you do it,"" he said.
The five top traders, who also include Mercuria and Trafigura, expect OPEC to extend output cuts into the second half of 2017, which would help draw down global inventories. 
When inventories are plentiful, the oil price for future delivery tends to be above the price for prompt delivery, a state known as contango, when it pays to be in the storage business, taking fees and selling stored oil forward at a profit. This has been the situation since mid-2014.
At times, the prompt price was more than $1 less than a barrel for delivery a month later. With an abundance of crude supplies, trading houses could book easy profits by buying crude and storing it after selling it forward.
""Contango is a very basic play. It's lazy,"" Trafigura's co-head of risk Ben Luckock said, speaking during a commodities conference. ""But I think you've seen contango has come out of the market."" 
As stockpiles draw down, the oil price for prompt delivery tends to trade above future prices, a condition known as backwardation. At this point, oil cannot be sold forward at a quick profit and the storage business loses its luster.
Till now, there have been few clear signs that OPEC and non-OPEC cuts of 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) were working, with global stockpiles stubbornly high, according to U.S. data and International Energy Agency (IEA) figures. 
MARKET MOMENTUM 
But some analysts are starting to see a shift.
""Examining less visible - but still reported - inventories shows about a 72 million barrel of total oil draws globally since end-January. We expect this to gain momentum,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a research note last week.
Oil trader Pierre Andurand of Andurand Capital Management, speaking to CNBC last week, went further, saying he expected ""sustainable backwardation"" by late summer.
The oil futures market was in backwardation, almost continuously, from early 2011 to mid-2014. Then it switched into contango as Brent crude tumbled from more than $100 a barrel. By the start of 2016, it had fallen below $30. 
Capitalizing on this market price structure, in mid-2015, Vitol bought its partner's 50 percent stake in infrastructure and storage firm VTTI for $830 million. Then in October 2016, it agreed to sell 50 percent to Buckeye Partners for $1.15 billion, completing that deal in January. 
The oil futures market has yet to slip into backwardation since OPEC began its cuts. But it came close in February when the price for the front-month Brent was $56.66 a barrel, settled at 16 cents less than the contract for delivery seven months later. 
The spread has since widened again to about 80 cents between the front-month contract and seven-month Brent. That could change if, as some OPEC officials suggest, cuts by the group and its non-OPEC partners are extended beyond June and prices climb. 
If it does, Glencore's sale of a 51 percent stake in its global oil products storage business for $775 million to Chinese conglomerate HNA last week would look prescient. 
Gunvor, meanwhile, is selling a share in a Rotterdam storage facility, while Trafigura is working on its IPO in privately owned Puma Energy, a venture with Angola's state-run Sonangol Holdings LDA and investment company Cochan Holdings. 
But not everyone is convinced a return to backwardation will be sustained, as U.S. shale oil producers have ramped up output, filling some of the gap left by OPEC and its partners.

""While over the next couple of months backwardation may temporarily come back ... we see a strong comeback of U.S. shale supplies joining in on many long-planned supply additions in the Atlantic Basin,"" David Wech of JBC Energy consultancy said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Thursday, on track for a weekly gain of 3 percent, after recovering from losses triggered by record high U.S. crude inventories.
Brent crude futures were up by 6 cents on the day at $54.42 a barrel by 0852 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 1 cent at $51.16 a barrel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported an increase of 1.57 million barrels in crude inventories late on Wednesday, bringing total U.S. stocks to a record high of 535.5 million barrels.
""Overnight crude inventory numbers pulled the rug out from under the feet of the oil rally,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior analyst at futures brokerage OANDA.
The record crude inventories came as U.S. oil production rose by 52,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.2 million bpd.
""The U.S. crude oil production profile is a mirror image of where it was last year, when at the end of the second quarter, production was 600,000 bpd lower than at the start of the year and this year is going to be the opposite,"" said Olivier Jakob, at consultancy Petromatrix.
""By the end of the second quarter, you could have U.S. production up by 1 million bpd.""
Because of the glut, U.S. crude exports have risen to a record 1.1 million bpd. Most cargoes are going to Asia, where traders say there are early signs of a tightening market due to efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut output in an effort to prop up prices.
""The global picture is more important (than just the U.S.) and stocks are being drawn,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director at trading company Strong Petroleum in Singapore.
In the short-term, he said, a lot of oil was being sold out of storage around the world, adding to the imminent glut.

But Berentsen warned that once a significant amount of crude had been sold out of inventories, ""then you get the full effect (of tighter supplies).""

265,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2017 02:20AM ET</span>",Big miners have trouble joining technology revolution,"By Barbara Lewis and Zandi Shabalala
SANTIAGO/LONDON (Reuters) - Mining companies chasing the kind of technological breakthroughs made long ago in the manufacture of cars and mobile phones have unveiled eye-catching innovations ranging from vast drills and remote-controlled trucks to second-by-second data analysis.
Behind the scenes, however, there has so far been limited progress towards a transformation the companies say is more and more vital to their survival.
They are being jolted into action by volatile commodity prices and the increasing difficulty and danger of accessing remaining reserves in hot, narrow seams several kilometers below ground.
""There'a a big awakening in mining. The time is ripe for things to begin to change,"" Anglo American's head of technology development Donovan Waller said by telephone.
A major obstacle is the massive upfront cost for innovation that firms such as Anglo, BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO)  Sandvik, one of the world's biggest suppliers of mining equipment, told Reuters it had doubled its installation of automation systems between 2015 and 2016. But, asked what proportion of the loaders and trucks it sells are fully automated, it gave an estimate of 5 percent. While automation represents a potential threat to jobs the world over, it is particularly sensitive in an industry employing hundreds of thousands of blue-collar workers in nations where mining represents a major chunk of GDP. Extreme environments and logistical barriers to transferring technology from other industries were other issues experienced by three big mining companies, in South Africa, Chile and Australia, which shed light on the complexity of the task. LABOR RELATIONS South Africa's South Deep started ahead of the pack back in 2008. Now the only fully mechanized large underground gold mine in South Africa, it broke even for the first time last year after years of losses and unveiled a new turnaround plan in February which cut production targets. Mine owner Gold Fields blames unforgiving geology 3 km (2 miles) beneath the operation south west of Johannesburg, says it has not had to fire anyone over mechanization and points to staff members who have readily embraced change. ""Our mining is going forward,"" said employee Margaret Motaung, describing training for remotely operated rock-breaking equipment imported from Australia as easy and reporting that she had had a pay rise, which she declined to specify. The mine's trade union leader, Victor Mphore, takes a very different view, saying miners were being replaced by outsiders. ""We have seen a lot of forced dismissals in the form of constructive dismissals and high turnover in middle management at this mine,"" he said, citing language and literacy barriers and what he said was insufficient training to overcome them. At a national level, the union will not discuss mechanization. ""We won't participate in talks about mechanization because it will lead to job losses,"" said National Union of Mineworkers spokesman Livhuwani Mammburu. ""They (the mine owners) mustn't rush only to make profits."" The chamber says some job losses are inevitable, but that without technology to extend the life of mines, some 200,000 people would lose their jobs by 2025, affecting 2 million people via families or related industries. Lack of engagement is a problem, it said. ""It is obviously impacting on the pace and the scale at which this can be done,"" said Sietse van der Woude, the chamber's modernization specialist. ""We hope that we can have a conversation in such a way that we can progress these matters and actually save those jobs."" Starting this month Pretoria is providing funding to develop ore processing techniques and related manufacturing to make up for lost jobs. But the sum, 150 million rand ($11 million) over three years, is modest. It declined to answer questions and is in a standoff with the mines over black ownership requirements that show the political sensitivity of an industry accounting for up to 60 percent of foreign export earnings and roughly 420,000 jobs. HEIGHT AND DEPTH In Chile, the copper industry faces wage talks overshadowed by a long strike at BHP Billiton's Escondida mine, alongside other challenges. At Anglo American's Los Bronces operations in Chile, which announced 140 job cuts last year, the altitude can interfere with remote navigation systems, and the company's Copper CEO Hennie Faul, is focused on systematic improvement of operations using data rather than on the latest drilling equipment. Describing mining as ""the most challenging culture to pull in"" he says dwindling supplies of ore means the industry must adapt fast to catch up with a technological shift it took the car industry decades to enforce. The company says an estimated four tonnes of earth now need to be moved to extract five kilograms of copper, increasing the need for the most efficient techniques. Unexpected outages for maintenance can make a 30 percent difference to productivity and cost. Using systematic analysis to conserve water is also crucial in an arid environment, Faul told Reuters at the CRU World Copper Conference in Santiago. The remote Pilbara region of Australia has already entered the space age as autonomous trucks the size of houses trundle through vast open pits controlled by operators more than 1,000 kilometers away in Perth. Rio says the change has improved productivity and put an end for many to a so-called FIFO (fly-in, fly-out) lifestyle as highly-paid workers were flown in to work the iron ore pits far from their homes. But the next stage - Rio's $518 million autonomous train plan, under development since 2012 - has yet to be fully rolled out because of technical glitches, although Rio says it is confident it can expand use of autonomous trains this year and next.

266,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 06, 2017 02:10AM ET</span>",Iran struggles to expand oil exports as sea storage cleared,"By Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) - Iran has sold all the oil it had stored for years at sea and Tehran is now struggling to keep exports growing as it grapples with production constraints, shipping and oil sources say.
Since the easing of international sanctions in January 2016, Iran tried to make up for lost sales by releasing millions of barrels parked on tankers offshore.
Tanker tracking and oil sources said Iran had sold its last stocks from the floating storage in the past two weeks. Much of the oil stored was condensate, a very light grade of crude.
With no more stocks at sea, Iran has lost a vital resource that had propped up exports. 
""We do think that (floating storage) has been the primary cause of the boost in exports,"" Energy Aspects analyst Richard Mallinson said, adding that now floating storage had ended total exports of crude and condensate were likely to slip.
""We see a very difficult path for Iran to raise crude output until it can get the Western expertise and investment back into the upstream, which has been notably slow to materialize,"" he added.
After Western sanctions were eased, Iran's output jumped from about 2.9 million barrels per day (bpd) to about 3.6 million bpd in June. 
But it has barely risen since - fluctuating between 3.6 million and 3.7 million bpd - even though Iran fought hard with fellow OPEC members to be excluded from production cuts that came into effect on Jan. 1 and will last till June.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pledged to reduce output by about 1.2 million bpd, but Iran was allowed a small increase to compensate for years of isolation. Yet it has produced less in the past three months than it was allowed.
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said last month Tehran was prepared to produce 3.8 million bpd if OPEC agreed to extend cuts to the second half of 2016, effectively signaling there was little hope of a steep rise in Iranian output.
NEED FOR INVESTMENT 
Prior to the lifting of sanctions, Iran stored unsold oil on ships, which peaked in 2015 at 40 million barrels on around 25 tankers. The country has up to 60 oil tankers in its fleet.
Iran's drawdown of floating storage gathered pace in September. By the start of 2017, Iran still held an estimated 16 million barrels of oil on ships. Since then, they have emptied.
While the EU and United Nations lifted sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program more than a year ago, the United States has held separate measures in place and President Donald Trump's administration has promised a tough line.
This has increased concerns among Western banks about offering finance to Iran, slowing energy investment decisions. 
French oil company Total said in February it planned a final investment decision on a $2 billion gas project in Iran by the summer, but said this hinged on a renewal of U.S. sanctions waivers. 
""The uncertainty over the U.S. position on further sanctions is casting a huge shadow on the oil trade with Iran,"" said Paddy Rodgers, chief executive of tanker company Euronav. 
In addition, the oil minister's efforts to secure deals with Western firms has run into internal opposition in Iran, which holds the world's fourth biggest oil reserves. The plans have now been postponed until after a May presidential election.
""Iran needs billions of dollars of investment to boost crude oil production and natural gas capacity,"" said Mehdi Varzi, a former official at state-run National Iranian Oil Company and now an independent consultant.

""Most of the fields were discovered many decades ago and are way beyond their production capacity,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Trading volumes and open interest in U.S. crude futures soared in 2016, particularly among buyers out of Asia and shale companies locking in output, both of whom have shown an affinity for far-dated contracts, the CME Group Inc (O:CME) said on Thursday.
NYMEX light sweet crude oil futures average daily volume hit an all-time high of 1.303 million contracts in November 2016, according to exchange data. 
Demand out of Asia/Pacific was notably stronger, with trading volume rising 93 percent from a year earlier, according to data provided to Reuters by the CME. 
Recently, there has been growing interest in the liquidity of near-term contracts but also further along the futures curve, for contracts that are two and three years forward, the CME said. 
So far in 2017, WTI open interest and volume continue to exceed historic levels. Several WTI crude oil trading records have already been set in 2017, including the current daily open interest record of 2.24 million contracts on March 14. 
""With the lifting of U.S. export ban and greater market efficiencies, WTI has become the leading indicator for price discovery in the global crude oil market,"" the exchange said in a report on Thursday.
U.S. shale production has boomed since 2011, fueled by hydraulic fracturing technology, but production waned during the worst price rout in a generation. 
Shale has since emerged as a resilient rival to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as efficiency improvements have reduced the cost of production. 
Trading volumes skyrocketed and hit records after OPEC and other top producers reached their first joint agreement to limit production since 2001.
U.S. crude has increasingly found its way around the world after the four-decade export ban was lifted in late 2015. Exports reached a record 1.1 million barrels per day in February.
The rising liquidity and rebound in oil prices has also narrowed the spread between the bid and ask prices, according to the report.
""What really matters is the difference between the bid and the ask,"" said Owain Johnson, managing director of energy research and product development at CME Group. 
""The more you can narrow the bid/ask - the cheaper it is for companies to hedge and that makes a huge difference.""

As shale producers increasingly hedged to protect future prices, WTI options activity increased. An average of 182,000 contracts traded per day in 2016, up 16 percent versus 2015.

Some saw the Fed minutes as a bit less hawkish than expected and as uncertainty swirls around President Donald Trump's plans to cut taxes and boost spending as policy makers said the outlook had changed little since January with further strengthening of the labor market and progress towards the inflation target and that rate hikes are likely ahead in line with a forecast for three this year.
But members were split over whether stronger inflation warranted faster hikes now or a more gradual pace given the persistence of low inflation in the past.

Gold futures struggled to hold onto gains before turning negative, after ADP and Moody's Analytics said U.S. private employers added 263,000 jobs for the month. That was well above economists’ expectations of 187,000. The stronger than expected private payrolls report raised expectations for a bullish Labor Department Nonfarm payrolls report expected to be released on Friday.
Meanwhile, a slowdown in the services sector capped selling pressure in the yellow metal, after a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed that non-manufacturing activity slowed more than expected to 55.2 from 57.6 in February.

270,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2017 08:16PM ET</span>",Destructive weed threatens U.S. corn fields,"By Renita D. Young and Tom Polansek
WINTERSET, IOWA (Reuters) - A U.S. government program designed to convert farmland to wildlife habitat has triggered the spread of a fast-growing weed that threatens to strangle crops in America's rural heartland.
The weed is hard to kill and, if left unchecked, destroys as much as 91 percent of corn on infested land, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It is spreading across Iowa, which accounts for nearly a fifth of U.S. corn production and in 2016 exported more than $1 billion of corn and soy.
The federal Conservation Reserve Program pays farmers to remove land from production to improve water quality, prevent soil erosion and protect endangered species.
The destructive weed - Palmer amaranth – has spread through seed sold to farmers in the conservation program, according to Iowa's top weeds scientist, Bob Hartzler, and the conservation group Pheasants Forever.
""We are very confident that some of these seed mixes were contaminated,"" Hartzler said.
Hartzler, an Iowa State University agronomy professor, said one seller was Allendan Seed Company, the state's largest producer of local grass and wildflower seeds for conservation land.
In written responses to questions from Reuters, Allendan said it was ""possible that pigweed seed ... was present in some mixes.""
Palmer amaranth is a type of pigweed. Allendan did not confirm it had found the seed in any of its supplies. It said outside labs that the firm hires to test seed quality had been unable to distinguish Palmer amaranath from other pigweeds.
The company said it started using a new DNA test in February to check its seed for Palmer amaranth.
Many farmers joined the conservation program in the past year as prices for their crops tanked amid a global grains glut. The weed can be killed, but the cost of clearing it would be another hit to the cash-strapped farming community in the United States, the world's top corn supplier.
The program is managed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Farm Service Agency (FSA), units of the USDA. NRCS officials have acknowledged that contaminated seed mixes for conservation land have spread Palmer amaranth.
In another state, Minnesota, authorities are also investigating whether the conservation program inadvertently introduced the weed to that state.
Keith Smith, a corn and soybean farmer in Gladbrook, Iowa, said he yanked Palmer amaranth out of land he set aside in the conservation program after finding the weeds last year.
He doused them in diesel and torched them with old tires.
Smith now regrets joining the program.
""I thought I'd help out the Earth,"" he said.
2016 Conservation Reserve Program - http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-GRAINS-WEEDS/010040ES0YN/index.html
ONE PLANT, HALF A MILLION SEEDS
The NRCS and FSA denied responsibility for the infestation because they do not supply or test the seed that farmers use to turn cropland into a refuge for wildlife. Landowners are responsible for finding their own seed.
None of the companies or organizations involved in the program should be blamed, said Jimmy Bramblett, the NRCS's deputy chief of science and technology. ""It's just something that happened,"" he said.
The NRCS is nonetheless considering giving financial assistance to Iowa farmers to help control the weed and is working with the farming community and other government agencies to control it, Bramblett said.
Palmer amaranth, which is native to the southwestern United States, grows up to 2 inches (5 cm) a day and can reach a height of 10 feet. It produces up to 500,000 seeds the size of a pepper grain, which travel easily on the wind, in manure or stuck to farm equipment and vehicles.
Midwest farmers now face increased costs for the herbicide and labor to eradicate the weed. Fighting Palmer amaranth has doubled or tripled annual herbicide and labor costs to between $60 and $80 per acre for cotton farmers in Georgia, said Stanley Culpepper, a weed science professor for the University of Georgia.
Iowa farmers currently spend between $35 to $40 per acre on herbicides, Iowa State University research shows. If Palmer amaranth is firmly established, costs could increase by up to 50 percent, Hartzler said.
Corn and soybeans can compete better with weeds than cotton plants, so the expense of controlling it could be less than on cotton farms.
DETECTIVE WORK
Palmer amaranth first arrived in Iowa in 2013 but exploded across the state last year, spreading from 5 to 48 of the state's 99 counties, according to Iowa State University.
In at least 35 of those counties, the weed was found on land in the conservation program.
The rapid rise in the incidence of the weed came after landowners in Iowa signed more contracts to put fields into the program than any other state - 108,799 out of the 637,164 total U.S. conservation program contracts, according to the USDA.
An Iowa landowner contacted Iowa State's Hartzler after Palmer amaranth infested 70 acres of farmland he planted with the conservation seed mix.
""The Palmer amaranth was uniformly distributed across those 70 acres, so that was a good sign that it came in the seed,"" Hartzler said.
Hartzler said he and his intern found the tiny black Palmer amaranth seeds in samples they took from seed bags the landowner purchased from Allendan.
He then grew some of the seeds in a greenhouse, he said, and they produced Palmer amaranth.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2017 03:51PM ET</span>",Oil eases off one-month high on surprise U.S. crude build,"By Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled a shade firmer on Wednesday, easing from one-month highs, as support from an outage at the largest UK North Sea oilfield was offset by a surprise increase in U.S. crude inventories to a record high limited price gains.
News of the unplanned outage of the 180,000-barrels-per-day Buzzard field in the North Sea had already began to support prices on Tuesday. Sources said the repairs would take one to two days. 
Prices, however, turned lower briefly on Wednesday after the U.S. government reported a rise in crude inventories of 1.6 million barrels last week. 
Analysts had expected a decrease of 435,000 barrels, and the build reported by the Energy Information Administration came as a double surprise after trade group the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a 1.8 million-barrel draw late on Tuesday. [API/S]
""Yesterday's API report gave the market a bullish head-fake via three chunky draws, hence a build to crude stocks and minor draws to the products is causing a tempering of bullish optimism,"" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData in Louisville, Kentucky.
Brent futures ended the session up 19 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $54.36 a barrel after earlier touching $55.09, last traded on March 8. U.S. crude settled 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, higher at $51.15.
""The crude build caught the market leaning the wrong way. Crude exports dropped to 575,000 bpd this week, versus over 1 million bpd last week,"" said David Thompson, executive vice-president at Powerhouse, a commodities-focused broker in Washington.
""The selling most likely includes a fair number of sell stops being hit.""
Still, there were positives in the data, traders and analysts said.
""Overall we think the data is fairly neutral,"" Standard Chartered said in a note. 
It said total crude and product inventories fell 2 million barrels relative to their five-year average, in the right direction but significantly less than the previous week's 8.3 million barrel draw.
An output cut from Jan. 1 led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries helped lift prices off last year's lows but rising U.S. output and high crude stocks have limited the rally.
Saudi Arabia cut the May official selling prices (OSP) for its light crude oil for Asian customers, in line with expectations, but raised the price for oil sales to the United States. 
OPEC and non-OPEC producers, including Russia, together cut supply by about 1.8 million bpd for six months, and are considering whether to extend the agreement.
The inventory surplus is likely to decline even without a prolonged cut, analysts at JBC Energy said. 
""In the event of OPEC/non-OPEC not extending the cuts into the second half, the world would still continue to draw stocks at a mild pace of about 200,000 bpd until September, thereby lending support to prices one way or another,"" JBC said.

However, a rise in U.S. output is likely to pressure prices, analysts said.

U.S. natural gas  for May delivery touched a daily peak of $3.348 per million British thermal units, the most since January 27. It was last at $3.338 by 9:10AM ET (13:10GMT), up 4.5 cents, or around 1.4%.
Prices of the heating fuel rallied 16.5 cents, or more about 5.3%, on Tuesday, despite there being no bullish weather trends to justify such a move.
Overall, an active spring pattern is expected the next two weeks across most parts of the U.S. with swings in demand between slightly lighter and stronger than normal every few days, according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting forecasts on early-spring demand.
Gas use typically hits a seasonal low with spring's mild temperatures, before warmer weather increases demand for gas-fired electricity generation to power air conditioning.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build of 10 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 31.

280,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2017 05:30AM ET</span>","LNG producers turn to trading, risk taking to maintain market share","By Osamu Tsukimori and Aaron Sheldrick
CHIBA, Japan (Reuters) - Producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) have shot themselves in the foot with oversupply, and face calls for flexibility and greater competition from other fuels that may force them to take more risks and start trading just like other commodity dealers. 
That's a big change for a market long dominated by large producers such as Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and  BP  (L:BP) who provide major importers with fixed volumes under multi-decade contracts linked to the price of oil (LCOc1). 
Under the protection of these lucrative locked-in deals, producers in Australia, Qatar, Russia and elsewhere went on an investment spree that left them with a huge supply overhang when demand in China and India developed more slowly than expected. 
That, together with rising fuel competition from coal and renewables, contributed to a more than 70 percent crash in spot Asian LNG prices  to under $6 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), increasing the pressure to grant more flexible contracts and better pricing options. 
""The LNG market is changing rapidly, (and) the large volume long-term contracts that traditionally underpinned the development of the industry are today much more difficult to obtain,"" said Steve Hill, executive vice president of Shell Eastern Trading, during a gas conference in Japan on Wednesday.
""LNG projects ... need to take more market risks,"" he said. 
In a sign of what might be ahead, Japan's JERA - the biggest single importer of LNG - and France's  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) are set to strike its first deal soon with flexible volumes that are based on Asia LNG spot prices.
JERA's chief fuel transactions officer, Hiroki Sato, confirmed the imminent deal to Reuters on Wednesday in an interview at the Gastech conference.
""There is no price war, but there is clearly competition under way to create a structure that answers the varying buyer needs,"" he said. 
Total did not respond to queries for comment on the deal. 
Another thing about to change is that trading specialists - who buy commodities from producers to sell on to importers at a profit and who have so far played a smaller role in LNG than they do in oil or coal - are jumping into the game. 
""People need to sit in the middle of the chain (to) provide the flexibility and meet the different customer needs,"" said Mike Utsler, chief operations officers for Australia's Woodside Petroleum (AX:WPL).
Preparing to do just that, commodity merchant Trafigura [TRAFG.UL] this week launched a standard master sales and purchase agreement (MSPA) for LNG trade, something already well established in other commodities.
""The industry is moving to a situation where you can't just be a seller or a marketer or a trader,"" said Kerry Anne Shanks, head of gas and LNG Research in Asia at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. ""You need to have middlemen positions."" 
Shanks also noted as an example of changes in the industry how buyers such as JERA are starting to trade gas.
UNLOCKING NEW MARKETS
Woodside, which operates several large LNG export facilities and is developing more, said producers also had to create new markets amid oversupply. 
""There's a big opportunity for much smaller scale demand ... Big, long-term contracts are not necessary in order to supply (such projects),"" Utsler said. 
The thinking is similar at Shell. ""We are trying to unlock new gas markets ... by initiating new small-scale LNG import terminals,"" Hill said. 
Smaller scale demand could come from new importers like Pakistan, which only started using LNG in the last two years, or from new sectors like transportation.
Singapore's Pavilion Energy this week signed a memorandum of understanding with Total to supply the French energy major with LNG used as a ship fuel.
But LNG producers need to keep a watch on competition. Oil still dominates transportation, and cheap coal - seen by many as outdated due to high pollution levels - is still the biggest fuel source for electricity, especially in fast-growing Asia. 
Wind and solar energy are also becoming competitive. 
""Coal won't completely disappear. It will continue to be a competitor and a provider of energy solutions, as will renewables,"" said David Knipe, head of international gas at BP's integrated supply and trading unit. 
Still, the market should not expect producers and suppliers to subject themselves to market whims, competition and geopolitics on large-scale projects, said Elizabeth Spomer, executive vice president at Toronto-listed  Veresen Inc  (TO:VSN) and head of its Jordan Cove LNG project in Oregon. 

""Even the international oil companies that have the big balance sheets are not going to make final investment decisions without long-term take or pay contracts,"" she said, noting that such projects represent billions of dollars of ""price risk"".

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude May contract reached a session peak of $51.49 a barrel, the highest since March 8. It was last at $51.39 by 3:33AM ET (07:33GMT), up 36 cents, or around 0.7%, after rising 79 cents on Tuesday.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for June delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London tacked on 38 cents to $54.55 a barrel. The global benchmark touched its highest since March 8 at $54.66 earlier. It jumped $1.05 in the prior session.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories fell by 1.83 million barrels in the week ended March 31.
The API report also showed a drop of 2.56 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks declined 2.09 million barrels.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report at 10:30AM ET (14:30GMT) Wednesday. If the draw is confirmed, it would be the first decline after two consecutive builds.
Oil has been well-supported in recent sessions amid increasing confidence that output cuts by major global oil producers are beginning to rebalance the market.
OPEC agreed in November last year to curb its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day between January and June. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 barrels per day.
In total, they agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the first six months of the year.
A joint committee of ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will meet in late April to present its recommendation on the fate of the pact. A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for May added 0.7 cents, or 0.4%, to $1.731 a gallon, while May heating oil rose 1.1 cents to $1.604 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for May delivery dipped 1.1 cents to $3.281 per million British thermal units.

Comex gold futures dipped 95 cents, or less than 0.1%, to $1,257.45 a troy ounce by 2:55AM ET (06:55GMT). Meanwhile, spot gold was down 60 cents at $1,255.60.
The yellow metal settled higher for the third session in a row on Tuesday after hitting its strongest since March 27 at $1,263.70.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for May delivery shed 5.0 cents, or about 0.3%, to $18.27 a troy ounce. It reached its highest since March 2 at $18.43 in the prior session.
The Federal Reserve will release minutes of its most recent policy meeting on Wednesday at 2:00PM ET (18:00GMT). The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points following its meeting on March 15 and stuck to its projection for two more hikes this year.
Besides the Fed minutes, Wednesday' calendar also features the ADP private sector nonfarm payrolls report and the ISM non-manufacturing survey.
Market experts do not expect the Fed to raise interest rates again until June, especially in light of recent softening data.
Futures traders are pricing in around a 55% chance of a hike at the Fed's June meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Odds of a September increase was seen at about 77%.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
Meanwhile, market players are awaiting President Donald Trump's first meeting with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday and Friday.
Last week, Trump tweeted that the meeting, which is expected to cover differences over trade and North Korea, ""will be a very difficult one.""
North Korea fired a ballistic missile early on Wednesday from its east coast into the sea off the Peninsula, South Korea's military said, ahead of the Trump-Xi summit.
The U.S. dollar index was little changed at 100.41 in London morning trade, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield held steady at 2.35%.
Elsewhere in metals trading, platinum tacked on 0.3% to $967.10, while palladium firmed at $806.65 an ounce.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2017 02:12AM ET</span>",Chevron pivots to Permian shale as mega-project era fades,"By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Nearly a century after  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) amassed the No. 2 stake in America's largest oilfield, Chief Executive John Watson is hitting the accelerator on developing the company's vast Permian Basin holdings.
In an interview, Watson made clear his desire to put the West Texas to New Mexico expanse in the ranks of Chevron's biggest ventures. That is a stark change from just five years ago, when Chevron executives rarely mentioned the shale basin.
But with low oil prices, the company is now spending more than it makes to cover its prized dividend and find new reserves. Now, those 2 million Permian acres have emerged as to way to help fund both goals.
""Some of the best things we have in our portfolio are the shales,"" Watson said during an interview on the 48th floor of the company's Houston office tower. ""My employees in the Permian know I'm featuring it as something very important.""
Gone, for the next few years at least, are plans for any new multi-billion-dollar mega-projects, he said. To survive and grow, San Ramon, California-based Chevron is turning to acreage it has always controlled and that largely is free of royalties to landowners.
""We're just in a period now where markets are weak and everyone is focused on controlling costs,"" Watson said. 
Within a decade, Watson expects Chevron's production in the Permian to grow eightfold to more than 700,000 barrels of oil per day. By the end of next year, nine drilling rigs will join the 11 that Chevron already has poking holes into Permian land.
It is all part of Watson's plan to methodically pump Chevron's more than 9 billion barrels of Permian oil, most of it owned outright by the company. That gives Chevron a cost advantage over rival Permian producers as the region in the past year has become the epicenter for the U.S. shale resurgence.
Chevron's Permian portfolio, which was acquired in stages by predecessor companies, is worth at least $43 billion, Chevron believes, greater than the market value of Pioneer Natural Resources Co, Concho Resources and other Texas producers.
Watson bristles at critics who say the company is moving too slowly in the Permian. ""We're growing our portfolio in the Permian as fast as anyone,"" said Watson, an economist by training who has worked at Chevron his entire career.
""We're focused on growing value and growing the dividend over time.""
Chevron is valued more highly by investors than rival  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) partly because of that dividend, which has risen annually for the past 29 years. Watson has called protecting the $1.08 quarterly payout his top priority.
""We like inexpensive, recurring revenue streams"" such as the Permian, said Oliver Pursche of wealth manager Bruderman Brothers LLC, which holds shares in the company. 
Chevron, which does not hedge oil production, is boosting spending in the Permian by 67 percent this year to $2.5 billion, an implicit bet that oil prices will rise and lift the company to a profitable year after an annual loss in 2016.
That makes the Permian the second-largest area for spending this year for Chevron after the Tengiz project in Kazakhstan, which is not expect to come online until next decade. 
CARBON TAX WOULD ADD COST
Watson said he is not worried about demand for oil hitting a ceiling for at least the next 20 years, despite the rising popularity of electric cars. Rising petroleum needs for air travel and petrochemical production should buffer any drop in demand from the automobile sector, he said. 
""There is no sign of peak demand right now,"" Watson said.
Like Exxon,  BP  (LON:BP) and other oil peers, Chevron supports the Paris climate accord, a 2015 agreement between nearly 200 nations that aims to limit the rise in global temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).
""We have said that Paris is a first step, but we need to understand what that translates to in terms of policy,"" Watson said. 
Watson, however, has spoken out against a tax on carbon, something that Exxon supports.
President Donald Trump had considered a carbon tax as part of his proposed budget, but the White House on Tuesday said it was not under consideration. It could still be resurrected by Congress, where it has some support.
""A carbon tax will have the effect of adding cost on the people who can least afford it,"" Watson said. ""If you increase energy costs you are going to make it more difficult here for industrial activity.""
Watson said he is not opposed to renewable energy, just government financial support for it through subsidies and other means. He said he would be open to buying a Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) or another electric vehicle.

""I have no particular aversion"" to electric cars, he said. ""I'll buy a car that meets all my needs, particularly around size and other characteristics.""

""Considering movements towards a strategic partnership, we have nothing concrete with Exxon, but they have certainly expressed strong interest in the Brazilian pre-salt exploration,"" Parente told reporters.
Earlier on Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Exxon was in talks to gain access to Brazil's deep-water oil resources, citing people familiar with the matter.
Petroleo Brasileiro Sa Petrobras, familiarly known as Petrobras, and Exxon initially declined to comment on the report, but later Parente briefly spoke about it on his way out of a seminar in Sao Paulo.
Exxon is one of the few major oil companies still with no presence in the exploration of the recently discovered large fields off the coast of Brazil.
Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) sharply increased its operations in the area after acquiring BG Group last year. French oil major  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) did the same recently by closing a strategic partnership with Petrobras.
Norway's  Statoil  ASA (OL:STL) has also bought stakes in the oil region. 
Petrobras is looking for partners for some of its projects.

288,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2017 06:40PM ET</span>",U.S. coal companies ask Trump to stick with Paris climate deal,"By Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some big American coal companies have advised President Donald Trump's administration to break his promise to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement – arguing that the accord could provide their best forum for protecting their global interests.
Remaining in the global deal to combat climate change will give U.S. negotiators a chance to advocate for coal in the future of the global energy mix, coal companies like Cloud Peak Energy Inc and Peabody Energy Corp told White House officials over the past few weeks, according to executives and a U.S. official familiar with the discussions.
""The future is foreign markets, so the last thing you want to do if you are a coal company is to give up a U.S. seat in the international climate discussions and let the Europeans control the agenda,"" said the official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.
""They can’t afford for the most powerful advocate for fossil fuels to be away from the table,"" the official said.
Cloud Peak and Peabody officials confirmed the discussions.
In Cloud Peak's view, staying in the agreement and trying to encourage ""a more balanced, reasonable and appropriate path forward"" on fossil fuel technologies among signatories to the accord seems like a reasonable stance, said Cloud Peak's vice president of government affairs, Richard Reavey.
The coal industry was interested in ensuring that the Paris deal provides a role for low-emission coal-fired power plants and financial support for carbon capture and storage technology, the officials said. They also want the pact to protect multilateral funding for international coal projects through bodies like the World Bank.
The Paris accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, would seek to limit global warming by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from burning fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 percent and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.
During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump vowed to pull the United States out of the pact, tapping into a well of concern among his fellow Republicans that the United States' energy habits would be policed by the United Nations.
But since being elected, he has been mostly quiet on the issue, and administration officials have recently been asking energy companies for advice.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer said last week that the administration expected to make a decision on whether to remain a party to the deal by the time leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy nations meet in late May.
The prospect of the United States remaining in the Paris deal has irritated some smaller miners, including Murray Energy Corp, whose chief executive, Robert Murray helped fund Trump’s presidential bid.

Staying in the Paris accord could also face resistance from within Trump’s party. Republican Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota has been circulating a letter among Republican lawmakers calling on the president to stay in the deal but has gathered only seven signatures so far.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices on Tuesday rose to a near one-month high, supported by an unplanned production outage in the North Sea and expectations of a drawdown in U.S. crude and product inventories.
Brent (LCOc1) futures rose $1.05, or 2 percent to settle at $54.17 a barrel. The move higher came after the global benchmark broke above its 100-day moving average, a key resistance level, putting the contract into technically overbought territory for the first time since the end of December.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1), meanwhile, gained 79 cents, or 1.6 percent, to settle at $51.03 per barrel.
Both contracts ended the day at their highest levels since March 7. They hit four-month lows late last month but have recovered 9 percent since then on expectations the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers would cut output under an agreement reached last year.
""OPEC compliance is still holding better than we expected with next week's release of various monthly agency reports likely to confirm,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note.
In the North Sea, production of crude oil from Britain's 180,000 barrel per day Buzzard field was temporarily halted while repair work is carried out at an onshore processing terminal, trading sources said, noting normal output should be restored in the coming day or two.
Demand, meanwhile, is picking up in key markets, including the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer. Analysts forecast that data will show U.S. crude stocks declined last week after rising for two consecutive weeks. A decline in refined product inventories was also expected, a Reuters survey showed.

The American Petroleum Institute will report inventory data at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT) on Tuesday, while the U.S. Energy Information Administration will announce official figures on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT. [API/S]
""U.S. product stocks need to be watched closely, since they have fallen massively over the last few weeks,"" said Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
Yet global inventories remain high. UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said OPEC was taking longer than expected to tighten the oil market but recent data suggested the process was now well under way.
""We believe the implemented production cuts will trigger a material drawdown in OECD oil inventories and thus higher crude oil prices,"" Staunovo said, referring to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
""We expect Brent oil prices to rise above $60 a barrel in three months,"" Staunovo said.

U.S. light crude may drop to $49.62 as it failed to break resistance at $50.95, said Reuters commodities markets technical analyst Wang Tao. Brent crude may retrace back to $52.79 per barrel, he said. [TECH/C]

As the calendar draws closer towards the summer months in the U.S., demand for gasoline edges higher because of the advent of the ‘summer driving season’.
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) says that gasoline demand is typically about a million barrels per day higher at its summer peak than at its low point for the year, which is generally in January.
Yet, the level of global supply in the industry, remained a concern, as a ramp up in production by non-OPEC members such as the U.S. has poured cold water on OPEC’s efforts to drain the glut in supply, which has pressured prices over the last two years.
In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) but non-OPEC members compliance with the deal has lagged behind that of their OPEC counterparts."

A strong spring storm with heavy showers and thunderstorms will track across the southern and east-central U.S. and then across the Northeast in the first half of the coming week, according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
However, there will be limited cold air associated with it and will result in slightly lighter than normal overall demand for the fuel, when considering much of the rest of the country will be mild to warm.
A colder storm will then track across the south-central and eastern U.S. later in the week, which should boost demand back above normal levels.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting forecasts on early-spring demand.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.

Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (20:30GMT) later on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of 0.5 million barrels.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude May contract tacked on 32 cents, or around 0.6%, to $50.55 a barrel by 8:05AM ET (12:05GMT), after falling to an overnight low of $49.88. The U.S. benchmark lost 36 cents on Monday.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for June delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London added 37 cents to $53.49 a barrel. The global benchmark declined 41 cents a day earlier.
Crude spent most of the overnight session in negative territory as a rebound in Libyan crude production and an ongoing increase in U.S. shale drilling activity exacerbated concerns about a glut.
Libya announced the production resumption at the Sharara field, the country's largest, after a one-week shutdown. The field was producing around 220,000 barrels per day prior to the March 27 closure.
Meanwhile, U.S. drillers last week added rigs for an 11th week in a row, data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed on Friday, extending a 10-month drilling recovery.
That brought the total count to 662, the most since September 2015, underlining concern that an ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC agreed in November last year to curb its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day between January and June. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 barrels per day.
In total, they agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the first six months of the year, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.

297,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 04, 2017 08:01AM ET</span>","Brazil's black market pipeline: Gangs hijack Petrobras' oil, fuel","By Rodrigo Viga Gaier
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - In September, police investigating a wave of killings in the northern Rio de Janeiro suburbs followed a tip to the isolated scrubland near the massive Duque de Caxias oil refinery.
Police presumed the killings were linked to turf battles between criminal gangs in the run-up to municipal elections the following month.
They found a different explanation buried beneath the grass: a system of tubes to siphon fuel from underground pipelines leading from the refinery, owned by state-run oil company Petrobras (SA:PETR4).
Some of the killings, police said, were part of a power struggle between rival gangs earnings millions of dollars a year from stealing crude oil, diesel and gasoline and selling it on a thriving black market.
The discovery highlighted a fast-growing criminal enterprise in Brazil's oil heartland, between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. From just one recorded incident in 2014, the number of thefts and attempted thefts from Petrobras rose to 14 in 2015 - before jumping five-fold to 73 last year, the company told Reuters.
The racket is part of a larger crime wave in Brazil, and especially Rio, amid the country's worst recession on record. 
Investigators believe the oil and fuel thefts were masterminded by the city's powerful militias - often made up of retired or off-duty cops - as they seek to move away from terror and violence to lower-profile crimes following a crackdown by authorities in recent years. 
The thieves' methods range from hijacking tanker trucks to tapping the company's more than 11,000 kilometers of pipelines - and processing stolen crude at their own secret refineries.
""Not even Petrobras knows exactly how much is being stolen,"" said Giniton Lages, the Rio police chief who led the investigation at Duque de Caxias. ""It's a huge business, moving millions of reais.""
INSIDE JOB
While oil theft - often with environmental damage from the accompanying spills - is commonplace in regions like the Niger Delta of Nigeria, it has not traditionally been a problem in Brazil.
The thefts add to the steep challenges facing Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the Rio-based firm is formally known. Amid weak oil prices, the company is scaling back under new CEO Pedro Parente and trying to emerge from a $100 million pile of debt. 
For the past three years, the state-run company has been hit by a sprawling investigation into corruption and political kickbacks in its dealings with construction firms.
Police suspect corruption in the oil thefts as well. The taps and pipes near the Duque de Caxias refinery were so precisely engineered that investigators concluded the thieves must have had help from inside Petrobras.
""They knew what type of fuel was inside each pipe and what was the ideal point to place a tap without the change of pressure in the tube raising the attention of the company's security system,"" Lages said.
Petrobras, whose production of about 2.8 million barrels a day makes it one of the world's top 10 oil companies, said it was working with police to identify any employees or ex-employees that may have been involved in the crimes.
""In 2016, there was a startling increase in theft from our pipelines,"" said Rodrigo Spagnolo, head of pipeline maintenance at Transpetro, Petrobras' transport subsidiary.
The company, however, said the robberies had no material impact on its earnings. Petrobras reported revenues of $81 billion last year.
RUTHLESS GANGS 
The militias in Rio de Janeiro emerged to combat drug gangs in the city's violent hillside favelas. But they evolved into criminal organizations preying on those impoverished communities, controlling everything from real estate and electricity to cable TV. Some of the leaders entered local politics.
In the wake of high-profile killings at the end of the last decade - prompting a government crackdown - the militia have maintained a lower profile, said Ignacio Cano, a professor at the state university of Rio de Janeiro and a member of its Laboratory for the Analysis of Violence.
""Stealing fuel was not typically a crime associated with militia, but they must see an opportunity for making millions,"" he said. ""It's unusual for them to operate outside the territory they control.""
Most oil and fuel thefts reported by Petrobras in 2016 took place on the populous Sao Paulo-Rio de Janeiro axis, which groups five of the company’s biggest refineries.
In Rio de Janeiro, thefts tripled last year to 33. Five of the incidents caused oil spills, Petrobras said.
Police arrested 13 people for the Duque de Caxias refinery scam, including two military police officers. A judge has issued warrants for 26 others.
The gang, set up in June 2015, stole 14 million liters (3.6 million gallons) of fuel last year, worth an estimated 33 million reais ($11 million), prosecutors said.
Police believe the Rio branch of the gang was headed by Caxias Denilson Silva Pessanha, a former city councillor in Duque de Caxias and the owner of illegal gasoline stations. Such service stations, operating without a license or a distribution contract with a fuel supplier, have become more common in Brazilian cities in recent years. 
Pessanha, a fugitive, is wanted for torture and attempted homicide. Reuters attempts to locate an attorney for him were not successful. 
Transpetro said it was investing in more security, but Rio de Janeiro police say the company remains an easy target.
""The company's security officials who we have spoken to admit there is little they can do,"" Lages said. ""This involves armed gangs, and private security can do little about it because they are afraid."" 
A SECRET REFINERY
While Brazil's high unemployment and deep recession could be driving the thefts, Lages said, another motivation is the low risk of capture and punishment.
Convictions are unlikely to result in imprisonment because Brazil's jails are chronically overcrowded.
""You might get a bit of community service time, so this is profitable and not much trouble,"" Lages said. 
Police are trying to classify the robberies as environmental crimes, which can carry up to five years in prison in cases where the pollution threatens humans or animals.
The 13 people arrested in the Duque de Caxias refinery thefts were charged with forming a criminal enterprise, which also carries stiffer penalties.
The scale of the crime has surprised police. At the end of last year, they uncovered a secret refinery in Boituva, Sao Paulo state, one of the installations used to process stolen crude.
Video images show a large complex, with four giant storage tanks surrounded by a complex mesh of pipes, and a vast forecourt filled with unmarked tanker trucks.
""The gang was stealing oil from Petrobras' pipelines in Rio de Janeiro, filling trucks and taking it to these secret refineries,"" said Sao Paulo police chief Emerson Martins.
The fuel would then be sold to illegal service stations and to small-scale vendors in rural towns or city slums, police say.
The criminals sometimes use water trucks to transport the stolen cargo without drawing suspicion. In reaction, Brazil's Federal Highway Police have increased roadblocks on highways between Rio and Sao Paulo.
""The militia has rushed headfirst into this business,"" said Jose Helio Macedo, a spokesman for the police agency. ""We are trying to curb it.""

303,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2017 06:20PM ET</span>",Brazil government says March beef exports near normal despite meat scandal,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian fresh beef exports fell 2 percent in March from a year ago, according to Trade Ministry data, although a government official said the drop was not due to a scandal last month involving alleged corruption by sanitation inspectors.
Brazilian beef exports totaled $404 million last month, the ministry said in a statement on Monday. Pork exports jumped 39 percent to $138 million while chicken exports rose 12 percent to $571 million.
Export prices rose for all three types of meat between 10 percent and 44 percent on an annual basis, helping to compensate an overall fall in shipment volumes in March, according to ministry data.
The steepest volume drop was for beef, which slumped 11.3 percent to 98,200 tons last month in annual terms. Chicken volumes fell 6.8 percent and pork was down 3.35 percent.
Police have accused more than 100 people, mostly inspectors, of taking bribes in exchange for allowing the sale of rancid products, falsifying export documents or failing to inspect meatpacking plants.
The data indicate the continuing investigation of Brazilian food inspectors, which sparked a series of temporary import bans against meat products from Brazil, did not disrupt exports as severely as initially feared.
The ministry official said after ""a brief scare"" in the fourth week of March, when there was a drop in average daily meat exports, shipments have normalized, adding that Brazil sold meat products to 137 countries last month.
""The government acted fast and the markets remained open,"" Herlon Brandão, director of export statistics at the ministry, told reporters after figures were released.
The drop in exported beef volumes is a continuing trend as countries such as Egypt stopped importing from Brazil for reasons unrelated to the scandal, he said.
On March 17, an investigation of government sanitation authorities that also implicated meat-packers such as BRF SA (SA:BRFS3) and JBS SA (SA:JBSS3), prompted large buyers such as China and Hong Kong to ban Brazil's meat products temporarily.
JBS and BRF have denied any wrongdoing.
Last week, a top European Union health official said Brazil needed independent controls over its meat industry, adding that increased European checks on Brazilian meat imports would not be removed soon.
Prosecutors have yet to present charges in the bribery investigation and the police allegations have not been proven.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude May contract fell 16 cents, or around 0.3%, to $50.44 a barrel by 10:15AM ET (14:15GMT). It touched its highest since March 8 at $50.85 in the prior session.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for June delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 15 cents to $53.38 a barrel. The global benchmark hit $53.77 on Friday, the most since March 9.
Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by 10 last week, the 11th weekly increase in a row.
That brought the total count to 662, the most since September 2015, underlining concern that an ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
Oil prices rose around 5% last week, the biggest weekly rise in four months, amid optimism that OPEC will extend its production-cut deal beyond June.
OPEC agreed in November last year to curb its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day between January and June. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 barrels per day.
In total, they agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the first six months of the year, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
A joint committee of ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will meet in late April to present its recommendation on the fate of the pact. A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for May added 0.2 cents, or 0.2%, to $1.706 a gallon, while May heating oil tacked on 0.4 cents to $1.579 a gallon.

U.S. natural gas for May delivery rose to an overnight high of $3.239 per million British thermal units, just shy of Friday's peak of $3.242, a level not seen since early February.
Prices of the heating fuel last traded at $3.148 by 9:40AM ET (13:40GMT), down 4.3 cents, or around 1.4%.
It posted a weekly gain of around 3.7% last week as traders monitored shifting early-spring weather forecasts.
A strong spring storm with heavy showers and thunderstorms will track across the southern and east-central U.S. and then across the Northeast in the first half of the coming week, according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
However, there will be limited cold air associated with it and will result in slightly lighter than normal overall demand for the fuel, when considering much of the rest of the country will be mild to warm.
A colder storm will then track across the south-central and eastern U.S. later in the week, which should boost demand back above normal levels.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting forecasts on early-spring demand.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data  due on Thursday, which is expected to show a build in a range between 7 and 17 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 31.
That compares with a withdrawal of 43 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a gain of 12 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 13 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.049 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 17.1% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 12.2% above the five-year average for this time of year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil futures held steady on Monday as a rebound in Libyan oil production over the weekend weighed against upbeat economic data from Asia that pointed to strong energy demand from the region.
International benchmark Brent futures (LCOc1) climbed 4 cents to $53.57 a barrel by 0952 GMT (5:52 a.m. ET).
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) were 8 cents higher at $50.68 a barrel. 
Libya's Sharara oil field, the country's largest, resumed production on Sunday after a week-long disruption and state-owned NOC lifted force majeure on loadings of Sharara crude on Monday, sources told Reuters.
The field was producing around 80,000 barrels per day (bpd) on Sunday and about 220,000 bpd prior to the March 27 shutdown.
""The main development over the weekend is the restart of Sharara,"" managing director of PetroMatrix Olivier Jakob said. 
Uncertainty about how Libyan output would fare in the months ahead added short-term volatility to oil prices, he said. ""(It) is a swing factor that can make it move both ways if one looks at the balances for the second half of the year."" he added.
Adding to pressure on prices, energy services firm Baker Hughes said the U.S. rig count rose by 10 to 662 last week, making the first quarter the strongest for rig additions since mid-2011 and raising prospects for more U.S. shale oil. [RIG/U] 
Rising supplies tempered data from Asia that suggested the region's buoyant economy would ensure solid demand for energy.
Manufacturing data showed factories across much of Asia posted another month of solid growth in March.
Purchasing managers' index (PMI) data from China showed its factories expanded for a ninth straight month in March, although the pace slipped as new export orders slowed.
""The China PMI figures were pretty positive. They provide background support for oil prices,"" chief market analyst at Sydney's CMC Markets Spooner said.

Oil prices had rallied for three days last week, lifted by reduced Libyan output and helped by expectations that members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other non-OPEC producers such as Russia would extend production cuts beyond June.

315,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: NAmerico unveils natural gas pipeline plan to relieve Permian glut,"By Liz Hampton
HOUSTON (Reuters) - NAmerico Partners LP is proposing a multibillion-dollar pipeline to ferry natural gas from fast-growing fields in West Texas to the Gulf Coast, the company said on Monday, angling to match plans by rivals such as  Kinder Morgan  Inc (N:KMI).
The pipeline, one of at least three being considered to ease a looming gas glut in the Permian producing region, would link to existing lines, including those that export gas to Mexico and to a  Cheniere Energy Inc  (A:LNG) liquefied natural gas export facility under construction.
The pipeline would be the first major project by NAmerico Partners, founded two years ago in Houston. The company is backed by private equity fund Cresta Energy LP, whose management includes former executives from Regency Energy Partners LP, a large energy infrastructure company that was bought by Energy Transfer Partners (N:ETP) in 2015. 
NAmerico Managing Partner Jeff Welch told Reuters in an interview this week that discussions with prospective shippers were at an advanced stage, and the pipeline would begin operations in 2019 if enough of them committed to supplying gas. 
He declined to identify the shippers but said the company was confident the project would proceed.
NAmerico's 468-mile (753-km) pipeline, named the Pecos Trail Pipeline, would transport some 1.85 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to the major Gulf Coast refining and petrochemical hub in Corpus Christi.
Last month, Kinder Morgan, which operates the largest natural gas pipeline network in North America, outlined a plan to build a 430-mile (692-kilometer) pipe traveling a similar route. It would be able to move 1.7 bcf per day of gas.
Enterprise Products Partners (N:EPD), another large pipeline operator, has said it may build a gas line to Corpus Christi, Texas, from the Permian.
""We've got this gigantic gas supply in West Texas, and big exports southbound and eastbound,"" Rick Smead, managing director of advisory services for consultancy RBN Energy, said in a telephone interview.
Kinder Morgan has also said its pipeline would begin operations in 2019 if enough shippers commit.
Analysts said the potential for new supplies could allow multiple projects to proceed.
The projects are being planned as big producers including  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM),  Apache Corp  (N:APA), and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) are expected to pour billions of dollars into drilling in the Permian, a vast shale play in West Texas known for its low production costs and massive reserves. 
Demand for natural gas in south Texas and the Corpus Christi area is expected to soar in the coming years. Cheniere Energy has said it has customers for 8.42 million metric tons a year of LNG from its site, which is expected to begin operations around 2018.
Exxon and Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SE:2010), an arm of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned energy company, also have proposed building a multibillion-dollar chemical and plastics plant outside of Corpus Christi. That plant would use natural gas as a raw material.
Natural gas production in West Texas is expected to more than quadruple by the middle of the next decade, Scott Sheffield, chief executive of  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co (N:PXD), a large Permian producer, said last month.
Gas production in the Permian is projected to reach 7.9 Bcf/d in April, up from 5.4 bcf/d the same month in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The number of drilling rigs operating in the region has more than doubled in the last year to 319 as of March 31, according to energy services provider  Baker Hughes  (N:BHI). 
While companies are primarily drilling in the Permian for crude, natural gas comes up along with it. The EIA estimates each new rig in March added in the Permian increases the field's gas production by 1.1 million cubic feet a day.

OPEC agreed in November last year to curb its output by about 1.2 million bpd between January and June. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 bpd.
In total, they agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million bpd to 32.5 million for the first six months of the year, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
A joint committee of ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will meet in late April to present its recommendation on the fate of the pact. A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
Oil has been under pressure in recent weeks amid concern that an ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production and swelling stockpiles in the U.S. could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by 10 last week, the 11th weekly increase in a row. That brought the total count to 662, the most since September 2015.

321,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2017 06:30PM ET</span>",Venezuela's Maduro wins power over oil despite court reversal,"By Alexandra Ulmer
QUITO, Ecuador (Reuters) - The Venezuelan Supreme Court may have amended part of its explosive decision to take over the opposition-led congress, but it still gives embattled leftist President Nicolas Maduro broad new powers over the OPEC nation's vast oil wealth.
The reversal on Saturday came after political leaders worldwide and street protesters at home accused the pro-government court of effectively making Maduro a dictator. 
While the court backed off its Wednesday decision to fully take over the legislative branch, it left in place sweeping new authority for Maduro to cut oil deals on behalf of PDVSA, the state-run oil company, without congressional approval.
Maduro's cash-strapped government now has the autonomy to sell stakes in Venezuela's oil fields, which contain the world's largest reserves, or launch new joint ventures with foreign firms.
The court action sets the stage for a protracted legal and political fracas that could spook foreign investors and further undermine the nation's efforts to stabilize PDVSA, said opposition lawmakers and industry experts. The state-run firm is already reeling from lower oil prices, a cash-flow crisis and chronic operational problems that have crippled its ability to serve customers worldwide.
The fight centers on a constitutional requirement that the National Assembly approve PDVSA contracts of ""national public interest"" with outside companies. In addition to Maduro's legislative opponents, Venezuela's attorney general - a longtime government ally - has called the court decision to bypass the assembly unconstitutional.
The legislature - which has been controlled by members opposing Maduro's government since late last year - has warned investors that oil deals would be invalid without assembly approval. 
Opposition lawmakers slammed state-run Russian oil major Rosneft (MM:ROSN), for instance, after it paid $500 million last year to increase its stake in the Petromonagas joint venture, to 40 percent from 16.7 percent, without legislative approval. 
Rosneft - a major PDVSA partner at a time when relations between Caracas and Moscow have grown increasingly cozy - said the deal was legal. But the episode underscored the potential legal quagmire for investors. 
Following the court's action on Saturday, opposition leaders vowed to continue challenging the validity of oil deals it has not approved. 
""This is desperation for dollars,"" opposition lawmaker Elias Matta, the vice-president of the congressional energy and oil commission, told Reuters. ""Let it be clear that any company created under this scheme will be null - totally null."" 
Venezuela's Information and Oil Ministries, along with PDVSA, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
NERVOUS INVESTORS
The imbroglio could hamper investments from wary multinational companies, especially those that are subject to stricter regulatory scrutiny at home. 
On Thursday, National Assembly head Julio Borges tore up the Supreme Court order on the steps of the legislature, an image likely to unsettle corporate boardrooms. Other major oil players in Venezuela include U.S. major  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and China's state-owned CNPC. 
Investor uncertainty, in turn, could further undermine Venezuela's ravaged economy, which depends on PDVSA for more than 90 percent of export revenue as millions face food shortages and runaway inflation.
In theory, the court's decision would allow Maduro's government the power to do anything short of privatizing PDVSA without approval of the National Assembly, said Francisco Monaldi, a fellow in Latin America energy policy at the Baker Institute in Houston. 
""But the legal ground could not be shakier if there is a change in government,"" he said. ""As a result of all this international scandal, foreign investors will be less likely to invest.""
$3 BILLION IN BOND PAYMENTS
Firebrand Hugo Chavez, president until he died in 2013, led a wave of oil nationalizations in Venezuela as part of his self-styled ""21st century Socialism."" The policies have left many oil fields less productive and lacking investment. 
National oil output tumbled last year on the back of constant refinery outages, an outflow of talent, and shortages of basic equipment in oil fields and imported diluents needed for blending with Venezuela's heavy crude.
Amid mounting debts, Venezuela has sought to sell stakes in oil fields to bolster its dwindling coffers before a deadline to pay about $3 billion in bond obligations this month, sources say.
On Friday, Venezuelan bonds tanked on worries about the impact of the latest crisis on the country's credit-worthiness.
It is unclear if the initial Supreme Court decision - the one that sparked global outrage - was prompted by an imminent plan to sell an oil field stake or create a new oil venture. 
Reuters reported in March that PDVSA was negotiating a business deal with Rosneft and had offered the state-led company a stake in the Petropiar joint venture.
The offer has not been confirmed, and it remains unclear if Rosneft, which has become an increasingly key source of financing for PDVSA, is interested. 
PDVSA is also relying on Rosneft to help it meet its looming bond payments, Reuters reported on Friday. It is unclear if the deal will go through or what Rosneft might get in exchange.
Late last year, Venezuela used 49.9 percent of its shares in U.S. subsidiary Citgo as collateral for loan financing from Rosneft. The move enraged opposition politicians who argue a desperate government is mortgaging prized national assets. 

PDVSA and the Oil Ministry have not responded to repeated requests for comment on potential deals with Rosneft. Rosneft has declined to comment.

322,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2017 11:03AM ET</span>","Iraq has pledged to fully comply with oil cut deal, OPEC chief says","By Ahmed Rasheed
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq has assured OPEC it will fully comply with an agreement to cut oil supply in order to bolster crude prices, OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said on Sunday in Baghdad.
Iraq's compliance stands now at 98 percent, the nation's oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi told reporters, after addressing a conference in the Iraqi capital, also attended by Barkindo. 
Compliance with the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC producers at the end of last year to cut supply is ""encouraging,"" Barkindo told the forum.
General compliance with supply cuts by the oil producers was 86 percent in January and 94 percent in February, he added. 
The market is already balancing, Barkindo said, adding stocks of crude were coming down.
Luaibi said he was satisfied with the existing deal, but declined to say whether Iraq would support an extension, leaving it to an OPEC ministerial meeting planned in May.
The current deal, he said, ""contains many positive elements and achieved a lot of targets; work is ongoing to reach the reduction of 1.8"" million barrels per day (bpd) agreed by OPEC and 11 other nations including Russia for their combined production in the first half of 2017.
The accord has lifted crude to about $50 a barrel. But the price gain has also encouraged U.S. shale oil producers, which are not part of the pact, to boost output. 
While Iraq is committed to achieving 100 percent of its target reduction, it will proceed with projects to boost oil production capacity to 5 million barrels per day before the end of the year, Luaibi said.
OPEC's second-largest producer, after Saudi Arabia, Iraq will proceed in parallel with exploration plans to increase its reserves by 15 billion barrels in 2018, to reach 178 billion barrels, he said.
Among the plans to increase output capacity from existing fields is a sea water injection plan which is in process of being tendered, he added.
Iraq's oil production has averaged 4.464 million barrels per day (bpd) so far in March, a reduction of more than 300,000 bpd on levels before OPEC cuts were implemented from Jan. 1, state-oil marketer SOMO said on Thursday.
Average crude exports were 3.756 million bpd in March, versus a record of more than 4 million bpd in November, according to SOMO.
Most of Iraq's crude is exported from southern ports, the region where it is produced. Exports from the south averaged 3.2 million bpd in March, Luaibi said. 
Barkindo described as ""very constructive"" meetings he had on Saturday with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and other Iraqi leaders in Baghdad.

Iraq's natural gas output will triple to 1,700 million cubic feet per day (cfd) by 2018, as it implements projects to reduce flaring, Luaibi told the conference.

Gold prices recovered from a dip earlier in the session, as the dollar slumped to lows, after the latest batch of economic data revealed a slowdown in personal spending and consumer sentiment.

The Commerce Department said on Friday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.1% against expectations of a 0.2% increase.
Gold is on track for its best quarterly performance in a year, the yellow metal has benefited from a flight to safety in recent months, as investors sought refuge in the yellow metal amid uncertainty over the outcome of European election and growing concerns that President Trump’s promised economic stimulus package may be delayed.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's largest crude oil buyer Sinopec aims to ship more cargoes from Brazil, the United States and Canada, to help ensure stable crude supplies as the Middle East boosts refining capacity and Africa suffers disruptions.
Shipments from the Americas hit an all-time high in March, boosting the region's share of the Chinese market by 1.1 percentage points in the first quarter to close to 14 percent, data from Thomson Reuters Oil Research & Forecasts showed.
""We're facing a big challenge on the supply side,"" said Chen Bo, president at Unipec, which purchases crude for Asia's largest refiner Sinopec (HK:0386) (SS:600028).
Asia needed to step up crude imports from the ""new frontier"", the greater U.S. Gulf Coast region made up of the United States, Canada and Latin America, to meet its growing demand, he told a seminar this week.
China is on track to overtake the United States as the world's largest oil consumer this year, Chen added.
China will add just under 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity between 2016 and 2020, taking its total capacity to nearly 12.5 million bpd by the end of this decade.
Also, by end-2018, the total crude import quota for independent refineries will grow to 2 million bpd, about 500,000 bpd more than March 2017 as government approvals flow through, he said.
SUPPLY DIVERSITY
Asia, which will account for a third of the world's refining capacity by 2020, will have to look beyond traditional markets Middle East and Africa for crude supplies, Chen said.
Security of supply and the optimization of supply were vital for Unipec.
""If every consumer goes to the Middle East and Africa we don't know what will happen to the market. So we have to diversify,"" he said.
China's crude imports from the Americas, led by Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia, hit 5.61 million tonnes (1.3 million bpd) in March, the highest in Reuters' data going back to 2006.
In the same month, China's crude oil deficit came in at a hefty 15 million tonnes, after touching a record 19 million in December 2016, as domestic production shrank while imports surged, customs data showed.
""Record imports are being driven by falling production, higher refinery runs, huge infrastructure and Strategic Petroleum Reserve builds,"" said Virendra Chauhan of consultancy Energy Aspects. The agency expects Asia's crude imports, led by China, to rise by 900,000 bpd on the year in 2017.
A preference for low-sulphur oil produced in the Americas by China's private refineries, or so-called ""teapots"", helped boost imports from the region, while increasing U.S. shale output and production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have made it economical for traders to send huge volumes of crude from west to east.
Next month, China will import its first Southern Green Canyon and Thunderhorse crude from the United States.
Brazil overtook Venezuela as the top South American crude supplier to China in the first two months of this year due to its favored medium-heavy quality grades, while China became the No. 3 destination for U.S. crude exports in 2016. [O/CHINA1]

The Americas has the potential to become a ""global trading hub"" in the next decade, Chen said.

The April contract ended Thursday’s session 0.69% lower at $1,245.00 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,226.40, the low of March 21 and resistance at $1,253,60, Thursday’s high.
The greenback remained underpinned by a flurry of strong U.S. data this week, including Thursday’s reports on fourth quarter gross domestic product and initial jobless claims.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 100.36, just off a two-and-a-half week high of 100.47 hit overnight.
A strong U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
But investors remained cautious as U.S. President Trump was scheduled later Friday to sign executive orders aimed at identifying abuses that are causing massive U.S. trade deficits and clamping down on non-payment of anti-dumping and anti subsidy duties on imports.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross specified that one of the orders directs a major review of the causes of U.S. trade deficits, including ""currency misalignment.""

China's semi-official manufacturing PMI rose to 51.8, the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing (CFLP) said Friday, beating the expected 51.6 level and releasing the figures one day ahead of the normal first of the month release and ahead of the Caixin PMI figures.
Earlier in Japan, household spending for February slumped 3.8% year-on-year, compared to a 1.7% decline seen. On a monthly basis however it rose 2.5%, beating the expected 0.4% rise.
Separately, national core CPI fell 0.2% for February year-on-year as expected, while unemployment dipped to 2.8% from 3.0%. Provisional industrial production for February rose 2.0% month-on-month, beating the expected 1.2% increase.
The dollar rose to a nine-day high against a basket of currencies on Thursday, easing slightly to around 100.40 on Friday in Asia. Gold is priced in greenbacks, making it potentially more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Overnight, gold prices traded lower on Thursday, as a push in the dollar weighed on the yellow metal, after the release of upbeat economic data and continued rate hike chatter from several Fed officials.
Gold prices fell to session lows, and on track to end the week in negative, after the dollar swooped to a nine-day high, buoyed by an upward revision in GDP data and hawkish comments from several Fed officials.
The Commerce Department earlier reported that U.S. gross domestic product grew faster than previously reported in the fourth quarter.
Cleveland Federal Reserve reiterated her hawkish view concerning interest rate hikes Thursday, as she said that “further removal of accommodation via increases in the fed funds rate will be needed” should economic conditions “evolve as anticipated”.
Fed President John Williams, tapered some of his bullish rhetoric on the U.S. economy, after he said even though the economy shows “consistent” and “encouraging” signs, “housing still isn’t quite back”.
Economic uncertainty in Europe, as the date of the French presidential election draws closer and the start of Britain’s departure from the European Union, have largely offset the negative impact a stronger greenback has on dollar denominated assets such as gold.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped for a third day on Thursday to their highest in three weeks after Kuwait backed an extension of OPEC production cuts to reduce a global glut.
Kuwait oil minister Essam al-Marzouq said his country was among several nations supporting the extension of a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters to limit output, state news agency KUNA reported.
Brent crude oil (LCOc1) settled up 54 cents, or about 1 percent, to $52.96 a barrel after hitting $53.10. U.S. crude (CLc1) settled up 84 cents, or 1.7 percent, higher at $50.35 a barrel, after touching $50.47. 
Both benchmarks reached their highest levels since March 9. In recent weeks, higher-than-expected inventory figures had prompted speculators to unwind long positions. 
""There is a significant chance that a short-to-medium-term bottom has been found,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
Yet concerns about the glut linger as OPEC grapples to tighten the oil market because inventories in many parts of the world are at, or near record highs and U.S. production has been rising.[EIA/S]
OPEC agreed to reduce oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day during the first six months of the year. Output has fallen for a third straight month and members have complied with 95 percent of their commitments. [OPEC/O]
""I see no sign from OPEC and Saudi Arabia that they will not roll over the cut into the second half of the year ... the market is about to go from supply surplus to deficit on crude "" said Scott Shelton, energy futures broker with ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Durham, North Carolina.
Other oil exporters outside OPEC, including Russia, have also gradually reined in production. 
Russia has reduced its output by 200,000 bpd in March in accordance with the agreement, the ministry quoted Energy Minister Alexander Novak as saying in a TV interview. 
Libya said production dropped by about a third or 250,000 bpd earlier this week due to armed protesters blocking western oilfields of Sharara and Wafa. 

The start-up of a 500,000 bpd crude pipeline in North Dakota next month, despite opposition by environmental groups and Native Americans, is expected to hasten a revival in output from the Bakken region which fell sharply along with global oil prices during the past two years.

The determinations of dumping, or selling a product below its fair price, apply to imports of CTL plate from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, Ross said.
In addition, there was a final finding that South Korean imports were subsidized, leading to a countervailing duty of 4.31 percent being slapped on those products, he said at a department event.
""A healthy steel industry is critical to our economy and manufacturing base, yet our steel industry today is under assault from foreign producers that dump and subsidize their exports,"" Ross told the audience.
In 2015, imports of CTL plate from the seven producers totaled $732 million, with those from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea and Taiwan valued at an estimated $14.2 million, $19.8 million, $179 million, $196.2 million, $37 million, $54.9 million, $210 million and $21 million, respectively, department figures show. Cut-to-length steel is used in a wide range of applications, including buildings and bridgework; agricultural, construction and mining equipment; machine parts and tooling; ships, rail cars, tankers and barges; and large-diameter pipe. The finding followed an investigation prompted by a petition from  Nucor  Corp (NYSE:NUE) and U.S. subsidiaries of ArcelorMittal SA and SSAB AB. For Austrian producers and exporters, dumping duties on the Voestalpine group and all others were set at 53.72 percent. They were 5.4 percent for Industeel Belgium, 51.78 percent for the NLMK Belgium group and 5.4 percent for all other Belgium producers and exporters. Among French manufacturers and exporters, duty rates were set at 148.02 percent for Industeel France and 8.62 percent for Dillinger France and all others. In Germany, duties were set at 5.38 percent for AG der Dillinger Hüttenwerke, 22.90 percent for the Salzgitter group and 21.03 percent for all other exporters and producers. In Italy, the department set anti-dumping duty rates of 6.08 percent for Officine Tecnosider, 22.19 percent for Marcegaglia SpA and NLMK Verona SpA and 6.08 percent for all other producers and exporters. Among Japanese producers and exporters, Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Co Ltd was hit with a duty rate of 14.79 percent. A rate of 48.67 percent was imposed on JFE Steel Corp and Shimabun Corp, and for all others it was set at 14.79 percent. Taiwanese companies Shang Chen Steel Co Ltd and China Steel Corp had anti-dumping duties of 3.62 percent and 6.95 percent, respectively, imposed on them. The rate for other producers and exporters was set at 5.29 percent. For South Korea, the department imposed an anti-dumping duty of 7.39 percent on POSCO, as well as a countervailing duty of 4.31 percent to account for subsidies. The same rates apply to all other producers and exporters. The findings allow the department to ask U.S. Customs authorities to collect cash deposits from exporters based on these rates. 
On March 3, in a decision stemming from the same investigation, the U.S. International Trade Commission said it had made a final finding that U.S. industry was being harmed by the dumping and subsidization of imports of carbon and alloy steel CTL plate from China. That allows for the final imposition of duties by the Commerce Department on China's producers and exporters of the plate.

338,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2017 10:54AM ET</span>",North Dakota oil output set to rise as controversial pipeline opens,"By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) - North Dakota oil production will get a shot in the arm next month as a pipeline comes online despite opposition by environmental groups and Native Americans, allowing the energy industry to save at least $540 million in annual shipping costs.
The Dakota Access Pipeline gives the state's producers cheaper access to refineries and other customers on the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
Market players said they expect this will hasten a revival of output from the Bakken region which fell sharply along with global oil prices during the past two years.
""We're back to growth in the Bakken,""  Hess Corp  (N:HES) Chief Executive Officer John Hess said in a recent interview. The New York-based company has contracts to send roughly half its daily North Dakota output through DAPL. For 2017, Hess has said its Bakken production could grow more than 10 percent.
President Donald Trump approved the $3.7 billion pipeline in February, reversing the prior administration which had blocked it last December with a decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
 Energy Transfer Partners LP  (N:ETP), which operates the 1,100 mile (1,770 km) long DAPL, has begun filling the line with crude and could reach full operating capacity by late April, based on industry estimates.
DAPL ""will provide a safer, more environmentally responsible and more cost-effective transportation system to move crude across this country as opposed to truck or rail,"" said ETP spokeswoman Vicki Granado. 
The pipeline will carry about 500,000 barrels of oil per day, more than half of North Dakota's daily output, cutting reliance on riskier rail-cars and reducing transport cost by roughly $3 to $5 per barrel, analysts estimate.
That should help level the playing field between Bakken producers and rivals in other U.S. shale plays, many of which are closer to refineries and other customers.
""Economics for drilling in the Bakken will look better because of DAPL,"" Rusty Braziel of RBN Energy consultants in Houston, said in an interview.
The state's drilling rig count has jumped 40 percent since early February, when Trump gave final approval to the pipeline. By the end of the year, analysts expect the rig count to rise another 10 percent or more. 
DAPL's opponents say they will continue to oppose the line and oil production across North Dakota, which pumps more crude each day than any state but Texas.
""Just because oil flow is pending does not mean that it cannot be stopped by court order, and we have a strong, ongoing case in front of the courts,"" said David Archambault II, chairman of North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which lives adjacent to the line.
OUTLOOK
Transportation savings from DAPL are a key factor oil companies are considering when deciding whether to boost production, executives, analysts and investors said.
Hess plans to triple the number of drilling rigs it operates in North Dakota this year. The company will move the 30 percent of its existing Bakken production from rail to pipeline once DAPL opens.
 Oasis Petroleum  Inc (N:OAS), another large Bakken producer, said its 2017 output could rise more than 30 percent. DAPL ""is definitely going to give us more options to get our product to market,"" Oasis Chief Executive Officer Tommy Nusz said in an interview. 
 Whiting Petroleum Corp  (N:WLL), the state's largest oil producer, does not contract for space on DAPL, nor does  Continental Resources Inc  (N:CLR), the second-largest.
But Continental expects DAPL to ease a transport bottleneck out of the state and open room on other pipelines, allowing it to stop using rail.
Both Whiting and Continental have projected production to rise more than 20 percent this year. The companies did not respond to requests for comment.
North Dakota's oil production fell 13 percent in the last 12 months for which data are available to about 980,000 barrels per day (bpd) due to low prices. While the expected jump in 2017 output likely won't return output to its 2015 peak, it could help statewide production again rise above 1 million barrels per day.
Another reason for rising production is that higher prices have prompted many companies to hedge, or sell forward, some of their output, which bolsters confidence. Whiting and Oasis, for example, have hedged more than half of 2017 production. 
But the state's producers say that DAPL's opening, after months of uncertainty, gives them confidence they can ship their product to market.

""We have to have a more pragmatic approach to infrastructure development in this country,"" said Hess.

Elsewhere, Brent oil for June delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rose 40 cents to $52.92 a barrel, after hitting a high of $52.99 earlier, also the most since March 10.
Crude prices rose to the highest levels of the session following reports saying that Kuwait and other OPEC countries support extending production cuts beyond June to balance the market.
OPEC agreed in November last year to curb its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day between January and June. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 barrels per day.
In total, they agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the first six months of the year, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
A joint committee of ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will meet in late April to present its recommendation on the fate of the pact. A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
Oil has fallen sharply this month amid concern that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that crude oil inventories increased by 867,000 barrels last week to yet another all-time high of 534.0 million.
It was the 12th weekly build in U.S. stockpiles in the past 14 weeks, feeding concerns about a global glut.
The view among many oil traders is that higher U.S. shale output could easily wipe out OPEC’s efforts to remove surplus barrels.

Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.049 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 17.1% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 12.2% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, traders continued to monitor shifting early-spring weather forecasts. Weather systems will track across the country the next several days with rain, snow, and thunderstorms, but with limited cold air as they play out spring-like, according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
There remains potential for a bit colder system from April 7 through the 10th and will be dependent on how a weather system tracking over the southern U.S. phases with a cold blast over the Midwest.

345,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2017 06:00AM ET</span>",Tofu trailblazer: Soymeal leads China charge into commodities derivatives,"By Hallie Gu and Josephine Mason
BEIJING (Reuters) - Soymeal, a chief ingredient in tofu, is set to provide rich nutrition of another kind: China is using the animal feed staple to blaze a trail in commodities derivatives, fueling its appetite for global investment hub status along the way.
On Friday, Dalian Commodities Exchange, one of four futures centers in China, will roll out a soymeal option, the country's first exchange-traded product of its kind in commodities.
The derivatives are designed to make it easier for the likes of traders, pig farmers and the companies who process soybeans into oil and feed to hedge price swing risks. Worth $7 billion, Dalian's soymeal futures are the country's largest agricultural market.
Fifteen years in the making, the soymeal options give holders the right to buy or sell a product at a particular strike price, and will appeal to another group - China's cash-rich speculative investors, who have piled into everything from eggs to iron ore in the past year, disrupting global commodity prices in the process. 
""We have been trading equity options, now we will give a shot at this first commodity option,"" said Mo Qingping, investment director at ESFund Management Co, with more than 2 billion yuan ($290 million) in assets. One of its main shareholders is Shenzhen-listed investment firm GF Securities Co (SZ:000776), worth more than $18 billion by market value.
As the world's second-largest economy has expanded, and with it an appetite for everything from copper to corn, futures trading in China has surged in recent years and now rivals the United States and Europe in volume terms. 
Dalian launched soymeal futures almost 20 years ago, but its foray into more complex instruments demonstrates the growing maturity of its risk management offering as China aims to play a bigger role on the global derivatives market. Beijing regulators are now considering prising open China's long-closed futures markets to foreign investors.
In an emailed statement on Thursday, the Dalian exchange cautioned it does not expect big volumes immediately, due to the complexity of the product. 
Still, the potential is vast.
More than 17.5 million lots of Dalian soymeal futures, equivalent to 175 million tonnes of soymeal, have changed hands so far this month. That's more than three times the size of U.S. annual soymeal output, and on a par with Brent crude oil futures turnover, arguably the highest-profile futures contract in the world.

With 85 percent of beans crushed in China brought in from abroad, it makes sense for the feed and meat industry to want additional protection against price volatility, said JY Chow, food and agriculture expert at Mizuho Bank in Singapore.
""The global grain and meat market will gain in complexity and uncertainty, so it is good that Chinese market becomes more sophisticated - moving in parallel with the maturity of the industry,"" he said. 
Guo Can, who imports soybeans and sells soymeal for a major soybean crusher in eastern Shandong province, has been practicing using the new-fangled hedging product on a simulated trading platform. 
""We aim to get involved, but we will see the trading volume first,"" he said. ""If it's quite active, we will buy in."" 
Friday's launch coincides with the release of the U.S. government's first estimate for grain acreage for the current season, one of the most widely anticipated reports on the agricultural calendar - and one which often roils prices.
This week, Shandong-based Luzheng Futures (HK:1461), one of 10 market makers appointed to ensure liquidity, was making final checks on its trading systems.
Even though he has handled options in other markets for almost a decade, Lin Qihong, investment director at the brokerage's option market maker division, remained cautious on the eve of the Friday launch.
""This is China's first commodities option product after all. We've got to be a bit careful,"" he said.

Brent oil for June delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London held firm at $52.57 a barrel by 4:30AM ET (08:30GMT), after hitting an overnight high of $52.69, the most since March 10. The global benchmark added $1.12 on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude May contract reached a session peak of $49.75 a barrel, also the highest since March 10. It was last at $49.60, up 9 cents, or around 0.2%, after advancing $1.14 in the prior session.
Oil prices continued to draw support from news that Libya's oil output shrank by 252,000 barrels per day as armed factions at the western Libyan oil fields of Sharara and Wafa blocked production.
Optimism that an OPEC-led production cut deal will be extended through the end of the year further supported prices.
OPEC agreed in November last year to curb its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day between January and June. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 barrels per day.
In total, they agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the first six months of the year, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
A joint committee of ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will meet in late April to present its recommendation on the fate of the pact. A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
Oil has fallen sharply this month amid concern that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that crude oil inventories increased by 867,000 barrels last week to yet another all-time high of 534.0 million.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for May held steady at $1.673 a gallon, while May heating oil was little changed at $1.544 a gallon.

San Francisco Fed President Williams speaks at 11AM ET, while Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan speaks at 3PM in New York.
On the data front, investors will have initial jobless claims and the final look at fourth quarter GDP, both released at 8:30AM ET.
The Fed raised interest rates earlier this month and stuck to its outlook for two more hikes this year.
Fed fund futures priced in around a 50% chance of a rate hike in June, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Odds of a September increase was seen at about 70%.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
Headlines from Washington will also be in focus, as traders await further details on President Donald Trump's promises of tax reform following the House's failure to vote on a plan to replace Obamacare last week.

351,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2017 05:04PM ET</span>",EU official urges independent controls over Brazil meat industry,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil needs independent controls over its meat industry, a top EU health official said on Wednesday, as he wrapped up a visit to the country rocked by an anticorruption investigation centering on bribery of its food-sanitation inspectors.
Brazil's police say in court documents bribes were paid to cover up serious health violations by some meat companies, including the sale of rotten and salmonella-contaminated products. Their probe, dubbed ""Operation Weak Flesh,"" led some of Brazil's biggest export markets to ban its meats.
The European Union is among the markets that suspended imports from 21 meat packing plants that are under investigation in Brazil, which is the world's largest beef and poultry exporter. 
EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Vytenis Andriukaitis said in an interview that its restrictions and stepped-up checks on Brazilian meat imports may not be removed anytime soon.
""The situation of meat imports from Brazil will remain under these reinforced checks until Brazil answers our questions and after our forthcoming audit team visits Brazil,"" Andriukaitis told Reuters.
""The situation will be much clearer in a few weeks or months. The main message to Brazil is that this issue is not closed. It is about health and quality,"" he said.
While he said it was not up to the EU to say what inspection system a country should have, Andriukaitis urged Brazil's government to introduce more transparent rules that avoid public-private conflicts of interest.
""The official control system must be independent and not under the influence of politicians and other actors. We must guarantee independence of the Brazilian official control system,"" he said.
Brazil's federal food inspectors currently report to the agriculture ministry and the system has come under fire for having politically appointed supervisors.
Andriukaitis said the EU could announce more measures related to Brazilian imports after its Agriculture Council meets on Monday and Tuesday. He declined to be more specific.
Hours after he spoke, President Michel Temer and Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi announced new rules for the meat processing industry, which they said were stricter and clearer.
The highest fine for food sanitary violations rose dramatically to 500,000 reais ($160,250) from 15,000 reais previously. Maggi said the rule changes would eliminate the need for inspectors to interpret antiquated laws that were 65 years old. 
Brazil's Federal Police have accused more than 100 people, mostly inspectors, of taking bribes in exchange for allowing the sale of rancid meat products, falsifying export documents or failing to inspect meatpacking plants at all.
Prosecutors have yet to present charges and the police allegations have not been proven.
Government officials have sought to downplay the impact of the probe. But an industry group said on Tuesday that beef exports alone fell over 40 percent in terms of both volume and revenue in March 20-26 from the prior week, as a number of countries imposed temporary bans.
The police investigation into irregularities in Brazil's meat industry, one of the few robust sectors in an economy locked in its worst recession on record, was made public on March 17.
Hong Kong on Tuesday removed one of the last blanket bans on Brazilian meat imports after it said it was satisfied by explanations from Brazilian officials. That followed China's removal of its restrictions last weekend. Together, the two Asian nations bought about one-third of Brazil's $14 billion in meat exports last year.
The EU ranks as the No. 2 importer of Brazilian meats, just behind Hong Kong and before China, buying $1.7 billion in frozen and fresh beef, chicken, pork and other meat products last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 2 percent on Wednesday as U.S. crude inventories grew less than expected, supply disruptions continued in Libya and the OPEC-led output cut by producing countries looked likely to be extended.
U.S. crude futures surged to nearly a two-week high after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that crude inventories  rose 867,000 barrels last week, nearly half the build expected, as refineries ramped up processing after seasonal maintenance and as imports dropped and exports rose. [EIA/S] 
And analysts expect further drops in coming weeks.
""Time is beginning to run out for further large crude inventory builds before the usual second-half of April start of seasonal crude draws,"" Standard Chartered said in a note.
""We expect runs to increase by a further 1 million barrels per day until they reach a seasonal peak in July or August, providing strong downward pressure on crude inventories.""
U.S. refinery crude runs  rose 425,000 barrels per day as utilization rates  jumped 1.9 percentage points to 89.3 percent of capacity, the EIA data showed.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) settled $1.09, or 2.1 percent, higher at $52.42 a barrel after hitting a session high of $52.46, the highest since March 16.
U.S. crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures (CLc1) ended up $1.14 cents, or 2.4 percent, at $49.51 a barrel after peaking on the data at $49.54, also the highest since March 16. 
U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) surged as much as 2.4 percent to the highest in three weeks after EIA data showed a 3.7 million-barrel drop in gasoline stocks  last week, nearly 2 million barrels more than forecast.
""The WTI crude bulls are emboldened by the double whammy of another large increase in refinery utilization rates and a big jump in crude oil export levels,"" said David Thompson, executive vice-president at Powerhouse, a commodities-focused broker in Washington. 
U.S. crude exports nearly doubled last week to climb to over 1 million bpd, EIA data showed.
U.S. crude exports surged 12 percent in 2016 to 520,000 barrels per day and China became the third-biggest overseas destination for U.S. crude last year, according to EIA data, up from ninth the previous year.
Still supporting prices was Tuesday's declaration of force majeure by Libya's National Oil Corp after production from the western Libyan fields of Sharara and Wafa was blocked by armed protesters, reducing output by some 250,000 bpd.
OPEC member Libya, whose oil sector suffered from the unrest that followed the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, was excluded from output cuts agreed last year. 
On Tuesday, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major producers were likely to extend their six-month agreement to cut output beyond June.
A Reuters survey indicates output from all 13 OPEC members fell 230,000 bpd in March from February's revised level and indicated members subject to the deal achieved 95 percent compliance. 
However, in the United States, shale oil drillers have seized the opportunity to ramp up output and exports.
""What OPEC has done has improved supply demand balance - there's no doubt about that,"" said Mark Watkins, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank Private Client Group.
""The one wild card in here is that if North American shale producers are the benefactor of OPEC cuts, it makes it much harder to swallow, where you have competitors benefitting at your cost - that's a big issue.""

UBS oil analyst Giovanni Staunovo said in a note he expects Brent to exceed $60 over three months before leveling off in six months to $60 and then retreating to $57 a barrel in 12 months, spurred by rising U.S. shale production and higher OPEC output.

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC oil output is likely to fall for a third straight month in March, a Reuters survey found on Wednesday, as the United Arab Emirates made progress in trimming supplies while maintenance and unrest cut production in exempt nations Nigeria and Libya.
The reduction by the UAE has helped boost OPEC compliance this month with its production-cutting deal to 95 percent, up from an initial February estimate of 94 percent and a record high, according to Reuters surveys.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pledged to reduce output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1 - the first accord on supply curbs since 2008. Non-OPEC countries pledged to cut about half as much.
In comments made to Reuters, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said the OPEC and non-OPEC agreement ""is gradually, but steadily working its way to restore balance to the oil markets"".
""The rebalancing process is already underway,"" he added.
OPEC wants to end a glut that is keeping oil (LCOc1) below $52 a barrel, half the level of mid-2014. But stocks are still high despite strong OPEC compliance, boosting expectations that the group will seek to prolong the agreement.
""OPEC is now facing the prospect of falling short of its objective,"" said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM. ""Bulging global oil stockpiles will not draw down to the five-year average unless OPEC-led cuts are extended.""
Compliance of 95 percent is higher than OPEC achieved in its last cut in 2009, Reuters surveys show. Analysts including those at the International Energy Agency have put adherence in 2017 even higher, with the IEA calling it a record.
March's biggest reduction came from the UAE, which was slower than Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to trim supply. Output is lower this month because more cuts have been implemented and due to planned maintenance, industry sources say.
After limited reductions earlier in 2017, UAE officials and industry sources have said the country would improve average compliance during the six-month duration of the supply cut.
The Reuters survey showed Saudi Arabia's output rose slightly in March from a large reduction in February. Even with March's increase, the total curb achieved is 564,000 bpd, well above the target cut of 486,000 bpd.
As a result, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and as of this month, the UAE, compensated for the weaker adherence of other members, including Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon and Venezuela.
Iraq has boosted compliance too, the survey found, with exports from northern and southern ports falling. A supertanker collided with a berth at Basra oil terminal in late March, although this did not affect shipments significantly.
Iran's production rose slightly. Tehran was allowed a small increase in output under the OPEC agreement.
Lower output in Nigeria and Libya, which are exempt from the curbs, helped bring overall OPEC production down.
Nigerian production fell partly because of planned maintenance at the Bonga field. A recovery in Libya ran into a setback after armed protests blocked output from two fields.
OPEC announced a production target of 32.5 million bpd at its Nov. 30 meeting, which was based on low figures for Libya and Nigeria and included Indonesia, which has since left the group.
The Libyan and Nigerian reductions mean OPEC output in March has averaged 32.01 million bpd, about 260,000 bpd above its supply target adjusted to remove Indonesia. 
The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data, and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a drop of 2.5 million barrels.
Oil has fallen sharply this month amid concern that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC agreed in November last year to curb its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day between January and June. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 barrels per day.
In total, they agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the first six months of the year, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.

U.S. natural gas for May delivery rose to a daily peak of $3.231 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since February 1.
It was last at $3.229 by 9:00AM ET (13:00GMT), up 5.2 cents, or around 1.6%, after gaining 4.6 cents on Tuesday.
Weather systems will track across the country the next several days with rain, snow, and thunderstorms, but with limited cold air as they play out spring-like, according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
There remains potential for a bit colder system from April 7 through the 10th and will be dependent on how a weather system tracking over the southern U.S. phases with a cold blast over the Midwest.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting forecasts on early-spring demand.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw of 37 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 24.
That compares with a withdrawal of 150 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a decline of 25 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 27 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.092 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 16% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 12.7% above the five-year average for this time of year.

360,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2017 08:20AM ET</span>",BP sees trading benefits from oil boom in the Americas,"By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil major  BP  (L:BP) expects its trading operations to benefit from growing global crude trade on the back of abundant U.S., Canadian and Brazilian production and rising energy demand in Asia, a top BP executive said.
Tufan Erginbilgic, the head of BP's downstream division that includes one of the world's most powerful trading desks, told Reuters he wanted to expand BP's trading activities using long-term deals on third-party oil and products.
U.S. shale oil production using fracking technology has turned the world's largest oil consumer into an exporter of crude and products, while Canada is developing its vast oil sands deposits and Brazil is developing huge offshore fields.
""There will be more flows in the world because where crude production will increase is the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and refining will increase in Asia and the Middle East,"" Erginbilgic told Reuters in an interview.
""We are not shy of optimizing the opportunities in any of our businesses,"" he said when asked if BP planned to expand its trading operations as flows increased.
BP, which employs about 1,800 people in oil trading, trades over 5 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil and refined products, and is only exceeded by rival Royal Dutch/Shell and trading house Vitol. 
The trading unit does not normally disclose results separately from the downstream business, which includes refining and petrochemical production. But industry experts estimate trading profits can be more than $1 billion in a good year. 
But, in an unusual move, BP said its oil trading had a loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 partly due to a $70 million lawsuit claim related to a cargo for a Moroccan refinery. It coincided with an oil price rally after OPEC announced plans to cut output.
""Our supply and trading is more about physical barrels than people realize,"" said Erginbilgic, referring to a common market perception that BP trades heavily on paper positions.
He also said BP wanted to expand its long-term deals to trade on crude and products from third-parties. ""We like our (BP) flows, but we are not limited by them,"" he said.
The world is becoming saturated with barrels of light crude from U.S. shale producers, while cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are reducing flows of the heavier grades that OPEC states mostly produce.
This benefits Atlantic basin refineries that are less sophisticated than modern Asian and Middle Eastern plants, which can deal with heavy and more complex grades of crude, said Erginbilgic. This should boost prices of heavier fuel oil.
""At some point, fuel oil will have to strengthen in this equation because people will need fuel oil to fill the cokers,"" he said, referring to units that deal with heavier residual crudes in the refining process.
But he said fuel oil gains were unlikely to hold for long due to new marine fuel regulations requiring the use of fuel with a lower sulfur content than fuel oil and encouraging usage of middle distillates from 2020. Middle distillates are lighter.
""Distillates will strengthen in the process at least early on,"" said Erginbilgic, adding that new refineries being built in Asia and the Middle East would help meet new marine fuel demand.
He said global demand for distillates was poised to grow faster than gasoline.
""Given the complexity of our refineries we are well positioned,"" said Erginbilgic, adding that 47 percent of output from BP's plants was distillates while less than 3 percent was high sulfur fuel oil.
BP has said it does not plan to build new refineries but will modernize existing ones.
Erginbilgic, who has run BP's downstream division since 2014, said he was ensuring that the trading business worked more closely with refining to generate profits.

""We brought together supply and trading and refining, they make decisions in the regions together. That allows you to optimize the pie,"" he said.

Optimism that an OPEC-led production cut deal will be extended through the end of the year further supported prices.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude May contract reached a session peak of $48.84 a barrel, the highest since March 21.

After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories rose by 1.9 million barrels in the week ended March 24.
The API report also showed a drop of 1.1 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks declined 2.0 million barrels.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report at 10:30AM ET (14:30GMT) Wednesday. If the increase is confirmed, it would be the 12th weekly build in the past 14 weeks.
Oil has fallen sharply this month amid concern that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC agreed in November last year to curb its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day between January and June. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 barrels per day.
In total, they agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the first six months of the year, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told reporters on Tuesday that a global oil cuts deal is likely to be extended, but that time is needed to discuss the subject thoroughly first.
A joint committee of ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers will meet in late April to present its recommendation on the fate of the pact. A final decision on whether or not to extend the deal beyond June will be taken by the oil cartel on May 25.
Meanwhile, armed factions at the western Libyan oil fields of Sharara and Wafa blocked production, reducing output by 252,000 barrels per day, or about a third of production, a source at the National Oil Corporation said on Tuesday.

365,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2017 08:00PM ET</span>",U.S. judge throws out many metals price-fixing claims,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday significantly narrowed private litigation accusing several big banks and German chemical giant BASF SE (DE:BASFn) of conspiring to suppress platinum and palladium prices.
U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods in Manhattan dismissed claims against BASF, Switzerland's UBS Group AG (S:UBSG), South Africa's Standard Bank Group Ltd (J:SBKJ) and the London Platinum and Palladium Fixing Co.
In a 104-page decision in the proposed class-action case, Woods said dismissal was appropriate because of a lack of proof these defendants conspired to fix prices, had sufficient ties to the United States, or both.
The judge also dismissed claims that  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (L:HSBA) violated the U.S. antitrust law known as the Sherman Act, saying the plaintiffs were not ""efficient enforcers"" of that law.
Woods said the plaintiffs may pursue some price manipulation claims against Goldman and HSBC under the Commodities Exchange Act, citing their allegations that the defendants ""engaged in conscious misbehavior or, at least, acted with recklessness.""
Merrill Davidoff, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, in an email declined immediate comment, citing a need to review the decision.
Platinum and palladium are used in catalytic converters to curb vehicle emissions, and are also used in dentistry and jewelry.
The U.S. lawsuit is one of many where private plaintiffs have sought to hold banks and other defendants liable for rigging interest rates, commodities and currencies, separate from any punishments that regulators might seek to impose.
Purchasers of platinum, palladium and futures contracts for the metals accused the defendants of having from Jan. 1, 2008 to Nov. 30, 2014 conspired to rig the twice-daily platinum and palladium ""fixings"" and the prices of futures and options based on those fixings.
According to the complaint, the alleged misconduct included illegal sharing of customer data, using that data to engage in ""front-running"" of expected price moves, and manufacturing phantom ""spoof"" orders.
While the London Metal Exchange launched a new electronic fixing process on Dec. 1, 2014, the plaintiffs said this did not excuse the defendants from owing unspecified millions of dollars for their earlier losses.

367,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2017 06:08PM ET</span>",Trump offers federal coal to industry awash in reserves,"By Timothy Gardner and Richard Valdmanis
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has billed his move to reopen federal lands to new coal leases as a win for miners seeking to expand production. But a review of company filings shows that coal miners with the most to gain already have enough leases in hand to last well over a decade.
Trump signed a decree on Tuesday to reverse former President Barack Obama's 2016 ban on new federal coal leases, part of a wide-ranging executive order to sweep away green regulations his administration says have hobbled the drilling and mining industries.
""You know our nation can't run on pixie dust and hope, and the last eight years showed that,"" Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said before Trump signed the executive order on a stage at the Environmental Protection Agency lined with coal miners.
But companies focused on coal deposits below federal lands, such as  Peabody Energy  Corp (PK:BTUUQ),  Arch Coal Inc  (N:ARCH), and  Cloud Peak Energy Inc  (N:CLD), have enough coal in the ground on existing leases to last an average of more than 17 years at 2015 sales levels, earnings reports show. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2lr2p5o)
That suggests miners could already ramp up production levels immediately if the market demanded more coal. Energy experts say that is unlikely on a large scale due to stiff competition from cheap and abundant natural gas. 
""These initiatives prevent things from getting worse for coal, but they won't help much,"" said Charles Dayton, vice president of market analytics at Doyle Trading Consultants in Colorado, which has been tracking reserve levels on public lands.
Shares of Cloud Peak closed 4.9 percent higher at $4.51 after the executive order. Arch closed 1.8 percent higher at $69.00 and Peabody gained 6.8 percent to end at $2.22.
The current level of reserves appeared to be within historical norms. A decade ago, under Republican President George W. Bush when there were no bans on federal coal leasing, the industry had about 18 years' worth of leases on federal lands, according to a Reuters examination of securities filings.
Arch Coal and Peabody confirmed they have substantial reserves on their federal leases already, but nonetheless welcomed Trump’s move.
""Peabody has a comfortable amount of reserves in the Powder River Basin, although we recognize the poor public policy represented by the leasing moratorium put into place by the prior administration,"" Peabody spokesman Vic Svec told Reuters in an email.
Arch Coal has ""sufficient permitted reserves to sustain our operations on federal lands for a number of years to come,"" spokeswoman Logan Bonacorsi said. ""But as with all producers we will need to add reserves over time, and the ability to obtain those reserves when needed is important.""
Cloud Peak spokesman Rick Curtsinger said his company has leases pending at all three of its mines in the Powder River Basin in the U.S. West and welcomed Trump's rescinding of the moratorium.
Another coal company, Contura Energy Inc (PK:CNTE), did not respond to requests for comment.
Trump's executive order will also seek to undo Obama-era rules limiting carbon emissions. One example is the Clean Power Plan, a regulation that would have increased pressure on states to replace coal-fired power stations with ones using cleaner fuels like natural gas, wind and solar.
'SIGNAL TO MARKETS'
Obama's administration imposed the temporary ban on new federal coal leases in January 2016 as part of a broad environmental and economic review to ensure royalties from lease deals provide fair returns to taxpayers.
It was not immediately clear whether the royalty review would continue even with the ban on leases lifted. Some analysts said this scenario could trigger a near-term land rush by companies fearing higher royalty rates in the future.
Coal accounts for about a third of U.S. electricity production, down from about half one decade ago. About 40 percent of all U.S. coal comes from federal lands, mainly in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana.
Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association industry group, said he expected Trump’s executive order to have symbolic impact, at least.
""Lifting the moratorium would strengthen the signal to markets that the federal government is not any longer standing in the way of fossil energy,"" he said.

He added that reopening federal lands to new leases could also play into a production upswing if demand ultimately increases. The U.S. Energy Information Administration has forecast a 9 percent increase in western coal production to 443.4 million short tons by 2018, driven mainly by higher natural gas prices. Others were less optimistic about the U.S. coal industry's outlook, saying the best Trump could do is slow the sector’s decline. Since 2012, coal production has plunged more than 25 percent to the lowest levels since 1978 due to falling prices. The industry has been hit with massive layoffs and bankruptcies.

368,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2017 05:49PM ET</span>",Trump signs order dismantling Obama-era climate policies,"By Valerie Volcovici and Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an order to undo Obama-era climate change regulations, keeping a campaign promise to support the coal industry and calling into question U.S. support for an international deal to fight global warming.
Flanked by coal miners and coal company executives, Trump proclaimed his ""Energy Independence"" executive order at the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
The move drew swift backlash from a coalition of 23 states and local governments, as well as environmental groups, which called the decree a threat to public health and vowed to fight it in court.
The order's main target is former President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, which required states to slash carbon emissions from power plants - a key factor in the United States' ability to meet its commitments under a climate change accord reached by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015. 
Trump's decree also reverses a ban on coal leasing on federal lands, undoes rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production and reduces the weight of climate change and carbon emissions in policy and infrastructure permitting decisions. Carbon dioxide and methane are two of the main greenhouse gases blamed by scientists for heating the earth.
""I am taking historic steps to lift restrictions on American energy, to reverse government intrusion and to cancel job-killing regulations,"" Trump said at the EPA. 
The room was filled with miners, coal company executives and staff from industry groups, who applauded loudly as Trump spoke. Shares in U.S. coal companies edged higher in response. 
The wide-ranging order is the boldest yet in Trump’s broader push to cut environmental regulation to revive the drilling and mining industries, a promise he made repeatedly during the 2016 presidential campaign. 
Energy analysts and executives have questioned whether the moves will have a big effect on their industries, and environmentalists have called them reckless.
""I cannot tell you how many jobs the executive order is going to create, but I can tell you that it provides confidence in this administration’s commitment to the coal industry,"" Kentucky Coal Association president Tyler White told Reuters.
Environmental groups heaped scorn on Trump's order, arguing it was dangerous and went against the broader global trend toward cleaner energy technologies. A coalition of mostly Democrat-led states and local governments issued a statement saying they would oppose the order in court.
""We won’t hesitate to protect those we serve — including by aggressively opposing in court President Trump’s actions that ignore both the law and the critical importance of confronting the very real threat of climate change,"" the coalition, led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said in a statement. 
The coalition includes states such as California, Massachusetts and Virginia, as well as cities including Chicago, Philadelphia and Boulder, Colorado.
PARIS DEAL NOT ADDRESSED
U.S. presidents have aimed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day, almost enough to meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined.
An overwhelming majority of scientists believe that human use of oil and coal for energy is a main driver of climate change, causing a damaging rise in sea levels, droughts and more frequent violent storms. 
But Trump and several members of his administration have doubts about climate change, and Trump promised during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord, arguing it would hurt U.S. business. 
Since being elected, Trump has been mum on the Paris deal and the executive order does not address it.
Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change who helped broker the Paris accord, lamented Trump's order.
""Trying to make fossil fuels remain competitive in the face of a booming clean renewable power sector, with the clean air and plentiful jobs it continues to generate, is going against the flow of economics,"" she said.
The order directs the EPA to start a formal process to undo the Clean Power Plan, which was introduced by Obama in 2014 but was never implemented in part because of legal challenges brought by Republican-controlled states. 
The Clean Power Plan required states to collectively cut carbon emissions from power plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.
Some 85 percent of U.S. states are on track to meet the targets despite the fact the rule has not been implemented, according to Bill Becker, director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, a group of state and local air pollution control agencies.
Trump’s order also lifts the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management temporary ban on coal leasing on federal property put in place by Obama in 2016 as part of a review to study the program's impact on climate change and ensure royalty revenues were fair to taxpayers.

It also asks federal agencies to discount the cost of carbon in policy decisions and the weight of climate change considerations in infrastructure permitting, and it reverses rules limiting methane leakage from oil and gas facilities.

""A suspicion of corruption is unacceptable,"" Vytenis Andriukaitis, EU commissioner for health and food safety, told reporters after meeting with Brazil's Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi to discuss police allegations that government regulators were paid bribes to turn a blind eye to breaches of sanitation rules.
The Operation ""Weak Flesh"" probe has hit exports from the world's top beef and poultry exporter. Meat exports fell by around a fifth last week, the trade ministry said.
Andriukaitis said he was happy with Brazil's attempts to clarify the situation but also urged broader action. 
""I expect Brazilian authorities to implement corrective actions to restore the credibility of their official controls as soon as possible,"" he said, adding ""the question is not over.""
The comments demonstrate the uphill struggle Brazil now has to restore credibility in the competitive global market even as the immediate problem of import bans subsides.
Hong Kong's Center for Food Safety said it eased the ban on Brazilian meat and poultry imports after it received further information from Brazilian authorities, according to statement on its website. 
Hong Kong had been one of several major buyers of Brazilian meat that froze imports after Brazil's federal police arrested dozens of people on March 17 and made allegations of corruption in the meat industry. No formal charges have been announced.
Brazil's government moved to block exports from the 21 plants directly implicated in the probe and urged importers to restrict bans to just these units as it campaigned to inform trade partners about standards in the industry, one of the few sectors to have bucked a painful recession in the country.
Most countries have now followed that guidance. 
Together with China, which lifted its ban on Saturday, Hong Kong bought nearly one-third of the $14 billion of meat that Latin America's largest economy exported last year.
Hong Kong narrowed its ban to just the 21 plants and voiced confidence in ""Brazilian authorities' stringent checks on the procedures for issuing international health certificates.""
Agriculture minister Maggi said investigators had not found any products that could harm the health of consumers, but conceded Brazil faced a struggle to recover its market share.
EU officials and their Brazilian counterparts will meet in Brasilia on Thursday to continue discussing the implications of the police probe, Maggi told reporters after talks with Andriukaitis.
The commissioner said during the talks that there was pressure from European consumers to clarify whether Brazilian meat was safe, Maggi said. He said the probe was an isolated problem exaggerated by the federal police.
Brazil has ordered the temporary closure of six of the 21 food processing plants under investigation by the police and health authorities. The other 15 plants are not allowed to export, although they may still produce for the domestic market.
The European Union has maintained a partial ban on products from the 21 meatpacking plants under investigation.

In the United States, pressure is mounting on the federal government to join other nations blocking shipments of raw beef from Brazil. Brazil only gained access to the U.S. market for fresh meat last year, an important seal of approval for other importers.

Gold prices shrugged off a bounce in the dollar, as jitters concerning Trump’s ability to push through his pro-growth economic agenda provided investors with a reason to seek refuge in the yellow metal, which is considered a safe haven asset.
Gold for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange traded roughly flat at $1,255.65 a troy ounce by 13:27 EDT.
The yellow metal continued to hold firm, despite a surge in consumer confidence data to a nearly seventeen-year high, after The Consumer Board Consumer Confidence Index, hit 125.6, far above expectations of a 114 print.
Meanwhile, comments from Federal Reserve officials concerning interest rate hikes continued to surface as both Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan on Monday, suggested that the U.S. central bank would continue on its monetary tightening cycle.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. interest rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as gold, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices surged as much as 2 percent on Tuesday after a severe disruption to Libyan oil supplies and as officials suggested OPEC could extend its production cuts deal to the end of the year.
Armed factions have blocked production at the western Libyan oilfields of Sharara and Wafa, reducing output by 252,000 barrels per day (bpd), about a third , said a source at the National Oil Corp (NOC).
NOC has declared force majeure on crude loadings from those oilfields. 
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) rose 65 cents, or 1.3 percent to $51.40 per barrel by 1:00 p.m. EDT. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) rose 78 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $48.51 a barrel. Both benchmarks were up about 2 percent at their session highs.
""The closure of two Libyan oil fields ... is supporting the market today with the timing of a potential restart uncertain after militias in western Libya shut key pipelines,"" Tim Evans, an energy futures specialist at Citi Futures said in a note.
""Past outages have ranged from a few days all the way up to two years, although the need for oil revenues will be a strong incentive to negotiate a pipeline restart sooner rather than later.""
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said the deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to cut output and reduce the global crude glut is likely to be extended beyond June. Russia, a non-OPEC member, is seen as a wild card. However, Russia and Iran signed a joint statement saying they will keep cooperating to reduce output.
Non-OPEC member Azerbaijan also said it was ready to join an extension of the deal.
Major oil traders gathered in Switzerland this week said they expected OPEC and non-OPEC producers to extend the pact, providing Russia complies. 
Still, resurgent U.S. oil production and record domestic crude inventories have kept pressuring oil prices. Analysts polled by Reuters predicted that data will show U.S. crude oil stocks rose 1.2 million barrels in the latest week. [EIA/S]
Data from the American Petroleum Institute is due at 4:30 p.m. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports at 10:30 a.m. on Wednesday.
Saxo Bank Head of Commodity Strategy Ole Hansen said ""an increase of more than 322,000 barrels will see Cushing hit a record"". 
Rising stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage site and delivery point for WTI tend to depress the price of the U.S. benchmark, widening its discount to Brent .

U.S. crude exports are poised to pick up, analysts and traders said, as rising domestic production has pushed WTI's discount to Brent to its steepest since the United States lifted a ban on exports in late 2015.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia and Iran have pledged to continue efforts to rein in oil production and stabilize markets, the presidents of both countries said in a joint statement on Tuesday.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other large producers, led by Russia, had agreed in December to cut their combined output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to reduce bloated oil inventories and support prices.
Iran, however, successfully argued that it should not limit production that was slowly starting to recover after the lifting of international sanctions in January last year.
""Russia and Iran will continue cooperation in this sphere (in oil output cuts) in order to stabilize the global energy market and ensure stable economic growth,"" the statement from Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani said.
They two presidents met in the Kremlin and also discussed Syrian crisis among other issues.
Russia has pledged to cut oil output by 300,000 bpd in the first half of the year.
On Sunday OPEC and non-OPEC oil ministers, including Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, discussed the implementation of the December deal but stopped short of recommending that cuts be extended into the second half of the year.
Earlier on Tuesday Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told reporters in Moscow that a global deal is likely to be extended, but time was needed to discuss the subject thoroughly.
""It seems that most of the OPEC and non-OPEC (countries) are going to extend the agreement, but time is needed to evaluate the situation and to have face-to-face meetings and discussions with others,"" Zanganeh said.
Asked whether Iran would be ready to cut its own output under the possible extension, Zanganeh said: ""I think it is necessary that all members comply with their commitments."" 

Iran's oil production stands close to 3.8 million bpd, he said.

U.S. natural gas for May delivery tacked on 2.8 cents, or around 0.9% to $3.159 per million British thermal units by 10:10AM ET (14:10GMT). It settled lower for the first time in three sessions on Tuesday, falling 2.2 cents.
Weather systems will track across the country the next several days with rain, snow, and thunderstorms, but with limited cold air as they play out spring-like, according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
Natural gas prices have closely tracked weather forecasts in recent weeks, as traders try to gauge the impact of shifting forecasts on early-spring demand.
The heating season from November through March is the peak demand period for U.S. gas consumption.
Nearly 50% of all U.S. households use gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 43 and 54 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 24.
That compares with a withdrawal of 150 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a decline of 25 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 27 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.092 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 16% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 12.7% above the five-year average for this time of year.

380,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2017 06:51AM ET</span>",The DNA of oil wells: U.S. shale enlists genetics to boost output,"By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) - A small group of U.S. oil producers has been trying to exploit advances in DNA science to wring more crude from shale rock, as the domestic energy industry keeps pushing relentlessly to cut costs and compete with the world's top exporters.
Shale producers have slashed production costs as much as 50 percent over two years, waging a price war with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). 
Now, U.S. shale producers can compete in a $50-per-barrel oil market, and about a dozen shale companies are seeking to cut costs further by analyzing DNA samples extracted from oil wells to identify promising spots to drill.
The technique involves testing DNA extracts from microbes found in rock samples and comparing them to DNA extracted from oil. Similarities or differences can pinpoint areas with the biggest potential. The process can help cut the time needed to begin pumping, shaving production costs as much as 10 percent, said Ajay Kshatriya, chief executive and co-founder of Biota Technology, the company that developed this application of DNA science for use in oilfields.
The information can help drillers avoid missteps that prevent maximum production, such as applying insufficient pressure to reach oil trapped in rocks, or drilling wells too closely together, Kshatriya said.
""This is a whole new way of measuring these wells and, by extension, sucking out more oil for less,"" he said.
Biota's customers include  Statoil  (OL:STL) ASA, EP Energy Corp and more than a dozen other oil producers. Kshatriya would not detail Biota's cost, but said it amounts to less than 1 percent of the total cost to bring a well online.
A shale well can cost between $4 million and $8 million, depending on geology and other factors.
Independent petroleum engineers and chemists said Biota's process holds promise if the company can collect enough DNA samples along the length of a well so results are not skewed.
""I don't doubt that with enough information (Biota) could find a signature, a DNA fingerprint, of microbial genomes that can substantially improve the accuracy and speed of a number of diagnostic applications in the oil industry,"" said Preethi Gunaratne, a professor of biology and chemistry at the University of Houston.
Biota has applied its technology to about 80 wells across U.S. shale basins, including North Dakota's Bakken, and the Permian and Eagle Ford in Texas, Kshatriya said. That is a tiny slice of the more than 300,000 shale wells across the nation.
EP Energy, one of Biota's first customers, insisted on a blind test last year to gauge the technique's effectiveness, asking Biota to determine the origin of an oil sample from among dozens of wells in a 1,000-square foot zone.
Biota was able to find the wells from which the oil was taken and to recommend improvements for wells drilled in the same region, said Peter Lascelles, an EP Energy geologist.
""If you've been in the oilfield long enough, you've seen a lot of snake oil,"" said Lascelles, using slang for products or services that do not perform as advertised.
Lascelles said DNA testing helps EP Energy understand well performance better than existing oil field surveys such as seismic and chemical analysis. The testing gives insight into what happens underground when rock is fractured with high pressure mixtures of sand and water to release trapped oil.
Biota's process is just the latest technology pioneered to coax more oil from rock. Other techniques include microseismic studies, which examine how liquid moves in a reservoir, and tracers, which use some DNA elements to study fluid movement.
Venture capitalist George Coyle said his fund Energy Innovation Capital had invested in Biota because it expected the technique to yield big improvements in drilling efficiency. He declined to say how much the fund had invested.
""The correlations they're going to be able to find to improve a well, we think, are going to be big,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Tuesday to undo a slew of Obama-era climate change regulations, a move meant to bolster domestic energy production but which environmentalists have vowed to challenge in court.
The decree, dubbed the ""Energy Independence"" order, will seek to undo former President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan requiring states to slash carbon emissions from power plants - a critical element in helping the United States meet its commitments to a global climate change accord agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in December 2015. 
It will also rescind a ban on coal leasing on federal lands, reverse rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production, and reduce the weight of climate change in federal agencies' assessments of new regulations.
""We're going to go in a different direction,"" a senior White House official told reporters ahead of Tuesday's order. ""The previous administration devalued workers with their policies. We can protect the environment while providing people with work.""
Trump will sign the order at the EPA with the agency's Administrator Scott Pruitt, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Tuesday afternoon. 
The wide-ranging order is the boldest yet in Trump’s broader push to cut environmental regulation to revive the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries, a promise he made repeatedly during his campaign for the presidency.
""I cannot tell you how many jobs the executive order is going to create but I can tell you that it provides confidence in this administration’s commitment to the coal industry,"" Kentucky Coal Association president Tyler White told Reuters.
PARIS ACCORD NOT ADDRESSED 
Environmental groups have promised to challenge the orders.
""These actions are an assault on American values and they endanger the health, safety and prosperity of every American,"" said billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, the head of activist group NextGen Climate. 
Green group Earthjustice said it will fight the order both in and out of court. “This order ignores the law and scientific reality,"" said the group's president Trip Van Noppen. 
Trump campaigned on a promise to sweep aside green regulations he said hurt the economy, and vowed to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Since being elected, however, he has been mum on the Paris deal and the executive order does not address it.
The White House official said Trump's administration was discussing its approach to the accord, meant to limit the planet's warming by reducing carbon emissions.
The order will direct the EPA to start a formal ""review"" process to undo the Clean Power Plan, which was introduced by Obama in 2014 but has never been implemented in part because of legal challenges brought by Republican states. 
The review is likely to trigger legal challenges by environmental groups and some state attorneys general that could last years.

The Clean Power Plan would have required states to collectively cut carbon emissions from power plants by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil ordered three more food processing plants to suspend production on Monday amid an investigation into alleged corruption in its meat industry as the world's biggest beef exporter sought to regain the trust of consumers.
Brazil's center-right government is hoping countries that imposed bans on Brazilian meat products because of the scandal will soon follow China's lead in lifting them, and that others such as the European Union will not impose tougher restrictions.
The top EU food safety official began a visit saying he wanted to help Brazil overcome the scandal and recover the confidence of European consumers, following the police investigation alleging the payment of bribes to inspectors and unsanitary conditions at meat plants.
The investigation has hit hard at one of the few strong sectors in Brazil's economy, which is experiencing its worst recession on record. 
""It's not about bans. It's about restoring trust,"" EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Vytenis Andriukaitis told Reuters. ""It's about people's health. It's about trust in trade.""
The European Union has maintained a partial ban on products from the 21 meatpacking plants under investigation, which are currently barred from exporting. 
European farm groups have called for tougher action against Brazilian meat.
Andriukaitis declined to say what measures the EU might take in coming days, but said he would discuss an ""effective official controls system"" with Brazilian Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi in Brasilia on Tuesday.
""People need to perceive food is safe,"" he said in an interview.
Brazil has so far ordered the temporary closure of six of the 21 food processing plants under investigation by the police and health authorities. The other 15 plants are not allowed to export, although they may still produce for the domestic market. 
All three plants ordered closed on Monday are in Parana state, where the scandal has been centered. They include units of Souza Ramos, Industria de Laticinios SSPMA and Fabrica de Farinha de Carnes Castro. 
Several major meat importers issued bans after Brazilian federal police unveiled their investigation on March 17, code-named ""Operation Weak Flesh.""
CONFIDENCE UNDERMINED
Maggi said investigators had not found any products that could harm the health of consumers. He acknowledged at a news conference that Brazil faced an uphill battle to recover its market share after confidence in its meat was undermined by the scandal.
On Saturday, China, the biggest buyer of Brazilian meats, lifted import suspensions, a move accompanied by Egypt and Chile, bringing hope of an end to the crisis.
Maggi said he hoped to convince Hong Kong, Brazil's No. 2 market, to follow China and lift its full ban on Brazilian meat imports.
Meat is Brazil's third biggest export after soy and iron ore, with foreign sales of almost $14 billion last year in beef, chicken, pork and other products.
The meat scandal has fueled pressure from farm groups in the United States to block imports of Brazilian raw beef, a market that Brazil only gained access to last year for its fresh meat, an important seal of approval that is now at risk.

The United States has already started testing all beef from Brazil for pathogens.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A wealthy Turkish gold trader's decision to hire former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey to represent him, as he defends against charges he conspired to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran, raises a potential conflict of interest, prosecutors said.
At least eight big banks allegedly victimized by the trader, Reza Zarrab, are current or former clients of Giuliani and Mukasey's law firms, acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan said in a letter dated Monday to the federal judge hearing the case.
The banks' relationships with the law firms require a special hearing, known as a ""Curcio"" hearing, to make sure Zarrab understands the potential conflict, Kim said.
Giuliani is a lawyer for Greenberg Traurig, while Mukasey, who is also a former federal judge, is a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton. Neither firm had an immediate comment.
The eight banks are Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C),  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn),  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM),  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc, UBS Group AG and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.
""Through various deceptive acts, including layering the transactions and omitting information concerning the Iranian nexus, Zarrab and his co-conspirators allegedly tricked numerous U.S. financial institutions into processing barred transactions, thus exposing them to significant potential loss,"" Kim said in a letter to U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, explaining the potential conflict of interest.
Prosecutors accused the Iranian-born Zarrab and two others of engaging in hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions for Iran's government and Iranian entities from 2010 to 2015, in a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions.
A trial is scheduled for Aug. 21. Zarrab has been in federal custody since his March 21, 2016, arrest in Miami, while en route to Disney World with his wife and daughter.
Holding a Curcio hearing now could eliminate one ground for appeal if the case goes against Zarrab.
The case has been closely watched in Turkey, where Zarrab was arrested in 2013 in a corruption probe into individuals with close ties to Tayyip Erdogan, then Turkey's prime minister and now its president. Zarrab is a dual national of Iran and Turkey.
Another lawyer for Zarrab, Benjamin Brafman, said in a letter on Monday that Giuliani and Mukasey's roles ""will not require any appearance in court and, accordingly, a hearing is not required.""

The case is U.S. v. Zarrab, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00867.

391,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2017 02:26PM ET</span>",Oil lower again on doubts over duration of output cut,"By David Gaffen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil resumed its slide on Monday as investors remained uncertain whether producing nations would extend an OPEC-led output cut beyond the end of June in an effort to reduce a global glut of crude.
On Sunday, a committee of ministers from OPEC and outside producers agreed to look at prolonging the deal, stopping short of an earlier draft statement that recommended keeping the measure in place.
Oil prices have been falling since the middle of the month, as a spate of reports showing stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. inventories sparked selling from speculators that had built record long positions in crude futures. 
Last week's futures data showed speculators were still unwinding long positions as high U.S. inventories offset cuts from other oil producers. Long positions as of last Tuesday were at their lowest since December.
A number of ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers met in Kuwait to review progress of their supply cut.
""When you look at the last two-and-a-half weeks we've moved into a sliding pattern vs. the sideways trend we have seen for much of the year,"" said Michael Train, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets. 
U.S. crude was down 33 cents at $47.63 a barrel, a 0.7 percent drop, as of 1:56 p.m. EDT. International benchmark Brent crude fell 17 cents to $50.63. Brent's session low was $50.03. 
The discount of U.S. crude to Brent has grown to around $2.90 per barrel, heading for its widest close since late 2015. That could result in U.S. producers sending more barrels overseas to take advantage of appetite for cheaper U.S. crude and help draw down stocks.
In December, OPEC and 11 other producers including Russia agreed to reduce combined output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day in the first half of this year.
While many in OPEC have called for prolonging the curbs, Russia has been less definitive. Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Sunday it was too early to make that call. Some analysts believe that the backward-looking nature of U.S. inventory figures understate the oil market's rebalancing. 

""We believe that the rebalancing of the oil market is making progress, despite the record high US crude inventories with non-crude US inventories and non-US inventories down year-over-year,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) wrote Monday. They said cuts may not need to be extended.

398,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2017 06:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Shell and Anadarko mull clean break from Permian venture - executive,"By Ron Bousso and Ernest Scheyder
LONDON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) and Anadarko Petroleum Corp (N:APC) may let a 10-year joint venture in the oil-rich Permian Basin of Texas expire and split their properties, hoping to speed up development, according to a senior Shell executive.
The divorce and re-parceling of acreage would let each company drill and develop new wells at its own pace in the Permian, which has become the U.S. oil industry's hottest development area for its low operating costs as crude prices (CLc1) hover under $50 per barrel. 
Shell and Anadarko have been discussing how to proceed after the partnership agreement expires this summer and are not likely to renew it, Greg Guidry, who oversees the Anglo-Dutch group's shale business, told Reuters. 
The talks come as Shell hopes to boost its North American shale output by 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the next three years, a goal that relies largely on the Permian, the largest oilfield in the United States. 
Talks have involved scenarios where acreage would be divvied up, allowing each company to individually develop the fields, he said. Under one proposal, ""we could have ideally two 100 percent owned and operated parcels,"" Guidry said.
""That would be a split that will allow us to manage the flexibilities in terms of capital pace, separate of Anadarko,"" he said in an interview this month. 
A Shell spokesman said late last week that negotiations continue between both sides.
The agreement was first signed in 2007 between Anadarko and Chesapeake Energy Corp (N:CHK). Shell bought Chesapeake's Permian holdings in 2012 and inherited the joint venture.
If the two sides were to do nothing, Anadarko would become the operator of the more than 350,000 acres (142,000 hectares) in the Delaware portion of the Permian, with a roughly 60 percent interest. A breakup would give Shell an opportunity to prove it can grow on its own in the largest American shale oil field.
Terms of the joint venture are not outlined in regulatory filings for either company, fuelling confusion among investors about what could come after the deal expires.
Anadarko Chief Executive Al Walker said earlier this month that he preferred an arrangement that would give his company majority control over the land once the joint venture expires.
""We and Shell, I think, have an extremely attractive position in the (Permian),"" he told investors on a conference call. ""We think the economics are certainly compelling for us to be operator going forward."" 
An Anadarko spokesman declined to comment beyond Walker's remarks.
The joint venture, where costs and profits are split equally, has benefited Shell more than Anadarko given that the latter has far more experience in horizontal well development so crucial to Permian operations, analysts at Bernstein said last month.
A clean split could be logistically challenging with acreage arrayed in a checkerboard pattern, the way drilling properties are organized in West Texas. Moving a rig or other equipment between such parcels would become more laborious in such a scenario.
""It would be unusual if either party would view that as an optimal solution because that's an inefficient way to develop those assets,"" said Ben Shattuck, an oil industry analyst with consultancy Wood Mackenzie. 
PERMIAN RED-HOT 
The Permian has seen a flurry of deals in recent months despite a wobbly recovery in global oil prices as shale producers in the region have been able to increase output and slash production costs, outpacing any other onshore U.S. basin and many deepwater oil fields around the world. 
The Anglo-Dutch company is accelerating its North American shale output faster than planned to lock in quick returns from what has become one of its most profitable businesses, Guidry said in an interview earlier this month. 
""The strategic fit of the Permian in the Shell portfolio will be different from a the strategic fit of the Permian in a pure upstream player.""

Anadarko also has been moving staff to West Texas to develop its holdings. The company sold assets elsewhere in its portfolio and, after deals close, is expected to have more than $6 billion in cash that analysts expect it to primarily use on Permian expansion projects.

Chief veterinary officers from the European Union's 28 member states met in Brussels to discuss an EU response to the scandal and the risk of rotten or contaminated meat entering the bloc.
""The extension of the ban is a response to European measures, aiming to prevent the meat from reaching European Union territory via Switzerland,"" a spokeswoman for Switzerland's food safety and veterinary office said.
Switzerland banned imports from four Brazilian meat processing facilities on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear how much meat Switzerland imports from Brazil.

405,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2017 11:36AM ET</span>","OPEC, non-OPEC to look at extending oil-output cut by six months","By Vladimir Soldatkin and Rania El Gamal
KUWAIT (Reuters) - A joint committee of ministers from OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers has agreed to review whether a global pact to limit supplies should be extended by six months, it said in a statement on Sunday. 
An earlier draft of the statement had said the committee ""reports high level of conformity and recommends six-month extension"". 
But the final version said only that the committee had requested a technical group and for the OPEC Secretariat to ""review the oil market conditions and revert ... in April, 2017 regarding the extension of the voluntary production adjustments"". 
Oil sector analysts said the lack of an immediate extension could drag on crude prices.
""The dropping of the recommendation to extend cuts in favor of technical review committee is likely to lead to a lot of disappointment and potential further liquidation of long positions by money managers that will put downward pressure on oil prices,"" said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodities strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in London. 
It was not immediately clear why the wording had been changed, although a senior industry source said the committee lacked the legal mandate to recommend an extension.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and rival oil-producing nations were meeting in Kuwait to review progress with their global pact to cut supplies.
OPEC and 11 other leading producers including Russia agreed in December to cut their combined output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of the year. The original deal was to last six months, with the possibility of a six-month extension.
""Any country has the freedom to say whether they do or they don't support (an extension). Unless we have conformity with everybody, we cannot go ahead with the extension of the deal,"" Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouq said, adding that he hoped a decision would come by the end of April.
The oil ministerial committee ""expressed its satisfaction with the progress made towards full conformity with the voluntary production adjustments and encouraged all participating countries to press on towards 100 percent conformity,"" the statement said.
The December accord, aimed at supporting the oil market, has lifted crude (LCOc1) to more than $50 a barrel. But the price gain has encouraged U.S. shale oil producers, which are not part of the pact, to boost output.
The committee said it took note that certain factors, such as low seasonal demand, refinery maintenance and rising non-OPEC supply had led to an increase in crude oil stocks. It also observed the liquidation of positions by financial players. 
""However, the end of the refinery maintenance season and noticeable slowdown in U.S. stock build as well as the reduction in floating storage will support the positive efforts undertaken to achieve stability in the market,"" it said. 
It asked the OPEC Secretariat to review oil market conditions and come back with recommendations in April regarding an extension of the agreement.
""This reaffirms the commitment of OPEC and participating non-OPEC countries to continue to cooperate,"" the statement said.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said it was too early to say whether there would be an extension, although the agreement was working well and all countries were committed to 100 percent compliance.
Olivier Jakob, of oil consultancy Petromatrix, said that with the revision of the ministerial committee's statement, it was becoming more difficult to know who was responsible for what in OPEC.
""That is not the best option to provide clarity to the oil markets,"" Jakob said.
Ellen Wald, a consultant on the global energy industry, said: ""I think the market will react negatively to the lack of a clear direction on a rollover for the deal.""
'ENCOURAGING ELEMENTS'
Before the meeting, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi told reporters there were some encouraging elements that suggested the oil market was improving, and that if all OPEC members agreed measures to help price stability, Iraq would support such steps.
""Any decisions taken unanimously by members of OPEC ... Iraq will be part of the decision and will not be deviating from this,"" Luaibi said.
Iraq's oil production is running at 4.312 million bpd this month, Luaibi said, adding that his country had cut its oil exports by 187,000 bpd so far and would reach 210,000 bpd in a few days. 
Compliance with the supply-cut deal was 94 percent in February among OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers combined, Russia's Novak said.
Russia is committed to cuts of 300,000 bpd by the end of April, Novak said.
Novak said he expects global oil stockpiles to decrease in the second quarter of this year.
""The dynamics are positive here, I believe,"" Novak said, adding that inventories in the United States and other industrialized countries had risen by less than in the past.
Kuwait's oil minister said the market may return to balance by the third quarter of this year if producers comply fully with their production targets.

""More has to be done. We need to see conformity across the board. We assured ourselves and the world that we would reach our adjustment to 100 percent conformity,"" Marzouq said.

BRASILIA/BEIJING (Reuters) - China lifted a ban on imports of meat from Brazil on Saturday after Brazilian authorities clarified details of a police investigation into alleged bribery of health inspectors, in a victory for President Michel Temer's efforts to stem damage from the probe.
The move by China, the biggest national consumer of Brazilian meat, was accompanied on Saturday by the lifting of import bans in Egypt and Chile, bringing hope of an end to a crisis that saw one-fifth wiped off the value of Brazilian pork and poultry exports last week. 
A slew of major meat importers issued bans after Brazilian federal police unveiled on March 17 an investigation into alleged payments to government health officials by meat processing companies to forego inspections and ignore abuses, codenamed ""Operation Weak Flesh"".
Temer's government, alarmed the scandal could damage one of the few sectors that has defied a deep recession in Latin America's largest economy, launched a campaign to convince trade partners that any abuses were limited in scope.
Meat is Brazil's third-largest export, after soy and iron ore. The country sold around $13.5 billion in chicken, beef and pork products last year.
Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi welcomed China's decision and said the government retained a ban on exports from 21 processing plants directly linked to the federal police investigation as it carried out its own inspections. 
“Lifting this suspension was the result of a giant effort by Brazil to explain that the investigation targeted the conduct of individuals and not the quality of the meat,"" Maggi told Reuters. 
Officials said that the only one of the 21 plants that exported to China is owned by Seara Alimentos Ltda, a unit of Brazil's JBS SA, the world's biggest meatpacking company. 
JBS has strongly denied any wrongdoing and said it upholds strict quality standards. 
Two sources in China confirmed that a ban remained in place on imports from the Seara plant, as well as any meat approved by seven Brazilian veterinary experts linked to the police investigation.
Brazilian meat imports have already started being cleared in Shanghai, one of the sources said. 
China had suspended imports of all meat products from Brazil, the world's top beef exporter, on March 20 as a precautionary measure.
An aide to President Temer told Reuters that he planned to call Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the coming days. In a statement, Temer voiced confidence that other countries would follow China's example in lifting restrictions. 
Chile on Saturday said it was ending a ban on meat purchases from Brazil, except for the 21 suspended plants, while Egypt also resumed imports after a two day-suspension.
South Korea had already called off a short-lived ban on chicken imports from Brazil's BRF SA on Tuesday, after just one day. 
BRF, the world's largest poultry producer, has denied selling rotten meat and taking part in any corrupt activities. 
The decision by China was crucial because of its size: it consumed some $1.75 billion in Brazilian meat imports last year.
In part, Brazil has been fortunate that rivals were ill-placed to fill the gap.
With China's second-largest beef supplier, Australia, still rebuilding its herd after drought, it could not meet fast-growing Chinese demand.
In the poultry sector, where Brazil supplies more than 85 percent of China's imports, other major producers, such as the United States and some smaller European markets, are banned from supplying to China due to bird flu outbreaks.

Despite the government's success in containing the damage from the scandal, sources familiar with the investigation said there was a large amount of unpublished evidence pointing to widespread fraud and not just isolated abuses in the meat industry, sources told Reuters on Friday.

""The market will decide. The market is a decisive factor,"" Luaibi told reporters in Kuwait, where a committee set up to monitor the production cuts is convening on Sunday.
He said Iraq was in full compliance with the output-cut agreement.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 other leading oil producers including Russia agreed in December to cut their combined oil output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of the year.
The accord was aimed at reducing bloated global inventories and propping up weak oil prices.
The agreement has elevated the price of crude to more than $50 a barrel but helped U.S. shale oil producers boost their output, hampering efforts to reduce global stockpiles.
Russia said it would reduce production by 200,000 bpd in the first quarter, with cuts reaching 300,000 bpd thereafter.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters on Saturday that the country so far had reduced output by 185,000 bpd.
He has said it is too early to decide whether prolonging the deal is warranted, and that the situation would be clearer in April-May.
Algerian Energy Minister Nouredine Bouterfa told reporters an extension could benefit the market.
""Perhaps an extension is good ... Algeria supports extending the deal.""

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's meat exports have fallen sharply since a police investigation into alleged bribery of food-sanitation inspectors in the world's top beef and poultry exporter sparked a wave of trade bans, an industry group said on Friday.
Restrictions by several key importers of Brazilian meat, ranging from China to Europe, caused a 22 percent drop in weekly average exports of pork and poultry since news of the federal police probe broke on March 17 compared to prior weeks, the Brazilian Animal Protein Association said.
The group did not provide beef export figures. Brazil's overall meat exports generate nearly $14 billion annually, and any drop in foreign shipments could stir new headwinds for the country's recession-hit economy.
Police have accused more than 100 people, mostly inspectors, of taking bribes in exchange for allowing the sale of rancid products, falsifying export documents or failing to inspect meatpacking plants at all.
Prosecutors have yet to present charges and the police allegations have not been proven.
Meat industry officials have sought to downplay the impact of the probe, known as ""Operation Weak Flesh,"" saying 33 arrests made so far pointed to only isolated cases of wrongdoing.
But Planning Minister Dyogo Oliveira was less sanguine in comments to journalists in Sao Paulo on Friday.
""It will clearly have some (economic) impact, but we still do not have a clear idea of the dimensions,"" Oliveira said.
BRF SA (SA:BRFS3), the world's biggest poultry exporter, and JBS (SA:JBSS3), the No. 1 beef producer, are among dozens of firms that have been targeted in the police probe. Both companies have denied wrongdoing and assured consumers that their products meet rigorous quality standards.
BRF said late on Friday it was taking additional measures to further guarantee the quality of its products, including creating a group that will work with independent firms to certify the company was following strict international standards.
INTERNATIONAL FALLOUT
Fallout from the investigation grew on Friday as officials in Hong Kong called on supermarkets to stop selling meat from 21 Brazilian plants targeted by police. 
China also agreed to lift restrictions on Australian beef imports, adding to competition for Brazil in one of the world's fastest-growing markets.
Vytenis Andriukaitis, the European Union's health and food safety commissioner, said a visit to Brazil next week would include a meeting with Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi to discuss sanitary measures among other topics.
Diplomats told Reuters on Thursday that the EU had asked Brazil to voluntarily suspend all shipments of meat to its member countries to avoid a more cumbersome formal ban.
The probe into Brazil's meat industry is a setback for its powerhouse farm sector, which has been a rare bright spot amid the country's worst economic recession on record.

Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, is one of the world's leading exporters of staples from coffee and orange juice to sugar and soybeans.

The ministry said in a statement it had resumed imports from authorized Brazilian slaughterhouses, adding shipments would be subject to checks both in the country of origin and on arrival in Egypt.
Brazil has been investigating how meatpackers allegedly paid off inspectors to overlook practices including processing rotten meat, shipping exports with traces of salmonella and not carrying out inspections of plants.

HOUSTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - A gasoline shortage in OPEC member Venezuela was exacerbated by an increase in fuel exports to foreign allies such as Cuba and Nicaragua and an exodus of crucial personnel from state-run energy company PDVSA, according to internal PDVSA documents and sources familiar with its operations.
Leftist-run Venezuela sells its citizens the world's cheapest gasoline. Fuel supplies have continued flowing despite a domestic oil industry in turmoil and a deepening economic crisis under President Nicolas Maduro that has left the South American country with scant supplies of many basic necessities.
That changed on Wednesday, when Venezuelans faced their first nationwide shortage of motor fuel since an explosion ripped through one of the world's largest refineries five years ago. At the time, the government of then-President Hugo Chavez curbed exports to guarantee there was enough fuel at home.
This week's shortage was also mainly due to problems at refineries, as a mix of plant glitches and maintenance cut fuel production in half.
Unlike five years ago, Caracas has continued exporting fuel to political allies and even raised the volume of shipments last month despite warnings within the government-run company that doing so could trigger a domestic supply crunch.
Shipments from refineries to the domestic market needed to be redirected to meet those export commitments, the internal documents showed.
""Should this additional volume ... be exported, it would impact a cargo scheduled for the local market,"" read one email sent from an official in the company's domestic marketing department to its international trade unit.
Venezuela last month exported 88,000 barrels per day (bpd) of fuels - equivalent to a fifth of its domestic consumption - to Cuba, Nicaragua and other countries, according to internal PDVSA documents seen by Reuters.
That was up 22,000 bpd on the volumes Venezuela had been shipping to those two countries under accords struck by Chavez to expand his diplomatic clout by lowering their fuel costs through cheap supplies of crude and fuel.
The order to increase exports came from PDVSA's top executives, according to the internal emails seen by Reuters.
Venezuela's oil ministry and state-run PDVSA, formally known as Petroleos de Venezuela SA, did not reply to requests for comment for this story.
FUEL STRAIN, BRAIN DRAIN
The strain on the country's fuel system has been worsened by the departure of staff in PDVSA's trade and supply unit who are key to ensuring fuel gets to where it is needed and making payments for imports, three sources close to the company said.
The unit has seen around a dozen key staffers depart since Maduro shook up PDVSA's top management in January. Among those who left was the head of budget and payments, two sources said.
""Every week someone leaves for one reason or another,"" said a PDVSA source familiar with the unit's operations. 
Some have been fired, while others have left since the shake-up inserted political and military officials into top positions and bolstered Maduro's grip on the company that powers the nation's economy.
The imposition of leaders with little or no experience in the industry has further disillusioned some of the company's experienced professionals and accelerated an exodus that had already taken hold as economic and social conditions in Venezuela worsened. 
A recent internal PDVSA report seen by Reuters mentioned ""a low capacity to retain key personnel,"" amid salaries of a few dozen dollars a month at the black market rate.
UNPAID BILLS
The departure of staff responsible for paying suppliers, as well as a cash crunch in the company and the country, have led to an accumulation of unpaid bills for fuel imports into Venezuela.
Had those bills been paid, the supply crunch would have been less acute, the company sources said.
About 10 tankers are waiting near PDVSA ports in Venezuela and the Caribbean to discharge fuel for domestic consumption and for oil blending. 
Only one vessel bringing fuel imports has been discharged since the beginning of the week, shipping data showed.
PDVSA ordered some of the cargoes as it prepared alternative supplies while refineries undergo maintenance.
The tankers sitting offshore will not unload until PDVSA pays for their cargoes, said shippers and the company sources.
Should PDVSA pay - up to $20 million per cargo - shortages could blow over relatively soon. 
The cash-strapped company has struggled since the global oil price crash that began in 2014 cut revenue for its crude exports. PDVSA is tight on cash as it prepares for some $2.5 billion in bond payments due next month. 
While the vessels sit offshore, lines of dozens of cars waited at gas stations in central Venezuela on Wednesday and Thursday. The shortages angered Venezuelans who already face long lines for scarce food and drugs.
PDVSA blamed the supply crunch on unspecified problems for shipping fuel from domestic refineries to distribution centers. The company said it was working hard to solve the gasoline situation by boosting deliveries to the worst-hit regions. 
A shortage of trucks to move refined products has also caused bottlenecks, oil workers told PDVSA President Eulogio Del Pino during a visit to a fuel facility this week, asking for help. Trucks are in short supply because the country does not have enough funds to pay for imports of spare parts.
It was unclear when fuel supplies would return to normal, although by late Thursday PDVSA appeared to have distributed some fuel from storage to Caracas and the eastern city of Puerto Ordaz. Lines to fill up at gasoline stations shortened in both cities, according to Reuters witnesses.

Workers at the 335,000-bpd Isla refinery on the nearby island of Curacao operated by PDVSA said on Friday that the refinery had begun restarting its catalytic cracking unit, which could boost fuel supplies in the coming days.

413,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2017 02:42PM ET</span>",Whistleblower in Brazil meat scandal takes on powerful industry,"By Stephen Eisenhammer
CURITIBA, Brazil (Reuters) - When government health inspector Daniel Gouveia Teixeira confronted a Brazilian processed meat plant with what he says was evidence of excess use of marrow, bone and other slaughterhouse by-products in food for human consumption, he was suddenly removed as the plant's inspector.
The incident, nearly three years ago at the Peccin Agro Industrial Ltda plant in Brazil's rural Parana state, led Teixeira to tell police he suspected he was being undermined by corrupt superiors. It also prompted friends to start calling him ""crazy"" for taking on one of the country's most powerful industries.
""Being honest and doing my job makes me crazy?"" he asked in an interview this week. ""That's crazy!""
Teixeira, 39, is the agriculture ministry whistleblower credited by Brazil's Federal Police with triggering an investigation into alleged bribes paid by meat companies to government food-sanitation inspectors in the world's top exporter of beef and poultry.
Police say in court documents the bribes were paid to cover up serious health violations by some companies in the meat industry, including the sale of rotten and salmonella-contaminated products. Their probe, dubbed ""Operation Weak Flesh,"" has caused some of Brazil's biggest export markets to ban its meats.
Police have accused more than 100 people, mostly inspectors, of taking bribes for allowing the sale of rancid products, falsifying export documents or failing to inspect meatpacking plants at all.
Prosecutors have yet to present charges and the police allegations have not been proven.
BRF SA (SA:BRFS3) and JBS (SA:JBSS3), two of the world's biggest food companies, are among dozens of firms targeted in the investigation. Both have denied any wrongdoing.
The anticorruption probe has led to the arrests of 33 sanitation officials and industry employees so far, with federal agents finding violations in at least 21 meatpacking plants across the country. 
Industry officials in the sector, which generates over $130 billion annually, have sought to portray the meatpacking arrests as isolated incidents.
Luciano Inacio da Silva, an auditor at the Agriculture Ministry who reviews internal procedures, said the ministry was still investigating Teixeira's allegations but had not yet come to any conclusions. He cited a lack of resources as a reason for the ministry's investigation to lag behind that of the police.
Teixeira worked as an inspector for five years in the state of Santa Catarina before moving to Parana in 2012. He said he repeatedly cited plants run by various companies in Parana, which is at the epicenter of the police investigation, but was routinely reassigned to other plants by his boss, Maria do Rocio Nascimento, each time he did.
Nascimento was arrested by police on March 17 on suspicion of taking bribes from meatpacking companies to move inspectors away from certain plants, according to court documents. Her lawyer, who has not commented publicly, could not be reached for comment.
In early 2014, Teixeira began inspecting the processed meat plant operated by Peccin Agro. After a month of biweekly visits, he said he noticed that one of the production lines was always down.
""People were just standing around,"" he said, adding that he suspected they were just waiting for him to leave to restart the line.
OVER THE LIMIT
Teixeira then asked the company for documents outlining the raw materials it bought and used for sausage and other processed meat products.
He concluded the documents showed the plant was using an excess of MSM or ""mechanically separated meat.""
MSM is a paste of marrow, bone, skin, nerves, blood vessels and other scraps. Its use for human consumption is limited, due to concerns over the intake of certain components. In Brazil, a government document posted online states that MSM cannot exceed 60 percent of the content in hams and sausages.
""They were using more than 85 percent MSM,"" Teixeira said.
Authorities have not confirmed the amount of MSM used by Peccin and Reuters was unable to verify Teixeira's allegation independently.
In September 2014, on the same day he confronted the company about his findings, investigators said owner Idair Peccin called Gil Bueno de Magalhaes, the agriculture ministry superintendent in Parana. Magalhaes, who like other such supervisors is a political appointee, removed Teixeira as Peccin's inspector.
Magalhaes and Peccin, who have been in custody since their arrests on March 17, could not be reached for comment. Their lawyers have not made any public comments and also could not be reached for comment.
A receptionist at Peccin headquarters, which also houses the plant, said no company officials were available to discuss the matter. The plant was shut last week.
In a statement posted on the website for one of its brands, Italli Alimentos, Peccin said the accusations against it were false.
Feeling that his work was being undermined by superiors, Teixeira said he went to the federal police shortly after his removal from the plant.

In November 2014, two months after his Peccin discovery, Teixeira said he was removed from inspecting meatpacking plants altogether by his boss Nascimento. He was assigned instead to his current post -- inspecting veterinary medicines.

415,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2017 01:39PM ET</span>","Trump greenlights Keystone XL pipeline, but obstacles loom","By Jeff Mason and Ethan Lou
WASHINGTON/CALGARY (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration approved TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL pipeline on Friday, cheering the oil industry and angering environmentalists even as further hurdles for the controversial project loom.
The approval reverses a decision by former President Barack Obama to reject the project, but the company still needs to win financing, acquire local permits, and fend off likely legal challenges for the pipeline to be built.
""Transcanada will finally be allowed to complete this long-overdue project with efficiency and with speed,"" Trump said in the Oval Office before turning to ask TransCanada (TO:TRP) Chief Executive Officer Russell Girling when construction would start.
""We've got some work to do in Nebraska to get our permits there,"" Girling replied.
""Nebraska?"" Trump said. ""I'll call Nebraska.""
Trump announced the presidential permit for Keystone XL at the White House with Girling and Sean McGarvey, president of North America's Building Trades Unions, standing nearby. He said the project would lower consumer fuel prices, create jobs and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
TransCanada's U.S.-listed shares (N:TRP) rose 0.52 percent to $46.50, having surged as much as 7 percent in premarket trading.
    The pipeline linking Canadian oil sands to U.S. refiners had been blocked by Obama, who said it would do nothing to reduce fuel prices for U.S. motorists and would contribute to emissions linked to global warming.
Trump, however, campaigned on a promise to approve it, and he signed an executive order soon after taking office in January to advance the project.
JOBS
Trump has claimed the project would create 28,000 jobs in the United States. But a 2014 State Department study predicted just 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs. 
The president said he would get in touch with Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts later in the day.
TransCanada applied to the Nebraska Public Service Commission in February for approval of the pipeline's route through the state. The company said it expects that process to conclude this year.
Ricketts said in a statement posted on Twitter that the project would help his state. 
""I have full confidence that the Public Service Commission will conduct a thorough and fair review of the application,"" he said.
The White House has said the pipeline is exempt from a Trump executive order requiring new pipelines to be made from U.S. steel, because much of the pipe for the project has already been built and stockpiled.
""As we move forward, we'll continue to look to buy the rest of the materials we need from ... American manufacturers. We'll put American workers to work,"" Girling told reporters. 
Environmental groups vowed to fight it. 
Greenpeace said it would pressure banks to withhold financing for the multi-billion dollar project, and others said they would fight the pipeline in court.
""We'll use every tool in the kit,"" said Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
Since Obama had nixed the pipeline based on an environmental assessment commissioned by the State Department in early 2014, opponents will likely argue in court that Trump can’t reverse the decision without conducting a new assessment.
CHALLENGES
Fred Jauss, partner at the international law firm Dorsey & Whitney and a former attorney with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said local permitting would also be a challenge.
""The Presidential Permit is only one part of a web of federal, state, and local permits that must be obtained prior to starting construction,"" he said. ""Other federal agencies, such as the Army Corps of Engineers, state regulatory commissions, and even local planning boards may have requirements that need to be fulfilled by Keystone prior to construction.""
""In addition, TransCanada may still need to reach deals with hundreds of potentially affected landowners on the pipeline’s route. There is a lot of work ahead for TransCanada.”
The multibillion-dollar Keystone XL pipeline would bring more than 800,000 barrels per day of heavy crude from Canada's oil sands in Alberta into Nebraska, linking to an existing pipeline network feeding U.S. refineries and ports along the Gulf of Mexico. 
The project could be a boon for Canada, which has struggled to get its vast oil reserves to market.
""Our government has always been supportive of the Keystone XL pipeline and we are pleased with the U.S. decision,"" said a spokesman for Canada's minister of natural resources. ""The importance of a common, continental energy market cannot be overstated.""
The president of the American Petroleum Institute, Jack Gerard, said the approval was ""welcome news"" and would bolster U.S. energy security.
Expedited approval of projects is part of Trump's approach to a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure package he promised on the campaign trail. The White House is looking for ways to speed up approvals and permits for other infrastructure projects, which can sometimes take years to go through a regulatory maze.

TransCanada tried for more than five years to build the 1,179-mile (1,897-km) pipeline, until Obama rejected it in 2015. The company resubmitted its application for the project in January, after Trump signed the executive order smoothing its path.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil was little changed in thin trade on Friday, but prices remained on track for weekly losses of about 2 percent as concerns persisted over an excess of crude.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were up 3 cents at $47.73 a barrel by 11:25 a.m. EDT, set for a more than 2 percent loss on the week. About 225,000 WTI contracts had changed hands, lower than average.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 4 cents at $50.54, also down about 2 percent this week.
Oil has been on the back foot for more than two weeks now, after a string of U.S. inventory reports suggested that output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries were not having the desired effect in reducing global oversupply. 
On Thursday, however, a Saudi energy ministry official told Reuters that crude exports to the United States in March would fall by around 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from February and hold at those levels for the next few months.
The official said the expected drop, in line with OPEC's agreement, could help draw down U.S. inventories that stood at a record 533 million barrels last week - stocks that have in part remained buoyant because of reduced seasonal refining runs. 
The OPEC kingpin's exports to other regions, notably Asia, remained elevated despite the OPEC-led deal that includes other producers like Russia to cut output by 1.8 million bpd during the first half of the year. 
Unless OPEC extends the curbs beyond June or makes bigger cuts, traders say oil prices are at risk of falling further.
""OPEC's goal of drawing down inventories to normal levels is not going to be reached before their agreement expires on June 30,"" said U.S. investment bank Jefferies in a note to clients.
Many are now watching for whether OPEC, whose committee monitoring the cuts will meet over the weekend in Kuwait, will extend the deal. 
In Russia, private oil producers are ditching their skepticism and lining up behind an extension of output cuts after previous oil price increases compensated for lost income.
In the United States, shale drilling has pushed up oil production  by more than 8 percent since mid-2016 to just above 9.1 million bpd, though producers have left a record number of wells unfinished in Permian, the largest oilfield in the country, a sign that output may not rise as swiftly as drilling activity would indicate.

The latest U.S. drilling rig count, which has shown nine straight weekly rises, is due after 1 p.m. (1700 GMT). [RIG/U]

418,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2017 11:44AM ET</span>","EU stalls Russian gas pipeline, but probably won't stop it","By Alissa de Carbonnel and Vera Eckert
BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Russia has the European Union in a bind.
The bloc is divided between eastern European and Baltic Sea countries that see a new pipeline carrying Russian gas across the Baltic making the EU a hostage to Moscow - and those in northern Europe, most especially the main beneficiary Germany, for whom the economic benefits take priority.
The result, EU sources say, is that the EU executive, the Commission, sensing that there may ultimately be no legal basis to block approval of Nord Stream 2, is delaying it as long as possible, hoping to get past 2019 - the date when Russia must renegotiate a gas transit deal with Ukraine.
""There's a difference between not supporting the project and having a legal basis to stop it,"" said one EU diplomat, adding that the aim for now was ""a break to avoid the project going anywhere in 2019"".
And for now, that means doing nothing, to the intense frustration of members such as Denmark, whose prime minister challenged the Commission at a summit of EU leaders this month to make good on strong words criticizing the pipeline.
Last summer, seven eastern member states, all formerly dominated by Moscow and at the center of an EU antitrust case accusing Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) of abusing its market dominance, sent a letter of protest to Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. They too are still waiting for a clear response.
EU sources say the Commission is in fact cultivating uncertainty by hinting that the pipeline may fall foul of EU rules, in the hope of scaring off Western investors, for a time at least.
And in fact, last July, Gazprom's Western partners - Uniper (DE:EONGn), Wintershall (DE:BASFn), Shell (L:RDSa), OMV (VI:OMVV) and Engie (PA:ENGIE) - did withdraw from pledges to provide 1.2 billion euros of equity for the pipeline, a twin to Nord Stream 1, which began pumping in 2011.
DEEP DIVISIONS
Germany is also not actively promoting the pipeline for now, with a parliamentary election looming this autumn. ""The feeling is: 'Why use up political capital to defend it?"" said one EU diplomat.
Broadly, the plan to bring more Russian gas to Europe plays into deep divisions between EU nations over whether to do more business with Moscow while countering its military power plays in Ukraine and Syria.
Germany itself has taken a firm stance on maintaining economic sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Crimea and its support for rebels in eastern Ukraine.
But it also argues that EU market rules guarantee that the pipeline remains a purely commercial project, while eastern and Baltic states accuse President Vladimir Putin of exploiting energy exports as a geopolitical tool.
Meanwhile, littoral states that feel increasingly threatened by Moscow's military posturing in and around the Baltic Sea want clarity from Brussels before going ahead with routine environmental assessments of Nord Stream 2.
    ""This has lots of geopolitical questions and it is not fair that one country should answer alone whether this is an good idea,"" Danish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen said last month.
""This is not a question only for Denmark but for the European Union.""
Russia already accounts for one-third of EU gas imports, and that could rise with the help of Nord Stream 2, as Gazprom fights for market share with the EU's domestic supplies decreasing.
It would also sharply reduce the need for Russia to export gas through Ukraine, where the EU is trying to support stumbling economic reforms. This would deprive Kiev of lucrative transit fees, and of a lever in its tortured relations with Moscow.
Hence the Commission's desire to at least stall approval until 2019.
STALLING, NOT STOPPING
But sooner or later, EU sources grudgingly admit that Russia's determined push for Nord Stream 2 looks set to carry it over the numerous legal and financial hurdles in its path.
Gazprom's Western partner firms say they are looking for new ways to share the financial burden, notwithstanding the uncertainty.
""If it isn't stopped politically, its commercial logic will prevail,"" one industry source said.
Gazprom is busily ordering steel pipes, renting facilities in Sweden, Finland and Germany and applying for permits to lay the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipe.
And Germany, by hosting the end-point of the 55 billion cubic meter a year pipeline, stands to grow into a gas hub for central, eastern and southern Europe, alongside the Dutch and British markets.
""What Germany wants, Germany gets,"" said one official in Brussels.
In an opinion seen by Reuters, it the Commission argued last January for EU gas market liberalization rules to be applied to Nord Stream 2, citing ""serious diversification and security of supply concerns"".
But that was rejected by the EU's own lawyers as well as the German energy regulator, the Bundesnetzagentur.
Responding this month to a missive from Brussels, the Bundesnetzagentur said Nord Stream 2 should simply be treated as an import pipeline like Nord Stream 1, Algeria's Medgaz and Libya's Greenstream.
To subject it to internal EU energy market rules would be ""just as inappropriate as it would be improper"", the agency's president, Jochen Homann, wrote in the March 3 letter, seen by Reuters.
""MONEY TALKS""
Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said on Tuesday that talks with the agency were far from over, insisting that EU rules to promote competition passed since Nord Stream 1 was built should apply to the new pipeline.
""Key EU legal principles must also be respected in the offshore part of the pipeline,"" he told Reuters. ""We'll negotiate with the German regulator how to secure that.""
He said the legal tussle should be dealt with via an intergovernmental agreement between Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel - which both sides have eschewed.
That would give the EU a chance to vet the deal under new rules, adopted on Tuesday, that give Brussels the power to vet oil and gas deals with outside countries to guard against anti-competitive practices and supply disruptions.
There are also legal questions over Eugal, a smaller pipeline intended to feed gas from the offshore Nord Stream 2 to Germany and beyond.
German regulatory sources say they will not approve Eugal until Europe's highest court decides whether to uphold a deal between EU regulators and Germany to remove limits on Gazprom's access to a similar pipeline running from Nord Stream 1. 
That ruling could take up to two years, although an interim ruling is expected to give a signal within weeks.
Ultimately, the pipeline means big business.
Building up a case to comply with German regulation, five pipeline operators ran an auction this month that indicated demand from shippers for almost the full capacity of the Eugal pipeline over 20 years from 2019.
When Sweden's government voiced national security concerns over Gazprom using the island of Gotland as a base for construction, several other ports stepped forward hoping to win the business. The chosen site, Karlshamn, stands to benefit from 100 million SEK ($11.3 million) worth of business.
""Money talks,"" said one EU diplomat. ""If it's not illegal, then politically there's little we can do.""

One senior German industry source put it bluntly: ""I don't care where the gas comes from as long as they are pumping more.""

420,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 24, 2017 07:32AM ET</span>",Crude moves higher but supply glut concerns persist,"Investing.com - U.S. oil prices moved higher on Friday, following news of a decline in Saudi oil exports to the U.S., although concerns over high U.S. production and inventories continued to weigh.
U.S. crude futures for May delivery were up 0.50% at $47.94 a barrel, not far from Wednesday’s four-month low of $47.08.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the May Brent contract advanced 0.40% to trade at $50.75 a barrel, still close to Wednesday’s four-month trough of $49.73.
Crude prices were boosted after Saudi Arabia said its crude exports to the United States in March would fall by around 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) from February, in line with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ agreement to reduce supply.
However, to other major consumer regions, Saudi exports remain high.
 But traders were still cautious after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report on Wednesday that crude oil inventories rose by 5.0 million barrels last week to an all-time high of 533.1 million.
Oil prices have dropped this month amid concerns the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC and other oil producers including Russia agreed last November to cut output by 1.8 million bpd during the first half of the year in order to reduce global supply.
OPEC's latest monthly report showed global oil stocks in January rose to 278 million barrels above the five-year average."
421,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2017 07:14AM ET</span>","All drill, no frack: U.S. shale leaves thousands of wells unfinished","By Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are drilling at the highest rate in 18 months but have left a record number of wells unfinished in the largest oilfield in the country – a sign that output may not rise as swiftly as drilling activity would indicate.
Rising U.S. shale output has rattled OPEC's most influential exporter Saudi Arabia and pushed oil prices to a near four-month low on Wednesday. U.S. production gains are frustrating Saudi-led attempts by the world's top oil exporters to cut supply, drain record-high inventories and lift prices.
Investors watch data on the number of rigs deployed in North American oil and gas fields as a leading indicator for output. But the rising rig count and frenetic drilling activity in the Permian Basin in West Texas is not all about pumping oil. 
During the 2014-2016 downturn in global oil prices, the number of wells left incomplete grew as companies shut down rigs, laid off workers and retreated from the fields. When prices picked up, operators were expected to pump the oil from those incomplete wells before spending money on drilling new ones.
Instead, the number of incomplete wells has risen. A record 1,764 wells were left unfinished in the Permian in February, according to U.S. government data going back to December 2013. In February alone, 395 wells were drilled and only 300 completed. That was the highest drilling rate in the Permian in two years. 
The surprise surge in unfinished wells indicates that investors, traders and oil market players may need to reinterpret rig count data.
""You would now be looking at the number of wells drilled and the uncompleted wells and not necessarily the rig count,"" said Bruce Bullock, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. 
Reuters interviews with more than a dozen well completion service providers, oil and gas lawyers and industry experts show that some operators are drilling because their leases require them to do so within a specified time limit to keep their leases. But they may not be required to actually pump the oil immediately after they have drilled the hole.
(For a graphic on the number of incomplete wells, click: http://tmsnrt.rs/2mYJlgN)
To complete a well, shale producers stuff the hole with sand, water and chemicals at high pressure until the rock fractures and releases the oil contained in its pores.
There is typically a lag of a few months between drilling and completion in government data, so some of the increase in unfinished wells can be explained by rising activity.
Some leases do require firms to produce a minimum volume of oil. On those leases, many firms will frack one well and leave others incomplete. That allows them to meet their contracts with land holders but gives them flexibility to come back and pump the oil later. 
LEASE VALUES JUMP
The value of land in the Permian has rocketed as oil prices recovered to around $50 a barrel, so oil firms are now scrambling to do the required drilling to keep leases they had left dormant. 
""During the period where we had the downturn in price, there were a lot of leases that were in danger of being lost ... they had to drill a well to maintain it,"" said Michael Stoltz, an attorney who represents energy firms in Texas for Stubbeman, McRae, Sealy, Laughlin & Browder Inc.
A new lease could cost the operator as much as five times more than a few years ago, said Joe Dancy, an oil and gas lawyer, who helps negotiations on such deals. Drilling costs are also on the rise, adding to the rush by producers trying to stay ahead of price inflation. 
Fracking is more expensive than drilling and is time consuming. As much as 70 percent of well completion costs are tied to fracking, while 30 percent is for drilling, experts say.
Fracking crews are in short supply, which is another reason that oil firms have delayed completion. 
As activity has picked up in the Permian, the labor market has tightened. Many oil workers found jobs elsewhere during the downturn, so rebuilding the workforce is taking time. 
""There were a number of completions that were originally scheduled in first quarter and you've seen those slide to Q2 and that's really being driven by ... access to service crews and things like that,"" said Tom Stoelk, the CFO and interim CEO of Northern Oil & Gas Inc, a producer focused on the Williston Basin in North Dakota and Montana. 
MORE INVENTORIES
The number of incomplete wells could complicate OPEC's attempt to balance markets, as they could be completed relatively quickly if the oil price rises.
Saudi Arabia is targeting a $60 per barrel price, and that could trigger those well completions and bring a new wave of supply to the market. 
If all the incomplete wells in the Permian pump instantaneously, output from the field could jump as much as 300,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
In February, the field accounted for about 2.1 million bpd, or about 23 percent of total U.S. crude output of about 9 million bpd, according to U.S. government data.
LOCKING IN LEASES AND COSTS
Landowners lease their land to energy companies for an upfront lump sum or signing bonus and subsequent royalty payments.
A standard lease lasts three years, with an option to extend for another two years, said sources who work with companies on such agreements.
Leases vary greatly. Some require drilling but no production, others require production, and some require a well every six months. None of them require firms to complete all the wells they drill.
Continental Resources Inc, which has about 185 such drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs) in the Bakken in North Dakota, says that innovation during the downturn meant it could now complete those wells more cost efficiently.

""We're glad we saved all those wells,"" CEO Harold Hamm said at an industry conference this month.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' environment ministry has allowed eight suspended nickel ore miners to ship out stockpiles of mined ore, sources told Reuters, temporarily boosting supply from the world's top exporter of the raw metal after a major crackdown.
More than half of all mines in the Philippines have been ordered to permanently shut to protect watersheds in an eight-month campaign led by Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Regina Lopez. 
Allowing the halted mines to sell their stocked nickel ore is aimed at limiting the potential build up of silt in nearby waters, an official with knowledge of the order said, rather than the government toning down its campaign.
The volume of nickel ore stocks from the mines may well exceed 1 million tonnes, or about a month's worth of consumption by top buyer China, said the official, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The total would likely be less than 5 million tonnes, he added.
Daniel Hynes, commodity strategist at ANZ Bank, said he did not expect the temporary boost in Philippine supply to be a big drag on nickel prices.
""It certainly doesn't remove the long-term issues around security of supply and the closures of other operations,"" Hynes said.
Still, three-month nickel on the London Metal Exchange  fell 1 percent to $9,935 a tonne by 0600 GMT, the biggest decliner among base metals on Friday. Nickel has lost more than 9 percent this month, following a 10 percent spike in February when Lopez ordered the mine closures.
ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD
In a memorandum issued on March 6, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, Lopez allowed the eight suspended nickel miners to remove their stockpiles from all mining areas. 
The order also required the mines to put 2 million pesos ($39,730) per hectare of disturbed land into a trust fund ""to further mitigate the adverse impacts of the mining operations to the environment and to the affected communities.""
Environment Undersecretary Philip Camara confirmed the memorandum is valid, a spokeswoman for the ministry said.
The eight miners, including Hinatuan Mining Corp - a unit of top nickel ore producer Nickel Asia Corp (PS:NIKL) - were among 10 suspended for environmental breaches during a July-August audit of the nation's 41 mines. 
Lopez last month ordered 23 mines closed for good, including six of the eight suspended nickel producers. Many of these mines have appealed to President Rodrigo Duterte and continue to operate while waiting for Duterte's final ruling.
The suspended miners had asked Lopez's permission to remove the mined ore and were granted it, the first official said.
""It's an issue of environmental hazard. If we don't allow it then it will just be a hazard so it needs to be removed,"" the official said. Another official with the environment ministry confirmed the mines can ship out the ore.
Two of the suspended mines are owned by construction-to-power firm DMCI Holdings Inc (PS:DMC), which was planning to restart the mines this month while it awaits the outcome of an appeal, in a test of rules around the crackdown.
Hendrik Martin, manager at DMCI's nickel mine in Zambales province, said the company had received the order from the environment agency and would likely sell its 200,000-tonne stockpile to China.
DMCI Mining Corp President Cesar Simbulan separately said stockpiles at its Berong Nickel Corp in Palawan province stand at around 1 million tonnes. Hauling of the stocks from the Zambales and Palawan mines to the ports had yet to start, he added.
Nearly all of the Philippines' nickel ore is sold to China where it is used to produce stainless steel. Philippine shipments reached 30.5 million tonnes last year, or 95 percent of China's total imports of the raw material.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The European Union has asked Brazil to voluntarily suspend all shipments of meat to its member countries to avoid imposing a ban that would take time to lift, but the Brazilian government has not agreed, EU diplomats in Brasilia told Reuters on Thursday.
Brazilian meat exports have in any case ground almost to a halt following a police investigation into corruption involving food-sanitation inspectors and accusations that rotten products were sold.
A spokeswoman said Brazilian Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi was not aware of the request.
The Brazilian government suspended meat shipments from the 21 meat-packing plants under investigation by the federal police, while insisting the quality of Brazilian meat was not in doubt.
But European farm groups called on the EU Commission on Thursday to take stronger action against Brazilian meat imports because of the scandal. EU experts meet in Brussels on Friday to decide on possible further measures.
The EU had already suspended imports from four Brazilian meat-processing facilities earlier this week.
EU ambassadors have been seeking more information on the irregularities discovered in Brazil's meat industry and have criticized Brazil's government for failing to deal with the problem as a public health issue, according to a European diplomat who attended a EU meeting on Wednesday.
""We asked the Brazilians to suspend all exports but they refused,"" said the diplomat, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
""There is overall disappointment with the way Brazil is treating this as a public relations issue rather than from a public health point of view,"" the diplomat said.
Another European diplomatic source confirmed the request that Brazil voluntarily suspend all meat shipments to the EU because a ban would take a long time to undo, whereas meat sales could resume at any time if Brazil held off shipments.
LARGEST MEAT EXPORTER
The corruption scandal has hurt Brazil's reputation as the world's largest meat exporter, with sales of almost $14 billion last year. The industry employs 4 million workers.
Brazil's JBS S.A. (SA:JBSS3), the world's biggest meat processor, said on Thursday it suspended beef production at 33 of its 36 plants in Brazil for three days because of the lack of sales.
A dozen countries, including Brazil's largest trading partner, China, have suspended imports of Brazilian meat as a precaution, and eight others have stopped imports from the plants under investigation.
Brazil exported beef, chicken, pork and other meat products worth $1.76 billion to EU members in 2017, and a similar amount to China, where some of the largest Chinese food suppliers have pulled Brazilian beef and poultry from shelves.
Brazilian President Michel Temer said he would call his Chinese counterpart to urge China to review its import ban.
Maggi said on Wednesday that Brazilian meat exports sank to $74,000 on Tuesday from a daily average of $63 million. He told a congressional hearing the scandal could cost the meatpackers $1.5 billion or 10 percent of annual meat exports.
He said on Thursday the police announcement of the corruption probe was exaggerated and wrongly suggested meat quality was being investigated instead of the individuals who violated sanitary rules.
Still, European farm groups Copa and Cogeca said corruption cases were unacceptable.

Brazil's failure to apply EU-equivalent food safety standards raises ""serious concerns"" about ongoing trade talks between the EU and South American trade bloc Mercosur that Brazil is part of, they said in a letter to the EU Commission.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department plans to approve on Friday the permit needed to proceed with construction of the Canada-to-United States Keystone XL oil pipeline, a project blocked by former President Barack Obama, according to two government sources familiar with the process.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the administration would provide an update on Keystone on Friday but did not offer any details.
Two government sources, who declined to be identified, said on Thursday that the pipeline approval would be announced by the White House. 
One of the sources said the State Department was working to get the approval completed before Monday, the end of the 60-day timeline under Trump's January executive order for the construction of Keystone and the Dakota Access pipelines.
The move would mark the beginning of a process that could be lengthy. Approvals are needed from state regulators, and the project could face legal challenges. 
But Republican President Donald Trump supports Keystone and, days after he took office in January, ordered its construction. That could mean the project, proposed in 2008, will eventually be completed. 
The State Department's undersecretary for political affairs, Tom Shannon, is expected approve the cross-border permit for TransCanada Corp's pipeline since Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), recused himself from the matter. 
The multi-billion dollar Keystone pipeline would bring more than 800,000 barrels-per-day of heavy crude from Canada's oil sands to U.S. refineries and ports along the Gulf of Mexico, via an existing pipeline network in Nebraska.
Obama had rejected the pipeline saying it would do nothing to reduce fuel prices for U.S. motorists and would contribute emissions linked to global warming. 
TransCanada resubmitted its permit application after Trump's executive order. Spokesman Terry Cunha said the company was working closely with the State Department. 
""Monday is the deadline, so that's what we're working towards,"" Cunha said. 
Conservatives said they supported quick approval. Nick Loris, an energy and environment researcher at the Heritage Foundation, said approval would ""reestablish some certainty and sanity to a permitting process that was hijacked by political pandering."" 
Environmental groups said they had been prepared for the approval and vowed Thursday to fight the pipeline at every turn with petitions, political pressure and mass protests.
""The same communities who defeated this pipeline before - indigenous leaders, landowners, farmers and grassroots activists - are ready to fight again,"" said May Boeve, director of activist group 350.org. 
Diana Best, a Greenpeace climate campaign specialist said, ""We will resist these projects with our allies across the country and across borders."" 
FURTHER HURDLES
A stretch of Keystone XL also awaits approval from Nebraska regulators. Transcanada has to file its pipeline route plans with the state's Public Service Commission, which is required to hold public hearings on the proposal.
Keystone's construction costs could be higher than the $7 billion estimated after it was first proposed, said Michael Wojciechowski, vice president of Americas oil and refining markets research at Wood Mackenzie. 
""Final costs are still to be determined, but they have done nothing but go up over time,"" he said. 

Still, there could also be some savings on labor given recent layoffs due to the recent oil price drop, he said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's crude exports to the United States in March will fall by around 300,000 barrels per day from February, in line with OPEC's agreement to reduce supply, a Saudi energy ministry official said on Thursday.
The United States imported about 1.3 million bpd from OPEC's top exporter in February, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. 
""Exports may fluctuate week on week, but on average in March exports will be down,"" the official said, responding to a Reuters request to comment on the EIA data. Saudi exports are then expected to remain around March's level for the next few months, the official said. 
The official noted that export data showed higher Saudi oil exports in January and February, but these shipments were the result of cargo loaded in November and December. 
Saudi Arabia has made the largest cut in production after the agreement reached last year by both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers to reduce output by 1.8 million bpd. 
Oil prices have been in a downtrend for two weeks on concerns that OPEC cuts so far have not dented record U.S. crude inventories. U.S. crude has declined nearly 10 percent since March 7 as speculators reduced big bets that oil would keep rising. It settled on $47.70 on Thursday. 
Crude stocks in the United States, the world's largest oil consumer, were a record 533 million barrels last week, the EIA said. In the week ended March 17, U.S. imports from Saudi Arabia unexpectedly rose by more than 200,000 bpd to 1.28 million bpd, after a sharp decline the prior week.
The official said lower Saudi exports to the U.S. is likely to affect stockpiling in the U.S. 
""This is mainly because there is a refinery maintenance in the U.S. The cuts in exports will help the crude stockpiling in the U.S. to go down,"" the official said.
Gasoline stocks are falling, but remain seasonally high.

The official also said he believed other Gulf oil exporters will follow suit and their crude exports will be lower in March and will continue to decline. Imports from Iraq and Kuwait dropped sharply for the week to March 10 but then rebounded in the most recent week of data.

Next week will be mostly mild to warm across the country with limited demand for heating or cooling besides the far northern U.S., according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
Prices of the heating fuel are down around 20% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.

435,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2017 07:20AM ET</span>","As Trump targets energy rules, oil companies downplay their impact","By Richard Valdmanis
BOSTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s White House has said his plans to slash environmental regulations will trigger a new energy boom and help the United States drill its way to independence from foreign oil.
But the top U.S. oil and gas companies have been telling their shareholders that regulations have little impact on their business, according to a Reuters review of U.S. securities filings from the top producers.
In annual reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 13 of the 15 biggest U.S. oil and gas producers said that compliance with current regulations is not impacting their operations or their financial condition. 
The other two made no comment about whether their businesses were materially affected by regulation, but reported spending on compliance with environmental regulations at less than 3 percent of revenue.
The dissonance raises questions about whether Trump’s war on regulation can increase domestic oil and gas output, as he has promised, or boost profits and share prices of oil and gas companies, as some investors have hoped.
According to the SEC, a publicly traded company must deem a matter ""material"" and report it to the agency if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important.
""Materiality is a fairly low bar,"" said Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who runs the university’s research program on regulation. ""Despite exaggerated claims, regulatory costs are usually a very small portion of many companies’ cost of doing business.""
The oil majors’ annual filings come after the industry and its political allies have spent years criticizing the Obama administration for policies aimed at reducing fossil-fuel consumption, curtailing drilling on federal lands and subsidizing renewable energy.
Trump promised during the campaign that a rollback of the Democratic administration’s policies would help free the nation from reliance on imported oil.
""Under my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence,"" said Trump, describing regulation as a ""self-inflicted wound.""
The Trump administration is now preparing an executive order - dubbed the ""Energy Independence"" executive order - to roll back Obama-era regulations, which could be signed as early as this month, according to administration officials.
U.S. presidents have aimed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day - almost enough meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined.
""ENERGY RENAISSANCE""
The Trump administration’s attacks on regulation have been applauded by the oil industry.
""We haven’t seen 3 percent growth in the economy for eight years, and I think part of the reason is that we’ve had a heavy dose of regulation,""  Chevron  Corp. (N:CVX) CEO John Watson said at CERAWeek, a global energy conference in Houston this month.
Continental Resources (N:CLR) CEO, Harold Hamm, who advised Trump on energy issues during his campaign for the White House, told the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July that stripping regulation could allow the country to double its production of oil and gas, triggering a new ""American energy renaissance.""
Yet Continental's annual report, filed last month with the SEC, says environmental regulation - after eight years under the Obama administration - does not have a ""material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors.""
Continental's competitors who reported actual spending on environmental compliance told investors that such expenses amount to a small percentage of operating revenues.
Fourteen of the 15 companies whose filings were reviewed by Reuters declined to comment on their statements to investors or the impact of regulation on their profits.
A spokesman for ConocoPhillips acknowledged that regulatory compliance has not had a material adverse impact on the company's liquidity or financial position. But red tape can be an unwelcome burden nonetheless.
""Changing, excessive, overlapping, duplicative and potentially conflicting regulations increase costs, cause potential delays and negatively impact investment decisions, with great cost to consumers of energy,"" the spokesman, Daren Beaudo, said in a written statement.
The American Petroleum Institute - which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry - also declined to comment.
Last month, before the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, API President Jack Gerard said that the oil and gas industry has surged forward despite onerous regulations under the Obama administration.
""Technological innovations and industry leadership have propelled the oil and gas industry forward despite the unprecedented onslaught of 145 new and pending federal regulatory actions targeting our industry.""
Though the industry saw a staunch opponent in Obama, oil and gas production soared more than 50 percent during his presidency. That was mainly because of high oil prices and improved hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technology that has allowed producers to access new reserves in previously tough-to -reach shale formations.
The rush of production ultimately contributed to a global glut that dropped crude oil prices (CLc1) from a high of over $100 a barrel in early 2014 to a low of nearly $25 by 2016. Current prices hover near $50 a barrel.
NO ""MATERIAL"" IMPACT
Four of the 15 companies reviewed by Reuters reported that spending on environmental matters - including new equipment or facilities, as well as fines and compliance staffing - amounted to a small fraction of revenues.
 Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) reported spending $4.9 billion worldwide in 2016, or about 2.24 percent of gross revenue. Occidental Petroleum (N:OXY), a much smaller company, reported spending $285 million, or about 2.82 percent of revenue. Neither addressed whether the spending was ""material"" in their filings.
Two other companies, ConocoPhillips (N:COP) and Chevron, also broke out their environmental spending while reporting that regulation had no material impact on their business. Conoco spent $627 million in 2016, or about 2.57 percent of gross revenue, while Chevron spent $2.1 billion, or 1.91 percent of gross revenue.
The other 11 companies did not break out spending, but all of them told the SEC that environmental regulation did not have a material impact on their business.
In one typical statement, EOG Resources (N:EOG), one of the biggest U.S. producers, told investors in a report filed last month: ""Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOG's operations, financial condition or results of operations."" 
 Devon Energy  Corp (N:DVN), Anadarko Petroleum Corp (N:APC),  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co (N:PXD),  Apache Corp  (N:APA), and other large U.S.-focused oil and gas drillers used similar wording.
""ABSENCE OF A NEGATIVE""
Still, Obama's exit - and Trump's win over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in November - has been enough to brighten the outlook of some big investors.
""I believe the absence of a negative is a positive,"" John Dowd, who manages several energy funds at Fidelity Investments, wrote in his 2017 energy outlook. ""The market has been concerned with the sustainability of fracking, and particularly to what extent it might have been regulated into obscurity by a different election outcome.""
Clinton had said during her campaign that she planned to increase regulation on fracking.
Other segments of the energy industry, such as coal mining and oil refining, were harder hit by environmental protection measures during Obama's presidency. Several coal companies went bankrupt in recent years and blamed Obama’s climate change initiatives for raising costs and hurting demand.
Refiners have also long complained that environmental regulations have stymied attempts to build new refineries and that they have borne the brunt of costly rules requiring them to blend biofuels into their gasoline.
Still, some energy analysts and regulation experts point out that the biggest drivers for these industries, too, tend to be supply and demand – not regulation.
The abundance of cheap natural gas is seen as the biggest obstacle to reviving coal country, since both fuels compete for space in the furnaces of U.S. power plants. For refiners, the key driver for profitability is the differential between the price of their raw material, crude oil, and the fuels they make with it.
""Supply and demand are the fundamental forces driving markets,"" said Coglianese, the University of Pennsylvania law professor. ""Regulation is relatively trivial.""

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude May contract tacked on 30 cents, or around 0.6%, to $48.34 a barrel by 5:35AM ET (09:35GMT).
The U.S. benchmark settled lower for the third session in a row on Wednesday after touching its weakest level since November 30 at $47.01 after government data showed U.S. crude supplies rose more than expected last week.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London added 30 cents to $50.94 a barrel. The global benchmark sank to $49.71 in the prior session, its cheapest since November 30.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 5.0 million barrels last week to an all-time high of 533.1 million.
Oil has fallen sharply this month amid concern that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC agreed in November last year to curb its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day between January and June. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 barrels per day.
In total, they agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the first six months of the year, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
OPEC's latest monthly report showed global oil stocks in January rose to 278 million barrels above the five-year average.
OPEC members increasingly favor extending the output curb beyond June to balance the market, sources within the group said, although they added that this would require non-OPEC members such as Russia to also step up their efforts.
Kuwait is scheduled to host a ministerial meeting on March 26 comprising both OPEC and non-OPEC members to review compliance with the output agreement and to discuss whether cuts would be extended beyond June.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for April inched up 0.2 cents, or 0.2%, to $1.603 a gallon, while April heating oil rose 0.3 cents to $1.499 a gallon.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed off four-month lows on Thursday but the recovery was cautious with investors fretting that OPEC-led supply cuts were not yet reducing record U.S. crude inventories.
Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil, was trading at $50.84 a barrel by 0915 GMT, up 20 cents on the day and rebounding from Wednesday's slide to $49.71, it lowest level since Nov. 30 when OPEC announced plans to cut output.
U.S. light crude was up 20 cents at $48.24.
Brent remains well below this year's high above $58, hit shortly after Jan. 1 when the deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC states to curb supplies by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) came into effect.
Global stockpiles have continued rising since then. On Wednesday, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed U.S. inventories jumped by a bigger-than-expected 5 million barrels last week to 533.1 million. [EIA/S]
While OPEC has broadly met its commitments to reduce output, non-OPEC producers have yet to fully deliver on pledged cuts and U.S. shale oil producers have been pumping more oil after crude prices recovered from last year's drop below $30.
Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader, said OPEC was ""underwriting the investment plans and returns of their competition in U.S. shale oil"".
He said oil prices could fall further due to U.S. output and a lack of compliance by some producers who said they would cut.
London-based  Barclays  (LON:BARC) bank offered a more upbeat assessment, saying the latest oil price weakness would not last into the second quarter. The bank forecast a modest recovery.
""We see a rebound to the high $50 and $60 range in Q2 as inventories draw and the market readies for the peak driving and demand season,"" the bank wrote in a note to clients.

It said inventories held by industrialized nations would be eroded by the end of the second quarter, sliding to OPEC's target level of the five-year average.

Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury yields edged higher, with the benchmark 10-year note yield rising to 2.412%. Yields fell to a three-week low of 2.375% on Wednesday.
The greenback, along with Treasury yields, have been on the retreat since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday last week, but stuck to its outlook for two more hikes this year, instead of three expected by the market.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen is due to deliver opening remarks at the Fed's System Community Development Research Conference, in Washington DC at 8:45AM ET (12:45GMT).
Traders are hoping she will offer insight into the likelihood of higher interest rates in the months ahead.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.

It settled higher for the third session in a row on Tuesday after hitting its strongest since February 9 at $3.113.
Warm to mild conditions will dominate most of the U.S. this weekend, even as a spring-like weather system with heavy showers and thunderstorms impacts the central U.S.
Next week will be mostly mild to warm across the country with limited demand for heating or cooling besides the far northern U.S., according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw of 147 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 17.
That compares with a withdrawal of 53 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 15 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 21 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.295 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 7.7% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 15.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Prices of the heating fuel are down around 18% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

447,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2017 09:19AM ET</span>",U.S. farm heartland lobbies to steer Trump away from Mexico trade war,"By Jason Lange and Alexandra Alper
GARNER, Iowa/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Farmers in the U.S. agricultural heartland that helped elect Donald Trump are now pushing his administration to avoid a trade dispute with Mexico, fearing retaliatory tariffs that could hit over $3 billion in U.S. exports.
The value of exports at risk is based on a Reuters analysis of a tariff list which Mexico used in a trucking dispute six years ago and which Mexican officials have said could serve as a model if President Trump sets new barriers to Mexican goods. 
Pork producers contacted Trump's transition team soon after the Nov. 8 election to stress that tariff-free access to Mexico has made it their top export market by volume, said John Weber, president of the National Pork Producers Council.
The council has sent the administration multiple letters, including one signed in January by 133 agricultural organizations, and is arranging for several hog farmers to fly to Washington next month to talk to officials.
""We just keep pounding them on how critical trade is to us,"" said Weber, who fears Mexico could revive the list of mostly agricultural products it successfully used to push Washington into letting Mexican truckers on U.S. highways in 2011. 
Pork products topped that list and, if revived, the tariffs would apply to over $800 million of annual pork exports, according to data compiled by IHS Markit's Global Trade Atlas. ""We'll be the first to take the hit,"" Weber said. 
The lobbying effort by U.S. businesses which rely on the Mexican market shows how Mexico can press its case in Washington despite having an economy 1/17 the size of America's and relying on the U.S. market for nearly 80 percent if its exports.
In Iowa, where pigs outnumber people seven to one, hog and grain farmer Jamie Schmidt voted for Trump in part on his promise to cut regulatory burdens for businesses.
Now he and others who farm the flat, rich land around Garner, Iowa, worry about trade. Schmidt gets about half of his income from hogs, earning $4-5 for each of the 425 pigs he sells per week, usually to a  Tyson Foods  (N:TSN) packing plant in nearby Perry, Iowa. 
Tariffs from Mexico could depress U.S. wholesale prices and wipe out his profits, Schmidt said. ""It would be devastating."" 
IN THE CROSSHAIRS
In December, after fears of a trade dispute fueled a deep peso  slump, Mexico started mapping out U.S. states that are most reliant on its market, replicating the strategy it used in the trucking dispute, said two senior Mexican officials.
Mexican officials also prepared briefs, seen by Reuters, on Mexico's own risks in a dispute, including losing much of its cost advantage in building cars, such as the Ford Fusion (N:F) made in Hermosillo, Mexico. 
Reuters could not verify a complete list of products and states Mexico considered targeting this time around.
But the country's foreign minister said last month tariffs could target Iowa, which raises a third of U.S. hogs and exports about a quarter of its pork production, $100 million of which went to Mexico last year.
The minister also said tariffs could aim at Wisconsin, the center of U.S. cheese production, and has singled out Texas for its ""notable"" trade surplus with Mexico. All three states voted for Trump in the 2016 election, with the president taking Iowa and Wisconsin by slim margins.
Trump has accused Mexico of destroying U.S. jobs and has vowed to leave the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico if he cannot renegotiate better terms with Mexico. United States went from running a small trade surplus with Mexico in the early 1990s to a $63 billion deficit in 2016.
Besides pork, cheese was also a top target in the trucking dispute in which Mexico retaliated with tariffs against rules that banned its trucks from U.S. roads. Some $200 million in current annual exports of cheese would be targeted if the tariff list were revived, according to the IHS database, which the U.S. government uses to measure the impact of trade disputes. The full tariff list would apply to $3.25 billion in current U.S. exports.
John Holevoet, the director of government affairs at Wisconsin's Dairy Business Association, said he has attended multiple meetings with Wisconsin federal lawmakers this year where risks of Mexican trade were discussed.
Weber of the pork producers group said he believed the Trump administration ""gets it"" when it comes to the vulnerability of U.S. farm exports. Republican Congressman Steve King, who represents Iowa's agriculture-focused fourth district, also pointed out that Iowa's role as the first state to hold presidential primaries helps keep farm interests in Washington's view.
But King told Reuters he was worried the White House is still not taking trade risks seriously enough. 
A possible 20 percent tax on Mexican imports, which White House spokesman Sean Spicer has said could also pay for Trump's proposed border wall, would cause a trade war, he said.
King said he has been in contact with the White House on the matter but has yet to secure a one-on-one meeting with the president. ""I'm making sure that here in Washington they know what this means.""

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude May contract shed 78 cents, or around 1.6%, to $47.46 a barrel by 6:10AM ET (10:10GMT), a level not seen since November 30.
The U.S. benchmark settled lower for the third session in a row on Tuesday as the market weighed rising U.S. drilling and growing stockpiles against efforts by major producers to cut output to reduce a global glut.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London sank 84 cents to $50.12 a barrel. The global benchmark touched $50.06 earlier, its cheapest since November 30.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories rose by 4.5 million barrels in the week ended March 17.
The API report also showed a drop of 4.9 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks declined 880,000 barrels.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report at 10:30AM ET (14:30GMT) Wednesday. If the increase is confirmed, it would be the 11th weekly build in the past 13 weeks.
Oil has fallen sharply this month amid concern that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC agreed in November last year to curb its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day between January and June. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 barrels per day.
In total, they agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the first six months of the year, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
OPEC's latest monthly report showed global oil stocks in January rose to 278 million barrels above the five-year average.
OPEC members increasingly favor extending the output curb beyond June to balance the market, sources within the group said, although they added that this would require non-OPEC members such as Russia to also step up their efforts.
Kuwait is scheduled to host a ministerial meeting on March 26 comprising both OPEC and non-OPEC members to review compliance with the output agreement and to discuss whether cuts would be extended beyond June.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped back to three-month lows on Wednesday after data showed U.S. crude inventories rising faster than expected, piling pressure on OPEC to extend output cuts beyond June.
A deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC producers to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 has had little impact on bulging global stockpiles of oil.
Benchmark Brent crude was down 82 cents at $50.14 per barrel at 0936 GMT (5:36 a.m. ET), after dropping to $50.05, its lowest level since OPEC announced on Nov. 30 its plan for cuts. The deal with non-OPEC states was reached in December.
U.S. light crude was down 70 cents at $47.54 a barrel, also slipping toward a three-month low.
""The lower the price goes, the higher the pressure on OPEC to extend cuts,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Carsten Fritsch said.
Sources have said OPEC is inclined to extend but wants backing from non-OPEC producers, including Russia, even though such countries have yet to deliver fully on existing cuts.
On Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute reported U.S. inventories climbed by 4.5 million barrels to 533.6 million last week, a bigger rise than the 2.8 million analysts forecast.
Investors now want to see whether Wednesday's figures from the Energy Information Administration, a unit of the Department of Energy (DoE), confirm the rise.
""A look below $50 (for Brent) is quite possible today if DoE data show a similar pattern, but it's impossible to say how far below $50,"" Commerzbank's Fritsch said.
U.S. shale oil producers have been adding rigs, pushing up the country's oil production to about 9.1 million bpd, from around 8.5 million bpd in late 2016.
""OPEC's market intervention has not yet resulted in significant visible inventory drawdowns, and the financial markets have lost patience,"" U.S. bank Jefferies said in a note.
The bank said OPEC-led cuts would start having an impact in the second half of 2017, but added that U.S. crude production was expected to grow by 360,000 bpd in 2017 and 1 million bpd in 2018.

U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) warned its clients in a note this week that a U.S. shale-led production surge ""could create a material oversupply in 2018-19"".

LAPA, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazilian authorities on Tuesday began scouring meat plants closed after a probe into corruption by health inspectors and the alleged sale of rotten products, as Hong Kong dealt a blow to the world's top beef and poultry exporter with an import ban.
Brazilian President Michel Temer's government has moved quickly since Friday to both address and downplay the scandal in the meatpacking industry, one of the bright spots of an economy struggling with its worst recession on record.
It won a victory earlier on Tuesday when South Korea lifted a ban imposed a day earlier on all poultry imports from BRF SA, the world's largest exporter of that meat.
But Hong Kong's ban, which followed China's decision to block imports of meat from the South American nation, showed the crisis was still not contained. China is the largest consumer of Brazilian meat, followed by Hong Kong.
The European Union also kept its ban on meat coming from four specific plants, while Chile maintained its total import ban. The U.S. Department of Agriculture started testing all shipments of raw beef and ready-to-eat products from Brazil for pathogens.
Brazil's meat investigation is the latest involving federal police and prosecutors and comes on the heels of a massive corruption scandal involving billions of dollars in political kickbacks made by construction giants to win contracts with state-controlled firms, especially the oil company Petrobras. 
That probe has ensnared scores of top politicians, including several ministers in Temer's center-right government. 
The operation targeting meatpackers resulted from a two-year investigation that culminated in raids on processing plants and company offices in seven states late last week.
Police have accused more than 100 people, mostly health inspectors, of taking bribes for allowing the sale of rancid products, falsifying export documents or failing to inspect meatpacking plants at all. 
Among the companies targeted were the world's largest meat producer, JBS SA, and BRF.
Both JBS and BRF strongly reject the accusations and have begun a publicity campaign in Brazil to safeguard their reputations and point out what they say are errors in information the police have disclosed.
Brazil's government also has gone on the offensive against the police operation.
""We are confident there are no public health risks associated with Brazilian meat,"" Luis Eduardo Rangel, secretary for standards at Brazil's agriculture ministry, said before officials began audits of 21 meat plants named by police.
The inspections include a JBS unit that exports to China, the EU and other markets in the southern state of Parana, where the investigation was headquartered.
Luis Boudens, head of the national federation of federal police, defended the police investigation, saying that government and industry criticism was being made to protect an important sector of the economy and politicians. 
""Federal agents have taken down a mafia of businessmen that bribed inspectors ... and politicians to obtain certification to sell meat without any inspections,"" he said in a statement on the federation's website. 
CHINA CONCERNED
The audit of the plants is expected to take three weeks, Rangel said. He added that Chinese officials had asked for assurances on Monday that the sanitary quality of Brazil's meat products had not been compromised. 
""We will present this letter to them today with our assurances and, once we have, we expect that import restrictions will be lifted,"" he said.
In Beijing, officials called on Brazil's meatpacking industry to take stricter safety measures. 
""China is concerned by the quality problems of some meat products in Brazil,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters.
""We hope that the Brazilian side will conduct a thorough investigation of the case ... and take more stringent measures to ensure safe and reliable food exports to China.""

She declined to comment on when the temporary ban on Brazilian meat imports might be lifted.

459,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2017 01:20PM ET</span>","New projects, shale boom could trigger oil oversupply by 2018-19: Goldman","(Reuters) - New production projects and a fresh shale boom could boost oil output by a million barrels per year and result in an oversupply in the next couple of years, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
""2017-19 is likely to see the largest increase in mega projects' production in history, as the record 2011-13 capex commitment yields fruit,"" the U.S. investment bank said in a research note on Tuesday. 
OPEC's landmark decision to limit output for the first time in eight years in a bid to arrest the existing supply glut reduced price volatility and increased stability, unintentionally helping the shale producers, the bank said. 
""OPEC's decision in November 2016 to cut production was rational, in our view, and fit into its role of inventory manager of last resort,"" Goldman said.
""However, the unintended consequence was to underwrite shale activity through a bullish credit market at a time when delayed delivery of the 2011-13 capex boom could lead to record non-OPEC production growth in 2018."" 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to curb its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1 this year. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 bpd. 
OPEC is likely to weigh the risk of long-term market share loss against the benefit of stability before taking a call on extending production curbs, with the industry expected to bring ""onstream a multi-year pipeline of giant developments that tails off only by 2020,"" Goldman said. 
""U.S. shale oil currently offers large-scale development opportunities with 6-9 months to peak production. In this environment, OPEC's rational decision is to leverage on its cost leadership to maximize market share, while managing short-term inventory imbalances,"" the bank said. 

OPEC will have to extend its oil output curbs in order to sustain a recovery in prices, as a revival in crude production outside the group may scupper its efforts to erode an overhang of unused inventory, a Reuters poll of analysts showed last week.

Sources within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have indicated that its members increasingly favor extended production cuts but want the backing of non-OPEC oil producers, such as Russia, which have yet to deliver fully on existing reductions.
""OPEC is sticking with a plan that has not worked,"" said Phil Davis, managing partner at PSW Investments in Woodland Park, New Jersey, noting they are not offering more cuts and no new countries are joining in the cuts.
The group and some non-OPEC producers agreed to curb production from Jan. 1 by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) for six months to drain crude from record stockpiles. But inventories remain stubbornly large.
""We think it is very unlikely that Russia will actively take part in any extension of the production cuts that goes beyond paying lip service to the agreement,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note, adding that it would be premature for investors to ""pin their hopes"" on an extension.
Commerzbank said that OPEC cuts would need to last into the fourth quarter to achieve the group's goal of reducing record oil stockpiles in industrialized nations to their five-year average.

Stocks at Cushing rose in the week to March 10, helping to widen the premium for Brent over WTI . That gap now stands at around $2.82 for May delivery, its highest since the end of January. 

""Another increase would be generally bearish for WTI-related spreads,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at London broker PVM Oil Associates.

462,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 21, 2017 11:11AM ET</span>",GOLDMAN: OPEC's oil production cuts were smart but they're having unintended consequences,"The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries made a smart move to limit production, but the move has had some unforeseen effects, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts. 
In November, some OPEC members agreed with a few non-members to lower their production levels in a bid to support oil prices. It was the most significant agreement since the oil crash in 2014 as OPEC fought for market share with US shale producers.
The oversupply from the moves for market share pushed the oil market into contango. That's a situation where the price in the futures market is higher than the current spot price, meaning that traders are willing to pay more for oil in the future than now. 
Goldman's Michele Della Vigna said that the inventory build pushed the 2-year forward price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, $5.50 per barrel (or 11%) above the spot price. 
That situation helped US producers at the expense of OPEC. ""As OPEC countries sell spot, but US E&Ps [exploration and production companies] sell 50%+ of their production forward, this was giving the E&Ps a competitive advantage,"" Della Vigna wrote in a note on Tuesday.
""Within one month of the OPEC announcement, the contango declined to US$1.1/bl (2%), achieving the cartel’s purpose. However, the unintended consequence was to underwrite shale activity through a bullish credit market at a time when delayed delivery of the 2011-13 capex boom could lead to record non-OPEC production growth in 2018.""
In other words, OPEC's deal started producing the intended effect as oil prices rose. Meanwhile, investors continued to buy energy high-yield bonds to support US producers. 
""Exhibit 3 shows how successful OPEC was in tilting the shape of the Brent forward curve within one month of its announcement,"" Della Vigna wrote. ""However, the unintended shale boom generated by low oil price volatility, a bullish credit market and management confidence is starting to impact the whole curve, shifting it downwards into the incentive price cost of shale production (US$50-55/bl on our estimates).""Goldman Sachs
And so, OPEC's output cuts could have the unintended effect of hurting their members' economic growth.
""Headline GDP growth in the Gulf looks is likely to slow to an eight-year low of 1.5% in 2017,"" said Capital Economics' Neil Shearing in a note on Monday. ""However, this will be entirely the result of oil production cuts as countries comply with last year’s OPEC deal."" 
Goldman included this chart which steps further back to illustrate the headache US shale producers are giving their OPEC counterparts. The efficiency of shale production reduced the oil price US drillers needed to break even, or produce without profit or loss. Low-cost OPEC producers then respond by increasing production where they can.

463,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2017 11:10AM ET</span>",Worried Canada presses U.S. over Buy America steel plan: sources,"By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's government, under pressure from domestic steel firms, is expressing concern to U.S. officials about a proposed Buy America policy that could cause heavy Canadian job losses, people familiar with the discussions told Reuters.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who wants firms to ""Buy American and hire American,"" pledged in January to require new pipelines to use U.S.-made steel.
Canadian steel firms fear Trump's plan could badly hurt a highly-integrated North American industry, and are pressing Ottawa to take action, the people added.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland raised the issue with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in their first conversation on March 9 and underscored worries about potential job losses, said a source familiar with the matter.
A statement issued after the meeting merely said that Freeland had highlighted ""the mutual benefits of the integrated Canada-U.S. steel industry"" but made no mention of the conversation about job losses.
In Washington, a Commerce Department official said Freeland had raised the Buy American issue during the call and that Ross noted her concerns. The official did not give further details.
Freeland spokesman Alex Lawrence said the minister would ""continue to defend our steel workers"" but gave no details.
Canadian diplomats and officials fanning out across the United States on a campaign to stress the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are also underscoring the importance of the steel sector and concerns about what could happen if the Buy American move went ahead, said a senior political source who was not authorized to speak about the matter publicly.
Records held by Canada's lobbying commissioner show that Joseph Galimberti, president of the Canadian Steel Producers Association, held 16 meetings with a total of 28 top government officials between Trump's Nov. 8 election win and Feb 24.
The CSPA says the industry, which has C$14 billion ($10.5 billion) in annual sales, directly employs 22,000 Canadians while supporting an additional 100,000 indirect jobs.
Galimberti said Canada's steel industry was integrated to a high degree with its U.S. counterpart and bought metallurgical coal, iron ore and steel scrap from its southern neighbor.
The prospect of losing thousands of well-paid jobs would be particularly painful for the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which says it wants to focus on boosting the middle class.
This is not the first time Canada and the United States have been at odds over steel. A stimulus bill introduced by the Obama administration in 2009 banned the use of foreign-made steel, upsetting Canada.
The two sides eventually signed a deal in 2010 that gave Canadian steel firms an exemption while allowing U.S. companies greater access to government procurement contracts in Canada.
Trump's proposed measure ""completely obliterates years of work integrating steel production ... there are concerns, grave concerns,"" said one person familiar with the industry campaign.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude May contract rose 15 cents, or around 0.3%, to $49.05 a barrel by 10:25AM ET (14:25GMT), pulling back from a session high of $49.48. It fell 40 cents in the prior session.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London tacked on 13 cents to $51.75 a barrel. The global benchmark dipped 14 cents on Monday.
Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (20:30GMT) later on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock rise of 2.6 million barrels.
Oil has fallen sharply this month amid concern that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
Futures were up almost 1% earlier amid speculation that OPEC could extend its production-cut deal beyond June if global crude inventories failed to drop to a targeted level.
OPEC members increasingly favor extending the output curb beyond June to balance the market, sources within the group said, although they added that this would require non-OPEC members such as Russia to also step up their efforts.
OPEC agreed in November last year to curb its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day between January and June. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 barrels per day.
In total, they agreed to reduce output by 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the first six months of the year, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
OPEC's latest monthly report showed global oil stocks in January rose to 278 million barrels above the five-year average.
Kuwait is scheduled to host a ministerial meeting on March 26 comprising both OPEC and non-OPEC members to review compliance with the output agreement and to discuss whether cuts would be extended beyond June.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down around 0.6% at 99.59 in New York morning trade, the weakest level since February 3.
The greenback has been on the retreat since the Fed raised interest rates on Wednesday last week, but stuck to its outlook for two more hikes this year, instead of three expected by the market.
Market players awaited comments from a number of Fed policymakers for more clues on the timing of the next U.S. rate hike.

U.S. natural gas for April delivery rallied 5.0 cents, or around 1.6% to $3.092 per million British thermal units by 8:55AM ET (12:55GMT).
It reached a daily peak of $3.099 earlier, a level not seen since February 10, after jumping almost 10 cents, or more than 3%, on Monday.
Cool temperatures will sweep across the Great Lakes and eastern U.S. toward the middle of the week, according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com, with overnight lows expected to drop well below freezing.
Temperatures are expected to remain much colder than normal through the end of the week, with highs struggling to reach the 30s, while overnight lows drop into the teens to below 0F.
A fast-moving weather system will then impact the east-central U.S. Saturday into Sunday, followed by warming Monday, but again cooling off mid-week.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 150 and 160 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 17.
That compares with a withdrawal of 53 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 15 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 21 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.295 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 7.7% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 15.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Prices of the heating fuel are down around 16% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

473,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2017 09:27PM ET</span>","China, EU cut imports of Brazil meat amid scandal","By Brad Brooks and Dominique Patton
SAO PAULO/BEIJING (Reuters) - China and the European Union curtailed meat imports from Brazil on Monday after police, in an anti-corruption probe criticized by the government as alarmist, accused inspectors in the world's biggest exporter of beef and poultry of taking bribes to allow sales of rotten and salmonella-tainted meats.
As the scandal deepened, Brazil's Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi said the government had suspended exports from 21 meat processing units.
But he also criticized the investigation by Brazil's Federal Police into meatpacking companies, calling their findings ""alarmist"" and saying they used a few isolated incidents to tarnish an entire industry that maintains rigorous standards. 
An all-out ban on Brazilian meat exports would be a ""disaster,"" Maggi added. ""I pray, I hope, I work so that does not happen,"" he said, speaking to reporters outside his office in Brasilia.
With other import curbs expected to follow, the scandal stemming from a police operation codenamed ""Weak Flesh"" could deal a heavy blow to one of the few sectors of Latin America's largest economy that has thrived during a two-year recession.
Police on Friday named BRF SA (SA:BRFS3) and JBS SA (SA:JBSS3), along with dozens of smaller rivals, in a two-year probe into how meatpackers allegedly paid off inspectors to overlook practices including processing rotten meat, shipping exports with traces of salmonella and simply not carrying out inspections of plants.
JBS is the world's largest meat producer and BRF the biggest poultry exporter.
The companies have denied any wrongdoing, and authorities have said no cases of death or illness have been linked to the tainted meat investigation.
New allegations of unsavory business practices in Brazil come as the country is still reeling from a massive graft scandal centered on state-controlled oil company Petrobras (SA:PETR4) that is widening into other sectors.
Brazil's President Michel Temer has sought to downplay the meatpacking probe, saying it involved only 21 of Brazil's more than 4,800 meat processing units. 
But Francisco Turra, head of Brazilian beef producers association ABPA, told reporters it had put the entire meat industry in jeopardy and ""destroyed"" a hard-won image of quality products.
China, which accounted for nearly one-third of the Brazilian meatpacking industry's $13.9 billion in exports last year, suspended imports of all meat products from Brazil as a precautionary measure. 
The European Union suspended imports from four Brazilian meat processing facilities, ABPA said, citing the nation's agriculture ministry.
Ricardo Santin, ABPA's vice president of markets, said two of the suspended plants process poultry, one beef and the other horse meat. One of the poultry plants is operated by BRF, said Santin.
In a statement, BRF said the company has not received any formal notice from Brazilian or foreign authorities related to the suspension of its plants.
South Korea's agriculture ministry said in a statement that it would tighten inspections of imported Brazilian chicken meat and temporarily bar sales of chicken products by BRF.
More than 80 percent of the 107,400 tonnes of chicken that South Korea imported last year came from Brazil, and BRF supplied almost half of that.
BRF SHARES SLIDE 
BRF closed down nearly 2.2 percent Monday, while JBS ended the day up 0.75 percent as investors bet the scandal would have less effect on the world's largest meatpacker.
BRF could prove more vulnerable to the scandal since a larger share of its operations are physically based in Brazil, while JBS derives most of its sales from abroad, according to a report by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts led by Luca Cipiccia.
Shares of Minerva SA (SA:BEEF3) and Marfrig Global Foods SA (SA:MRFG3), which are not involved in the investigations, also fell as traders fretted over the possibility of further import bans.
The scandal ""could be enough to compromise temporarily Brazilian protein's acceptance worldwide,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Securities analyst Victor Saragiotto wrote in a Monday note to clients.
Chile is also temporarily banning imports of all Brazilian meat products, the agriculture ministry said on Monday.
The European Commission said the scandal would not affect negotiations between the European Union and South American bloc Mercosur about agreements on free trade. 
On the streets of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's second-largest city, the scandal left many consumers in doubt.
""My freezer at home is full of meat, and I don't know what to do,"" said Maria Fonseca, a saleswoman. ""Should I eat it or just throw it all away?

""It is an enormous waste. If I lived in the countryside, I'd start raising my own cows and chickens!""

""An extension is needed to balance the market,"" an OPEC delegate said. ""Any extension of the cut agreement should be with non-OPEC.""
OPEC and non-OPEC producers such as Russia agreed in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the first six months of 2017, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
OPEC's latest monthly report showed global oil stocks in January rose to 278 million barrels above the five-year average.
Kuwait is scheduled to host a ministerial meeting on March 26 comprising both OPEC and non-OPEC members to review compliance with the output agreement and to discuss whether cuts would be extended beyond June.
A poll of market analysts showed on Friday that OPEC will have to extend its oil output curbs beyond June as a revival in crude production outside the group, specifically in the U.S., may scupper its efforts to erode an overhang of unused inventory.

478,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2017 11:00AM ET</span>","OPEC leans toward oil cut extension, but non-members need to be in: sources","By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC oil producers increasingly favor extending beyond June a pact on reducing crude supply to balance the market, sources within the group said, although Russia and other non-members need to remain part of the initiative.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is curbing its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1 for six months, the first reduction in eight years. Russia and other non-OPEC producers agreed to cut half as much.
The deal has lifted oil prices (LCOc1), but inventories in industrial nations are rising and higher returns have encouraged U.S. companies to pump more. A growing number of OPEC officials believe it may take longer than six months to reduce stocks.
""An extension is needed to balance the market,"" an OPEC delegate said. ""Any extension of the cut agreement should be with non-OPEC."" 
OPEC sources told Reuters in February that the group could extend the supply-reduction pact, or even apply deeper cuts from July, if inventories fail to drop to a targeted level. 
The group wants stocks in the industrialized world to fall to the average of the past five years. According to the most recent data, for January, inventories of crude and refined products stood 278 million barrels above this level.
Five other OPEC sources said it was increasingly clear that the market needed more than six months to stabilize but added that all producers - in OPEC plus non-members - had to agree.
""The ministers will meet in May to decide, but everyone has to be on board,"" an OPEC source from a major producer said. 
OPEC next meets to decide output policy on May 25 in Vienna. There will also be a gathering in May of OPEC and non-OPEC producers, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said last month.
""Hard negotiations are on the way,"" another one of the sources said.
Russia, the largest of the 11 outside producers working with OPEC, has not publicly said whether it supports extending the supply cut, but is wary about the revival of U.S. shale output due to higher oil prices.
""It's too early to know whether everyone will agree to this,"" a source from a non-OPEC participant in the deal said, referring to prolonging the output curb.
The revival of shale oil production - whose growth added to the oversupply that battered oil prices in mid-2014 - has restrained the rally this year and may worry OPEC leaders. 
OPEC ministers and sources, however, have said they don't see a large rebound in 2017. One OPEC source said shale production was expected to grow by about 300,000 bpd this year - a level the market could accommodate.
""OPEC heavyweights such as Saudi Arabia are not happy with the return of shale oil in full force and have to make a hard choice between losing part of their market share or steady income,"" said a source from a major non-Gulf OPEC producer. 

""They will more likely opt for income and will push to get help from non-OPEC.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell on Monday as investors continued to unwind bets on higher prices after record cuts last week because of concerns that growing U.S. oil output could hamper an OPEC-led deal on production reductions.
Benchmark Brent crude futures were down 31 cents at $51.45 a barrel by 1409 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell by 52 cents to $48.26.
""Speculative investors have thrown in the towel, it seems. We've got record selling in the week ending March 14 and the bleeding has not stopped yet,"" said Carsten Fritsch, senior commodities analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
Oil futures have retreated in the past two weeks as a supply overhang driven by rising production from the United States overshadows a deal by OPEC and other producers to rein in crude output.
Last week speculators cut more than 150,000 contracts betting on firmer U.S. and Brent oil prices, a record high.
Latest U.S. drilling data supported estimates for higher production, with 14 oil rigs added in the week to March 17 to 631, the most since September 2015, energy services company Baker Hughes Inc said on Friday.
Growing U.S. production is playing into concerns about the effectiveness of the deal between members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers.
The prospect of higher output from Libya, which is exempt from the deal, is adding further bearish sentiment.
Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said it was confident of regaining control of two key oil ports, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, which have combined capacity to export 600,000 barrels per day (bpd).
""Hedge selling from producers and long-liquidation from funds is a bearish cocktail,"" said Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank's head of commodities strategy.
An upgrade in supply estimates also led analysts at J.P. Morgan to cut their 2017 and 2018 price forecasts.
""The risks that OPEC has painted itself into a corner cannot be ignored and it may need to extend, or even increase, cuts if the response from shale producers is more vigorous than we currently model,"" they said in a report.

In a further sign that key OPEC member Saudi Arabia was adhering to its output cut pledges, official data showed that its crude exports fell by about 300,000 bpd in January.

U.S. natural gas for April delivery rallied 4.3 cents, or around 1.5% to $2.990 per million British thermal units by 9:40AM ET (13:40GMT).
Cool temperatures will sweep across the Great Lakes and eastern U.S. toward the middle of the week, according to forecasters at NatGasWeather.com, with overnight lows expected to drop well below freezing.
Temperatures are expected to remain much colder than normal through the end of the week, with highs struggling to reach the 30s, while overnight lows drop into the teens to below 0F.
A fast-moving weather system will then impact the east-central U.S. Saturday into Sunday, followed by warming Monday, but again cooling off mid-week.
Prices of the heating fuel are down around 20% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 150 and 160 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 17.
That compares with a withdrawal of 53 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a build of 15 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 21 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.295 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 7.7% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 15.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.

486,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2017 04:26AM ET</span>",Saudi king's Asia tour trumpets Aramco's moves downstream,"By Henning Gloystein
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Saudi King Salman's lavish tour of Asia, arriving in each country on a golden escalator with 400 tonnes of luggage, had a hardnosed marketing mission - to cement the kingdom's place as leading oil supplier to the world's biggest consumer region.
The string of deals inked on his three-week tour to Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan and China also point to a fresh strategy, one to increase Saudi leverage over refined product and petrochemical markets, known as the downstream sector.
""Our strategy is about growth in the downstream,"" said Amin Nasser, chief executive officer of state oil company Aramco, told Reuters on Sunday. ""The growth in that sector is very important, and anything integrated between refining, petrochemical, with marketing and distribution, is of interest to us."" 
Saudi Arabia's main influence on oil markets has been via the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which it is the de-facto leader.
But OPEC's ability to control prices by turning the oil pumping spigots on and off has waned as non-OPEC producers like Russia and, more recently, U.S. shale drillers, have ramped up output and eroded its grip on market share.
One indication of a shift in Saudi strategy came on the first leg of the tour in Kuala Lumpur. Aramco signed a deal to take a $7 billion investment, in a joint venture with Malaysia's state oil company Petronas in a refinery and petrochemical project known as RAPID (Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development).
'THE WINDOW'
Under construction in Malaysia's southern Johor state, RAPID is just across a narrow strait from Singapore, Asia's oil trading hub. Some 70 percent of the oil for the project, set to start in 2019, will come from Saudi Arabia, giving the kingdom a key outlet for its crude in Asia, the world's fastest growing market. It is Armaco's largest refinery project outside the kingdom.
Aramco also recently made a deal with Indonesia's Pertamina over a $5 billion expansion of the country's largest oil refinery, for which Armaco will supply the crude.
""The investments are intended to enhance Aramco's competitive position in Southeast Asia,"" said Ihsan Buhulaiga, a Saudi economist.
The Malaysian investment also allows the Saudis to join the hub of refineries in and around Singapore that help determine fuel prices in the region.
Price agency S&P Global Platts assesses dozens of fuel products during a set time every day, based on deliveries in and out of this region. Platts calls it Market-on-Close, but traders dub it ""the window"", and it influences pricing of oil products worth billions of dollars each day.
While crude and fuel products by many companies flow in and out of the pricing region, known as FOB Straits. But the only refineries now in this price region are operated by U.S. Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), and Singapore Petroleum Corp (SPC), owned by PetroChina.
""When you control refining capacity with the capability to deliver petroleum products into the window, you have access to a physical outlet which also plays a key role in daily price discovery,"" said John Driscoll, director of consultancy JTD Energy in Singapore.
ARAMCO IPO
The Saudi move deeper into refineries and petrochemical plants would likely help the potential valuation of Aramco in what could be the world's largest-ever initial public offering.
Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees the kingdom's economic policy, has said the sale is expected to value Aramco at $2 trillion or more. Analysts have estimated a valuation between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion.
Singapore, along with Hong Kong and Tokyo have been mentioned as possible exchanges where Aramco's shares would be traded. The primary listing will be on Saudi Arabia's domestic exchange, and Riyadh is also looking at New York or London for the secondary listing.
Aramco's joint ventures in Malaysia, Indonesia and elsewhere are not only aimed at increasing its refining capacity. Its new deals in the region would also greatly increase its participation in the petrochemical sector, which involves all forms of plastics and where profits have soared thanks to strong demand. 
""We have capacity of about 5.4 million barrels per day of participated refining capacity, and our target is to reach 10 million barrels by 2030,"" Aramco's Nasser said.
Ultimately, the big prize is China, where the Saudis signed deals that could be worth as much as $65 billion during the last leg of the king's Asian tour, covering energy, manufacturing and even a theme park in the kingdom. 
The deals included a memorandum of understanding between Aramco and China North Industries Group Corp (Norinco) to look into building refining and petrochemical plants in China.
John Sfakianakis, director of the Riyadh-based Gulf Research Centre, said that the trip was ""the beginning of a long-term strategy of Saudi Arabia to open itself to Asian investors and vice versa"" as part of its Vision 2030 policy to diversify its economy beyond crude exports.

Last week, gold prices rose on Friday as expectations of a slower pace of U.S. interest rates hikes than some investors had anticipated continued to weigh on the dollar.
But the U.S. central bank did not flag any plan to speed up the pace of monetary tightening, with Yellen reiterating that the pace of rate hikes would be gradual. Expectations for a slower pace of monetary tightening pressured the dollar to five week lows against a basket of the other major currencies.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.

492,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2017 06:55AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Libya's NOC says expects to regain Es Sider, Ras Lanuf oil ports","By Aidan Lewis
TUNIS (Reuters) - Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) has been coordinating with military forces from eastern Libya and has ""no reason to believe"" it will not regain control of the Es Sider and Ras Lanuf oil ports, NOC's chairman said.
The loss and recapture of the ports this month by the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) had raised doubts over its willingness to let the Tripoli-based NOC manage the ports.
Revenue from the sites is controlled by a central bank and U.N.-backed government in the capital which pro-LNA factions oppose.
Eastern officials accuse rivals in Tripoli and the western city of Misrata of supporting a March 3 attack on the ports by a faction known as the Benghazi Defense Brigades (BDB).
An oil guard commander appointed by the U.N.-backed government was deployed to secure them.
After they were retaken, the head of a Benghazi NOC office appointed by Libya's eastern government said he was pulling out of an NOC unification deal signed in July and an LNA spokesman said there would be no immediate decision on a handover.
But in written responses provided to Reuters, Mustafa Sanalla, the Tripoli-based NOC chairman, said his staff had already been working with the LNA.
""We have been coordinating our assessment of the facilities with them,"" Sanalla said, in his first public comments since the ports were retaken.
""We have no reason to believe control of the ports will not be handed back to NOC.""
Es Sider and Ras Lanuf have a combined potential capacity of 600,000 barrels per day (bpd).
Operations there and at two other ports southwest of Benghazi are crucial to the NOC's efforts to revive Libya's output, which has been crippled by years of conflict and political chaos. 
The LNA took over the ports in September, ending a two-year blockade at three of them and quickly inviting the NOC to resume exports.
Es Sider and Ras Lanuf were badly damaged in previous rounds of fighting and have been operating well below normal levels. The latest clashes, which included ground battles and more than a week of LNA air strikes, had dented the LNA's claim it could defend the ports and led to fears that facilities would suffer further damage.
But Waha Oil Company resumed pumping to Es Sider on Saturday and Sanalla said the NOC had decided to restart operations at the ports based on technical assessments and a review by military engineers.
""For the most part, the facilities are not damaged. In one or two locations, some work needs to be done by the military engineers. Our workers are returning to their terminals gradually.""
Reuters journalists observed little apparent additional damage to the ports during a visit on Thursday.
An engineer at the Waha oil field said on Sunday it was pumping 25,000 bpd to Es Sider as it restarted production, which stood at 75,000 bpd before the clashes.
Sanalla said the NOC was hoping to raise overall production to 800,000 bpd by the end of April from 611,000 bpd currently.
Libya along with Nigeria has been exempted from production cuts recently agreed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
However, any gains in Libya remain fragile as long as the political turmoil that has fractured the country since its 2011 uprising continues.
Oil accounts for nearly all of Libya's income and pipelines and ports have been repeatedly blockaded by local groups seeking political and financial gain.
Eastern authorities have attempted to sell oil independently, but have been blocked by international sanctions which remain in place.
Oil facilities are protected by the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) but PFG units often operate independently or for a particular political faction.
Sanalla said a neutral PFG should have a role, ""but under the authority and real management of NOC"".
""Putting the PFG under the NOC would, we think, go a long way to removing Libya's oil assets as an object of military competition,"" he said.
""Unless oil assets are taken off the table as an object of conflict, unless the oil industry is ring-fenced from our political conflict, then the possibility of more fighting remains.""

493,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2017 02:00AM ET</span>","Beijing, Saudi Arabia agree to more oil cooperation, exports to China","BEIJING (Reuters) - China and Saudi Arabia will increase their cooperation in the oil sector, including in Saudi oil exports to China, the two countries said in a joint communique issued on Saturday at the end of Saudi Arabian King Salman's visit to Beijing.
The world's largest oil exporter has been looking to cement ties with the world's second-largest economy. 
After losing market share to Russia last year, Saudi Arabia has sought to boost oil sales to China, the world's second-largest oil market, by working mostly with China's top three state oil firms.
""Both countries are willing to raise their level of cooperation in the oil sector, including supplying Saudi oil to the continuously growing Chinese market,"" the two said in a statement issued by China's official Xinhua news agency.
""Both sides stress the importance of stability in world oil markets to the global economy ... China appreciates Saudi Arabia being a safe and dependable oil supplier to the world market, and the role it plays in ensuring the stability of the global oil market,"" it said.
Salman oversaw the signing of deals worth as much as $65 billion on the first full day of his visit to Beijing on Thursday.
China has traditionally played little role in Middle East conflicts or diplomacy, despite its reliance on the region for oil. However, it has been trying to get more involved in efforts to end Syria's six-year-old civil war, where Riyadh supports rebels battling President Bashar al-Assad.
Last year, China also offered support for Yemen's government, which is backed by a Saudi-led Gulf Arab coalition in a war against the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement that controls much of the country.
China has had to tread a careful line, though, as it also has close relations with Iran. Xi visited both Saudi Arabia and Iran in January last year.
The joint statement said both China and Saudi Arabia stressed their support for Yemen's legal government.
China's renewed diplomatic push with the Middle East continues next week when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits China.

Diplomatic sources say China is trying to play the role of ""honest broker"" in the Middle East, as it lacks the historical baggage of the Americans or the Europeans.

""When we are talking about overcapacity in the steel sector, China should not be singled out. This is a global issue, this is a cyclical issue,"" Wang told the China Development Forum in Beijing. 
China is both the world's biggest steel producer and consumer, and its steel sector has been under particular scrutiny. Chinese mills have been subject to increasing numbers of anti-dumping moves by international rivals amid accusations that they have been selling at less than cost and forcing foreign competitors out of business.
President Donald Trump's choice for top U.S. trade negotiator on Tuesday pledged an ""America First"" strategy to enforce U.S. laws and trade deals to stop unfair imports and push China to scrap excess factory capacity. 
China has recognized the seriousness of overcapacity problems in some industries and has been trying to deal with the issue, while some other countries have been ""just talking and watching"", Wang said without making specific reference to the U.S. comments or elaborating further. 
China is facing growing trade frictions with its trade partners, he noted, but he shrugged off criticism about the country's trade practices. Major economies should tackle overcapacity problems in a concerted manner, he said. 
China has announced plans to slash another 50 million tonnes of steel capacity this year, on top of the 65 million tonnes removed last year. Many of the plants closed last year were already idled, however, and output from the still-open plants actually rose 1.2 percent to 808.4 million tonnes. 

China will continue to open up its economy to foreign investors and promote globalization, which is facing risks from ""populism, conservatism and protectionism"", Wang said.

RAS LANUF, Libya (Reuters) - A broken down truck and a tank lie by the side of the road in the sand, and overturned boxes are strewn across the floor of a firefighting station.
Otherwise, Libya's coastal Oil Crescent appears much as it did before a string of battles saw the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) lose and retake the major export terminals of Ras Lanuf and Es Sider in the space of 11 days.
The fighting with the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB) caused output to dip slightly, and fueled fears of fresh shutdowns in Libya's most important oil producing region.
But workers are gradually returning to the oil facilities which officials say show little sign of damage beyond what was wrought in previous rounds of fighting.
Military checkpoints have sprung up again, and shops, mosques and petrol stations have reopened. The LNA says it is once more fully in control.
Es Sider and Ras Lanuf are two of Libya's largest terminals. They have a potential combined capacity of some 600,000 barrels per day (bpd), but have been operating at a fraction of normal levels after being repeatedly fought over and blockaded for two years.
Reuters reporters saw a heavy military presence at Es Sider, the westernmost of the ports, during a visit on Thursday, just two days after the LNA recaptured it.
""The port has not suffered damage that would hinder exports, just some stealing,"" said an engineer at Es Sider. ""About 30 workers have returned to the port, though we have not started export operations yet.""
At the Harouge oil storage tank farm in Ras Lanuf, about 30 km (18 miles) east of Es Sider, a group of soldiers with five military vehicles stood guard.
""There were clashes around the tanks, they didn't last long,"" said Alaa Gaddafi, an LNA commander stationed there. ""Some of them escaped and we found some dead. We got control of the tanks after about 10 minutes. There was no new damage to the tanks, the damage is from before.""
The LNA and its leader Khalifa Haftar say they are working to rid Libya of Islamist extremism and militia rule. They have gradually extended their control over most parts of eastern Libya.
The BDB is partly made up of fighters who battled the LNA in Benghazi. They draw on support from Haftar's opponents in western Libya, and say they are fighting to prevent a return to authoritarian rule and to allow displaced families to go back to Benghazi.
OPEN LAND
The attack on the Oil Crescent by the BDB on March 3 took the LNA by surprise, exposing previous claims to have the area well secured.
Its loss of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, and the BDB's promise to push northeast toward Benghazi, raised the prospect of an escalation in a simmering conflict between loose armed alliances based in the east and west of the country.
It also put at risk a partial revival of Libya's oil production, throwing into doubt a fragile arrangement by which the LNA allowed the National Oil Corporation (NOC) in Tripoli to operate the ports, even whilst allowing revenues to go to a central bank that it opposes.
National output more than doubled after the LNA took control of all four of the Oil Crescent's ports last September, allowing the NOC to reopen three of them. During this month's clashes it dropped by about 100,000 bpd.
The LNA maintained control of Brega and Zueitina, two ports that lie to northeast of Ras Lanuf, as the BDB advanced. And after massing its forces between Brega and Ras Lanuf, and carrying out daily air strikes against its rivals, it took back both those terminals in a single day.
""They had no air cover and were in open land, they were on land they did not know, a land which to them was hostile,"" said Mohamed Manfour, commander of Benghazi's Benina air base, speaking in Brega
The BDB says it will regroup and that its campaign to reach Benghazi will continue.

The depth of local support for either side in the Oil Crescent remains unclear. Local backing is often won by offers of financial support and tribal pledges that can quickly shift. Both sides accuse the other of using mercenaries from southern Libya and sub-Saharan states across the border, and of carrying out abuses.

Oilfield services firm Barker Hughes reported its weekly U.S. rig count rose by 14 to 631, it was the ninth straight weekly increase.
Crude traded in a narrow $2.5 range this week but ultimately settled positive for the week on Friday as investors mulled over the release of several mostly upbeat energy reports while the slump in the dollar provided support for oil prices.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih relieved some concerns from investors on Thursday, as he said that oil production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers could be extended beyond June if oil stocks stayed above a long-term average.
The somewhat bullish comments from the Saudi Energy Minister came a day after the Energy Information Agency (EIA) revealed that U.S. crude inventories declined to 528.2 million barrels last week, the first decline in nine weeks.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices firmed on Friday and looked set to finish the week with a modest gain after losing almost 10 percent last week on concerns that an OPEC production cut was failing to reduce a global supply overhang.
Crude traded in a narrow band this week, with Brent and West Texas Intermediate bouncing in a $2.5 range as investors weighed the impact of the first oil cut from OPEC in eight years against rising U.S. shale oil output and high inventories.
Brent crude was up 27 cents at $52.01 a barrel by 1353 GMT. U.S. light crude was up 24 cents at $48.99.
""The market remains relatively calm today, with concerns about having to extend the production-cut deal being offset by a weaker dollar,"" said Saxo Bank head of commodity strategy Ole Hansen.
Oil found some support from dollar weakness after the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated it would not accelerate plans for rises in interest rates. 
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Thursday the cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers could be extended beyond June if oil stockpiles stayed above a long-term average.
Six of 10 analysts polled by Reuters said they believed OPEC would prolong its output reductions past the deal's six-month duration.
However, Saudi Arabia has cut output by more than its share under the November 2016 deal. Some ask whether Riyadh has the appetite to continue while several OPEC and non-OPEC states fail to comply.
""While OPEC has shown more cohesion than we expected, the problem has always been that free-riders benefit most from OPEC cuts, which makes the deal inherently unstable,"" Dan Smith of Oxford Economics said in a note to clients. 
""Saudi Arabia is not prepared to shoulder all of the burden of rebalancing the oil market and if others fail to cooperate then it may prove to be difficult for OPEC to extend cutbacks beyond the middle of this year."" 
OPEC and non-OPEC members agreed last year to cut output by a combined 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017. But OPEC's monthly report showed global oil stocks rose in January to 278 million barrels above the five-year average.

The market will seek more direction from data due later on Friday. The Baker Hughes weekly rig count will indicate activity in the U.S. shale industry, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission releases calculations of net long and short positions in the crude futures market.

U.S. crude futures for April delivery were up 0.49% at $49.08 a barrel.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the May Brent contract gained 0.56% to trade at $52.02 a barrel.
 Crude prices rallied after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report on Wednesday that crude oil inventories declined by a surprising 237,000 barrels last week to 528.2 million barrels. It was the first drawdown in stockpiles since early January.
The commodity also benefited from a weaker dollar after the Federal Reserve’s policy statement on Wednesday was seen as less hawkish than expected by sticking to projections of three total rate hikes in 2017 and not four as some traders had hoped for.
However, traders were expected to remain cautious after a report earlier in the week showed that Saudi Arabia raised output back above 10 million barrels a day in February, sparking fresh concerns over a global supply glut.
Separately, Iraq said its March oil exports averaged 3.25 million barrels-per-day in the first 14 days of the month, slightly lower than February's 3.27 million bpd. However, the decline was not as much as expected, raising doubts over the country's compliance with the OPEC supply cut deal.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
Kuwait is scheduled to host a ministerial meeting on March 26 comprising both OPEC and non-OPEC members to review compliance with the output agreement and to discuss whether cuts would be extended beyond June."
501,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2017 06:53AM ET</span>","Trump seeks to ax Appalachia economic programs, causing worry in coal country","By Valerie Volcovici
PAINTSVILLE, Kentucky (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has proposed eliminating funding for economic development programs supporting laid-off coal miners and others in Appalachia, stirring fears in a region that supported him of another letdown on the heels of the coal industry’s collapse.
The 2018 budget proposal submitted to Congress by the White House on Thursday would cut funds to the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and the U.S. Economic Development Administration. The Washington-based organizations are charged with diversifying the economies of states like West Virginia and Kentucky to help them recover from coal’s decline.
The proposed cuts would save the federal government $340 million and come as the Republican president seeks to slash a wide array of federal programs and regulations to make way for increased military spending.
But they are perceived by some in Appalachia as a betrayal of his promises to help coal miners.
""Folks that live in Appalachia believe that the ARC belongs to them,"" said federal ARC Co-Chair Earl Gohl, bemoaning the proposed cut. ""It's really their organization.""
Republican Congressman Hal Rogers, who represents eastern Kentucky's coal counties, said he would fight to restore the funding when Congress negotiates the budget later this year.
“It's true that the president won his election in rural country. I would really like to see him climb aboard the ARC vehicle as a way to help us help ourselves,"" Rogers said.
Four hundred of the 420 counties ARC operates in voted for Trump in November's election.
The 52-year old agency has run more than 650 projects in Appalachia's 13 states between 2011 and 2015 costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Its programs, some launched under Democratic former President Barack Obama, are expected to create or retain more than 23,670 jobs and train and educate over 49,000 students and workers, the organization said.
Trump vowed during his campaign that the White House would put American coal miners back to work, in part by cutting environmental regulations ushered in by Obama, mainly aimed at curbing climate change but characterized by Trump as hampering the industry.
However, many industry experts and coal miners doubt that rolling back regulation alone can revive the coal mining industry, which faces stiff competition from abundant and cheap natural gas in fueling U.S. power generation.
TECHNOLOGY FUTURE?
Rigel Preston, a 38-year old former surface miner, said ARC programs helped him land a job as a paid intern at technology company Interapt after he lost his benefits.
He said that, while he and many members of his family in eastern Kentucky hope Trump will deliver on his promise to revive the coal industry, he believed the region's future lay elsewhere.
""From my experience from the coalfield, I know that that is a finite job and coal will run out eventually,"" Preston said.
Preston was among several former miners and other east Kentuckians at an event in Paintsville this week held by Interapt and ARC to announce Interapt's plan to hire another hundred people from the region this summer.
Interapt last year launched a program called TechHire Eastern Kentucky, supported by ARC, which provides 36 weeks of paid training in code and paid internships.
Interapt Chief Executive Ankur Gopal, a 37-year-old tech entrepreneur, expanded his Louisville-based company out to eastern Kentucky with the vision of lifting that part of his home state out of economic stagnation.
""There is a skilled workforce and opportunity that can be found here in eastern Kentucky,"" Gopal said. ""This is not just a bunch of people that are waiting for coal mines to reopen.""
ARC has worked on economic development in Appalachia since its founding in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson's ""war on poverty."" In recent years it has focused on helping states in the region deal with the coal industry's sharp decline and the loss of 33,000 coal mining jobs between 2011 and 2016.
So far, ARC has had no official contact from the president's transition teams, said co-chair Gohl, an Obama appointee who remains in the job.
The cuts to its funding were recommended to the administration by the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based think tank. Nick Loris, an energy fellow at the foundation, said the work that ARC and the Economic Development Administration do should be devolved to state and local governments ""to encourage transparency and reduce duplicative federal spending.""
States have said their budgets are already strapped.
In addition to all of West Virginia and part of Kentucky, the ARC covers parts of Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.

502,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 17, 2017 04:05AM ET</span>",Gold prices edge lower but remain supported,"Investing.com - Gold prices edged lower on Friday, but still remained close to two-week highs thanks to a weaker U.S. dollar and the Federal Reserve’s dovish stance at its latest policy meeting.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery were down 0.09% at $1,226.05, just off the previous session’s two-week high of $1.231,40.
The April contract ended Thursday’s session 2.20% higher at $1,227.10 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,197.70, the low of March 15 and resistance at $1,231.40, Thursday’s high.
The greenback weakened broadly as the Fed’s policy statement was seen as less hawkish than expected by sticking to projections of three total rate hikes in 2017 and not four as some traders had hoped for.
As expected, the Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.00% from 0.75%.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 100.07, the lowest since February 9.
A weak U.S. dollar usually supports gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
Market participants were looking ahead to reports on U.S. industrial production and consumer sentiment due later in the day.
Elsewhere in metals trading, silver futures for May delivery slid 0.31% to $17.282 a troy ounce, while copper futures for May delivery dropped 0.58% to $2.662 a pound."

(Reuters) - OPEC will have to extend its oil output curbs in order to sustain a recovery in prices, as a revival in crude production outside the group may scupper its efforts to erode an overhang of unused inventory, a poll of market analysts showed on Friday.
Six of the 10 analysts polled by Reuters said they believed OPEC will extend its output cuts beyond June this year, while two felt the group did not need to extend the deal and a further two were undecided.
""If OPEC is genuinely pursuing an inventory target, then an extension to current supply restraint is needed,""  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) analyst Harry Tchilinguirian said. 
""But given recent producer statements suggesting that a rollover of this policy is contingent on cooperation, OPEC will face a conundrum as to what to do next when it meets again in May,"" Tchilinguirian added. 
In its monthly report on Tuesday, the group said oil inventories rose in January despite a global deal to cut supply and raised its forecast of production in 2017 from outside the group, suggesting complications in the effort to clear a glut. 
But the group maintained that stockpiles will begin to fall thanks to the supply cut, and added that in the second half of the year ""the market is expected to start balancing or even see the start of a drawdown in oil inventories.""  
""If the group's main ambition is to effectively reduce global crude stocks toward their five-years average, then OPEC must deepen its cuts and fix a quota for exempted members,"" said Intesa Paolo analyst Daniela Corsini. 
""Total OPEC production should be capped around the current level of about 32.1 million barrels per day, well below the 32.5 mb/d which would balance markets this year. If OPEC's main goal is simply to sustain crude prices above $40-45 then an automatic roll-over of the existing agreement could be enough.""    
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is curbing its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1, the first cut in eight years. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers have agreed to jointly cut by an additional 600,000 bpd.
Strong compliance by OPEC has helped the price of oil rally, but gains have been tempered by rising U.S. oil production. 
Brent crude has averaged about $55 this year but prices touched a three-month low earlier this week on concerns over excess supply in the market following an increase in U.S. output. 
Reuters last week reported senior Saudi energy officials had warned top independent U.S. oil firms not to assume OPEC would extend output curbs to offset rising production from U.S. shale fields.
""The recovery (in shale production) may be a bit stronger than OPEC anticipated which may be a similar situation of the years up to 2015,"" ABN Amro analyst Hans Van Cleef said.   
""Whether the fight for market share will return will strongly depend on the future development of non-OPEC production/non-shale production in regions where investments were cut back significantly,"" Van Cleef added.    
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said oil demand was set to overtake supply in the second quarter of this year and it was not in OPEC's interest to extend the deal beyond six months as the group's aim was to normalize inventories and not support prices. 
""In the short term, crude prices are likely to remain volatile. However, further down the road, we remain confident of meaningfully higher oil prices this year as they are required to bring the global oil market into balance,"" said Raymond James analyst Muhammed Ghulam. 

""In our view, we are currently in the early stages of a multi-year energy up-cycle, and the recent correction represents a buying opportunity for investors.""

505,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2017 10:20PM ET</span>","Halfway into 2017's oil supply cut, Asia remains awash with fuel","By Florence Tan and Henning Gloystein
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Halfway into an OPEC-led oil supply cut, Asia remains awash with fuel in a sign that the group's efforts to rein in a global glut have so far had little effect.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other suppliers including Russia have pledged to cut production by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of this year to rein in oversupply and prop up prices.
Yet almost three months into the announced cuts, oil flows to Asia, the world's biggest and fastest growing market, have risen to near record highs.
The Asian surplus will pressure global oil prices and weigh on the budgets of major oil producing nations but may also help spur growth in demand needed to soak up the excess.
Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts data shows around 714 million barrels of oil are being shipped to Asia this month, up 3 percent since December when the cuts were announced. 
Responding to rising production, benchmark crude prices are down 10 percent since January, and analysts warn that more falls could follow.
""Cuts are not enough to re-absorb the world's excess supply. So, unless oil demand growth rebounds to record levels in 2017, oil prices could head for another substantial fall,"" said Leonardo Maugeri, senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
Not only are supplies from the Middle East and Russia to Asia still high despite the pledge to cut, but record volumes are flooding into Asia from the Americas and Europe.
The result is a market awash with fuel. More than 30 supertankers are sitting off the coasts of Singapore and southern Malaysia filled with oil, despite a price structure that makes it unattractive to buy oil now and store it for sale at a later date. Crude for delivery in January 2018 is only 70 cents more expensive than that for delivery next May, making those floating storage vessels unprofitable. 
OPEC'S DILEMMA
The ongoing glut poses a predicament for OPEC. Its members need higher oil prices to balance government budgets, but cutting back production to prop up prices means losing market share as other suppliers step in to fill the gap.
OPEC's cuts early in the year pushed up Middle East Dubai crude price against the international benchmark Brent, allowing oil from outside the Middle East to head to Asia.
Traders are shipping competitively priced crudes such as Russian Urals, Kazakhstan's CPC Blend, North Sea Forties and U.S. West Texas Intermediate to replace Middle East staples from Oman to Abu Dhabi.
A record 10.5 million barrels of Russian Urals will arrive in Asia between April and June, Eikon data shows.
Oil from Kazakhstan, the North Sea, Brazil, and the United States arriving in Asia in March is expected to reach 45 million barrels, double the volume in the same month a year ago.
""The uptick in arbitrage has not gone unnoticed by the large Middle Eastern (OPEC) producers,"" analysts from consultancy JBC Energy said in a note to clients this week.
In a move to beat off competition but which contradicts the announced cuts, OPEC's de-facto leader Saudi Arabia unexpectedly cut light crude prices last week. 
State-owned Saudi Aramco has also given additional supplies to Asian customers in April, trade sources said. 
Stiff competition and ample supplies have depressed prices for Middle East and Asia-Pacific grades, some of them to multi-month lows. 
May-loading for Qatar Marine crude sold at discounts to its official selling price for the first time in four months while spot premiums for Russian and Malaysia's flagship Kimanis crude have also hit lows.
With few signs that producers will cut supplies deeply enough to end the glut, and indicators that output is rising in the United States, traders say only strong demand can eventually rein in the surplus.
""Demand growth in Asia is about 700,000 bpd, so the glut will eventually clear,"" said Oystein Berentsen, managing director for oil trading company Strong Petroleum in Singapore.
Not all are as confident. 

""Enduring excess supply could be eased by a robust demand growth,"" said Maugeri of the Belfer Center. ""But preliminary data and analyses do not portend such a development, especially because of a significant slowdown in demand growth in China and India - the two major engines of world oil consumption growth.""

508,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2017 06:27PM ET</span>",Canada's Alberta ups spending with higher C$10.3 billion deficit,"By Ethan Lou
CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The Canadian crude-producing province of Alberta will post a higher-than-expected budget deficit of C$10.3 billion (US$7.73 billion) in the coming fiscal year, it said on Thursday, raising spending as its economy recovers.
Alberta, home to Canada's oil sands and the No. 1 exporter of crude to the United States, has benefited from higher global crude prices since a long decline bottomed out at $26 a barrel last year. 
That recovery, along with a pickup in manufacturing exports, have boosted Alberta's economy, which will grow by 2.6 percent in 2017, according to the province.
Nonrenewable resources revenue, including from oil and gas, will increase to C$3.8 billion. The projected deficit for 2017-18 was higher than the C$10.1 billion forecasted last year, but lower than 2016-17's C$10.4 billion, which itself had been revised to become lower than expected.
But the province's left-leaning New Democratic Party government, which swept to victory in 2015, said it was prepared to tolerate deficits. Thursday's budget, with C$29.5 billion in capital spending over four years, reiterated that the province would protect public services.
The budget is for fiscal 2017-2018 which begins on April 1.
Finance Minister Joe Ceci told a news conference an increase of 2.2 percent of the province's operating expenses to C$55 billion was more than previously forecast, but the government may have a lower deficit for 2017-18 if it does not encounter unexpected spending.
""We will continue to bring the deficit down to balance and we will do so without sacrificing the supports and services families need,"" Ceci said. 
Alberta will borrow heavily to fund its fiscal plan, with total debt hitting C$71.1 billion, or 19.5 percent of nominal GDP, by 2019-20. The province's target of 2024 for balancing the books remains, it said.
Alberta forecast newly approved pipelines that move its landlocked crude will spur production, boosting revenue from royalty payments by up to C$9 billion between 2017 and 2022.

The province will earn more than C$1 billion from a new carbon levy in 2017-18, the first full year the measure is in place. By 2020 Alberta expects the levy to raise C$5.4 billion, all of which would be funnelled into green projects, consumer rebates and a small-business tax reduction.

CARACAS/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has offered Russian counterpart Rosneft a stake in a joint venture in the country's Orinoco Belt extra-heavy crude area, five industry sources said, in a sign of the Latin American nation's dire economic situation and Moscow's growing muscle there.
Rosneft (MM:ROSN), Russia's top oil producer, has been offered a 10 percent stake in the Petropiar joint venture. 
PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], as Petróleos de Venezuela SA is known, has a 70 percent share, and U.S. oil company  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) holds 30 percent of the venture, which includes an oil field and a 210,000 barrel-per-day oil upgrader. 
Two sources said the offer was part of a larger package offered to Rosneft as PDVSA seeks to raise money to pay suppliers and bond holders. 
It is unclear if Rosneft will accept the offer. Financial details of the potential transaction were not immediately available.
PDVSA and Venezuela's Oil Ministry did not respond to requests for comments. Chevron and Rosneft declined to comment. 
A deal would see California-based Chevron working alongside state-owned Rosneft, which has been affected by U.S. sanctions against Russia. 
But Chevron's main concern is that accounting and transparency laws are less strict in Russia than in the United States, a source close to the matter said. 
The proposal highlights Venezuela's need for cash after the nation's oil output fell about 10 percent last year, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. This has worsened a recession that has millions of Venezuelans skipping meals amid food shortages and spiraling inflation. 
The opposition-controlled National Assembly says President Nicolas Maduro's unpopular government is resorting to surreptitiously selling strategic assets to weather the unprecedented crisis. 
""Any deal of national interest must be approved by the National Assembly,"" tweeted lawmaker Jose Guerra, head of congress' finance commission, in reaction to Reuters' article. ""If PDVSA sells 10 (percent) of Petropiar to Rosneft, that sale is null and void."" 
MOSCOW'S MUSCLE 
Rosneft has already been gaining ground in Venezuela, an OPEC member. 
Last year, the company paid $500 million to increase its stake in the Petromonagas joint venture from 16.7 percent to 40 percent, the maximum foreign partners are allowed to have under oil sector regulations created under late leader Hugo Chavez. 
""The ballpark value of the two projects (Petromonagas and Petropiar) probably isn't that different,"" said Francisco Monaldi, fellow in Latin American energy policy at the Baker Institute in Houston.
The Petromonagas sale also raised the ire of the National Assembly, which said the purchase was illegal because Congress did not approve it. Critics have also said the stake was sold too cheaply.
In another controversial move, PDVSA last year used 49.9 percent of its shares in coveted U.S. subsidiary Citgo as collateral for loan financing from Rosneft. 
PDVSA said this month it had received $1.985 billion from an unnamed client in return for future oil shipments, with Citgo shares used as a guarantee. 
In total, Rosneft has lent PDVSA between $4 billion and $5 billion, but the details of those deals have not been disclosed.
""We must thank life that Russia and the world have a Vladimir Putin,"" Maduro said at a deal-signing event with Rosneft head Igor Sechin last year. 

""I wanted to be here at this event because of how important relations with the new Russia are.""

Crude prices struggled for direction throughout the day, after rising more than 2% in the previous session, following the surprise dip in U.S. crude inventories.
U.S. crude inventories declined to 528.2 million barrels last week, the first decline in nine weeks, data from the Energy Information Agency showed.
Despite the dip in U.S. crude stockpiles, investors continued to fret about oversupply in the industry amid concerns that OPEC may not seek to extend oil production cuts beyond the six-month period agreed last November.
In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in an effort to combat the oversupply issue that has pressured prices over the last two years.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for May delivery lost 11 cents to settle at $48.75 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent was unchanged and settled at $51.81 a barrel.
Concerns of oversupply in the industry remained elevated, after OPEC's latest monthly report on Tuesday, revealed that Saudi Arabian crude oil production rose to 10.011 million barrels a day, up from 9.748 million in January while the report also forecast a rise in production from non-OPEC members in 2017.

Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.242 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 9.5% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 17.6% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Prices of the heating fuel are down around 22% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.

About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria/LONDON (Reuters) - The moment a group of Nigerian contractors met executives from Italian oil major  ENI  (MI:ENI) to discuss unpaid wages they started shouting, calling them fraudsters and liars until a police commander restored calm.
Wenenda Mpi, local manager of ENI unit Agip, blamed the payment delays on debts owed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and said the government had promised to sort the problem out.
The heated meeting, called after hundreds of ENI contractors threatened a protest that police feared could turn violent, highlights the challenge of stabilizing the Niger Delta oil region, even though attacks on oil facilities have halted.
Militants were persuaded to stop the attacks by promises of more investment and jobs from visiting officials including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, a technocrat who stood in for President Muhammadu Buhari this year while he had seven weeks of medical treatment in London.
That has helped restore output to close to its former level 2.2 million barrels a day (bpd) from the 1.15 million bpd it hit last year. But it is unclear how long the calm will last.
Protests like that against ENI in the region's biggest city Port Harcourt are common, partly because low global oil prices mean oil firms are firing hundreds of workers and cutting back on contractors such as welders, security guards and cooks.
The ENI contractors showed up on time at the city's police headquarters for the meeting brokered by a local police commander, and tempers were high by the time three AGIP managers and the police boss arrived more than an hour later.
""We are giving Agip a two week ultimatum to pay all outstanding debt,"" said Clement Adaminegbe, head of contractors at Agip, threatening unspecified further action. ""In case of failure we will take a clear stand.""
Mpi promised to look into the grievances but was shouted down by the workers until the Commissioner of Police Zaki Ahmed stepped in -- persuading them to meet again next week in the presence of an Italian manager.
""I want both parties to resolve the issue amicably,"" he said, addressing the stone-faced protesters at the meeting attended by a Reuters reporter.
EXPECTATIONS
Since the start of the year, vice president Osinbajo has been going back and forth to the swamps land, promising to drag the region's population out of poverty with a bigger share of Nigeria's huge oil wealth.
Residents say Osinbajo, a Christian like most in the southern region, has connected much better with them than Buhari, a Muslim from the north, who last year sent the army to hunt down militants and has only visited the region once.
Osinbajo has proposed legalising illegal oil refineries to ensure employment for angry youths who often join militants, although a military campaign to hunt them down has continued.
The future of the fragile peace will depend on whether the government follows up on such proposals at a time when Africa's biggest economy is hit by its first recession in 25 years.
State oil firm NNPC has been planning for two years to pay back funds owed to oil majors for joint oil operations. The government said in December a remaining $5.1 billion would be paid back in five years, a time scale which means tensions over payments on the ground will likely continue.
Locals are demanding that oil majors relocate their headquarters to the region – a move that most are loath to make due to security concerns.
A spokesperson for Shell's Nigeria unit said they had no such plans,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon (NYSE:XOM) declined to comment on any relocation and a spokesperson for ENI did not respond immediately to a request to comment.
CASH
The oil swamps are home to 40 ethnic groups competing for a share of oil money, a major obstacle to reaching an agreement that would put a permanent end to attacks on oil facilities.
""There's a kind of cycle of violence in the Delta,"" said Anthony Goldman of Nigeria-focused Promedia Consulting. ""It's not just about paying people off. This money is there – it's in the budget. It's really about what the situation is on the ground.""
Villages fight for contracts, forcing oil firms to recruit only their youth as guards or risk pipelines being blown up by rejected hires. Or they demand firms to buy food or cement from them and block passage of vehicles if they bring in supplies from other villages, oil workers say.
""The issue of surveillance contracts is not working well, we will revisit it,"" the Agip manager said at the meeting, referring to security contracts with host communities.
The protesters handed the Agip delegation a list of 16 demands including a cash payment of 10 million naira ($32,000) to ""demobilize"" the planned protest. They also want to get 60 percent of future work tendered by Agip.
Officials have repeatedly visited the biggest Delta group of Ijaw from which the Niger Delta Avengers, the biggest militant group, recruits. That has not gone down well with other groups.
""If the people of the upland part of the region are not treated with same level of respect as those in the creeks, there will never be security for the oil assets you so much cherish,"" the militant group Niger Delta Greenland Justice Mandate said in a media release last week.
Shell (LON:RDSa) has been reluctant to reopen the only key pipeline that is still down – Trans Forcados – and oil traders say there are still worries from buyers about the reliability of Nigeria’s exports, given the security problems.
Locals hope Buhari will allow Osinbajo to continue his peace efforts in the Niger Delta after he resumed work on Monday following his medical leave.
""Osinbajo...was working hard to return peace,"" said Austin Ozobo, a Delta activist. ""Our fear is that things may get worse with the return of President Buhari, certain steps or modalities taken by the (former) acting President Osinbajo to restore peace in the region may be abandoned.""

514,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 16, 2017 09:48AM ET</span>",Oil's bounce loses steam as concerns remain over supply glut,"Investing.com - Oil prices turned lower during North American morning hours on Thursday, as an overnight bounce lost steam amid ongoing concerns over a global supply glut.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude April contract shed 13 cents, or around 0.3%, to $48.73 a barrel by 9:45AM ET (13:45GMT), pulling back from a session high of $49.62.
The U.S. benchmark rallied $1.14, or about 2.4%, on Wednesday, snapping a seven-session losing streak after government data showed U.S. crude supplies fell for the first time in ten weeks.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 11 cents to $51.70 a barrel. The global benchmark reached a daily peak of $52.65 earlier.
Sentiment improved after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories declined by a surprising 237,000 barrels last week to 528.2 million barrels. It was the first drawdown in stockpiles since early January.
The weaker dollar after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected and took a less hawkish stance than anticipated also helped to make the greenback-denominated crude less expensive for holders of other currencies.
However, lingering fears over swelling global supplies pressured prices.
Oil tumbled to the lowest level since November at the start of the week after a report showed Saudi Arabia raised output back above 10 million barrels a day in February, underlining concerns over a global supply glut.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
Kuwait is scheduled to host a ministerial meeting on March 26 comprising both OPEC and non-OPEC members to review compliance with the output agreement and to discuss whether cuts would be extended beyond June.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for April held steady at $1.588 a gallon, while April heating oil dipped 0.5 cents to $1.506 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for April delivery declined 6.7 cents to $2.914 per million British thermal units.

515,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 16, 2017 09:33AM ET</span>",Coal isn't dead yet and the railroads are loving it,"By January 2016, some investors believed that the final nail had been hammered into the coffin of the American coal industry, but then something surprising happened.
According to research from UBS, coal prices and production, along with the stocks of companies involved in coal, began to slowly turn around. This came as natural gas prices rose for the first time in years, taking the pressure off coal.
It is still expected that the long-term prospects for coal are grim. However, when Donald Trump was elected president in November, new life was breathed into the coal story with investors looking forward to possible deregulation of the energy industry.
And coal companies aren't the only ones to benefit. These developments have been a huge tailwind to railroad companies who make a nice profit margin off transporting coal, but have lost much of that revenue in recent years.
UBS
In a recent note, UBS reported the decline in coal's importance to railroads when production was lower:
""In 2011, coal made up ~31% of revenue for  CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) corp. and  NSC ( Norfolk Southern  (NYSE:NSC)) and ~21% of revenue for  UNP ( Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP)). As shown in Figure 1, below, coal fell to ~12% of revenue for UNP, ~17% of revenue for CSX, and ~15% of revenue for NSC in 2016.""
UBS
But now, with coal making a comeback, as well as other economic developments, UBS is more optimistic about rail:
""We have a broadly positive view on the railroad stocks based on our expectation of favorable cyclical improvement in rail volumes in 2017, stronger pricing in 2018, and the potential for boosts to EPS and free cash flow if US tax reform is enacted.""
The bank's favorite rail stocks are CSX and NSC, in part because of their exposure to coal. "

517,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2017 07:19AM ET</span>",Oil extends gains as dollar and U.S. inventories fall,"By Edmund Blair
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose for a second day on Thursday, supported by U.S. data showing crude inventories had dipped after rising for nine weeks and a weaker dollar after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it would not hike rates faster than expected.
Brent crude oil was up 38 cents at $52.19 a barrel by 1050 GMT, recovering from Tuesday's slide to $50.25, its lowest level since Nov. 30 when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced plans to cut supplies.
U.S. light crude oil was up 37 cents at $49.23 a barrel, also climbing from a three-month low.
The rebound from three-month lows has been cautious, with investors looking for evidence that OPEC-led supply cuts will bring a sustained drawdown in stockpiles since OPEC and non-OPEC producers began cutting back output on Jan. 1.
""The dollar is weaker due to the U.S. Fed. I don’t think it is going to be enough to bring some follow-through buying to crude oil. We need something more substantial,"" said Olivier Jakob of Swiss consultancy Petromatrix.
The U.S. Energy Information Agency said on Wednesday that crude oil stocks fell 237,000 barrels in the week to March 10, defying forecasts of a 10th weekly rise. [EIA/S]
Further support came on Wednesday from the International Energy Agency (IEA). Although global inventories rose in January, the agency said the oil market could be in deficit by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017.
OPEC has broadly complied with its commitment to cut 1.2 million bpd in the first half of the year, but investors have been unnerved as stocks have kept climbing. The IEA called for patience, saying cuts would take time to feed through. [IEA/M]
Thursday's oil price rise seemed largely powered by a dip in the dollar, helping commodities across the board. A decline in the U.S. currency makes dollar-denominated commodities less expensive for holders of other currencies.
OPEC has said it wants to see inventories fall below the five-year average for industrialized nations. Stephen Brennock of PVM oil brokerage said this would only be achieved if OPEC kept supply reductions beyond the first half of 2017.
""Unless OPEC agrees to extend its self-imposed production restraint beyond the June deadline, any claims of victory in the battle against the oil glut will be premature,"" Brennock said.

OPEC member Kuwait said this week that it was ready to prolong the deal to reduce supply. But OPEC heavyweight Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, has said it is too early to consider an extension.

Comex gold futures jumped to a session peak of $1,228.65 a troy ounce, the highest since March 6. It was last at $1,225.55 by 4:10AM ET (08:10GMT), up $24.85, or around 2.1%.
Meanwhile, spot gold was up $6.30 at $1,225.75 per ounce.
The Fed on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 0.75%-to-1% in a widely-expected move, but said further increases would only be ""gradual.""
Fed officials stuck to their projection for two more hikes this year, when many had expected a more hawkish shift in the Fed's rate hike outlook.
The dollar sank to a one-month low against a basket of major currencies, while Treasury yields fells sharply, in reaction to the Fed's rate view for the rest of the year.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion.
A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for May delivery surged 53.9 cents, or 3.2%, to $17.46 a troy ounce. It reached a two-week high of $17.53 earlier.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for April rose 0.47% to $49.09 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange global benchmark Brent for May delivery was quoted up 0.12% to $52.05 a barrel.
U.S. crude inventories fell by 240,000 barrels by the end of last week, the U.S. energy Information Administration (EIA) said Wednesday, compared to an expected 3.2 million barrels gain.
Gasoline inventories fell by 3.1 million barrels, while distillates dropped 4.2 million barrels, compared with declines of 1.98 million barrels and 1.5 million barrels respectively. The crude draw was less than the American Petroleum Institute (API) estimate of a 530,000 barrels drop.
Overall, crude inventories at 528.2 million barrels are 7.3% higher than year-ago levels, and the storage hub at Cushing, Oklahoma, recorded a build of 2.13 million barrels.

The ministry then clarified the figures both parse and amplify a central point of coordinated pact by OPEC and non-OPEC nations to trim nearly 1.8 million bpd from global markets in the first six months of the year - the goal is an average over the period and represnts oil for sale, not supplies placed in storage or used domestically.
""The difference between what the market observes as production, and the actual supply levels in any given month, is due to operational factors that are influenced by storage adjustments and other month to month variables,"" the ministry statement said.
""Saudi Arabia assures the market that it is committed and determined to stabilising the global oil market by working closely with all other participating OPEC and non-OPEC producers.""
Kuwait is scheduled to host a ministerial meeting on March 26 comprising both OPEC and non-OPEC members to review compliance with the output agreement and to discuss whether cuts would be extended beyond June.

523,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2017 01:01PM ET</span>",Trump seeks input from U.S. energy companies on Paris climate pact,"By Valerie Volcovici and Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration has been contacting U.S. energy companies to ask them about their views on the U.N. global climate accord, according to two sources with knowledge of the effort, a sign Trump is reconsidering his 2016 campaign pledge to back out of the deal.
The sources, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the subject, said many of the companies reached by the administration had said they would prefer the United States remain in the pact, but would also support reducing U.S. commitments in the deal. 
The accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, would limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.
The sources did not name the companies contacted. 
One of the sources said the companies were ""publicly traded fossil fuel companies,"" and added the White House would consider their input in making a decision on the Paris accord shortly. The source said the White House has been leading the discussions with the fossil fuel companies and the State Department, which represents the United States in climate negotiations, had not taken part.  
A White House official declined to comment.
Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed during his campaign for the White House to ""cancel the Paris Climate Agreement"" within 100 days, claiming it would be too costly for the U.S. economy. 
Since being elected he has been mostly quiet on the issue. In a New York Times interview in November he said he would keep an open mind about the Paris deal. He and members of his family and inner circle also met with climate change advocate and former Vice President Al Gore in December. 
Officials for  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP),  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), Peabody Energy Corp and others did not immediately comment when asked about whether they had been contacted by the White House about the Paris accord.
But several, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, have expressed public support for the pact. The World Coal Association, which represents Peabody and other miners, has also said it supports the deal.
OIL COMPANY SUPPORT
Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Darren Woods recently called the pledges that came out of the Paris agreement an “effective framework” for dealing with emissions, and pointed to Exxon’s own work to cut its carbon emissions.
In comments on Exxon’s website, Woods wrote: “I believe, and my company believes, that climate risks warrant action and it’s going to take all of us – business, governments and consumers – to make meaningful progress.”  
Rex Tillerson, Exxon’s former CEO and now U.S. Secretary of State, also supported remaining a part of the climate change discussion during his confirmation hearing. He said he did not see climate change as an imminent national security threat but said the U.S. would be ""better served by being at that table"" and remaining a party to climate change negotiations.
Conoco CEO Ryan Lance similarly said he favored the U.S. remaining in the Paris agreement, during CERAWeek comments last week, in part because it could create opportunities for its natural gas operations and its investments in carbon-capture and storage. 
Benjamin Sporton, the president of the World Coal Association, had a similar stance: ""With a number of well-developed carbon capture and storage projects, the United States is already a global leader in cleaner coal technology. Given the role given to low emissions coal technology in the Paris Agreement by many developing economies, there are clear benefits to remaining within the agreement."" 
J. Robinson West, former chairman of Magellan Petroleum Corp., and now a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, said President Trump’s anti-Paris accord sentiments probably reflected his dealings with the CEOs of smaller companies that operate only in the U.S.
""The independents are anti-climate change ... all this stuff costs them money. The global companies operate all over the world. They have to operate at one standard - the highest standard - wherever they operate,” he said. 

Global oil companies have spent heavily on environmental initiatives in recent years. Exxon Mobil, for example, logged $4.9 billion in environmental spending in 2016, about 2.24 percent of total revenue, according to its annual report with the Securities and Exchanges Commission. ConocoPhillips spent $627 million, or 2.57 percent of revenue.

When the LNA originally took over Es Sider, Ras Lanuf and two other terminals in Libya's Oil Crescent in September, it handed them to the NOC in Tripoli.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global oil inventories rose for the first time in January as the market grappled with a swell in production last year, but if OPEC maintains its output cuts, demand should overtake supply in the first half of this year, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday.
The IEA's monthly report struck a more bullish note than that issued by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Tuesday.
OPEC also flagged rising inventory levels, but raised its estimates for production outside the group and did not see a rebalancing between supply and demand until the second half of this year. [OPEC/M]
The IEA said crude stocks in the world's richest nations rose in January for the first time since July by 48 million barrels to 3.03 billion barrels, more than 300 million barrels above the five-year average.
""The actual build in OECD stocks in January reminds us that it may be some time before global stocks start to fall,"" the agency said.
The increase is the product of ""relentless"" supply growth in the latter stages of last year, particularly from OPEC countries that pumped at record levels, and from the U.S. shale oil basin, where drilling activity began picking up 10 months ago.
Compliance by OPEC with its agreed output cut of 1.2 million barrels per day in the first half of this year was 91 percent in February and, if the group maintains its supply limit to June, the market could show an implied deficit of 500,000 bpd, the IEA said. 
""If current production levels were maintained to June when the output deal expires, there is an implied market deficit of 500,000 bpd for 1H17, assuming, of course, nothing changes elsewhere in supply and demand,"" the IEA said.
""For those looking for a re-balancing of the oil market the message is that they should be patient, and hold their nerve.""
In its October report, before the November agreement between OPEC and some of its competitors including Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan to limit output, the IEA warned the market risked running into a third successive year of excess supply without any action from the producer group. 
SAUDI OUTPUT UP, BUT NO QUOTA-BUSTING
Within OPEC, Saudi Arabia has shouldered the burden of the production cuts, offsetting poorer compliance by other nations.
In February, Saudi oil production staged a monthly rise of 180,000 bpd, but at 9.98 million bpd, its output remained below its agreed target of 10.06 million bpd and, according to tanker-tracking data, Riyadh is focusing its cutbacks on North America, the IEA said.
""At 32.3 million bpd, the call on OPEC crude during the first quarter of 2017 is higher than average output of 31.9 million bpd so far this year, which could lead to a draw in global inventories,"" the IEA said, adding that it was not clear if the group will extend its supply agreement.
""Beyond the nervousness about this legacy supply and concerns about rising production today from some non-OPEC countries; the implementation of the OPEC production agreement appears in February to have maintained the solid start seen in January.""
Saxo Bank senior manager Ole Hansen said the report did not rock the boat as the OPEC report did yesterday. 
""As long as OPEC stays on track and non-OPEC delivers on their agreed cuts the market will continue to balance,"" he said.
Beyond OPEC, oil production rose 90,000 bpd in February, as increasing U.S. output offset declines elsewhere.
Compared with last year, total non-OPEC supply was 285,000 bpd lower, of which the United States accounts for roughly half, the agency said.
""The recovery path of U.S. tight oil is key to rebalancing the oil market over 2017, so is the compliance of the 11 non-OPEC countries that agreed to curb output,"" the IEA said.
The IEA left its estimate of global demand growth unchanged from its last report at 1.4 million bpd in 2017.
""The market is still dealing with a vast amount of past supply, which will take time to work its way through the system. Meanwhile, demand growth has not provided any further encouragement after three consecutive months when we upgraded our estimates,"" the IEA said.

A fast-moving weather system will then impact the east-central U.S. Saturday into Sunday, followed by warming Monday, but again cooling off mid-week.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw of 60 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 10.
That compares with a withdrawal of 68 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 1 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 85 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.295 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 7.7% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 15.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Prices of the heating fuel are down around 20% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

529,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2017 09:58AM ET</span>",Exclusive: London gold rush - ICE to launch clearing before banks are ready,"By Peter Hobson and Jan Harvey
LONDON (Reuters) - Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is set to launch clearing for London's benchmark gold price auction before participants are ready as it races to prevent rivals muscling in on the city's $5 trillion-a-year bullion market, market and banking sources said.
Clearing - where an exchange acts as an intermediary to guarantee and settle trades - is regarded as a necessary progression for the gold trade as tighter regulatory capital requirements increase the cost of trading off-exchange. ICE (N:ICE), the London Metal Exchange (LME) and CME Group (O:CME) are competing to offer services through futures contracts and grab the biggest slice of the new business. 
U.S.-based exchange operator ICE has already pushed back the launch of its service by several weeks to allow the banks and brokers who participate in the auction to adapt their IT systems, four sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Two of the sources said ICE now planned to introduce clearing from Apr. 3 - the first Monday of the month. 
However, at least four of the 14 banks and brokers who participate in the LBMA Gold Price auction - which sets the benchmark for bullion traders around the world - will still not be ready to use the new system, three separate sources said. 
When asked by Reuters about any delay in the launch and any lack of readiness among auction participants, ICE declined to comment for this story. 
Banks that are not ready would be suspended from the auction until they have the necessary IT infrastructure in place or would have to participate through other players who could clear deals, according to the sources.
ICE's readiness to provoke such disruption illustrates how much it wants to avoid further delays that could torpedo its ambitions to become the dominant exchange in London's vast bullion market, market sources said.
It comes as the LME is preparing to launch its own rival precious metals contracts in June. The LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HK:0388), has moved aggressively by reaching a 50:50 revenue-sharing deal with a company founded by a group of banks to promote its offering. 
If it quickly builds up liquidity, it could mop up a big slice of the market.
The sources said a launch by ICE within weeks could give it time to cement its own position before the LME contract begins trading. 
""ICE is obviously of the view that if they go early, before the LME, then they will win long term,"" said a source familiar with the process of launching the service. ""If something already has liquidity, it will tend to attract liquidity."" 
U.S.-based CME launched a cleared gold contract in January but it has so far struggled to attract business. 
DEADLINE
 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN),  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN), ICBC Standard Bank (SS:601398) and China Construction Bank will not be ready to clear the LBMA auction from day one, according to four sources. 
""We are trying our best to communicate with our broker to make the clearing possible. But I'm not sure whether we can get ready before deadline as some issues still need to be solved,"" a spokesman for China Construction Bank said. 
Societe Generale declined to comment, while Standard Chartered was unable to provide immediate comment and ICBC did not respond to a request for comment. 
The remaining LBMA Gold Price benchmarking participants are Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), ScotiaMocatta, Toronto-Dominion Bank and UBS. INTL FCStone is an indirect participant. 
A telephone-based benchmark gold price auction, or gold fix, dates back to 1919. In those days, each representative had a small British flag that they raised after receiving any change from their dealing room. As long as any flag was raised, the chairman could not declare the price as fixed. 
This was replaced by the current electronic alternative in 2015 because of regulatory pressure and U.S. lawsuits alleging rigging by the banks that set bullion prices.
Sources at many participant banks said that they were unhappy with the speed at which ICE was seeking to introduce clearing, which require investment in IT processes and back office systems and raise complex compliance issues.
""They are struggling because they've been focusing on getting ready for MiFID,"" said one source, referring to new guidelines on commodity derivatives which will come into force next year. 
ICE says clearing will open the price benchmarking process to new participants by removing the need for them to have bilateral credit lines in place with all other direct participants in the auction.

But it is also a way of bringing more business to the exchange and could be key for the success its gold contract, market participants said.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen is to hold what will be a closely-watched press conference 30 minutes after the release of the Fed's statement, as investors look for any hawkish change in tone about the economy or future rate hikes.
Fed officials previously projected three rate hikes in 2017, but that might move up to four, amid signs of a recent uptick in inflation and continued strength in the jobs market.
Ahead of the Fed's decision, reports showed that U.S. inflation posted the smallest increase since last summer, while retail sales recorded their smallest gain in six months in February.
Meanwhile, investors were focusing on political risks in Europe. Wednesday's Dutch election is being watched as a bellwether for the spread of populism in Europe, particularly ahead of next month's French election.
Opinion polls have suggested that Dutch nationalist Geert Wilders' right-wing Freedom Party, which wants to take the Netherlands out of the European Union and stop Muslim immigration, has lost its lead to more mainstream opponents.
However, a diplomatic standoff with Turkey was seen influencing voting in Wilders' favor, prompting investors to remain weary over the possibility of a Brexit or Trump-style shock result.

That compared with analyst expectations for an increase of 3.7 million barrels. If the draw is confirmed by government data on Wednesday, it would be the first drawdown after nine consecutive builds.
U.S. gasoline and distillate inventories drew more than expected, the data also showed.
Oil tumbled on Tuesday after OPEC reported a rise in global crude stocks and a surprise output jump from its biggest member, Saudi Arabia, further pressuring prices that have erased nearly all of their gains since OPEC announced output cuts in November.
Secondary sources had said Saudi output fell in February to 9.797 million barrels per day (bpd), but Riyadh told OPEC it rose to 10.011 million bpd.
In an effort to dispel market concerns, the Saudi energy ministry said the ""difference between what the market observes as production, and the actual supply levels in any given month, is due to operational factors that are influenced by storage adjustments and other month-to-month variables.""
Influential U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs cast a positive light on the numbers, saying compliance with production cuts remains high. Market rebalancing is still progressing and the bank expects demand for oil to finally exceed supply next quarter.
""Our expectations that inventories will draw through 2017 therefore leads us to expect that Brent timespreads will continue to strengthen with the forward curve in backwardation by 3Q17,"" Goldman said in its research note.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is curbing its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1, the first reduction in eight years. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC producers agreed to cut half as much.
OPEC said in the report oil stocks in industrialized nations rose in January to stand 278 million barrels above the five-year average, of which the surplus in crude was 209 million barrels and the rest refined products.
""Despite the supply adjustment, stocks have continued to rise, not just in the U.S., but also in Europe,"" OPEC said. 
""Nevertheless, prices have undoubtedly been provided a floor by the production accords.""
Oil prices (LCOc1) fell after the release of the report to trade close to $50 a barrel, their lowest since November. Crude is still up from about $40 a barrel a year ago and a 12-year low near $27 reached in January 2016.
In the report, OPEC pointed to an increase in its members' compliance with the deal, according to figures from secondary sources that OPEC uses to monitor output.
Supply from the 11 OPEC members with production targets under the accord - all except Libya and Nigeria - fell to 29.681 million bpd last month, according to these figures. 
That means OPEC has complied by more than 100 percent with its plan to lower output for those nations to 29.804 million bpd, according to a Reuters calculation. OPEC gave no compliance figure in the report.
But the report revised up its estimate of oil supply from producers outside OPEC this year, as higher oil prices following the supply cut help spur a revival in U.S. shale drilling.
Production outside OPEC is now expected to rise by 400,000 bpd, 160,000 more than previously thought. U.S. oil output in 2017 was revised up by 100,000 bpd.
SAUDI REPORTS OUTPUT RISE
OPEC said its production, including Nigeria and Libya, fell by 140,000 bpd in February to 31.96 million bpd, led by a large Saudi cut.
While the OPEC secondary sources said Saudi output fell in February to 9.797 million bpd, Saudi Arabia reported to OPEC that it increased to 10.011 million bpd - which would still be in line with its OPEC output target.
OPEC uses the two sets of data to monitor output - figures provided by each country and by secondary sources, which include industry media. This is a legacy of old disputes over real production levels.
Production levels reported to OPEC by other members in February including Algeria, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela were also higher than estimated by the secondary sources.
OPEC maintains that stockpiles will begin to fall thanks to the supply cut, saying that in the second half of the year ""the market is expected to start balancing or even see the start of a drawdown in oil inventories."" 

The report revised upward its forecast for world oil demand in 2017 and said the requirement for OPEC crude would average 32.35 million bpd - more than current production, suggesting stocks will drop if output does not rise.

Comex gold futures tacked on $1.25, or around 0.1%, to $1,204.30 a troy ounce by 11:20AM ET (15:20GMT), within sight of last Friday's low of $1,194.50, which was the weakest level since January 31.

The U.S. central bank will also release its latest forecasts for economic growth and interest rates, known as the ""dot-plot"".
Fed Chair Janet Yellen's post-meeting press conference will be closely watched for clues on the pace of future rate hikes. Fed officials previously projected three rate hikes in 2017, but that might move up to four, amid signs of an uptick in inflation and continued strength in the jobs market.
Meanwhile, investors were focusing on the Dutch election, to be held Wednesday, which is being watched as a bellwether for the spread of populism in Europe, particularly ahead of next month's French election.
Opinion polls have suggested that Dutch nationalist Geert Wilders' right-wing Freedom Party, which wants to take the Netherlands out of the European Union and stop Muslim immigration, has lost its lead to more mainstream opponents.
However, a diplomatic standoff with Turkey threatened to overshadow the final stretch of campaigning and influence voting in Wilders' favor with less than 24 hours to polling day, prompting investors to remain weary over the possibility of a Brexit or Trump-style shock result.
Elsewhere, in France, presidential candidate Francois Fillon was put under formal investigation on Tuesday over misuse of public funds in the fake jobs scandal involving his wife, the prosecutor's office said.
Fillon has said he would maintain his bid as the candidate of The Republicans party in the April-May presidential election even if he went under formal investigation.

U.S. natural gas for April delivery shed 3.7 cents, or around 1.2% to $3.006 per million British thermal units by 9:50AM ET (13:50GMT). Prices of the heating fuel rallied to $3.089 in the prior session, the most since February 10.
The National Weather Service warned some 50 million people from Pennsylvania to Maine of a ""rapidly intensifying nor'easter"" that was unusual for so late in the winter. Some could expect to find themselves surrounded by up to 2 feet (60 cm) of snow by early Wednesday, the federal agency predicted.
However, New York City was expected to escape the worst of it after the NWS withdrew its blizzard warning for the city on Tuesday morning, replacing it with a mere ""winter weather advisory."" The service sharply reduced its snowfall forecast for the city to between 4 and 8 inches (10 and 20 cm).
The storm comes near the end of an unusually mild winter along much of the East Coast, with below-normal snowfalls in some areas, including New York City and Washington DC.
It was the warmest February on record in nearly the entire area, according to the Northeast Regional Climate Center.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 49 and 59 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 10.
That compares with a withdrawal of 68 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 1 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 85 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.295 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 7.7% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 15.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Prices of the heating fuel are down around 17% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude April contract sank to a session low of $47.66 a barrel, a level not seen since November 30. It was last at $47.80 by 8:30AM ET (12:30GMT), down 60 cents, or around 1.2%.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 50 cents to $50.85 a barrel. The global benchmark touched a session low of $50.61 earlier, its cheapest since November 30.

However, Saudi Arabia boosted production by 263,300 barrels a day to 10.011 million a day, reversing about a third of the cuts it made the previous month.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
Kuwait is scheduled to host a ministerial meeting on March 26 comprising both OPEC and non-OPEC members to review compliance with the output agreement and to discuss whether cuts would be extended beyond June.
Investors now looked ahead to weekly data from the U.S. on stockpiles of crude and refined products.
Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (20:30GMT) later on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock rise of 3.2 million barrels.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices recovered modestly from three-month lows on Tuesday, with concerns persisting about rising U.S. inventories and few clear signs that OPEC will extend supply curbs beyond June.
The immediate focus for investors is Tuesday's data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) about U.S. crude and product stockpiles after a bigger-than-expected climb in last week's report. Analysts see a further, albeit smaller, rise this time.
""Right now, the direction of travel is more important than the absolute level,"" said Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), citing concerns that OPEC-led cuts lasting from January to June had not halted the build.
By 1052 GMT, Brent futures (LCOc1) had risen 35 cents to $51.70 a barrel, after sliding on Monday to $50.85, their lowest level since Dec. 1.
U.S. crude (CLc1) rose 27 cents to $48.67 a barrel, after dipping in the previous session to $47.90, its lowest since November.
""This week is crucial to give us an idea of where prices will be for the rest of the year - all eyes will be on API data later, and a sniff of another big crude build and down we go towards $45,"" said Matt Stanley, commodities broker at Freight Investor Services.
Investors will also be watching OPEC's monthly report to be released on Tuesday, followed by a report from the International Energy Agency on global supply and demand on Wednesday.
Crude prices have erased most of the gains made since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced supply curbs on Nov. 30, followed in December by an announcement that a number of non-OPEC producers would join the cuts.
OPEC has said the supply cuts aim to stabilize prices and draw down global inventories. Investors are now looking for indications that OPEC will extend its reductions beyond June.
Saudi ally Kuwait said on Monday it would support an extension of the global deal. 
""It will speed up rebalancing of the market and will help bring prices to acceptable levels for oil-producing nations and the industry in general,"" the Gulf state's oil minister, Essam al-Marzouq, told the state news agency.

But Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter and which has cut even more production than it had pledged in the OPEC deal, has yet to indicate clearly whether it is ready to extend.

Meanwhile, spot gold was little changed at $1,204.50 per ounce.
The Dutch election on Wednesday is being watched as a bellwether for the spread of populism in Europe, particularly ahead of next month's French election.
Opinion polls have suggested that Dutch nationalist Geert Wilders' right-wing Freedom Party, which wants to take the Netherlands out of the European Union and stop Muslim immigration, has lost its lead to more mainstream opponents.
However, a diplomatic standoff with Turkey over the weekend threatened to overshadow the final stretch of campaigning and influence voting in Wilders' favor with less than 48 hours to polling day, prompting investors to remain weary over the possibility of a Brexit or Trump-style shock result.
Meanwhile, markets braced for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May to trigger Article 50, which kicks off the process of exiting the European Union.
Britain's Article 50 Brexit bill returns to the House of Commons on Monday for lawmakers to debate and vote on conditions attached to it by members of the House of Lords.
If the Brexit bill is passed Monday, it could allow Theresa May to announce the triggering of Article 50 as early as Tuesday, when she is due to brief parliament on last week's EU summit.
Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve is scheduled to conclude its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, with most market participants expecting the U.S. central bank to raise the fed funds target range by a quarter point, which would put it in a range between 0.75%-1%.
According to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, market expectations for a rate hike this week stood at 93%.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen's post-meeting press conference will be closely watched for clues on the pace of future rate hikes. Fed officials previously projected three rate hikes in 2017, but that might move up to four.
Besides the Fed, this week's calendar also features U.S. data on inflation, retail sales, building permits, housing starts, initial jobless claims, industrial production, consumer sentiment as well as surveys on manufacturing conditions in the Philadelphia and New York regions.
Another event markets are watching is the expiration of the U.S. debt ceiling extension in the middle of the week, though the government has sufficient funding until sometime in the fall.
The White House, meanwhile, is expected to release its budget Thursday.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude April contract inched down 7 cents, or around 0.2%, to $48.42 a barrel by 9:20AM ET (13:20GMT). It fell to an overnight low of $47.90, a level not seen since November 30.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 2 cents to $51.35 a barrel. The global benchmark touched a session low of $50.85 earlier, its cheapest since November 30.
Concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand pressured crude prices.
Data from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes on Friday revealed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by 8 last week, the eighth weekly increase in a row. That brought the total count to 617, the most since October 2015.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude supplies rose by 8.2 million barrels last week to yet another all-time high of 528.4 million. It was the ninth straight weekly build in U.S. stockpiles, feeding concerns about a global glut.
Sentiment in oil markets in recent months has been torn between rising stockpiles and increased shale production in the U.S. and hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries made a strong start to lowering their oil output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day by the end of June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
Kuwait is scheduled to host a ministerial meeting on March 26 comprising both OPEC and non-OPEC members to review compliance with the output agreement and to discuss whether cuts would be extended beyond June.
Investors will keep an eye out for monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency due on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively to gauge global supply and demand levels.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for April shed 0.6 cents, or around 0.4%, to $1.584 a gallon, while April heating oil added 0.2 cents to $1.506 a gallon.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil hovered around three-month lows on Monday, as rising U.S. inventories and drilling activity offset optimism over OPEC's efforts to restrict crude output. 
Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 7 cents on the day, at $51.30 a barrel by 1202 GMT, having hit a session trough of $50.85, its lowest level since Nov. 30. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) (CLc1) fell 15 cents to $48.34 a barrel.
The price has fallen by more than 8 percent since last Monday, its biggest week-on-week drop in four months, and analysts said the slide may not have much further to run.
""The market is bearish because sentiment has turned. The risk is still towards the downside, but we are nowhere near the precipice,"" PVM Oil Associates Tamas Varga said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note it remained ""very confident"" about commodity prices and maintained its price forecast of $57.50 a barrel for WTI in the second quarter.
U.S. drillers added oil rigs for an eighth consecutive week, Baker Hughes said on Friday, lifting spending to benefit from an earlier recovery in crude prices since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to cut output. [RIG/U]
OPEC and other major oil producers including Russia reached an agreement late last year to rein in production by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017.
Although OPEC states have been complying with supply curbs, led by Saudi Arabia, it has not been enough to overshadow a rise in U.S. inventories to a new high. [EIA/S]
""It will be interesting to see how OPEC rhetoric will evolve with this price correction. Is price the only consideration when it comes to the decision of extending cuts?""  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) global head of commodity strategy Harry Tchilinguirian told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.
He added that OPEC's task was more difficult as it aimed to cut inventory levels rather than simply target a specific price.
Money managers cut their net long positions in U.S. crude futures and options in the week to March 7.
For the broader financial markets, the focus will be on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting later this week at which it could likely raise U.S. interest rates.

""The week ahead is packed with potentially market defining releases,"" Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at Sydney's CMC Markets, said. ""However, the key to market performance this week is the response to the U.S. lift in rates.""

U.S. natural gas for April delivery rallied 5.5 cents, or around 1.8% to $3.063 per million British thermal units by 8:10AM ET (12:10GMT). Futures touched a session high of $3.089 earlier, the most since February 10.
It posted a gain of 6.4% last week as forecasts showing cooler weather on the way boosted the heating fuel.
Weather experts predicted the U.S. Northeast region could see 12 to 18 inches of snow from Monday to early Wednesday, while sub-freezing temperatures were forecast in the upper 20s Fahrenheit, the National Weather Service said.
New York City issued a snow alert for Monday night into Tuesday, expecting snowfall rates of up to 2 to 4 inches per hour Tuesday morning and afternoon, with gusts of up to 50 mph.
The storm comes near the end of an unusually mild winter along much of the East Coast, with below-normal snowfalls in some areas, including New York City and Washington DC.
It was the warmest February on record in nearly the entire area, according to the Northeast Regional Climate Center.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 49 and 59 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 10.
That compares with a withdrawal of 68 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 1 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 85 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.295 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 7.7% lower than levels at this time a year ago but 15.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Prices of the heating fuel are down around 17% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

New York City issued a snow alert for Monday night, preparing its fleet of snow plows, as some 50 million people up and down the Eastern Seaboard came under winter storm or blizzard watches.
Washington, which often bogs down with even low levels of snow, was expecting 5 inches in the city and twice that in outlying areas.
The storm raised the potential for dangerous travel and power outages with damaging wind gusts up to 50 mph possible across eastern Long Island and southeastern Connecticut, the National Weather Service said. 
The likelihood of blowing snow and strong winds could lead to ""whiteout"" conditions with visibility as poor as a quarter mile, the service said. Sub-freezing temperatures were forecast in the upper 20s Fahrenheit. 
New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo announced preparations for the so-called Nor'easter storm, activating the state Emergency Operations Center as of Monday night while also directing state agencies to be on heightened alert.
""I encourage all New Yorkers in affected regions to plan ahead, and avoid any unnecessary travel as the storm progresses,"" Cuomo said in a statement, adding that commuters should expect road closures, delays and cancellations.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was installing hundreds of pieces of snow equipment at the three New York area airports, including snow melters that can liquefy up to 500 tons of snow per hours and plows that can clear snow at 40 mph, Cuomo's office said.
Thousands of tons of salt and sand were prepared for airport roads, parking lots, bridges and tunnels.
The threat of heavy snow comes toward the end of an unusually mild winter along much of the East Coast, with below-normal snowfalls in some areas, including New York City and Washington. It was the warmest February on record in nearly the entire area, according to the Northeast Regional Climate Center. 
Last week in New York, temperatures hovered near 70 degrees Fahrenheit, according to Accuweather.com, and hit 60 degrees or higher on six days in February.

Data from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes on Friday revealed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by 8 last week, the eighth weekly increase in a row. That brought the total count to 617, the most since October 2015.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude supplies jumped by 8.2 million barrels last week to yet another all-time high of 528.4 million. It was the ninth straight weekly build in U.S. stockpiles, feeding concerns about a global glut.
Oil prices have been trading in a narrow $5 range around the low-to-mid-$50s over the past three months as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between rising stockpiles and increased shale production in the U.S. and hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries made a strong start to lowering their oil output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day by the end of June, but so far the move has had little impact on inventory levels.
Kuwait is scheduled to host a ministerial meeting on March 26 comprising both OPEC and non-OPEC members to review compliance with the output agreement and to discuss whether cuts would be extended beyond June.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for April shed 2.4 cents, or about 1.5% to $1.600 on Friday. It ended down about 3.2% for the week.
April heating oil inched down 2.5 cents, or 1.7%, to finish at $1.503 a gallon, the lowest since November 30. For the week, the fuel lost roughly 5.7%.
Natural gas futures for April delivery rose 3.4 cents, or almost 1.2%, to $3.008 per million British thermal units. It posted a weekly gain of 6.4%.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Meanwhile, investors will keep an eye out for monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency to gauge global supply and demand levels.
Traders will also continue to pay close attention to comments from global oil producers for further evidence that they are complying with their agreement to reduce output this year.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.
Tuesday, March 14
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties will publish its monthly assessment of oil markets.
Later in the day, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, is to publish its weekly report on U.S. oil supplies.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's ambitious plan to recycle thousands of tonnes of gold lying idle in temples and households looks to have foundered on concerns over high costs and slight returns, in a blow to government hopes of cutting imports of the metal.
After 16 months, temples and households have turned over just seven tonnes of gold out of the 24,000 tonnes believed to be in private hands, two industry sources and a government official said, with almost all the gold coming from temples.
Families that hold about 80 percent of the idle gold have largely shunned the scheme, with some four dozen government-approved centers that opened to test purity still to process a single gram of household gold, said Harshad Ajmera, president of the Indian Association of Hallmarking Centres. 
""You hardly earn anything but you have to do so many things to deposit gold under the scheme. Why should I take all this pain?"" said 54-year-old clerk Ganpat Shelke, who considered depositing 50 grams of gold.
The struggling scheme was launched with much fanfare by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2015, with India seeking ways to stem the spending of billions of dollars on a non-essential commodity that accounted for 27 percent of its trade deficit in the year to March, 2016. 
The country is the world's second-biggest gold importer behind China, buying about 800 tonnes a year for wedding gifts, religious donations and as an investment. (For a graphic on India's gold market click http://tmsnrt.rs/2c1U49q)
The plan was for holders of idle gold to lodge it with banks in return for interest and cash at redemption. The government would melt the gold and auction or rent it to jewelers, reducing the need for imports.
But the scheme logistics mean the owners of the gold must shoulder the cost of testing its purity and melting it down, while the interest rate on offer of just 2.5 percent compares with 7-8 percent that banks offer for cash deposit rates.
""If a consumer wants to have 25 grams jewelry converted the cost of converting and purity testing takes 3-4 percent of total value away,"" said Shekhar Bhandari, executive vice-president of Kotak Mahindra Bank.
RELUCTANT BANKS
Even when holders of the precious metal want to take part in the scheme they have run into hurdles.
""I visited four banks several times to deposit gold but they could not accept it,"" said Kushal Chatterjee, a businessmen from the eastern city of Kolkata. ""They said they did not know the process.""
At least five bank branches visited by Reuters this week in Mumbai said they could not accept gold under the scheme as they had not been given directions by their head offices.
A senior official with the Indian Banks' Association said the current scheme offered banks little or no profit.
""There should be an incentive for banks,"" said the official, who declined to be named when commenting on a sensitive issue.
Banks are also concerned that provisions allowing gold to be deposited for up to 15 years will raise currency and liquidity risks, the India Gold Policy Centre in a recent report.
A finance ministry spokesperson declined to comment on the gold program. 
Gold refiners, who more than doubled capacity in recent years in anticipation of higher scrap supplies, are operating at well below capacity, said James Jose, secretary of the Association of Gold Refineries and Mints. 
""Except for the banks, all other stakeholders like purity centers, refiners are ready, but they are helpless without banks' participation,"" he said.
The India Bullion and Jewellers Association urged the government to revisit the scheme, clearing doubts for consumers and putting pressure on banks to participate.
""Otherwise Indian imports will not fall,"" said Association secretary Surendra Mehta.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Thousands of Native American demonstrators and their supporters marched to the White House on Friday to voice outrage at President Donald Trump's support for the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines, which they say threaten tribal lands.
The protest follows months of demonstrations in a remote part of North Dakota, where the Standing Rock Sioux tribe demonstrated in an attempt to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing upstream from their reservation. 
That pipeline is being installed now, after Trump signed an executive order last month smoothing the path for construction. He also cleared the way for the Keystone XL project that would pipe Canadian crude into the United States.
The protesters, some wearing traditional tribal garb, carried signs reading ""Native Lives Matter"", ""Water is Life"", and ""Protect the Water"" while marching.
A White House official did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""You stood with us at Standing Rock and now I ask you to stand with our indigenous communities around the world,"" Dave Archambault, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, said at the rally. 
Among Republican Trump's first acts in office was to sign an executive order that reversed a decision by the previous administration of Democratic President Barack Obama to delay approval of the Dakota pipeline, a $3.8 billion project by Energy Transfer Partners LP.
The Standing Rock Sioux and the Cheyenne River Sioux lost a legal bid to halt the construction of the last link of the oil pipeline under Lake Oahe in North Dakota. The pipeline is due to be complete and ready for oil by April 1.
At the rally, Archambault's remarks were interrupted intermittently by both supportive cheers and boos from people who shouted that he ""sold out"" protestors by allowing the main anti-pipeline protest camp, Oceti Sakewin, to clear out.
""I don't care what you guys say and it's ok for you to be upset,"" Archambault said in response. ""But the real thing is we are here for our youth and here for our future.""
Protest organizers erected tipis on the National Mall to represent the camp. Oceti Sakewin was populated by protesters for months, who at times clashed with law enforcement officers.

Opponents of the Dakota Access pipeline have vowed to keep up protests against pipelines.

Crude prices slipped for a third straight day of losses, as investors continued to fret about oversupply in the industry.
Oilfield services firm Baker Hughes reported its weekly U.S. rig count rose by 8 to 617, it was the eighth straight weekly increase.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for May delivery lost $0.79 to settle at $48.49 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent shed $0.91 to $51.28 a barrel.
The slide in crude prices began on Wednesday, after the Energy Information Agency (EIA) reported that U.S. crude inventories rose to an all-time high of 528.4 million barrels for the week ended March 1.
Record U.S. crude inventories has cast a doubt on the efficacy of OPEC’s efforts to rebalance supply and demand, after the oil cartel group agreed a deal to cut production last November.
OPEC began implementing cuts of 1.16 million barrels per day at the start of this year for a period of six months, after its members and other exporters agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in an effort to combat the oversupply issue that has pressured prices over the last two years.

Gold for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange shed $1.25 or 0.19%, to trade at $1,201.95 a troy ounce.
Gold pared losses sustained from the early morning trade and benefited from a slump in the dollar, after a US jobs report showed wage growth slowed while non-farm payrolls beat expectations.
The Labor Department's non-farm payrolls report showed employers added 235,000 jobs last month, beating expectations for 200,000.
Wage growth stuttered in February and rose by only 0.2% compared to forecasts of a 0.3% increase.
The weaker wage growth raised doubts concerning the pace of rate hikes this year, as the U.S. 10-Year fell 0.34% to 2.589.
According to Investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool, 93% of traders expect a rate hike in March, compared to just 80% of traders on Monday.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. interest rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.

Copper prices rose following the latest disruption to global supplies, amid a monthlong strike at BHP Billiton's (L:BLT) (AX:BHP) Escondida mine in Chile and a dispute over export rights at Freeport's Glasberg mine in Indonesia.
The 1,300 unionized workers at Cerro Verde downed tools at 7:30 a.m. (12:30 GMT), said union leader Cesar Fernandez. 
According to Fernandez, the company plans to mitigate the effects of the strike using non-unionized workers. He said 300 or 400 employees at the mine do not belong to the union and do not normally work in areas key to production.
Cerro Verde and Freeport representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange  was up 1.2 percent at $5,760 a tonne. Prices had fallen to $5,652, their lowest since Jan. 10, in the previous session.
The Cerro Verde union initially scheduled a five-day strike but voted this week to stop work indefinitely to push for family health benefits and a bigger share of the mine's profits, Fernandez said.
Freeport-McMoRan owns a 53.56 percent stake in Cerro Verde, which more than doubled its production to nearly 500,000 tonnes of copper last year because of an expansion.

Sumitomo Metal Mining Company Ltd (T:5713) controls a 21 percent stake in the mine, and Buenaventura (N:BVN) (LM:BUEv) has 19.58 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and Mexico will launch a new round of negotiations to resolve a years-long trade dispute over Mexico's sugar exports to the United States, senior officials in both governments said on Friday.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said that the talks would be aimed at resuming Mexican imports to the United States after they had been halted earlier this week as Mexico reached a temporary limit on sugar exports to the United States. 
""These discussions are the beginning of our work together on the day-to-day issues that arise from our very important bilateral relationship,"" Ross told a news conference.
The U.S. sugar quotas are set under a 2014 trade pact that has become a source of tension between the two countries. The deal ended a year-long investigation by the U.S. government after domestic farmers and sugar companies said Mexican millers were flooding the market with cheap, subsidized sugar.
Ross said the Commerce Department pushed back an April 4 deadline for completing a review of the trade pact until May 1, to allow more time to reach a resolution that suits both countries. The government said in November that a preliminary review indicated the deal may not be working.
The two countries have been in ongoing negotiations to rework the agreements since 2016, under pressure from the U.S. industry. Those discussions were slowed amid the transition to a new administration under President Donald Trump.
Earlier this week, Reuters learned that Mexico had canceled export licenses, at a time of tightening cane supplies for U.S. refiners, who have said that Mexico's mills are circumventing them to sell refined sugar into the U.S. market.

The U.S. sugar industry has asked the government to cancel the 2014 pact unless it can be renegotiated. The country's cane refiners have said that Mexican suppliers are continuing to circumvent them to sell refined sugar, starving them of raw supplies.

578,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2017 06:42AM ET</span>",Trillion-dollar question looms as Aramco audits oil reserves,"By Reem Shamseddine, Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler
KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia/DUBAI (Reuters) - When Saudi Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] reveals a Western audit of its oil reserves, investors will be looking for two answers: How much oil and how much detail?
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih has hinted at a surprise on the upside on reserve volumes ahead of Aramco's 2018 share listing, but industry sources say detail on individual deposits – which investors have long sought - will be thin.
Saudi Arabia's reserves of easily recoverable oil have long been the world's largest. 
But there also have long been questions about the volume and quality of those reserves. For nearly 30 years - despite rising production, wild swings in oil prices and improved technology - Riyadh has annually reported the same number for reserves of 261 billion barrels, according to BP’s statistical review.
Firms listing in New York are required to have a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission audit. Last year, the SEC launched a probe into why the world's largest listed oil company, ExxonMobil (N:XOM), reported virtually unchanged reserves for years despite a plunge in prices.
Exxon revised its reserves down last month. 
Having an internationally recognized reserves audit has become a key task for Aramco as it seeks to become the world's most valuable company when it lists shares in an initial public offering (IPO) for 5 percent of the firm's value. 
An industry source told Reuters that Aramco aimed to have one of its two reserves auditors wrap up the review this year, long before the share listing.
Dallas-based DeGolyer and MacNaughton, and Gaffney, Cline and Associates, part of  Baker Hughes  (N:BHI), are involved in the auditing, sources have said. 
When the reserves are confirmed by the auditors, the results are likely to be similar to the levels of disclosure by international peers such as  BP  (LON:BP)  and Royal Dutch/Shell (L:RDSa), sources familiar with the process said. 
""What Aramco will do in the IPO is try to report in a similar way to other companies,"" a senior source with knowledge of the plans said. 
Listed majors' reserves reports ""vary a bit in detail and some give a greater breakdown. Aramco probably hasn't decided that yet,"" the source said.
Over a decade ago, Shell's stock price collapsed after the company said it had overstated its reserves by 20 percent. No listed oil major has seen its stated deposits stay unchanged for the past 30 years. 
Aramco declined to comment. ""Saudi Aramco does not comment on rumor or speculation,"" a company spokesman said. Gaffney, Cline and Associates also declined to comment, while DeGolyer did not respond to a request for comment.
A reserves total that is significantly above or below the 261 billion figure is likely to affect Aramco's potential value. Earlier phases of the audit have supported Aramco's statements on the total size of deposits.
Aramco is showing all its data to the auditors, the sources said, and is using two firms rather than one in an effort to bolster confidence that the process is not a rubber-stamping of Aramco figures. 
""Our reserves have been partially audited and are bigger than we actually booked,"" Falih said this week.
""On every metric, Aramco will surprise analysts on the upside - lowest cost, highest cash flow, solid reserves that will be certified by third-party agencies.""
WHAT'S IN THE GROUND?
Historically Aramco has provided little detail publicly on its reserves other than total volume.
Publicly traded oil companies such as BP and Shell with assets distributed globally give more detail than just a headline figure, including reserves by geographic location and whether they are developed or undeveloped.
However, they do not give reserves by individual field - and for Aramco that is precisely what investors want, because its oil is concentrated in one country, Saudi Arabia.
Sadad al-Husseini, a former Aramco senior executive and now energy consultant, said Aramco has extensive details on its reserves in every field but it was not common practice for national oil companies to identify their deposits on that basis. 
""What it might do initially is give a corporate summary and break it down by crude grade with more data to follow,"" he said.
Aramco's precise level of disclosure has yet to be decided, the source familiar with the plans said. He noted that Western majors do not list reserves by field.
""There is no way Aramco will be giving field-by-field detailed reserves,"" another industry source familiar with the plans said, adding that the firm considers reserves decline rates and field maturity as sensitive, non-public data.
The question of how much oil is left at the biggest Saudi field, Ghawar, has long intrigued market watchers. 
""What they need to offer is a package of assets with value-chain, operating and financial detail comparable to that made available by integrated oil companies,"" said Jason Kenney, head of European oil and gas research at Santander (MC:SAN).

""I doubt you're going to get a full breakdown of the 261 billion barrels - but maybe the IPO is not about a full upstream offering either. To attract the investors, you’ve got to offer the same level of transparency as alternative investments.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Crude prices inched up on Friday after dropping to their lowest in more than three months the session before, pressured by concerns that a global supply glut is proving stubbornly persistent.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) was up 37 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $49.65 a barrel at 0604 GMT. It fell below $50 on Thursday for the first since mid-December, when OPEC and other producers agreed to cut output.
Brent crude was up 35 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $52.54 a barrel, having settled down 1.7 percent in the previous session and slumping 5 percent the day before in its biggest percentage decline in a year.
WTI is on track for a 7 percent decline this week, the biggest weekly drop since early November. Brent is heading for a 6 percent fall, also the biggest since early November. 
Market confidence has taken a hit after a period of higher prices enticed more U.S. shale oil companies to drill more wells and as stockpiles have remained high. 
""Steep price falls in the last two days amid building U.S. inventories show that the market remains concerned about the supply-demand balance,"" NAB Group Economics said in a research note.
Data showed crude stocks in the United States, the world's top oil consumer, swelled by 8.2 million barrels last week to a record 528.4 million barrels. 
U.S. drilling has also picked up, with producers planning to expand crude production in North Dakota, Oklahoma and other shale regions, while output has jumped in the Permian, America's largest oilfield.
That has undermined the bullish sentiment generated after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and major producers including Russia agreed to cut production in the first half of this year to drain a global glut.

582,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2017 01:40AM ET</span>",Oil industry revives quest for deepwater reserves,"By Ron Bousso
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Deepwater oil drilling can be expensive, time-consuming and a hard sell to investors. But the world's top energy firms are restarting their search for giant oilfields under the ocean after a two-year lull.
A recovery in oil prices to about $50 a barrel from a 12-year low in 2016 is reviving oil majors' appetite for risk.
Reductions in offshore production costs mean that some projects may be able to compete with North American shale fields, executives said at an energy conference in Houston this week.
The recovery in the industry has so far been focused on onshore shale output from the largest U.S. oilfield, the Permian Basin.
""Our competition over the past years has evolved from 'we want to be the best in deepwater' to 'we want to compete with shale' to 'we want to beat the Permian',"" Wael Sawan, Royal Dutch Shell's executive vice president for deepwater, said in an interview.
Shell (LON:RDSa) is the largest deepwater producer among the world's top publicly traded oil companies and is set to pump 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) from such projects by the end of the decade.
Firms such as Shell and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), who specialize in complex offshore exploration, slashed budgets after oil prices collapsed in 2014. Spending cuts were so drastic that the Paris-based International Energy Agency warned this week of a looming supply crunch beyond 2020.
Shell has cut well costs by at least 50 percent, reduced logistics cost by three quarters and cut staff by nearly a third to make developments in areas such as the Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria profitable at oil prices below $40 a barrel, on par with the most profitable shale wells, Sawan said.
Other companies such as France's Total have seen similar cost cuts.
SNIPER FOCUS
After cutting the cost of deepwater development, companies are also reviving the search for new resources.
They are focusing exploration efforts on areas close to existing fields to maximize the chances of discovery and minimize costs. Many such areas are in Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia.
""It is a very selective, sniper focus,"" Sawan said.
Some firms are poised to benefit from decreased competition, lower costs of marine seismic studies and drilling rigs, and cheaper opportunities to acquire exploration licenses from governments eager to attract investment.
""Right now, we've entered the best time in the last decade to be in the exploration business,"" Gregory Hebertson, who heads Murphy's western hemisphere exploration, said at the CERAWeek conference in Houston. ""There is probably a two- or three-year window that we can capture the cost efficiency in the market.""
Discovering new resources is essential for oil firms to grow and to offset natural decline of fields. But deepwater exploration requires money, time, expertise - and luck.
Some shareholders would prefer that oil firms stick to other, less risky growth options, said Federico Arisi Rota, executive vice president Americas for Italy's Eni, which operates major offshore drilling projects.
""We must compete with alternative growth options that might be considered more attractive,"" such as growth through mergers and acquisitions or investing in shale oil production, Rota said.
Pressure to limit company spending amid a slow recovery in oil prices is also putting a break on big exploration campaigns.
""We know exploration spending is not always appreciated by investors,"" Kevin McLachlan, head of exploration for Total said.
RISKIER PLANS AHEAD
Eni is considered one of the most successful explorers after the discovery of giant gas fields in Egypt in recent years. It aims at discovering 2 to 3 billion barrels of oil and gas this year through drilling 115 offshore wells near Africa, Mexico, Norway and Asia, Rota said.
A ""more aggressive"" exploration program is planned to start in 2018 in riskier and more expensive regions such as the Arctic, which offer the potential big discoveries, he said.
Deepwater resources will be required to keep up with the growing demand, regardless of output growth in shale oil fields, Total's McLachlan said.

583,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2017 12:50AM ET</span>",Bets on gold hold ground even as Fed rate hike looms large,"By Sethuraman N R and Arpan Varghese
(Reuters) - While an imminent hike in U.S. interest rates is putting a downdraft on gold prices, bullion's allure as a safe haven is likely to limit the downside, traders and analysts say, owing to uncertainties in the United States and Europe.
Gold slumped to a 10-month low in mid-December after rates were increased for the first time in a year, but gold investors don't appear to be as jittery ahead of the next Fed meeting and a near-certain rate rise on March 14-15.
The previous slide came also as equity investors cheered the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, but gold has since recovered about 7 percent on a lack of clarity on Trump's policies and worries about upcoming elections in Europe.
""The expectations of rate hikes are already priced into gold unless the expectations grow to four hikes, which we think is unwarranted,"" said analyst Dominic Schnider of UBS Wealth Management in Hong Kong.
""With a more hawkish Fed, there is no incentive to chase gold. But, the disappointment potential on President Donald Trump is very high. The Congress will not give what he wants.""
Higher interest rates make it less attractive to hold non-interest bearing gold, while a firmer U.S. dollar also makes gold more expensive for buyers in other currencies.
Gold has fallen about 5 percent from a three-month peak on Feb. 24 to $1,198 an ounce, but traders say the risks of a sharp technical fall have eased and expect physical demand to emerge in a band from $1,150 to $1,200 an ounce.
""From the fund management industry, some people believe in this political uncertainty trend, and they are buyers of gold,"" said Hans Brandt, commodity fund manager at Swisscanto Invest.
""Some believe economic growth is picking up, the dollar is getting stronger over the next 3-6 months. Those people are sellers at this level.""
LONG POSITIONS RISE
Speculative long positions held by hedge funds and money managers in COMEX gold have nearly tripled this year, suggesting a fresh round of allocations into gold in 2017.
However, the 121,720 lots at Feb. 28 were still less than half of the 286,921 contracts held in July 2016, when speculative fever was at its peak as gold prices hit over 2-year highs at $1,374.91 an ounce.
This lower amassed speculator position reduces the threat of a sharp drop in prices should a flood of speculative positions be unwound, said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Carsten Fritsch.
Increasing inflation across a number of major economies will also likely dampen appetite for fixed income investments and support gold, said UBS's Schnider. 
""There is interest in physical gold if prices drop below $1,200. People will definitely see value below $1,200 and that will help stabilize the market. So far, ETFs also have looked resilient,"" Schnider said.
Physical gold holdings in exchange-traded funds have fallen since last week, partly because of a stronger dollar, but at 54.45 million ounces are still nearly 3 percent higher than at the start of February. Holdings are also roughly 6 million ounces or 13 percent above where they were in early March 2016. 
Meanwhile, gold is expected to be boosted by political risks stemming from Britain's exit from the EU and upcoming contentious elections elsewhere in Europe.
""The impact of a Fed rate hike will be offset as we go into the French elections. This year, we also have German, Dutch and Italian elections and all have the possibility of surprises,"" INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir said.
""We saw very good physical demand when prices came near $1,150. Especially, the German public is very keen on buying. Nobody is talking about interest rates there,"" said Michael Kempinski, Managing Director, Degussa Precious Metals Asia Pte. Ltd.

""People in Europe face uncertainty every day ... when prices come down, they buy more.""

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures rose 0.63% to $49.59 a barrel. On London's Intercontinental Exchange, global benchmark Brent for May delivery rose 0.50% at $52.45 a barrel.
Ahead, investors are awaiting an update on the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil from oilfield services firm Baker Hughes. Last week, figures showed oil rigs rose by 7 for the seventh weekly increase in a row. That brought the total count to 609, the most since October 2015, showing the sustained strength of a supply response as crude stayed above $50 a barrel in a narrow range since the end of November when an output cut pact was announced.
Overnight, Saudi sources reportedly told a meeting of U.S. shale oil firms that an extension of a pact by OPEC and non-OPEC nations to trim almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from global markets in the first half of the year is not a good assumption to make for drilling plans. The supply response by shale drillers will again be in sharp focus on Friday, though the recent dip in prices won't be reflected.
However, the issues and the overall effect of higher production had already hit the market this week as Brent and West Texas Intermediate took a more than 5% tumble on Thursday. Trading volumes on exchanges reach the highest since early December, with over 430,000 contracts in Brent crude for May delivery and more than 911,000 contracts of WTI for delivery in April changing hands.
As well, crude oil inventories in the U.S. rose more than quadruple the forecasts by 8.21 million barrels at the end of last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday, marking nine straight weeks of gains and taking the total to 528.4 million barrels.
The market had forecast a gain of around 2 million barrels. Gasoline stocks however dropped a much sharper than expected 6.6 million barrels, while distillate supplies dropped 2.7 million barrels, also more than seen.
The data offset a report that showed crude imports by China, the world's second largest buyer, rose to the second-highest level on record in February, reaching 8.286 million bpd, up 3.5% from a year ago, according to trade data released on Wednesday, just shy of December's record 8.57 million bpd and up on 8.01 million bpd in January.

590,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2017 12:50PM ET</span>",U.S. shale firms lift reserves while oil majors take Canada hit,"By Swetha Gopinath and Arathy S Nair
(Reuters) - Top shale oil producers are lifting their crude and gas reserve estimates for the first time in two years - even as many major oil companies are cutting the same projections and taking write downs on more expensive fields.
Rising confidence in the growth prospects of the U.S. shale patch is in striking contrast to the retreat of the world's top oil firms from the high-cost oil sands of Canada.
The increase in reported shale reserves is driven by new drilling efficiencies, leaner operations and improved well completion techniques, industry experts said.
""Many wells that were not profitable a year ago have become profitable"" because those advances have cut the cost of producing from shale, said Per Magnus Nysveen, a senior partner at consultancy Rystad Energy.
The top 20 U.S. shale firms - a group that includes  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co (N:PXD) and Chesapeake Energy Corp, (N:CHK) - hiked their proved oil reserves by nearly 7 percent on average in 2016, according to a Reuters review of year-end financial filings.
While shale producers reap the benefits of technological advances, oil majors that bet billions of dollars on giant long-term projects in Canada have taken a hit.
On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell plc (L:RDSa) became the latest energy giant to quit on oil sands. Shell said it would remove 2 billion barrels of oil from its reserves and take a $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion after-tax impairment in a retreat from most of its Canadian oil sands operations.
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and ConocoPhillips (N:COP) last month reported total reductions of nearly 5 billion barrels of proved reserves from oil sands projects after deciding they could not be pumped at current prices.
Overall, the 10 U.S. oil companies with the largest holdings in conventional oil fields reduced their reserves by 13.4 percent in 2016, according to a Reuters' analysis of year-end regulatory filings.
SHALE TURNAROUND
In 2015, the same shale firms, a group which do not operate in conventional oil fields, reported that proved reserves had fallen by 13 percent on average as low oil prices made many fields unprofitable.
Firms operating in shale oil fields use hydraulic fracturing to tap oil in rock formations that cannot be accessed by conventional drilling methods.
The reserves reflect oil and gas that can be profitably tapped in the next five years and are valued by investors as a measure of future revenue growth. Greater reserves also can give the companies more borrowing power.
The 2016 shale reserve gains, while modest, came as conventional drillers were paring back their own estimates as oil prices remain below the levels needed to make output from higher cost fields profitable. The cost of pumping a barrel of oil from Canada's oil sands is much higher than the cost of producing oil from shale. 
The reported 2016 increases in shale reserves are based on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and use an average West Texas Intermediate (CLc1) oil price of $42.75 per barrel in 2016. 
The oil price on Thursday fell below $50 per barrel amid worries about growing crude inventories, especially from shale producers. 
Shale producers' reported natural gas reserves were based on a $2.49 per million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) average price in 2016, down from $2.58 a year earlier. 
Recent production increases from U.S. shale fields have rattled OPEC producers aiming to pare global crude inventories. In remarks to industry executives at an energy conference in Houston this week, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih warned that OPEC won't accept shale oil rivals getting ""free rides"" from its production cutbacks.
The implied threat was that OPEC could reverse the output cuts, which took effect in January, and flood the world market with oil, kicking off another price war. The curbs have boosted oil prices and in turn revived the shale industry in the United States after a two-year downturn.
BOOST FROM TECHNOLOGY
The technological improvements in shale fields include the ability to drill further into the earth, both vertically and horizontally, creating more underground sites in each well for hydraulic fracturing. 
""Reserve growth really comes down to better well design,"" said Michael Dynan, vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm, a manufacturer of drilling rigs.
Such changes are helping oil firms tap more oil and gas while keeping spending low.  Continental Resources Inc  (N:CLR) says it found twice the reserves per dollar spent in 2016 than in 2014.
More recently, producers have also embraced big data analysis techniques that are providing ""a lot of insight into how best to drill a well, where to locate a well and the fracking techniques to use,"" said Binu Mathew, who heads digital products at GE Oil & Gas, which is merging with  Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI). 
Such advances are only the beginning of the shale oil industry's efforts to wring more oil from wells for less money, said Stephen Ingram, southern region director of Halliburton Co's (N:HAL) completion and production business.
HIGHER CONFIDENCE
Another factor in aiding reserves is the sharp decline last year in fees charged by oilfield service suppliers.
Oilfield service firms are looking to take back some of the discounts they extended during the downturn, but shale producers say they expect to hold the line on expenses as they continue to expand production.
Some of the reported gains in reserves are coming from un-drilled acreage, which makes them less certain. At least six of the companies Reuters analyzed reported a rise in proved reserves based on undeveloped properties in 2016.
Investors have increasing faith in the profit potential of such undeveloped properties, however.
""Confidence is very high that they are going to be turned into proved, producing assets,"" said Todd Heltman, a senior energy analyst at investment firm Neuberger Berman.
Still, some investors worry that shale firms are becoming too aggressive about booking undeveloped reserves.

""There is no geological risk here, but if your wells don't live up to your expectations, you have negative reserve revisions,"" said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group, referring to downgrading proved reserves to uneconomic-to-tap categories.

Natural gas for delivery in April on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 6.2 cents, or 2.14%, to trade at $2.963 per million British thermal units by 10:33AM ET (15:33GMT).
Futures were at around $2.952 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. fell by 68 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 3, while analysts had forecast a fall of 61 billion.
That compared with a build of 7 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a decline of 57 billion a year earlier and a five-year average decline of 136 billion cubic feet.
Total U.S. natural gas storage stood at 2.295 trillion cubic feet, 7.7% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 18.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, traders continued to monitor shifting weather forecasts to gauge demand for the fuel.
Weather forecasts for the next 8-to-15 days showed that rain, snow, and cool temperatures will track across the northern and eastern U.S., boosting demand expectations for the heating fuel.
At the same time, the southern half of the U.S. will be warmer than normal as high pressure dominates with highs reaching the 60s to 80s Fahrenheit.
Prices of the heating fuel are down around 22% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower."

Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London slumped 45 cents to $52.66 a barrel. The global benchmark fell to $51.60 earlier, its lowest since December 1.
Oil sank more than 5% in the prior session after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude supplies surged by 8.2 million barrels last week to yet another all-time high of 528.4 million.
It was the ninth straight weekly build in U.S. stockpiles, feeding concerns about a global glut.
Futures have been trading in a narrow $5 range around the low-to-mid-$50s over the past three months as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between rising stockpiles and increased shale production in the U.S. and hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries made a strong start to lowering their oil output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day by the end of June.
Kuwait is scheduled to host a ministerial meeting on March 26 comprising both OPEC and non-OPEC members to review compliance with the output agreement, the second such meeting since the deal was reached.
Oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kuwait, Oman, Algeria and Venezuela will attend the meeting, along with the OPEC secretary general.

594,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 09, 2017 08:48AM ET</span>","Gold slides toward $1,200 as Fed March rate hike seen near-certain","Investing.com - Gold futures extended losses into an eighth consecutive session Thursday, sending the precious metal to the lowest level since the start of February amid growing expectations among traders that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its March policy meeting next week.
Comex gold futures touched a session low of $1,202.50 a troy ounce, a level not seen since February 1. It was last at $1,206.40 by 8:45AM ET (13:45GMT), down $3.00, or about 0.3%.
Spot gold was down $1.70 at $1,206.60 per ounce.
Futures traders are pricing in around a 90% chance of a hike at the Fed's March 14-15 meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Investors are now awaiting Friday's nonfarm payrolls report for further clues on the likely pace of hikes this year.
Odds of a second rate hike in September currently stand at about 70%, while a third hike in December is priced in at almost 60%, aligning market expectations with the Fed's current forecast for three rate hikes in 2017.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was little changed at 102.11 in New York morning trade, not far from last week's two-month high of 102.27.
Treasury yields were higher, with the Fed-sensitive 2-Year yield hovering near a more than seven-year peak of 1.37%, while the 10-Year bond yield was at around 2.57%, its highest since December.
Both a strong dollar and higher interest rates are typically bearish for gold, which is denominated in dollars and struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when borrowing costs rise.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for May delivery slipped 4.0 cents, or around 0.2%, to $17.25 a troy ounce, after touching $17.15, the lowest since January 31.
Meanwhile, platinum was slightly lower at $946.30, while palladium sank 2.7% to $750.23 an ounce.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 2 percent on Thursday, extending the biggest falls this year as record U.S. crude inventories kept sentiment weak, pointing to a global glut despite supply cuts.
Crude oil stocks in the United States, the world's top oil consumer, surged last week to 528.4 million barrels, an all-time high and up 8.2 million barrels in a week, well above forecasts of a 2 million barrel build. [EIA/S]
The surge in U.S. inventories came despite an agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017.
""U.S. oil stockpiles have gained around 50 million barrels since the start of the year, raising some doubts over the effectiveness of OPEC cuts,"" said Hamza Khan, head of commodities strategy at ING Bank in Amsterdam.
Brent crude oil was down $1.05 a barrel at $52.06 by 1100 GMT, after reaching an intraday low of $51.60, its lowest since Dec. 1. On Wednesday, Brent fell $2.81 a barrel, or 5 percent, in its biggest daily price move this year.
U.S. light crude reached an intraday low of $48.79, down $1.49, before recovering slightly to trade around $49.20 a barrel. WTI plummeted 5.38 percent on Wednesday.
""The market went into a meltdown yesterday,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates. ""The risk is now tilted to the downside. Lower numbers are not a foregone conclusion yet, but bears are in control.""
Major oil exporters say they will gradually tighten global supplies as they reduce production.
Kuwait's oil minister has said OPEC's compliance with cuts has exceeded targets.
Kuwait will host a meeting on March 26 of OPEC and non-OPEC ministers to review compliance with the production cuts.
OPEC hopes it can persuade other oil producers to make deeper cuts to try to push up prices that have been below some breakeven costs for more than two years. 
But they will need to act fast, because low oil prices encourage producers to increase output to balance their budgets.

""If things stay unchanged, then this week will be worst week for oil prices since the OPEC deal (in November),"" said Olivier Jakob, managing director of Swiss consultancy Petromatrix. ""If a quick rebound cannot be organized by the end of the week, then banks will start to revise lower their oil price forecasts.""

597,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2017 04:50AM ET</span>",Oil bulls blink after months of attempts to push crude prices higher,"By Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil bulls trying to push the crude market higher finally waved the white flag on Wednesday, triggering the biggest rout in a year, on concerns that stubbornly high inventory levels would persist despite supply cuts. 
Prices had been locked in the tightest trading range in over a decade as traders and speculators piled into bets that oil prices would rise after the world's top producers cut output.
For weeks, they shrugged off record high inventories in the United States until on Wednesday, the market finally blinked.
Global oil benchmark, Brent and U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate prices plunged more than 5 percent - the biggest drop since February 2016 - an unwelcome reminder of the darkest days of a two-year price war that left many U.S. shale producers with beleaguered balance sheets. 
The move also pushed trading volumes to the highest since early December with over 430,000 contracts in Brent crude for May delivery and more than 911,000 contracts of WTI for delivery in April changing hands. 
Industry players were divided on whether the price slide would continue or be short-lived given producers' adherence to a pledge to rein in output and prop up prices that have languished for over two years owing to a glut.
""The high level of uncertainty that has kept the oil complex trading in a relatively narrow trading range since late last year has been replaced, at least for the moment, by a bearish market sentiment,"" said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York. 
""The discussion will now center around whether or not Saudi Arabia is willing to give back market share to U.S. producers ... or are they ready for yet another round of the market share war.""
So far, there has been no indication that Saudi and OPEC would extend the cuts beyond what is announced or allow the U.S. to claw some of its market share.
Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei, the energy minister for the United Arab Emirates told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry conference in Houston that the plunge in oil prices was temporary and that prices would rise as OPEC complies with output cuts. 
Still, the rise in inventories was ""a worry"", he admitted.
Despite record exports in U.S. crude oil, inventories have ballooned to a new high week after week, threatening a speedy rebalancing of the market. 
Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih even admitted on Tuesday inventory drawdowns were taking longer than he had expected for the first two months of the year. 
The crash on Wednesday also tested key technical levels of support established this year and dropped below their 100-day moving averages - a key metric for chart watchers - for the first time since the OPEC deal was announced.
""The move down is in oversold territory, but otherwise, there is very little evidence that it will end,"" said Dean Rogers, senior analyst at Kase & Company said of WTI. 
A small upward correction might take place first, but odds strongly favor a continued decline toward the next major target at $48, he said, adding that for Brent, the move lower is poised to continue to at least $52.60 and likely $51.60 and lower over the next few days.
But for the long term, most market participants continue to remain bullish.
Trade in options - that give the holder the right to buy or sell at a specific price - signaled that the market does not expect prices to move much lower than current levels.
""Their (OPEC's) response may very well be a continuation of co-operation to limit their oil production, perhaps for a little longer than they had hoped and this should help keep a floor under oil prices,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at forex.com.

""Indeed, despite today's sharp sell-off, I remain bullish on oil and still expect to see $60-$70 a barrel by the year end.""

Comex gold futures touched a session low of $1,203.50 a troy ounce, a level not seen since February 1. It was last at $1,204.75 by 3:10AM ET (08:10GMT), down $4.55, or about 0.4%.

Robust U.S. private-sector payrolls data on Wednesday further cemented expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next week.
Futures traders are pricing in around a 90% chance of a hike at the Fed's March 14-15 meeting, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Investors are now awaiting Friday's nonfarm payrolls report for further clues on the likely pace of hikes this year.
Odds of a second rate hike in September currently stand at about 70%, while a third hike in December is priced in at almost 60%, aligning market expectations with the Fed's current forecast for three rate hikes in 2017.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was little changed at 102.11 in London morning trade, not far from last week's two-month high of 102.27.
Treasury yields were higher, with the Fed-sensitive U.S. 2-Year note yield hovering near a more than seven-year peak of 1.37%, while the U.S. 10-Year bond yield was at 2.57%, its highest since December.
Both a strong dollar and higher interest rates are typically bearish for gold, which is denominated in dollars and struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when borrowing costs rise.

600,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2017 01:30AM ET</span>",Oil executives cautiously optimistic about Trump policies,"By Liz Hampton and Marianna Parraga
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil executives cautioned it is too soon to gauge the impact of President Donald Trump's policy proposals on their businesses, but they are looking forward to hearing more about plans for energy regulation, trade and taxation. 
Tougher environmental regulations under the Obama administration stymied energy infrastructure projects like the Keystone XL crude pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline, and required automakers and refiners to spend more to reduce pollutants. 
Spirits at the CERAWeek conference this year have been buoyed by higher energy prices after a bruising two years for the oil and gas industry. Crude fell by more than 70 percent from mid-2014 to early-2016 amid a global supply glut.
Trump has vowed to bolster U.S. infrastructure spending and slash regulations, pledges welcomed by business leaders attending the annual energy event.
""We have a unique president today,"" Continental Resources Inc Chief Executive Harold Hamm said on Wednesday, ""unique in that he keeps his promises."" Hamm, an early supporter of the president, said: ""It is a good start."" 
Pro-energy policies and regulatory roll-backs anticipated from the new administration could lure more investment to the industry, but so far the details of Trump's plans and a potential border adjustment tax remain unclear.
""Political rhetoric has to translate into tangible policy,"" Vimal Kapur, president of Honeywell Process Solutions, said in an interview with Reuters. 
""We're exporting gas, so we're very happy,"" said Charif Souki, chairman of Tellurian Inc, which recently received approval to export liquefied natural gas to free trade agreement countries from its Driftwood project near Lake Charles, Louisiana.
But he added, ""It's too soon to say where the Trump administration is going to go on the long-term basis. We have to give them a chance to start articulating policy.""
Formerly the head of LNG exporter Cheniere Energy, Souki was a high-profile supporter of Democrat Hillary Clinton, donating to her presidential campaign and the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee with the Democratic National Committee.
TRADE POLICIES IN LIMBO
Feelings toward proposed Trump administration policies were mixed among international energy officials, which could see their businesses and economies impacted by renegotiated trade policies. 
Mexico, which imports over 800,000 barrels per day of fuels from the United States and supplies crude to U.S. refineries, has had a rocky relationship with the new administration, largely driven by a dispute over a proposed border wall. 
But executives from Mexico stressed the importance of continued cooperation between the neighbors. 
""There are large exchanges of services we contract from each other back and forward. It's in our best interest to continue to construct and build on it, to make it stronger,"" said Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya, chief executive of state-run oil firm Pemex. 
Trump's desire to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has also drawn concern from Canada, which exports around 3.5 million barrels per day of crude to the United States.
""The NAFTA situation is yet to be determined. I think everyone is anxious to get after it,"" said Al Monaco, chief executive of Canadian pipeline company Enbridge Inc. 
For its part, Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer and a long-time ally of the United States, struck a tone of optimism toward Trump's support for the energy industry. 
""We welcome the new administration's attention to strategic energy issues. I personally look forward to working with the new administration,"" said Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih.
Oil executives in the United States and abroad are closely watching a Republican proposal for a border adjustment tax, which would tax imports in a bid to spur U.S. production of goods and resources. Exported goods would be exempt from the tax. 
""There's a lot of speculation,"" said Monaco, stressing the importance of getting heavy Canadian oil to U.S. refiners that rely on it.
While opponents of the border tax have said it could drive up the cost of gasoline and other fuels, refining executives have been hesitant to draw conclusions about its impact. 

Dan Romasko, chief executive of Motiva Enterprises LLC, said it is hard to believe U.S. consumers would accept higher fuel prices due to a proposed border tax on imports.

601,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2017 01:20AM ET</span>",U.S. shale plots production growth despite OPEC's warning,"By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. shale oil producers are plotting ambitious production growth outside the red-hot Permian Basin in Texas, widening a resurgence that could confound OPEC's strategy to tighten global supplies.
As shale firms rebound from a two-year price war with OPEC, many are planning to expand production in North Dakota, Oklahoma and other shale regions. 
The Permian - America's largest oilfield - has already seen output jump in the past six months.
 Hess Corp  (NYSE:HES), Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK), Continental Resources Inc and other firms detailed their growth plans at an energy conference in Houston this week. The projects they outlined would result in a steady supply of American crude exports through the next decade. 
Rising U.S. energy clout has frustrated efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to control global oil prices through a production curb announced last fall - its first in eight years.
The rise in U.S. output was enough to boost domestic crude stockpiles last week by 8.2 million barrels, more than quadruple estimates from analysts polled by Reuters. 
The unexpected supply surge pushed U.S. oil prices down more than 5 percent on Wednesday to close at $50.49.
The price drop underscored the growing impact of U.S. shale production on global supplies and prices relative to OPEC member nations, which once exercised dominant influence on global markets. Representatives from both sectors acknowledged that power shift at the energy conference in Houston.
""We are on something of an equal basis today with OPEC,"" said Harold Hamm, founder and chief executive of Continental Resources, which has invested heavily in Oklahoma shale projects in the past year. 
In North Dakota's Bakken shale fields, where Continental is the largest leaseholder, the company has hired oilfield service contractors to frack wells that it had mothballed during the price downturn.
Chesapeake - which has one of the largest acreage positions of any U.S. producer, with holdings in Pennsylvania and Louisiana - has only drilled an average of 25 percent of its land, giving it years of inventory to drill and frack.
""We have this great opportunity to run with,"" said Frank Patterson, Chesapeake's head of exploration and production. ""We can develop what we have and grow.""
Hess, one of the largest Bakken producers, is adding four rigs this year and says it has more than a decade of drilling locations at current oil prices. 
""We're back to growth in the Bakken,"" Chief Executive John Hess said in an interview.
These and other expansion plans come as the Permian Basin saw $28 billion in land acquisitions in 2016, more than triple the prior year.  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), which controls 2 million Permian acres, expects its output there to jump 20 percent by the end of the decade.
""We're ramping up,"" Chevron CEO John Watson said.
Yet as the rise in American oil stockpiles shows, producers run the risk of pumping too much and creating a new glut that could push prices down.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration boosted its forecast this week for American oil production for 2017, now expecting output to rise 330,000 barrels per day from last year. Production in the United States is about 5 percent below the all-time high.
OPEC WARNS SHALE PRODUCERS
A handful of chief executives at U.S. oil producers met with OPEC ministers last weekend ahead of the CERAWeek conference at a dinner organized by investment bank Lazard Ltd. The meeting, the first between the two groups, was described by attendees as cordial.
""OPEC is trying to figure out U.S. shale,"" Scott Sheffield, chairman of Pioneer Natural Resource Co, said in an interview. ""U.S. shale is trying to understand where (oil) prices will go. We're educating each other.""
OPEC plans to meet on May 25 in Austria to decide whether to extend or deepen the supply cuts. 
OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said this week that for the cartel to renew its production output agreement, non-OPEC members must be on board.
Hess, Sheffield and other U.S. shale leaders said they expect the group will renew the production curbs. 
""It's really healthy that shale producers understand the importance of OPEC,"" said Hess. ""We're all in the same boat.""
While American producers seem unlikely to agree to any broad output curb with OPEC, they are keenly aware of the supply and demand for oil. 

""We have the potential to oversupply the market,"" said Continental's Hamm. ""And we have a great responsibility not to do so.""

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to cut its output by about 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1 to prop up oil prices and reduce a supply glut.
Marzouq attributed the high compliance rate by OPEC members to a deep production cut by Saudi Arabia.
""Saudi Arabia has voluntarily cut by more than its share to increase confidence in the output reduction issue (agreement),"" he told journalists in Kuwait.
He described OPEC's compliance as ""excellent"" and that of the non-OPEC members as ""acceptable"", adding that there was satisfaction by OPEC members with the current prices, which he described as ""stable"".
Kuwait is scheduled to host a ministerial meeting on March 26 comprising both OPEC and non-OPEC members to review compliance with the output agreement, the second such meeting since the deal was reached.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 1 percent on Wednesday after the U.S. Department of Energy reported a much larger increase than expected in domestic crude inventories, feeding concerns the supply glut could persist even as OPEC seeks to prop up prices with output curbs.
U.S. crude inventories rose by 8.2 million barrels in the last week, quadruple analysts' expectations for an increase of 2 million barrels, as refineries cut output and imports rose, data from Energy Information Administration showed. [EIA/S]
Prices had weakened overnight after data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed late on Tuesday inventories rose by more-than-forecast 11.6 million barrels last week. [API/S]
Brent crude (LCOc1), the international benchmark, was down 63 cents, or 1.13 percent at $55.29 a barrel at 11:00 a.m. EST (1600 GMT). U.S. crude (CLc1) fell 70 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $52.44.
U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1), meanwhile did extended gains, rising as much as 1.5 percent after EIA data showed the biggest weekly drawdown in stockpiles since 2011. 
""This report runs the gamut in terms of extremes, with a huge 8.2 million barrel build to crude stocks tilted bearish, large draws to the products distinctly bullish,"" said Matt Smith, Director of Commodity Research at ClipperData.
""Crude stocks were bolstered by rebounding imports, while both gasoline and distillates draws were exacerbated by higher implied demand.""
It was the ninth straight weekly rise in U.S. crude supplies. The market is also concerned about resurgent U.S. drilling activity. [RIG/U]
On Tuesday, the EIA's latest monthly outlook forecast that U.S. crude production in 2017 would rise by 330,000 barrels per day to 9.21 million bpd, a bigger rise than previously forecast.
Oil prices have been supported by a supply cut that started on Jan. 1 by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus Russia and other non-members. Data has suggested high compliance with the deal.
Kuwait Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouq said on Wednesday that OPEC's compliance with an oil output cut stood at 140 percent in February, while non-OPEC members compliance was 50-60 percent.
Total output reductions have exceeded 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) out of almost 1.8 million bpd pledged, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Tuesday. He said the results exceeded low market expectations.
Also supporting oil prices, China's crude imports rose in February to the second-highest level on record.

Pressuring oil prices were expectations of a U.S. interest rate hike next week, which lifted the dollar (DXY) against a basket of currencies, making greenback-denominated oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.

Oil prices have been trading in a narrow $5 range around the mid-$50s over the past two months as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between rising stockpiles and increased shale production in the U.S. and hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih gave mixed messages on future production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Speaking at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, Falih said last year's historic agreement by OPEC and non-OPEC countries to curb supply and raise oil prices has improved market fundamentals. Still, it was premature to consider whether or not the cuts should be continued into the second half of the year, he added.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day by the end of June, with compliance currently at around 94%.
Any decision to extend OPEC production cuts past June would have to include the continued participation by the non-OPEC members of the November accord, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said on Tuesday.

U.S. natural gas for April delivery jumped 10.1 cents, or around 3.6% to $2.925 per million British thermal units by 9:50AM ET (14:50GMT), nearing a three-week high of $2.952 touched on Monday.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw of around 59 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 3.
That compares with a build of 7 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a decline of 57 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 136 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.363 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 7.3% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 12.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, traders continued to monitor shifting weather forecasts to gauge demand for the fuel.
Weather forecasts for the next 8-to-15 days showed that rain, snow, and cool temperatures will track across the northern and eastern U.S., boosting demand expectations for the heating fuel.
At the same time, the southern half of the U.S. will be warmer than normal as high pressure dominates with highs reaching the 60s to 80s Fahrenheit.
Prices of the heating fuel are down around 22% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

    Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected the tribes' request for an injunction to withdraw permission issued by the Army Corps for the last link of the oil pipeline under Lake Oahe in North Dakota.
 Energy Transfer Partners LP  (N:ETP) is building the $3.8 billion pipeline to move crude from the Northern Plains to the Midwest and then on to the Gulf of Mexico. 
The denial of the injunction represents yet another setback to the tribes – the Standing Rock Sioux and the Cheyenne River Sioux – that have been leading the charge against the line, which runs adjacent to tribal territory in southern North Dakota. 
The tribes had argued that the pipeline would render water they use for religious ceremonies spiritually impure even if the pipeline goes under Lake Oahe. They said the pipeline was reminiscent of an ancient prophesy of a Black Snake that would harm natives and that they could not use other water supplies in the region because they had been polluted by decades of mining. 
Boasberg said in a written ruling that the Cheyenne tribe ""remained silent as to the Black Snake prophesy and its concerns about oil in the pipeline under Lake Oahe"" during two years of legal disputes against the line.
Chase Iron Eyes, lead counsel for the Lakota People's Law Project said ""it is simply unacceptable that the government is allowing Energy Transfer Partners to build this pipeline through our sacred lands."" The water the pipeline threatens supplies used by the Lakota and more than 17 million other people downstream, he said. 
The tribes had won a reprieve from the Democratic Obama administration in early December, but the victory was short-lived as Republican President Donald Trump signed an executive order days after taking office on Jan. 20 that smoothed the path for the last permit needed.
Energy Transfer Partners needed only to cross beneath Lake Oahe, part of the Missouri River system, to connect a final gap in the 1,170-mile (1,885-km) pipeline, which will move oil from the Bakken shale formation to a terminus in Illinois.
The company said in a filing late Monday that it plans to start pumping oil through a section of the line under the Missouri River by the week of March 13.
Lisa Dillinger, a spokeswoman for the pipeline, said the company was pleased with Boasberg's decision and that it has ""progressed quickly with the final piece of construction.""
FIGHT CONTINUES
An oil analyst said the pipeline would help slash transportation costs for producers in the Bakken, one of their biggest expenses. 
He predicted that the ruling and the Trump administration's pro-oil stance could clear the way for more pipelines. ""If we're setting precedent where we're building pipelines without real restrictions, I think this is a kickoff to what's going to happen in the next few years,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil Outlooks and Opinions. 
Public opposition to the pipeline drew thousands of people to the North Dakota plains last year, including high-profile political and celebrity supporters, along with veterans’ groups upset by the use of force by law enforcement. 
After the legal victory in December, Standing Rock Sioux chairman Dave Archambault II asked protesters to leave; the primary protest camp on federal land was evacuated by mid-February, though substantial cleanup remains. The last protesters burned structures as they left the camp.
Archambault said that his tribe and its allies will continue to fight larger legal battles in the case, including the legality of the permitting. The court will next consider issues including the tribes' effort to stop the pipeline from operating until the Army Corps completes an environmental impact assessment that Trump's executive order cut short. 

""The fight against the pipeline has changed, but it continues with as much strength as ever,"" Archambault said.

Gold for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange shed $9.65 or 0.79%, to trade at $1,216.05 a troy ounce.
A recent batch of strong U.S. economy data coupled with hawkish comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen last Friday fueled expectations that the U.S. central bank will hike rates in March.
According to Investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool, nearly 90% of traders expect a rate hike in March, compared to just 81.9% of traders on Monday.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. interest rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
Gold struggled to mount a recovery, despite a brief setback in the dollar as it pared gains, after the release of economy data showed the U.S. trade deficit grew in January to its widest monthly level in almost five years.
The commerce department said Tuesday, the trade gap widened by 9.6% to $48.5 billion in January, the highest level since March 2012, and in line with economists’ forecasts.
Meanwhile, investors await non-farm payrolls for February on Friday, viewed as a critical barometer of the U.S. economy and represents the final key economic data point ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting on March 14-15.
Commodities across the board traded lower in the midst of a higher dollar, as silver futures slumped 1.24% to $17.55 a troy ounce while Copper traded lower at $2.62.
Platinum traded at $962.45 down 1.61% and Natural Gas Futures trickled 1.83% lower to $2.85."

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Tuesday that oil market fundamentals were improving after an agreement struck with top oil producers to curb supply and end a two-year glut took effect.
The kingdom led a pact between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers, such as Russia and Kazakhstan, to cut global crude output by about 1.8 million barrels per day from Jan. 1, and bring supply closer to demand.
Saudi Arabia had cut beyond what it had pledged in the agreement and brought the kingdom's output below 10 million bpd, he said.
Global oil demand would grow by 1.5 million bpd in 2017, and increased output from the United States, Brazil and Canada would be more than offset by natural declines in aging fields, he said.
Oil inventories worldwide had fallen ""slower than I thought,"" in the first two months of the year, Falih told energy executives and oil officials gathered at the CERAWeek industry conference in Houston.
Inventories in developed countries remain about 300 million barrels above the norm, he said.
Still, it was premature to consider whether or not the cuts should be continued into the second half of the year, he said. OPEC next meets in May, he said.
On Monday, oil ministers from fellow OPEC member Iraq and non-OPEC Russia also said it was too early to discuss extending the deal, while the head of Angola's state oil firm said she thought curbs should continue.
""There is also cause for cautious optimism as we see the 'green shoots' of the recovery,"" Falih said, but ""We should not get ahead of the market.""
Greater price arbitrage between east and west oil markets that ""indicate the cuts are biting,"" he said. U.S. crude cargoes have increasingly flowed to Asian buyers as the market has tightened.
Addressing many top executives of U.S. shale producing firms who Saudi Arabia targeted in a two-year price war that aimed to drive many of them out of business, Falih warned there would be ""no free rides"" for non-OPEC producers.
OPEC would not let rival producers take advantage of the cuts to underwrite their own production investments, he said.
While Saudi Arabia welcomed increased output from shale producers to help meet rising supplies, he cautioned that a fast-response from shale could be discouraging investment in multi-year, long-term projects in other oil sources.
Falih said he was concerned that investment in those projects was falling behind what was needed to meet future demand increases. Demand continued to grow in the developing world and predictions that the world would soon reach peak demand were ""misguided"" and not helping encourage investment, he said.
The market could absorb between 3 million and 5 million barrels of new oil over time because demand is improving, he told CNBC. He did not specify over what period.
Saudi Arabia does not want OPEC to intervene in the oil market to address long-term structural shifts, but to address ""short-term aberrations,"" he said. 
WORKING WITH THE U.S.
He praised the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump for its focus on energy issues, citing its ""pro-business and pro-petroleum"" policies. ""We look forward to working with the new administration,"" he said.
Saudi investment in the U.S. is vast, and Saudi efforts to reduce global oil market volatility were of direct benefit to the U.S. oil industry, he said.

Falih also said the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco remains on track and ""we expect it to take place in 2018."" The IPO could value the energy giant at between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion, analysts have estimated.

U.S. natural gas for April delivery shed 5.3 cents, or around 1.8% to $2.848 per million British thermal units by 10:10AM ET (15:10GMT), after reaching $2.952 on Monday, the most since February 16.
Weather forecasts for the next 8-to-15 days showed that rain, snow, and cool temperatures will track across the northern and eastern U.S., boosting demand expectations for the heating fuel.
At the same time, the southern half of the U.S. will be warmer than normal as high pressure dominates with highs reaching the 60s to 80s Fahrenheit.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 53 and 64 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 3.
That compares with a build of 7 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a decline of 57 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 136 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.363 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 7.3% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 12.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Prices of the heating fuel are down around 22% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

627,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2017 09:46AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mexico cancels sugar export permits to the U.S. in 'absurd' dispute,"By Adriana Barrera
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has canceled existing sugar export permits to the United States to avoid penalties in a dispute over the pace of shipments, a document seen by Reuters said, partly blaming the issue on unfilled positions at the U.S. Department of Commerce.
It was not immediately clear what impact the cancellation would have on exports to the United States. The document, sent by Mexico's sugar chamber to mills on Monday, said existing permits would be reissued in April. 
Mexico's sugar mills are currently in full swing at the height of the harvest. The amount of sugar sent to the United States varies from season to season, with the document referring to a quota of 820,000 tonnes in 2016/2017. 
Ties between the United States and Mexico have frayed under Donald Trump, who sees trade skewed to favor the southern neighbor and is seeking to renegotiate the North American Free Trade agreement. 
The document made no suggestion that the present dispute was related to the wider politics, but described as ""absurd"" an interpretation by ""low-level"" Commerce Department officials of a clause in so-called suspension agreements, which have regulated the sugar trade between both countries since the end of 2014.
In the document, Chamber president Humberto Jasso says the interpretation relating to how much sugar Mexico can send in the six months up to March 31 means it would only be able to export 40 percent of the quota allocated by the United States in the period, causing a concentration in the second half of the season.
The Economy Ministry said it could not immediately comment. Officials from Mexico's sugar chamber could not be reached for comment. It was not immediately clear how many sugar export permits were canceled or what penalties Mexico had faced.
The Mexican Economy Ministry decided to cancel the permits since it has no counterparts at the Commerce Department to resolve the issue, the document said.
""Because the Ministry cannot resolve the issue with the DOC, since officials in charge of making decisions have not been appointed, Economy Ministry attorneys in Washington insisted on sending a statement to the DOC acknowledging the problem and canceling existing exports, so that they can be re-issued as of April 1,"" the document adds.
Mill owners should consider legally challenging the decision, it said.

Trump has not filled staff positions in several departments, a situation Mexican officials say has made it hard to negotiate on trade issues.

631,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2017 07:19AM ET</span>",Oil prices entrenched in tight range; eyes on data,"By Sabina Zawadzki
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Tuesday, trading in a tight range as rising U.S. shale output offset OPEC crude production cuts, with investors seeking clearer direction from upcoming inventory data and comments from senior oil officials.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 18 cents at $56.19 a barrel as of 1155 GMT (0655 EST). U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) was up 20 cents at $53.40. Both benchmarks have hovered in negative and positive territory since the start of the day's Asian trading.
Oil prices have been entrenched in a $3 band since February, failing to take off after OPEC implemented, to a surprisingly high degree, the first production cut in eight years. 
Capping any upsurge has been an increase in U.S. shale oil drilling after WTI rose firmly above $50 a barrel in December following OPEC's sealing of the deal, which also included several non-OPEC producers such as Russia.
""Market-wise, we have seen open interest on Brent fall to a six-week low as non-performing or even loss-making longs have begun to reduce exposure,"" said Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank's head of commodity strategy.
Fund managers doubled their net long positions in Brent, WTI and options to 951 million barrels between the start of November and Feb. 21, betting OPEC's high compliance with the cut agreement would push up prices.
But with Russia's lackluster participation in the cuts, rising shale output and signs that OPEC countries increased their crude exports in February after a January reduction, that bullish sentiment has wavered.
Oil company executives, energy ministers, including from Saudi Arabia and Russia, and other top officials such as the head of OPEC are meeting in Houston this week for the CERAWeek energy conference. Observers are keen for any comments that may indicate whether OPEC would extend its output reduction.
Russia and Iraq said it was too early to discuss that issue, but OPEC's secretary-general as well as Saudi officials are expected to speak later on Tuesday. Russia also promised to implement its 300,000-barrels-per-day share of production cuts by the end of April.
Brokerage Marex Spectron, however, said it expects production and exports from Russia to rise gradually.
""If our expectations materialize, we will see a quick deterioration of the short-term supply conditions.""

Markets await U.S. oil stocks data from industry group API on Tuesday and the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday. U.S. oil stocks are expected to have risen for the ninth consecutive week to a record, a Reuters poll showed.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, said on Monday it would invest $20 billion through 2022 to expand its chemical and oil refining plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast.
The investments at 11 sites should create 35,000 temporary construction jobs and 12,000 permanent jobs, Chief Executive Darren Woods said in a speech at CERAWeek, the world's largest gathering of energy executives.
Some of the expansions began in 2013, but the scope of the project is now growing and the timeline extended, Exxon said.
Woods ran Exxon's refining division before becoming CEO two months ago, and the new spending benefits a sector with which he has significant experience and comfort. Investments in the high-margin projects should help ease concerns from Wall Street that Exxon's growth potential - especially in oil and gas exploration and production - is sliding.
""Exxon Mobil is building a manufacturing powerhouse along the U.S. Gulf Coast,"" Woods said. ""These businesses are leveraging the shale revolution to manufacture cleaner fuels and more energy-efficient plastics.""
The investments across Texas and Louisiana will take advantage of cheap shale gas to make plastics and other chemicals for export. The strategy builds on prior steps Exxon and peers, including  Dow Chemical  Co (N:DOW), have taken in the wake of the American shale expansion, which sharply cut production costs.
""The supply is here. The demand is there. We want to keep connecting those dots,"" Woods said.
Exxon last month pledged to boost this year's spending by 16 percent to expand operations, especially in shale production, after the company posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by rising oil prices and lower costs.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who tapped former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, praised the company's spending plans as an example of ""a true American success story."" Most of the permanent jobs are expected to pay more than $100,000 per year.
""This is exactly the kind of investment, economic development and job creation that will help put Americans back to work,"" Trump said.
When asked if Trump was taking credit for an investment program that began under former President Barack Obama in 2013, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that Exxon made it clear to the president it was investing more in the United States because of his push for fewer regulations and tax relief.
The bulk of the expansion will take place in Beaumont, Texas, with plans to expand polyethylene production, oil refining capacity and liquefied natural gas exports.
Exxon also will increase its lubricant manufacturing capacity and potentially build a new refinery to produce ethane, a key building block for chemical production.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Woods spent the larger part of his speech discussing climate change, an area for which Exxon has come under attack in the past year. The global economy can grow while also improving the climate, he said.
""I believe the assumption that affordable energy and a cleaner environment are a zero-sum game is mistaken,"" he said. ""It underestimates the power of technology.""
Woods highlighted Exxon's research into carbon capture sequestration, biofuels and other areas as ones helping the company expand its operations beyond oil and gas.
""The only way to keep winning in a competitive market is to keep innovating,"" he said.

Hoping to stem at least some of the environmental controversy, Exxon in January, just after Woods became CEO, named an environmentalist to its board of directors.

Overnight, gold prices were higher during North American morning hours on Monday, kicking the week off with gains as a missile launch by North Korea was the latest event to add to concerns about rising geopolitical tensions.
Geopolitical tensions were in focus after North Korea fired four ballistic missiles early on Monday, three of which landed in Japan's exclusive economic zone, an area extending about 230 miles out to sea from its coastline.
The move came just after Japanese media reported on Saturday U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is due to visit Japan, South Korea and China this month to discuss North Korea on his first trip to the region since he took up his post.
The news bolstered demand for perceived safe-havens such as the yen and gold, while weighing on U.S. Treasury yields.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for May delivery rose 0.06% to $53.22 a barrel. On London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent was last quoted at $55.95 a barrel.
Novak told the CERAWeek energy conference on Monday that Russia would move to comply with its pledges under an output cut pact to trim nearly 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from global markets in the first half of the year working with OPEC and other key producers.
But he said it is too early to say if the pact should be extended beyond June 30, but that Russia would meet its current commitment by the end of April, in remarks before industry executives at the annual industry gathering CERAWeek carried online.
Earlier, Russia's Tass news agency said that Novak met his Saudi counterpart Khalid Al-Falih in the United States on Monday, without providing further details. Compliance by Russia with the pact is at the center of sentiment as figures last week showed Russian crude oil production in February came in at 11.11 million bpd, mostly unchanged from January.
Russia is slated to average cuts of 300,000 bpd through June 30, but had said the first three months of the pact would see it at a 200,000 bpd reduction pace as it has already dialed back more than 145,000 bpd from an October baseline. Going by the January start of the cut pact, Russia is at a 33% compliance rate while OPEC is hitting 94%, potentially setting the stage for a dispute among participants over adherence.
Later on Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute will release its estimates of crude and refined prodyct stocks at the end of last week.. The figures ill be followed by official data on Wednesday from the U.S. Energy Information Administration expected to show crude oil inventories up by 1.66 million barrels, while gasoline supplies are expected down 1.28 million barrels and distillates eased by 880,000 barrels.
Overnight, crude settled lower on Monday, after the International Energy Agency predicted a sharp increase in shale oil growth and a reduction in demand for European refined products.
It was a volatile session for market participants, as large moves in oil prices were driven by headlines.Earlier during the session, oil prices advanced, after Jabbar Al-Luaibi, Iraq’s oil minister said that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), would likely extend its production cuts into the second half of 2017.
Gains were short-lived as oil prices pulled back, after the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in a report U.S. shale oil production may grow by 1.4 million barrels per day by 2022 with prices at about $60 barrel and pointed out that demand for European refined products may weaken.
U.S. producers will contribute most of the growth in supplies outside OPEC through to 2022, the IEA said. The IEA’s report, fueled concerns that rising U.S. crude and shale production may curtail OPEC's efforts to rebalance supply and demand in the industry.
Data from Baker Hughes last week revealed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by 7 to 609 rigs this week. It was the seventh straight weekly increase while U.S. crude inventories rose for an eight straight week to a record 520.2 million barrels the Energy Information Agency (EIA) revealed last Wednesday.
The build-up in U.S. crude oil inventories to record high levels, overshadowed a Reuters survey last week that found OPEC cut its oil output for a second month in February, following a record high compliance level by OPEC members in January.

Gold traded close to session lows of $1225.00 but turned positive, as a raft of geopolitical concerns helped the yellow-metal shrug off increased expectations the U.S. central bank would raise interest rates at its next meeting on March 14-15.
In Europe, former French Prime Minister Alain Juppe, announced Monday he would not seek the country’s presidency – this is widely viewed as a positive for anti-European candidate Marine Le Pen and added an element of uncertainty to the outcome of French Presidential elections.
Over the weekend, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Barack Obama of wiretapping him during the 2016 election campaign while North Korea conducted missile tests early Monday, which increased demand for the yellow metal, as a safe haven investment.

The move came just after Japanese media reported on Saturday U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is due to visit Japan, South Korea and China this month to discuss North Korea on his first trip to the region since he took up his post.

U.S. natural gas for April delivery rallied 9.1 cents, or around 3.2% to $2.918 per million British thermal units by 8:45AM ET (13:45GMT). Futures touched a session high of $2.946 earlier, the most since February 16.
Sentiment in the gas market improved after forecasts over the weekend showed a return to cool weather after a warm spell in key gas-consuming regions in the U.S.
Weather forecasts for the next 8-to-15 days showed that rain, snow, and cool temperatures will track across the northern and eastern U.S., boosting demand expectations for the heating fuel.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 53 and 64 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 3.
That compares with a build of 7 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, a decline of 57 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 136 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.363 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 7.3% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 12.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Prices of the heating fuel are down around 22% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - East Libyan forces carried out fresh air strikes on Monday and said they were mobilizing ground forces as they attempt to win back two of Libya's largest oil ports, military officials said.
Forces loyal to the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) lost control of the ports of Sider and Ras Lanuf on Friday to a rival faction known as the Benghazi Defense Brigades (BDB), and have been unable to dislodge them with air strikes and ground operations since then.
The escalation risks reversing a recent recovery in Libya's oil production and reigniting conflict between military factions based in eastern and western Libya that have been fighting on and off for the past three years.
LNA forces are currently stationed at Al Uqaylah, about 70 km (45 miles) southeast of Ras Lanuf, military spokesman Akram Buhaliqa said. LNA war planes conducted strikes near Ras Lanuf and Es Sider early on Monday, he said.
The LNA took over the ports of Es Sider, Ras Lanuf, Brega and Zueitina in September, allowing the National Oil Corporation (NOC) to end a long blockade in the area and more than double national output.
Al Uqaylah lies about 40km southwest of Brega, and about 120 km southwest of Zueitina, both still under LNA control.
LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari urged citizens in the region to restrict their movements, and appealed to forces that captured Sirte, about 180 km east of Es Sider, from Islamic State last year, to stay within the coastal city to avoid being hit by air raids.
""There is a very large air and ground mobilization of (LNA) forces to drive back the terrorist gangs in the Oil Crescent,"" he said in a statement.
Since clashes began on Friday, 18 of the LNA's forces have been killed and 15 wounded, a medical official in the nearby town of Ajdabiya said.
Libya's oil production has reached around 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) in recent weeks, more than double the OPEC member's output last year, but still far under the 1.6 million bpd it was producing before a 2011 uprising.
Es Sider and Ras Lanuf were badly damaged in previous rounds of fighting and have been operating far below normal capacity.
The BDB are partly made up of fighters who fled Benghazi as the LNA made advances there in a three-year campaign to oust Islamists and other opponents from the city.

They say they are trying to return to Benghazi, 130km north of Zueitina.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell in Asian trade on Monday, wiping out some of the gains of the previous session amid worries lower growth targets in China could cut oil demand and ongoing concern over Russia's compliance with a global deal to cut oil output.
But worries over escalating violence in the Middle East put a floor under prices.
Brent crude futures dropped 47 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $55.43 a barrel as of 0749 GMT after settling 1.5 percent higher in the previous session.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 47 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $52.86 a barrel after closing the previous session up 1.4 percent.
""The main drag affecting markets today is the lowering of growth targets by China and tighter regulatory controls which implies less demand for oil and commodities in general,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market strategist at Oanda brokerage in Singapore.
China aims to expand its economy by around 6.5 percent this year, Premier Li Keqiang said in his work report at the opening of the annual meeting of parliament on Sunday.
That is lower than the 6.7 percent growth achieved last year.
China also plans to cut steel and coal output this year in an effort to tackle pollution, its top economic planner said on Sunday, while China's newly appointed banking regulator vowed on to strengthen supervision of the lending sector.
Meanwhile, figures by Russia's energy ministry released last week showed February oil output was unchanged from January at 11.11 million barrels per day (bpd), casting doubt on Russia's moves to rein in output as part of a pact with oil producers last year.
Despite uncertainty over output cuts, crude inventories among OECD members would normalize slightly faster than expected this year due to larger-than-expected production cuts this year and higher demand in 2016, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said on Monday.
Oil prices rose on Friday as the dollar weakened modestly after a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen suggested a rate increase would come at the end of a two-day Fed meeting on March 15. 
A weaker dollar bolsters commodity prices, including oil. While a rate hike would be supportive for the U.S. dollar, analysts said a near-term hike was already largely priced in.
Crude oil prices were also supported by news of increasing supply disruptions in the Middle East, ANZ said in a note on Monday. 
That followed new doubts over Libya's attempts to revive its oil production after an armed faction entered two major oil ports on Friday, pushing back forces that captured and reopened the terminals in September.

""I'm surprised prices haven't moved higher given events in the Middle East over the weekend. China and U.S. interest rates are the bigger issues,"" Halley added.

On Thursday, the European Central Bank meets and will offer fresh cues on the future direction of its stimulus program.
At the weekend, China's Premier Li Keqiang mapped out a cautious economic course for China, setting a modest downshift in growth to let the government rein in swelling financial risks and ensure a smooth changeover in the political leadership this year with a target for the world’s second-largest economy to see GDP gain about 6.5% for 2017, a small recalibration from last year’s range of 6.5% to 7% and not far from actual growth of 6.7% in 2016, the slowest pace in a quarter-century.
Li also said Beijing aimed to keep consumer-price inflation under 3% in 2017, unchanged from last year’s goal. China’s consumer-price index rose 2.0% in 2016 from a year earlier.
Last week, gold prices fell on Friday and posted the largest weekly loss of 2017 so far amid growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this month.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said Friday that a rate hike ""would likely be appropriate"" this month if the economy remains on track. The remarks cemented the view that the Fed will raise interest rates at its next meeting on March 14-15, following a series of hawkish comments by Fed policymakers earlier in the week.
Almost 80% of traders expect a rate hike at the Fed’s March meeting, compared to just over 60% on Wednesday, according to Investing.com’s Fed rate monitor tool.

Barkindo added that a monitoring committee will meet on March 25.
Last week, oil futures ended higher on Friday, as a broadly weaker U.S. dollar helped prices rebound from a sell-off that took them to multi-week lows in the prior session. Oil prices typically strengthen when the U.S. currency weakens as the dollar-priced commodity becomes cheaper for holders of other currencies.
Uncertainty surrounding Libya’s crude production following reports of violence near the war-torn country's biggest oil terminal also provided support.
Prices, however, still ended with a weekly loss as concern over rising shale production and record-high U.S. crude inventories offset optimism that OPEC and its allies have been following through on their commitment to cut production.
Concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand pressured crude prices.
Data from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes on Friday revealed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by 7 last week, the seventh weekly increase in a row. That brought the total count to 609, the most since October 2015.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude supplies increased by 1.5 million barrels last week to yet another all-time high of 520.2 million. It was the eighth straight weekly build in U.S. stockpiles, feeding concerns about a global glut.
Oil prices have been trading in a narrow $5 range around the mid-$50s over the past two months as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between rising stockpiles and increased shale production in the U.S. and hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day by the end of June, with compliance currently at around 94%.

On Thursday, the European Central Bank meets and will offer fresh cues on the future direction of its stimulus program.
At the weekend, China's Premier Li Keqiang mapped out a cautious economic course for China, setting a modest downshift in growth to let the government rein in swelling financial risks and ensure a smooth changeover in the political leadership this year with a target for the world’s second-largest economy to see GDP gain about 6.5% for 2017, a small recalibration from last year’s range of 6.5% to 7% and not far from actual growth of 6.7% in 2016, the slowest pace in a quarter-century.
Li also said Beijing aimed to keep consumer-price inflation under 3% in 2017, unchanged from last year’s goal. China’s consumer-price index rose 2.0% in 2016 from a year earlier.

654,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2017 01:10AM ET</span>",Titans of oil world meet in Houston after two-year price war,"By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) - The biggest names in the oil world come together this week for the largest industry gathering since the end of a two-year price war that pitted Middle East exporters against the firms that drove the shale energy revolution in the United States.
When OPEC in November joined with several non-OPEC producers to agree to a historic cut in output, the group called time on a fight for market share that drove oil prices to a 12-year low and many shale producers to the wall.
Oil prices are about 70 percent higher than they were the last time oil ministers and the chief executives of Big Oil met in Houston a year ago at CERAWeek, the largest annual industry meet in the Americas.
The ebullience as both sides enjoy higher revenues will be a welcome relief from the gloom of a year ago, near the depths of the price war.
""The oil market has been rebalancing and the powerful forces of supply and demand have been working,"" said Dan Yergin, vice chairman of conference organizer IHS Markit and a Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian.
""The mood will be different this year.""
The capital of the U.S. oil industry Houston is emerging from the price war sporting new downtown skyscrapers and the lingering glow from hosting last month's Super Bowl. 
OPEC's November deal, the prospects for its continuation and rosier investment prospects for the industry will dominate the discussions, with state-run producers and Big Oil both positioning themselves for an upturn in the notoriously cyclical business.
Twice as many OPEC ministers as a year ago - plus Russia and India's top energy officials - will be in the capital of the U.S. energy industry.
Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih, who assumed his role last spring and whose country has contributed the largest share of OPEC output curbs, addresses the meeting on Tuesday.
Russian Oil Minister Alexander Novak, who was key to bringing non-OPEC countries on board to cut in tandem with OPEC, will speak on Monday
Chief executives from five hard-hit international oil producers -  BP  (LON:BP),  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and Total - will be listening closely to the ministers' comments to see if those production curbs will be extended past their June expiration.
The meeting won't be without simmering tension between U.S. oil producers and OPEC. One of the biggest questions in the oil market is how quickly and how much shale producers will boost output. A sharp rise from the U.S. shale patch could undo the Saudi-led deal to reduce the global oil glut.
Shale activity is humming in the hottest U.S. oilfield, the Permian Basin, a 75,000 square mile expanse in West Texas. The U.S. land drilling rig count is up 55 percent in the past 12 months, and many of them are in the Permian.
""It's exciting now to see the rig count rising and business activity picking up again,"" said Peter Boylan, chief executive of Cypress Energy Partners LP, an oilfield service provider with operations in Texas and North Dakota. 
MORE SPENDING 
Oil's resurgence isn't confined to America. Already this year, Total and BP have launched multi-billion dollar deals to expand in Brazil and Mauritania, respectively. Better prices could stir a new round of merger activity, according to some analysts.
Exxon, which is expected later this year be eclipsed by Saudi Aramco as the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, recently pledged to boost this year's spending by 16 percent to expand operations, especially in shale production.
That newfound investment vigor and projections for stronger shale production have kept a lid on the recovery. Oil prices may struggle to breach $60 per barrel, regardless of how much OPEC cuts, if the U.S. keeps increasing production, according to a Reuters poll. 
U.S. crude futures closed on Friday at $53.33 per barrel. 
BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) has boosted investment in its shale operations since last fall, forecasting the sector to become the single largest generator of cash flow for its petroleum business within five years. 

""We expect a balanced oil market in 2017 for the first time in nearly three years,"" said Steve Pastor, president of BHP's petroleum business.

655,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2017 07:50PM ET</span>","Armed faction enters major Libyan oil ports, putting output at risk","By Ayman al-Warfalli
BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - An armed faction entered two major Libyan oil ports on Friday, pushing back forces that captured and reopened the terminals in September, officials and residents said.
The move risks increasing the fighting around the ports and casts new doubt over Libya's attempt to revive its oil production. The terminals at Es Sider and Ras Lanuf are two of Libya's largest, with potential combined production capacity of about 600,000 barrels per day (bpd).
It was unclear late on Friday to what extent the faction that attacked, the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB), had gained control over the area. There was no statement from the Libyan National Oil Corporation (NOC) in Tripoli, which restarted operations at the ports after the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) took them over seven months ago.
Since then the LNA's opponents have launched several unsuccessful attacks against the ports in Libya's eastern Oil Crescent, in a campaign linked to a broader conflict between factions based in eastern and western Libya.
The LNA had said the ports were well secured. But it said the BDB had launched a rapid, three-pronged attack early on Friday that pierced its defenses.
Air strikes repelled an attack targeting a third port, Brega, but the LNA withdrew men and equipment around Es Sider and Ras Lanuf to avoid a damaging fire fight, LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari said.
Port engineers, oil sources and residents said the BDB entered both Es Sider and Ras Lanuf ports after the attack.
The BDB posted pictures of its fighters at Ras Lanuf's nearby air strip, though the LNA later said it had retaken control there.
At least nine men loyal to the LNA were killed and eight wounded in the fighting, a medical source said.
The LNA took Es Sider, Ras Lanuf, Brega and Zueitina oil ports in September. All but Brega had long been blockaded. After the NOC reopened them, Libya's oil production more than doubled.
The Benghazi Defence Brigades are composed partly of fighters who were ousted from Benghazi by the LNA, where LNA commander Khalifa Haftar has been waging a military campaign for nearly three years against Islamists and other opponents.
The LNA brands its opponents as Islamist extremists, and each side accuses the other of using mercenaries from Libya's sub-Saharan neighbors. Some in the east also accuse elements of the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli of backing the BDB and their allies.
The GNA's leadership strongly condemned Friday's escalation, saying in a statement that it ""did not give any order to any forces to move towards that area"". It suggested the attack could be an effort to scupper Libyan and international efforts to bring peace.
Libya has recently been producing about 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil, more than double its output early last year but still far less than the 1.6 million bpd the OPEC member was pumping before the 2011 uprising.
The Oil Crescent ports suffered major damage in previous rounds of fighting and are still operating well below capacity.
Tankers have been loading at Es Sider since December, with the Amalthea due to arrive on March 7 to load 630,000 barrels for Austria's OMV, according to shipping sources.

The NOC has been lobbying foreign firms to return to Libya and invest in the oil and gas sector as it tries to push production to 1.2 million bpd later this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices ticked higher on Friday, recouping some of the previous session's losses, as a weaker dollar encouraged buying but investors remained cautious after Russian production figures showed weak compliance with a global deal to cut output.
Global benchmark Brent (LCOc1) was up 7 cents at $55.15 a barrel at 1252 GMT, recovering some of Thursday's losses that amounted to more than 2 percent.
WTI futures (CLc1) traded at $52.64 a barrel, up 3 cents on the previous close.
""The market is range bound, therefore there is nothing surprising in seeing fresh buying after a big sell-off and of course the slightly weaker dollar is also helping oil recover,"" said Tamas Varga, senior analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
The dollar (DXY) slipped from a seven-week high on Friday ahead of a key speech by Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen.[USD/] 
A weaker greenback makes it more attractive to buy dollar-denominated currencies like oil futures.
""Because prices have failed once again to rise above their trading corridors, there is a growing risk of speculative selling,"" said analysts at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), suggesting further downside potential.
Oil's gains were capped after concerns remained over non-OPEC compliance with a global deal to rein in oversupply.
Russia's February oil output was unchanged from January at 11.11 million barrels per day (bpd), energy ministry data showed, with its cuts from October 2016 levels remaining at 100,000 bpd or a third of what was pledged by Moscow under its agreement with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
Official U.S. data also showed crude inventories in the world's biggest oil consumer rose for an eighth straight week to a record 520.2 million barrels last week. [EIA/S] 

But even as U.S. oil production rose and Russian output held steady, OPEC boosted already strong compliance with the group's six-month deal to 94 percent, cutting output for a second month in February, a Reuters survey found. [OPEC/O]

660,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2017 07:50AM ET</span>",Kirkuk oil flows in jeopardy again as Kurdish tensions grow,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's Kurdistan is facing growing tensions between its government and the key opposition faction, which briefly disrupted oil flows from the semi-autonomous region this week and has threatened to take more action in coming days.
At the center of the dispute is the huge Kirkuk oil field in northern Iraq, which can pump around 150,000 barrels per day and has been exporting the output to world markets via Turkey.
The Kurdistan Regional Government, led by President Massoud Barzani and based in the capital of Erbil, began independent exports of oil from Kirkuk in 2014 but cut a deal with Baghdad last year to equally split the revenues.
The deal has been opposed by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which is dominant in the area of Kirkuk and is the historic adversary of Barzani's Erbil-based ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).
On Thursday, forces loyal to the PUK seized the Kirkuk facilities and briefly suspended oil flows, and threatened further action.
The developments have revived memories of a prolonged oil disruption in 2015-2016, when a quarter of Kurdish oil was reinjected back into the ground for months. That cost the region around $1 billion in lost revenues as the two Kurdish groups and the central government in Baghdad argued about revenue sharing.
A key PUK lawmaker said on Friday that the operation to seize the facilities was triggered by frustration among the local population with both the government in Baghdad and the Kurdish leadership in Erbil.
Aala Talabani, a lawmaker who heads the PUK block of MPs in the Iraqi parliament in Baghdad, said the local authorities were unhappy that neither Baghdad nor Erbil was prepared to build a local refinery ""so that the people of the province can have a share of the petrodollars"".
""What happened is a natural reaction (after) the federal government and the Kurdistan Regional Government resumed oil exports without implementing (this) condition,"" she told the Iraqi news website Mawazeen.
Oil officials and security sources said PUK forces were still in control of the pumping facility, located around 15 km (10 miles) west of the city of Kirkuk, although they had allowed oil flows to resume after halting them for several hours on Thursday.
""PUK wants the current Kirkuk oil sharing deal to be canceled within a week,"" said a source with knowledge of the Kirkuk operations. He said there was a risk that flows could be suspended again.
A PUK official said on Thursday that PUK forces would shut down oil flows again unless their demands were met within a week.
The oil field was run by Baghdad's North Oil Company until 2014 when the Kurdish peshmerga forces took control of the Kirkuk area after Islamic State militants overran around a third of Iraq and Baghdad's local forces disintegrated.
The current Kirkuk oil sharing deal between Erbil and Baghdad was agreed by Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Kurdish Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani.

Prior to the signing of the deal, local Kirkuk authorities and some executives from Iraq state oil firm SOMO were suggesting exporting oil from Kirkuk via Iran.

667,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2017 11:45AM ET</span>",Peak gasoline demand looms with engine efficiency gains,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Demand for gasoline in the United States, which accounts for a tenth of global oil consumption, is expected to peak next year as engines become more efficient, WoodMackenzie analysts said.
Global demand for gasoline, which accounts for more than a quarter of the world's oil consumption, is set to peak as early as 2021 even in the face of relentless growth in the vehicle fleet, according to the Edinburgh-based consultancy.
A rise in the number of hybrid and electric cars such as the Nissan (T:7201) Leaf, Toyota (T:7203) Prius and Tesla (O:TSLA) as well as tighter fuel standards in Europe and the United States will contribute to a historic shift in consumption.
The United States saw spectacular growth in gasoline demand following the collapse in oil prices in 2014 and as its economy recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, reaching a record high of 9.326 million barrels per day last year.
Gasoline demand is expected to grow to peak of around 9.45 million tonnes in 2017 and remain largely unchanged in 2018 before slipping to 9.28 million tonnes in the following year, according to WoodMac.
""We expect gasoline engine efficiency to continue to improve through better deployment of batteries in hybrid vehicles,"" WoodMac analyst Alan Gelder said. 
An expected recovery in oil prices in coming years is also expected to curtail demand growth, he added. 
At its peak, global gasoline demand is expected to reach 25.89 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2021, accounting for roughly a quarter of oil demand.
The decline in U.S. and European gasoline consumption will mask a steady expansion in demand in Asia, where most of the global increase in the vehicle fleet will take place.
While engine efficiencies increase, the global gasoline car fleet is expected to grow by more than 10 percent by 2025 to above 1 billion vehicles, according to WoodMac.
Vitol, the world's top oil trader, last month said it expected global demand for gasoline and diesel to peak in 2027-2028.
NO PEAK
The question of when oil demand will reach its apex has been one of the most central and divisive for the industry, which faces the prospect of a world almost free of fossil fuels by the end of the century if a U.N.-backed plan to stem global warming is enforced.
Some companies, including Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), the world's second-largest oil and gas company, say oil demand could peak in the 2030s. The International Energy Agency, the West's energy watchdog, expects oil consumption to grow in the foreseeable future, albeit at much slower rates.
""We still see global oil demand growing but the role of transportation shrinks,"" Gelder said.
Growth will be driven by the petrochemical sector, which uses oil feedstocks to produce plastics, as well as demand for diesel and gasoil from the commercial transportation sector, particularly buses, ships and planes, he added.
The world's car fleet, including diesel cars and trucks, is set to grow by some 20 percent to 1.32 billion by 2025, according to WoodMac.
But the pace is expected to drop sharply compared to historic rates.

""Traditionally we had (annual) oil demand growth north of 1 million barrels per day. We are transitioning over the next decade to growth of around 500,000 bpd a year,"" Gelder said.

U.S. natural gas for April delivery fell 2.7 cents, or around 1%, to $2.772 per million British thermal units by 10:35AM ET (15:35GMT). Futures were at around $2.780 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. rose by 7 billion cubic feet in the week ended February 24, compared to market expectations for a drop of 4 billion cubic feet.
That compared with a withdrawal of 89 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 48 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 132 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.363 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 7.3% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 12.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Prices of the heating fuel are down a whopping 28% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

673,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2017 05:40AM ET</span>",Back from the dead? Chinese iron ore miners plot return as prices surge,"By Manolo Serapio Jr
MANILA (Reuters) - Rocketing iron ore prices may prompt Chinese producers to reopen mines shuttered years ago in a sector downturn, potentially tightening the market for marginal foreign suppliers to the world's biggest importing country, industry executives say.
A revival could help Chinese steel mills cut raw material import costs, boosting margins amid rising steel prices. If more domestic ore is produced, mills could also use that as leverage to push for better deals on seaborne imports from top suppliers like Vale (SA:VALE5),  Rio Tinto  (AX:RIO) (L:RIO) and BHP Billiton (AX:BHP) (L:BLT), traders say. 
A booming Chinese steel market pushed iron ore <.IO62-CNO=MB> to $94.86 a tonne last month, its strongest since August 2014. With Beijing expected to boost infrastructure spending, the raw material looks set to rally further, making domestic production more viable. 
""Quite a few Chinese iron ore miners are planning to come back and reopen their mines,"" said Pan Guocheng, head of medium-sized miner  China Hanking Holdings Ltd  (HK:3788). While low prices led to closure of more than a third of China's iron ore capacity since 2013, Pan expects nearly half of those mines to restart - if the price stays above $80 for another six months. 
Hanking is now considering restarting one of three mines it closed when times were leaner. ""If the price will stay high,"" said Pan, ""we are going to seriously re-evaluate if that mine should be reopened."" 
A wave of mine reopenings won't present any immediate threat to Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, giants that supply top-grade material that's an essential element of the input mix used in steel mill blast furnaces.
What's more, Beijing's tighter environmental rules could make life difficult for returning mines, analysts have warned. 
BARGAINING CHIP
Raw Chinese iron ore only has iron content of about 20 percent, compared to more than 60 percent mined by Vale, Rio and BHP. But processed Chinese ore can go up to 66 percent.
Some mills prefer to use the best grades of Chinese iron ore they can find, rather than lower grade material from overseas.
""We are looking to get more local iron ore but we cannot find a lot of it now,"" said an official from a steel mill in southeastern China, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media. ""I think they're just preparing to restart.""
Hanking's Pan said China's best grade ores are competitive with lower grade material from Australia, like those shipped by  Fortescue Metals  Group (AX:FMG).
But inland Chinese mills buy Fortescue's ore to blend with domestic high-grade ore, Fortescue Chief Executive Nev Power said. ""Demand... remains strong and we are making very strong margins at the prevailing market price,"" Power told Reuters by email.
Nonetheless, traders are betting that if more domestic high-grade iron ore is produced, Chinese mills could use it as bargaining chip with foreign suppliers. 
""Mills may use it as leverage - if imported price is too high they will shift to domestic ore,"" said one Shanghai-based trader who declined to be identified.

679,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2017 01:51PM ET</span>","Trump poised to lift federal coal ban, other green rules: White House","(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will target a handful of Obama-era green regulations, including a federal coal mining ban and an initiative forcing states to cut carbon emissions, in an executive order as soon as next week, a White House official told Reuters on Wednesday.
Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress are seeking to unravel former Democratic President Barack Obama's initiatives to combat global climate change, which they say are costly for U.S. business and have hampered drilling and mining without providing any clear benefits.
""Rescinding the federal coal leasing moratorium is part of that executive order, which has lots of different components, including the Clean Power Plan,"" the White House official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. The official said the order was scheduled to come next week.
The Clean Power Plan is Obama's centerpiece initiative to combat climate change, requiring states to slash emissions of carbon dioxide, but it was never implemented due to legal challenges launched by several Republican states.
Legal experts have said Trump could begin the process of killing the regulation by having the Environmental Protection Agency ask the courts to return it to the agency for review, effectively ending its legal defense.
Killing the coal mining ban would be easier. Trump could reverse the ban by asking the Department of Interior to lift it and resume its coal leasing program.
Obama's administration imposed the temporary ban on new federal coal leases in January 2016 as part of a broad environmental and economic review of the program aimed at ensuring lease deals account for coal's contribution to global climate change and yield fair returns to taxpayers.
But it angered some Western state lawmakers and people in the mining industry, who said it stymied development.
Trump has already rolled back some Obama-era green regulations, including the Stream Protection Rule limiting coal mining waste dumping, and the Waters of the U.S. rule that expands the waterways under federal protection.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil reversed earlier losses on Wednesday as investors took heart from strict OPEC compliance with its pledge to cut output, although evidence of increasing U.S. production capped gains.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reduced its oil output for a second month in February, a Reuters survey found, showing the exporter group has boosted already strong compliance to around 94 percent.
Heftier cuts by Saudi Arabia and Angola helped offset weaker compliance by other members that agreed to limit their output. 
May Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were last up 27 cents at $56.78 a barrel by 1030 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures for April (CLc1) were up 18 cents at $54.19.
Oil prices are 23 percent higher than they were at the end of November, when OPEC announced its deal, but this strength has encouraged more U.S. production to come back online.
""There seems ... to be a consensus within OPEC that the optimal crude oil price is as near as possible to the upper line of our shale band price range ($40-60 a barrel) but not significantly above,"" Olivier Jakob, a strategist at consultant Petromatrix, said.
""OPEC will be happy with price stability in the upper half of our shale band (i.e. trying to keep prices in the $50-60 upper half) and above $60 a barrel, we will see more OPEC cheating as members do not want to see U.S. shale oil come back too strongly.""
Investors were waiting for weekly U.S. inventory data at 1530 GMT. 
U.S. crude stockpiles have risen for seven straight weeks. Forecasts for another build last week, this time of 3.1 million barrels, have fueled worries that demand growth may not be sufficient to soak up the global oil glut. 
The market offered little reaction to news of a rise in North Sea crude supply next month. Loading programs for the four crudes that underpin dated Brent showed a rise to 908,000 barrels per day, from March's 884,000 bpd. [O/LOAD]
A speech by U.S. President Donald Trump late on Tuesday gave little detail on plans by his administration to boost U.S. oil production. 
Traders and investors had expected Trump to include specifics on energy policy in an address to the U.S. Congress.

""If Trump had announced de-regulations of some of the environment protections to make it easier to pump more oil, that might have put pressure on WTI,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore.

Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, in an interview with CNBC Africa, also said he was confident that an output reduction agreement agreed in November would see oil prices hold. 
Nigeria, which relies on crude sales for around two-thirds of government revenue, saw its economy shrink 1.5 percent in 2016 - the first full-year contraction in 25 years - largely due to lower oil receipts. 
Eleven of OPEC's 13 members along with 11 non-OPEC countries agreed to make cuts for the first half of 2017, although Nigeria and fellow OPEC member Libya were exempt due to production setbacks suffered last year. 
""OPEC members must lower production costs to compete better with shale producers,"" said Kachikwu, quoted in a tweet on CNBC Africa's Twitter feed. 
Kachikwu said he was ""impressed with the work OPEC has done"" and ""confident prices will hold"", but added: ""What is more fundamental is what OPEC countries can begin to do for themselves in term of costs, diversification."" 
The Nov. 30 agreement to cut production prompted oil prices to rise $10 a barrel, although they have been trading in a narrow $3 range in the last few weeks. [O/R]
But analysts say that a revival in U.S. shale production is likely to limit any major price recovery in crude oil.

""This year we will continue to cut capacity in coal and steel,"" Yin Weimin, the head of China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, told reporters.
""We will need to reallocate jobs to 500,000 workers,"" he said, including assigning workers different jobs within the same or a different company, early retirement or encouraging them to become entrepreneurs.
China will introduce a policy this year to encourage the development of new industries, for example internet-related industries, that will create new jobs, he said.
China reallocated jobs to 726,000 coal and steel workers in 2016 ""without any major problems"", he said, adding that China's overall employment outlook in 2017 is expected to remain relatively stable, despite the government facing immense pressure to create jobs. 
China's central government allocated more than 100 billion yuan ($14.54 billion) last year to help laid-off coal and steel workers and spent more than 30 billion yuan from the fund last year, Yin said.
China created 13.14 million urban jobs in 2016, Yin said, but did not specify whether this was a gross or net figure of the number of people at work.
China's urban registered unemployment rate will remain at around 4.5 percent in 2017, Yin told reporters, but many analysts believe this figure is an unreliable indicator of nationwide employment conditions. 
China's official unemployment rate has been around 4 percent for years, despite the rapid slowdown in the economy from double-digit growth to 6.7 percent in 2016, its slowest pace in 26 years.

LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC has cut its oil output for a second month in February, a Reuters survey found on Tuesday, allowing the exporter group to boost already strong compliance with agreed supply curbs on the back of a steep reduction by Saudi Arabia.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is cutting its output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1 - the first such deal since 2008 to get rid of a glut. Non-OPEC countries pledged to cut about half as much.
Previous OPEC cuts have been mired in mass cheating by its members, making strong compliance by OPEC this time a positive surprise for the market, with prices trading above $55 per barrel -- up from $35 a year ago.
Top exporter Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies are hoping the cuts will help oil rise a bit further to around $60, five sources from OPEC countries and the oil industry said, to boost exporters' income and industry investment.
""If compliance is high by OPEC and non-OPEC, then I think prices will reach $60,"" said an OPEC delegate. ""If it was higher it would be better, but $60 is fine.""
In January, OPEC delivered 82 percent of the promised cuts, according to a Reuters survey and over 90 percent according to OPEC's own report.
The International Energy Agency has said it was impressed with OPEC's compliance, calling it a record level.
In February, supply from the 11 OPEC members with production targets under the deal has averaged 29.87 million bpd, down from a revised figure of 29.96 million bpd in January and 31.17 million bpd in December, according to the Reuters survey.
Compared with the levels the countries agreed to make the reductions from, in most cases their October output, this means the OPEC members have cut output by 1.098 million bpd of the pledged 1.164 million bpd, equating to 94 percent compliance.
The Reuters survey showed Saudi Arabia's output fell slightly in February from an already deep reduction in January taking the total curb achieved to 744,000 bpd, well above the target cut of 486,000 bpd.
Thus, Saudi Arabia continued to compensate for the weaker adherence of other members, including Algeria, Iraq, Venezuela and even its key ally the United Arab Emirates, which cut output by 33,000 bpd -- well below the target reduction of 139,000 bpd.
Iraq trimmed exports from its southern ports in February, boosting its compliance, the survey found, and shipping schedules suggest exports may fall more in March. 
UAE officials and industry sources say the UAE will move closer to its OPEC target in coming months, improving average compliance during the six-month duration of the supply cut rather than focusing on month-by-month performance.
Iran's production was up slightly in February versus January even though the country is effectively excluded from output cuts. Nigeria, which is also excluded from cuts, raised output while Libya was flat month-on-month.
OPEC announced a production target of 32.5 million bpd at its Nov. 30 meeting, which was based on low figures for Libya and Nigeria and included Indonesia, which has since left the group.
The increases in February mean OPEC output has averaged 32.19 million bpd, about 440,000 bpd above its supply target adjusted to remove Indonesia. 

The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data, and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

697,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2017 12:19PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Iraq's Kurdistan negotiates new terms, raises oil pre-payments to $3 billion","By Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - Iraq's Kurdistan has increased the loans guaranteed by future oil sales to $3 billion in new deals with trading houses and Russian state oil firm Rosneft aimed at strengthening its fiscal position as the semi-autonomous region fights Islamic State.
Kurdistan's natural sources minister Ashti Hawrami told Reuters new debt talks concluded in recent weeks gave the region grace periods of between 3 and 5 years for repaying the debt.
The deals also increased total borrowing to around $3 billion. He did not give the size of the debt before the latest round of talks but some of it dates from 2014 and 2015. 
Trading houses have been pre-financing Kurdish oil exports for the past two years on a fairly short-term basis after the government in Erbil decided to start independent oil exports via Turkey's Mediterranean terminals. Now traders will loan money to Kurdistan for several years. Rosneft became a lender last week..
Kurdistan says it needs to export oil independently as Baghdad has not paid Erbil its budget share just as the region needs money to fight Islamic State and host Syrian refugees.
Baghdad has said it would sue buyers of Kurdish oil, arguing that the central government was the only legal exporter. The new Baghdad government has softened its stance, however, as it cooperated with Erbil against Islamic State in Mosul.
""This helps our economic independence although it is important to understand that this cannot be achieved just by oil revenues and higher oil prices. We also need to press on with our economic reforms,"" Hawrami said in an interview in London.
""We have learnt a lot from the oil price shock, the costs of fighting ISIS, and the burden of some 1.8 million refugees coming to our territory... Reform is a must – we have a lot of debts to deal with."" 
He declined to name the trading houses but market sources have previously identified Vitol, Petraco,  Glencore  (L:GLEN) and Trafigura as buyers of Kurdish barrels. Last week, Glencore confirmed it had concluded deals for Kurdish oil. The other trading houses do not comment on their dealings with Kurdistan and Rosneft did not give any details on the size of the deal. 
Hawrami said the deals would serve as a hedge against an oil price slide for several years. Previous deals with trading houses have usually lasted 6-12 months.
""It is also positive for the traders as they don't have to renegotiate their contracts every six months,"" said Hawrami.
""It strengthens our fiscal situation. It means we can pay more regularly to the international oil companies working in Kurdistan and we can invest some money in expanding our oil infrastructure,"" he said.
Kurdistan's finances suffered badly during the oil price slump of 2015-2016 and it has accumulated several months of arrears to producers such as Genel (L:GENL), DNO (OL:DNO) and Gulf Keystone (L:GKP) due to tight revenues and supply glitches.
The stocks of these companies rose on the news. 
""This year we want to avoid repeating this. I'm confident we will do better. We know the producers’ needs and plans. We are prioritizing not to fall behind again,"" Hawrami said. 
GROUND BREAKING DEAL
Hawrami said the arrival of Rosneft in addition to trading houses to the marketing of Kurdish barrels was good news for the region as it gave Erbil its first big end-user and opened up new markets - Rosneft has refineries in Germany and India.
""We hope Rosneft’s deal will become a ground breaker for other majors,"" he said adding Rosneft was also looking at exploration blocks in Kurdistan.
He also said relations with Baghdad were improving.
""We didn't hear any negative comments from them after the deal with Rosneft. They know we are selling our oil. And actually if we help each other rather than hindering progress, we can both achieve better prices as buyers will not be able to seek unreasonable discounts.""
He also said the fact that Erbil was now selling some barrels for Baghdad from the northern Kirkuk field was evidence of improving relations.
""In reality, Baghdad has given us some share of oil to export. So we have an arrangement that we both honor. We have real cooperation and we hope to build on that,"" he said.
INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANSION
Kurdistan's existing pipelines can handle just over 650,000 barrels per day of exports and more investments are needed to bring that capacity to 1 million bpd, including upgrading of pumping stations, said Hawrami.
He said pipeline capacity should be expanded by the year-end but production would not start rising until next year.
""We have to be mindful about supply and demand. You tell me what the oil price is going to be and I will tell you when we could reach 1 million bpd of output. Investments have dried up in the last two years because of the oil price crash and attacks by ISIS,"" he said.
Kurdistan is planning to offer some 20 blocks of land for exploration to investors. The region took some blocks back from investors after discovering they did little exploration, said Hawrami without naming the companies.
Some operators relinquished blocks as they were disappointed with what they found, including U.S. oil giant  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) which has given back three blocks out of six over the past year. 
Hawrami said he did not see this as a set back.
""Exxon has concluded that they will continue working on 3 blocks while on another three the potential reserves were simply not big enough for them. Those blocks could suit other firms. We are now looking to farm them out,"" he said.

699,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2017 09:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi Arabia wants oil prices to rise to around $60 in 2017 - sources,"By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia wants crude oil prices to rise to around $60 a barrel this year, five sources from OPEC countries and the oil industry said.
This is the level the OPEC heavyweight and its Gulf allies - the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar - believe would encourage investment in new fields but not lead to a jump in U.S. shale output, the sources said. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers pledged last year to cut production by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1. The first cut in eight years is intended to boost prices and get rid of a supply glut.
Crude prices have risen by more than 14 percent since the November pact but are still only trading around $56 a barrel despite record compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC members.
OPEC officials have repeatedly said the group does not target a specific oil price and their focus is on drawing global oil inventories and helping the market to re-balance.
But behind closed doors, Riyadh and its Gulf OPEC allies hope to see a higher level because the low price has pressured their finances and stoked fears of a future supply shortage.
However, they do not want the price to be so high that it encourages rival U.S. shale producers, which were hard hit by the slump in oil prices, to ramp up production again. Advances in technology have made it easier for them to adapt quickly to oil price fluctuations. 
""They (the Saudis) want to see oil prices at $60 towards the end of this year. It's good for (oil) investments,"" said a Gulf oil industry source familiar with the matter.
Another non-Gulf industry source said ""OPEC and particularly the Saudis want higher prices"" not just for investment but also as Riyadh as it seeks to offload a stake in state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco‎. 
Over $1 trillion worth of oil projects have been canceled or delayed since mid-2014. A decline in investments in future oil projects triggered worries that this could lead to a supply shortage and spike in oil prices.
Oil fields take around four years to develop before production can start whereas U.S. shale oil can now be extracted within a few months of a decision. 
""In general, something around $60 this year is good. $60 will not encourage that big increase in shale,"" said one OPEC source, adding that shale oil production is expected to grow by about 300,000 bpd this year.
ABSORBING SHALE
U.S. shale producers started to grow production again when crude prices first topped $50 a barrel in May 2016 after a two year price slump due to a global glut starting in mid 2014.
U.S. drillers have added more than 280 oil rigs since the end of May, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecast that U.S. domestic production will rise by 430,000 bpd between December 2016 and December 2017.
Despite the advances in technology, another OPEC source said that shale producers who survived the downturn may be cautious about responding quickly to a change in oil prices. 
A third OPEC source said it was difficult to see oil prices rising to $60 or above this year due to a lingering oversupply.
That source also said that even if shale oil production rose by more than 300,000 bpd the market could absorb it if it comes during the cold winter season when demand peaks.
""The catch is the timing. If this happened, as it is widely projected, during the fourth quarter, the impact will be manageable and could be absorbed by the market,"" the source said.
OPEC could extend its oil supply-reduction pact with non-members or even apply deeper cuts from July if global crude inventories fail to drop to a targeted level, OPEC sources have told Reuters.
The Gulf industry source said OPEC and non-OPEC members may extend the supply curb pact because a return to a pump-at-will oil policy would crash prices and destabilize markets again.

""If we go back to a race to raise production, then we haven't achieved anything and prices will fall again,"" the source said.

Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (21:30GMT) later on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock rise of 2.9 million barrels.
Last week's numbers showed U.S. output helped boost crude inventories to record highs, feeding concerns about a global glut.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude April contract lost 54 cents, or around 1%, to $53.48 a barrel by 9:10AM ET (14:10GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London declined 57 cents to $55.85 a barrel.
According to market experts, failure to break through the upper range of a recent trading band dampened sentiment.
Oil prices have been trading in a narrow $5 range around the mid-$50s over the past two months as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers and expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production.
Data from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes revealed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by five last week, the sixth weekly increase in a row.
That brought the total count to 602, the most since October 2015, raising concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
Hedge funds extended their bullish bets on oil to an all-time high last week as OPEC and non-OPEC countries made a strong start to lowering their oil output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day by the end of June, with compliance currently at around 90%.
OPEC could extend its oil supply-reduction pact with non-members or even apply deeper cuts from July if global crude inventories fail to drop to a targeted level, OPEC sources said earlier this month.

U.S. natural gas for April delivery dipped 0.1 cents, or less than 0.1% to $2.692 per million British thermal units by 8:40AM ET (13:40GMT), after plunging 9.4 cents, or 3.4%, on Monday.
Futures touched a three-and-a-half-month low of $2.522 last Wednesday, as forecasts called for mostly warmer-than-normal weather in key regions across the U.S. for the rest of the winter.
Prices of the heating fuel are down a whopping 30% so far this year.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 1 and 8 billion cubic feet in the week ended February 24.
That compares with a withdrawal of 89 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 48 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 132 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.356 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2.5% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 6.6% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

(Reuters) - Oil may struggle to rise beyond about $60 a barrel by the end of 2017, even if OPEC extends its supply cuts and global demand continues to improve, as U.S. shale production ramps up.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) are expected to average $57.52 a barrel in 2017, according to a Reuters poll of 31 analysts and economists. The current forecast is slightly lower than the $58.01 forecast in the previous survey. Brent has averaged about $55.73 this year. ""OPEC will extend its deal to limit cumulative supply, probably adjusting the numbers in order to take into account developments about global stock levels and production from non-participating countries,"" Intesa SanPaolo analyst Daniela Corsini said. 
""We expect crude markets will be in deficit in the first three quarters of 2017 and then they could swing into a small surplus in the fourth quarter amid rising non-OPEC supply,"" Corsini added. OPEC has agreed to cut production by around 1.2 million barrels per day in the first half of this year and has so far surprised the market by showing record compliance. The group could cut further in coming months as the biggest laggards - the United Arab Emirates and Iraq - pledge to catch up quickly with their targets.
However, analysts feel a revival in U.S. shale production will keep a lid on any major price recovery. 
U.S. drillers added five oil rigs in the week to Feb. 24, bringing the total count to 602, the most rigs since October 2015, energy services firm  Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI) said on Friday.
""Though the rate of efficiency gains in U.S. shale oil drilling will slow as time progresses, we still expect total production to expand as the number of rigs increase. This will weigh on prices,"" said Capital Economics analyst Caroline Bain. 
""That said, we believe the price of oil will rise gradually through the year to $60 per barrel at the end of 2017, with increased global demand helping to re-balance the market."" 
Crude demand is expected to grow by about 1.3 million bpd in 2017, according to most analysts and this will partially offset the growth in U.S. crude output, thereby rebalancing the market.
Uncertainty surrounding the direction of the U.S. fiscal policy under the administration of President Donald Trump, a stronger dollar, and political uncertainty in countries such as Libya, Nigeria, and Venezuela are also likely to play into the dynamics of the crude oil market this year. 
The poll forecast U.S. light crude (CLc1) will average $55.66 a barrel in 2017 and $60.68 in 2018. WTI has averaged about $53 so far in 2017.

Raymond James had the highest 2017 Brent forecast at $73 per barrel, while Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) had the lowest at $50.

705,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2017 07:24AM ET</span>",China voices disquiet over new EU anti-dumping move on steel,"By Josephine Mason and Foo Yun Chee
BEIJING/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - China expressed concerns on Tuesday over what it said was increasing protectionism after European Union regulators imposed new duties on steel imports from the world's biggest producer.
The European Commission is seeking to protect EU steelmakers while avoiding tensions with Beijing, which it sees as a possible ally against protectionism and climate change.
It imposed definitive anti-dumping duties of between 65.1 percent and 73.7 percent on imports of heavy plate non-alloy or other alloy steel from China on Tuesday, confirming provisional tariffs set in October.
This prompted a statement from China's Commerce Ministry calling on Europe to treat Chinese companies ""fairly and impartially"", adding it was ready to strengthen communication with the EU to tackle issues in the industry. 
The companies named in the Commission's ruling included Nanjing Iron & Steel Co Ltd, Minmetals Yingkou Medium Plate Co Ltd, Wuyang Iron and Steel Co Ltd [WYIAS.UL] and Wuyang New Heavy & Wide Steel Plate Co Ltd.
The EU executive said it acted after an investigation found Chinese companies to be heavily dumping their products on the EU market by selling them at well below half of the price on the producers' home market.
""The Commission has responded forcefully and quickly to unfair competition, while at the same time ensuring that the rights of all interested parties have been protected,"" the Commission said in a statement. 
Eurofer, which represents the European steel sector, said the Commission had found clear evidence of dumping.
""Tens of thousands of steel jobs have been lost in Europe over the past few years, and dumping, particularly demonstrably from China, has been one of the causes,"" it said in a statement.
The EU has strengthened its policy against what it considers unfair competition for its steel industry, and said its new approach had allowed it to decide on trade sanctions more quickly than in the past.
It said on Tuesday it has 41 anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures in place, 18 of which are on products from China.

Also on Tuesday, Europe's second highest court backed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties imposed by the EU nearly four years ago on imports of Chinese solar panels.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2017 06:46AM ET</span>","Oil prices dip, rising U.S. output offsets OPEC cuts","By Sabina Zawadzki
LONDON (Reuters) - Global oil prices dipped on Tuesday but continued to trade in a tight range with the OPEC-led output cuts offset by increasing crude production from the United States.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has so far surprised the market by showing record compliance with oil-output curbs, and could improve in coming months as the biggest laggards - the United Arab Emirates and Iraq - pledge to catch up quickly with their targets.
But while the Nov. 30 agreement to reduce production prompted oil prices to rise $10 a barrel, they have been trading in a narrow $3 range in recent weeks.
Benchmarks Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude oil on Tuesday traded several cents on either side of the previous day's close. By 1130 GMT, Brent was 16 cents lower at $55.77 a barrel while the U.S. benchmark was 9 cents lower at $53.96.
""Oil is well and truly stuck and the falling futures volumes does not indicate that we have much of a bull-bear fight either,"" Saxo Bank head of commodity strategy Ole Hansen said.
""Having failed on a couple of occasions to break higher it is only natural to see it correct lower. I'm looking for a retracement to $55 on Brent and $52.70 on WTI.""
OPEC agreed to curb output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1, the first cut in eight years. 
In addition, 11 non-OPEC oil producers have promised to cut their output - Russia reduced production by 124,000 barrels per day this month compared with October levels, Interfax reported on Tuesday citing a source familiar with the data.
Several analysts noted record high bets on rising Brent and WTI prices, as showed by data from the InterContinental Exchange and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
""Increasingly, the high degree of speculative interest is hanging over oil prices like the sword of Damocles. If financial investors were to unwind their positions, a sharp fall in prices would be on the cards,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note to clients.
Broadly, analysts and economists expect an average 2017 Brent price of 57.52 a barrel, according to a Reuters poll issued on Tuesday.
Oil industry and OPEC country sources told Reuters Saudi Arabia wanted crude prices to rise to $60 a barrel this year, a level it saw as encouraging investments but not spurring a fresh surge in U.S. shale production.
But a report from consultancy Rystad Energy issued earlier this month said the break-even price for U.S. shale oil producers fell last year to an average $35 per barrel.

U.S. producers boosted crude production to over 9 million bpd during the week ended Feb. 17 for the first time since April 2016, according to federal data. U.S. drillers were operating 602 rigs last week, the most since October 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2017 05:21AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco to buy $7 billion stake in Petronas' RAPID refinery project,"By Emily Chow
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Saudi oil giant Aramco will buy an equity stake in Malaysian firm Petronas' major refining and petrochemical project, the companies said on Tuesday, pumping in $7 billion in its biggest downstream investment outside the kingdom.
The deal will boost Aramco's downstream business ahead of a planned initial public offering next year and also bolsters Malaysia's state-controlled Petroliam Nasional Bhd - known as Petronas - after it cut spending because of the slump in oil prices.
In a joint statement, the firms said Aramco will take a 50 percent stake in select ventures and assets in the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project developed by Petronas.
The deal signing was witnessed by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and Saudi King Salman, currently on a state visit to Malaysia - the first in over a decade.
""Malaysia offers tremendous growth opportunities and today's agreement further strengthens Saudi Aramco's position as the leading supplier of petroleum feedstock to Malaysia and Southeast Asia,"" Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said. 
""With RAPID's strategic location in a prolific hub, it would also serve to enhance energy security in the Asia-Pacific region."" 
Petronas' Chief Executive Officer Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin told reporters Aramco will take a 50 percent stake in RAPID's refinery and cracker project.
Aramco will supply up to 70 percent of the crude feedstock requirement of the refinery, with natural gas, power and other utilities to be supplied by Petronas.
""To my knowledge, it is the largest single downstream investment made by Saudi Aramco outside the kingdom,"" said Sadad al-Husseini, a former Aramco executive.
RAPID, part of the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in the southern Malaysian state of Johor, will contain a 300,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery and a petrochemical complex with a production capacity of 7.7 million metric tonnes. The total development cost has been estimated at $27 billion.
Like neighboring Singapore, Malaysia's Pengerang peninsula sits between the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea, through which almost all the Middle East oil and gas bound for northern Asia's industrial powerhouses of China, Japan and South Korea is shipped.
Petronas on Tuesday said almost 60 percent of the PIC development is complete, and that it is on track for refinery start-up in 2019.
NEARLY THREE YEARS IN THE MAKING
Petronas CEO Wan Zulkiflee said the idea for a partnership on RAPID was first mooted in 2014 when he met the then Aramco Chief Executive Khalid al-Falih, now the Saudi energy minister, in Geneva. 
Sources had told Reuters in January that Aramco had pulled back from a planned partnership with Petronas on RAPID over concerns about returns from the project. 
But the deal was back on within a month in time for King Salman's visit to Malaysia. 
""We started negotiations three years ago. There was not any plans to break out of the agreement... From the beginning we came with the intention to stay,"" Aramco CEO Nasser said on Tuesday.
The Aramco investment comes as a relief for Petronas which has cut expenditures in the past year as oil prices have slumped from over $100 a barrel in 2014. In early 2016, Petronas said it would cut spending by up to 50 billion ringgit ($11.27 billion) over the next four years. Dividends to the government coffers have also been slashed. 
Saudi Energy Minister Falih echoed Nasser's comments, saying Saudi Arabia would use the Malaysian investment as a platform to other investments in southeast Asia. 

""We will encourage the private sector of Saudi Arabia to come and look at Malaysia as an investment for its own market and also to address the needs for the broader region,"" he said.

The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude April contract shed 5 cents, or around 0.1%, to $54.00 a barrel by 4:20AM ET (09:20GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for May delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 2 cents to $56.40 a barrel.
Oil prices have been trading in a narrow $5 range around the mid-$50s over the past two months as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers and expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production.
Data from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes revealed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by five last week, the sixth weekly increase in a row.
That brought the total count to 602, the most since October 2015, raising concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
Hedge funds extended their bullish bets on oil to an all-time high last week as OPEC and non-OPEC countries made a strong start to lowering their oil output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day by the end of June, with compliance currently at around 90%.
OPEC could extend its oil supply-reduction pact with non-members or even apply deeper cuts from July if global crude inventories fail to drop to a targeted level, OPEC sources said earlier this month.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for April shed 0.2 cents, or around 0.2%, to $1.738 a gallon, while March heating oil dipped 0.2 cents to $1.645 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for April delivery slumped 1.9 cents, or almost 0.7%, to $2.674 per million British thermal units.

Comex gold futures dipped $5.95, or about 0.5%, to $1,252.85 a troy ounce by 3:30AM ET (08:30GMT), pulling away from the prior session's high of $1,264.90, a level not seen since November 10.
Spot gold was steady at $1,252.30 per ounce. The metal hit its highest since November at $1,263.95 on Monday.
President Donald Trump will make his first major address to Congress on Tuesday at 9:00PM ET (02:00GMT Wednesday), with investors hoping he will shed light on his economic agenda, most notably tax reform.
Beyond tax reform, investors will be eager to learn more about Trump's plans for repealing the Affordable Care Act, reducing regulations on businesses and increasing infrastructure spending.
Ahead of his speech in Congress, Trump will appear on Fox News at 6:00AM ET (11:00GMT). Some market commentators believe Trump might preempt his speech by announcing part of his plans.
White House budget officials told reporters Monday that Trump's first budget will call for a $54 billion increase in defense spending and a corresponding cut in what his administration deems lower priority programs.
Besides Trump, markets Tuesday will get plenty of economic data, including a second reading on fourth quarter GDP at 8:30AM ET (13:30GMT). There is S&P/Case-Shiller home price data at 9AM ET and Chicago PMI at 9:45AM ET. At 10AM ET, consumer confidence is released.
A recent string of solid data reinforced the view that the U.S. economy is sufficiently robust to warrant higher interest rates in the months ahead.
Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan, who is a voting member on the central bank's rate-setting committee this year, on Monday repeated his view that it would be prudent for the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates sooner rather than later.
Investors raised their outlook on a faster pace of U.S. rate increases following his comments.
Fed fund futures priced in about a 30% chance of a rate hike in March, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Odds of a May increase was seen at 53%, while June odds were at around 73%.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 101.10 in London morning trade.
Treasury yields were little changed, with the U.S. 10-Year bond at around 2.358%.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for May delivery dipped 7.4 cents, or 0.4%, to $18.34 a troy ounce after reaching $18.54 earlier, the highest since November 11.
Meanwhile, platinum was down 0.7% to $1,031.65, while palladium was firm at $786.20 an ounce.

LONDON (Reuters) - For every buyer of futures and options there must be a seller. For every long position there must be a corresponding short position.
Hedge funds and other money managers have purchased a record number of futures and options contracts linked to Brent and WTI, betting that prices will rise.
As a group, hedge funds now hold a record net long position equivalent to 951 million barrels across the three main Brent and WTI contracts (http://tmsnrt.rs/2mm1HeI).
Hedge fund long positions outnumber short positions by a record ratio of 10.3:1 (http://tmsnrt.rs/2mvnvBA).
With hedge funds almost all long, some other group of traders must have sold a correspondingly large number of futures and options contracts, either as a hedge or betting prices will fall.
OIL TRADERS
Since September 2009, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has employed a four-way classification for all traders with reportable positions in crude oil.
Traders are classed as a producer/merchant/processor/user, a swap dealer, a money manager, or into a miscellaneous ""other reporting"" category.
Traders with positions less than 350,000 barrels do not have to report them but they show up as a residual ""non-reporting"" category.
The classification is discussed on the commission's website (""Disaggregated commitments of traders report: explanatory notes"", CFTC, undated).
If a trader's market activities span more than one category, the commission makes a judgment about their predominant activity, and all trades are then classed in this category.
Unfortunately, the commission does not disclose how individual traders are classified, which creates considerable uncertainty about the composition of the categories.
For example, if a major oil company hedges its inventory as well as providing price risk management services to customers, we don't know whether its trades are classified as producer/merchant/processor/user or as a swap dealer.
NYMEX WTI
On Feb. 21, hedge funds and other money managers held a net long position in WTI on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) equivalent to 414 million barrels, according to CFTC data.
""Other reporting"" traders also held a net long position of 173 million barrels while non-reporting traders were net long by 15 million barrels.
The corresponding short positions were held by producer/merchant/processor/users, with a net short position of 291 million barrels, and swap dealers, with a net short of 310 million barrels.
As hedge funds have increased their net long positions in WTI, the majority of the contracts have been sold to them by swap dealers (http://tmsnrt.rs/2mlWLGN).
Hedge funds and other money managers have increased their net long position in WTI by 254 million barrels since early November.
Swap dealers increased their net short position by 202 million barrels over the same period (with the balance of extra short positions coming from producer/merchant/processor/users).
Hedge fund positions in WTI are more closely correlated with swap dealers than with any other category of traders.
The CFTC defines swap dealers as any ""entity that deals primarily in swaps for a commodity and uses the futures markets to manage or hedge the risk associated with those swaps transactions"".
According to the commission, ""the swap dealer's counterparties may be speculative traders, like hedge funds, or traditional commercial clients that are managing risk arising from their dealings in the physical commodity"".
Swap dealers function as market makers and intermediaries and may assume positions on their own account or act as intermediaries for other traders.
Swap dealers (or their clients) have been eager sellers of futures and options linked to WTI because as hedge funds have accumulated a record position prices have scarcely risen since mid-December.
ICE BRENT
Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) employs a similar four-way classification for trades in its Brent and other commodity contracts listed in London.
But although ICE employs the same criteria there is no guarantee that individual classifications by ICE and the CFTC are the same because the CFTC does not disclose how individual traders are categorized.
The positioning of traders is very different in Brent, which may reflect differences in the structure of the market, or inconsistencies in classification.
On Feb. 21, hedge funds and other money managers held a net long position in ICE Brent futures and options equivalent to 508 million barrels.
Swap dealers also held a very large net long position amounting to 428 million barrels in Brent, according to records published by ICE, which contrasts with their large short position in WTI.
In Brent, the corresponding short positions all came from producer/merchant/processor/users with a net short position of 790 million barrels (http://tmsnrt.rs/2mvw1jS).
Hedge funds have boosted their net long position in Brent by 241 million barrels since Nov. 8, with most of this supplied by an increase in producer/merchant/processor/user short positions of 193 million barrels.
Swap dealers have also cut their net long position in Brent by 66 million barrels since early November, but this has supplied only a small part of the hedge fund long positions.
Despite the differences between the commitments of traders in the two markets, hedge fund buyers of Brent have found plenty of willing sellers, with prices barely changing for the last two months.
TWO-WAY MARKET
Not much is known about the identity and motivation of the short sellers, other than that have been willing to sell large numbers of extra futures and options contracts at Brent and WTI prices just over $50 per barrel.
Some of them, especially in WTI, are likely to be U.S. shale oil producers keen to hedge their production for 2017 and 2018 and lock in revenues in case prices slump again.
Some could be hedging inventories, though in theory the demand for inventory hedging should be declining as crude stocks fall.
Some could be outright shorts with a more bearish view on the outlook for oil prices than hedge fund managers and willing to take the other side of the trade.
And some could simply be making a market for their hedge fund clients by willing to sell futures and options to them on demand.
While we know very little about the identity of the shorts, their motivations could be crucial, because at some stage the hedge funds will want to take profits and liquidate some of their record long position.
At that point, the readiness of the short sellers to buy back these futures and options will make a big difference to how that liquidation occurs.
There has been a good two-way market for the last two months which has kept prices trading in a narrow range despite a large number of futures and options changing hands.
The critical question is whether that liquidity will remain high in the months ahead or evaporate, which could lead to either a spike in prices or a sharp drop when some of the trades are closed out.

717,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2017 08:50AM ET</span>","Litasco CEO sees oil range-bound in 2017, looks to expand","By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Julia Payne
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices are likely to stay in a tight range between $50 and $60 a barrel this year as a recovery in U.S. shale output counterbalances the OPEC supply cut deal to reduce the global glut, Litasco Chief Executive Tim Bullock said in an interview.
A lack of volatility means trading houses will no longer have the extra boost as in the last two years following the 2014 oil price crash, said Bullock, a  BP  (LON:BP) trading veteran who has run Litasco - one of the world's largest traders and part of Russian oil major LUKOIL (MM:LKOH) - since 2012.
""2016 was good but it got tougher towards the end. There was less volatility and less structure ... so that made it more difficult to make money. 2017 looks like an extension of that,"" Bullock said.
""You will probably see the creation of a new reasonably tight trading range ... with the OPEC cuts and the supply and demand coming into line... It's difficult to see Brent going much below $50 per barrel and with shale and everything lining up on the other side, it's difficult to see it going much above $60 per barrel.""
Bullock also said he saw little chance for spread betting between U.S. WTI and Europe's Brent futures contracts to pick up steam as it did during previous years of relatively low oil price volatility in 2012-2013.
""Now with U.S. exports, the whole system is much more linked together. It should correct itself faster - so there won't be as much opportunity but also not as much risk,"" he said.
Set up in 2000 as the trading arm of LUKOIL, Swiss-based Litasco focuses on selling its parent's crude and products worldwide, serving its refineries in Italy, the Netherlands, Romania and Bulgaria and adding value through trading.
""We're more like a BP or a Shell (LON:RDSa). We have a system. Our job number 1 is to serve the system, and make sure we get the best price we can for the crude and products we sell and keep the refineries wet. We're quite European centric generally,"" Bullock said.
However, third party contracts have increased substantially over the past few years as Litasco's footprint expanded into the United States, Asia and Africa.
Bullock said traded volumes grew slightly in 2016 from 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2015 with the split between group volumes and third party barrels remaining about 50-50.
Its parent LUKOIL produces around 2.4 million barrels per day, from fields in Russia, Iraq and the former Soviet Union.
Litasco is looking to expand globally with particular interest in West Africa and the United States.
""Basically if you want to be involved in West Africa then you have to be in Nigeria. So we've been trying to grow our business there over the last few years,"" Bullock said.
Litasco secured a 2017 crude contract in Nigeria where it also delivers refined products.
""You start looking at Ghana, Ivory Coast, Angola ... that's the big block that you want to be in. We'd love to get more involved in Angola, finding the right deal is always a challenge.""
Litasco traditionally played a strong role in the north African market thanks to its ISAB refinery in Italy. It imports crude from North Africa and supplies products to countries such as Egypt.
The Mediterranean market has become one of the most oversupplied in the last year with rising Kazakh output but Bullock does not see it remaining dislocated for long, saying the glut would encourage West African or Mid-Eastern barrels to travel elsewhere instead of Europe.
In the United States, Bullock said expansion was possible thanks to the huge size of the market and a ""dis-intermediated"" value chain, where a company can pick and choose how deeply involved it wants to be.
""We have a strong position in gasoline blending in the (U.S.) Gulf. I think that's something we expect to be in for the medium term,"" Bullock added. ""In Asia, there are more integrated companies who have got the whole chain, it's difficult to get into the business you want to be in.""

U.S. natural gas for April delivery dropped 10.6 cents, or around 3.8% to $2.681 per million British thermal units by 8:15AM ET (13:15GMT) after being down by nearly 5% earlier. Futures touched a three-and-a-half-month low of $2.522 last Wednesday.
Prices of the heating fuel dropped 7% last week, taking its losses for the year to a whopping 30% amid forecasts for warm winter weather.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 1 and 10 billion cubic feet in the week ended February 24.
That compares with a withdrawal of 89 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 48 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 132 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.356 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2.5% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 6.6% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

Hedge funds extended their bullish bets on oil to an all-time high last week as OPEC and non-OPEC countries made a strong start to lowering their oil output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day by the end of June, with compliance currently at around 90%.
OPEC could extend its oil supply-reduction pact with non-members or even apply deeper cuts from July if global crude inventories fail to drop to a targeted level, OPEC sources said earlier this month.
Concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand limited gains.
Data from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes on Friday revealed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by five last week, the sixth weekly increase in a row. That brought the total count to 602, the most since October 2015.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Thursday that crude supplies rose by 564,000 barrels last week to yet another all-time high, feeding concerns about a global glut.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2017 06:30PM ET</span>",Funds prepare $2 billion oil market play as supply tightens,"By Catherine Ngai
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Passive investment funds are poised to shift an estimated $2 billion from far-term to near-term crude futures over the next week, anticipating an energy market rally as a historic OPEC output cut slashes supply.
The switch may foreshadow the end of a global oil glut that built up during a two-year price war.
On Friday - for the first time in six years - a rule in one of the most popular commodity market indices was triggered, requiring funds tracking the index to sell Brent crude futures contracts for December  and to buy contracts for June . 
The S&P GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index rule aims to ensure that investors are positioned to cash in when oil market fundamentals change - in this case, when supply becomes so tight that the current price of oil becomes higher than the price of oil for delivery many months or years into the future. That structure is called backwardation.
When markets are oversupplied, the opposite is true: It is cheaper to buy crude now than to buy it for delivery later. That structure is called contango.
An S&P bulletin late Friday confirmed the rule had been triggered for Brent contracts. It stipulates that the funds must bring their money forward if the second and third month contract settles at a difference of less than 0.5 percent on the third to the last day of any given trading month.
On Friday, the Brent May contract  price settled at $56.31 a barrel, while the June  price settled at $56.55 a barrel. That would make the difference about 0.4 percent. 
The threshold was not breached for West Texas Intermediate crude.
Investors will need to start the shift on March 1 and complete it over the next five business days, moving 20 percent of their money each day. Two traders with knowledge of the indices told Reuters that they estimated that rule impacts between 35,000 and 45,000 Brent contracts.
Each contract represents 1,000 barrels. So if those predictions prove true, about 40 million barrels - worth about $2 billion - will change hands.
""This is just another reason to be very bullish"" about oil prices, said one trader involved with the deals, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
OPEC IMPACT
When the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC producers agreed in November to cut output, they wanted to stem a flood of supply that had left the contango so deep that traders found it profitable to buy crude and store it for sale later. 
That dynamic pushed worldwide inventories to record levels and helped drive oil prices to multi-year lows. 
OPEC's output cut, however, has tightened supply and narrowed contango, prompting traders from the United States to Asia to start selling oil from more expensive storage facilities because the contango is no longer enough for them to make a profit by holding oil.
If contango narrows further, tens of millions more barrels could flood out of storage. 
That could put downward pressure on prices in the short term, but the move to unleash stored oil is viewed by analysts as a first step toward rebalancing global markets after a period of oversupply.
The fast flow of capital into front-month contracts will make it uneconomical for traders to store physical barrels, said Michael Tran, director of energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets. 
""The unintended consequence"" of the trading shift, he added, ""is helping OPEC in its objective to draw barrels from storage."" 
It's not clear exactly how much money is managed by firms that benchmark off the indices, but exchange-traded funds linked to them, such as the iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust (GSG), have more than $1.1 billion in assets, according to ETF Securities LLC.
STORAGE PLAY THREATENED
Since the OPEC output cut, the spread between the front month and second month Brent contracts  has tightened to as little as 5 cents from 79 cents. June and December contracts  traded near parity on Friday.
To make money by holding crude, the spread between oil prices for future months needs to be wide enough to cover the cost of leasing tank space and borrowing the money to buy the fuel to fill it. 
For the last two years, U.S. traders have rushed to that opportunity as those price spreads widened. Now, they may be forced to rush out of it.

""When there's a shortage, there's no value to storage. So, there's a premium put on having the oil right now,"" said Jodie Gunzberg, global head of commodities and real assets at S&P Dow Jones Indices. ""That's where you want to be sitting up front in the near contract.""

725,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2017 01:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Algeria's Sonatrach in talks to begin offshore drilling - source,"By Lamine Chikhi
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria's Sonatrach wants to start offshore oil drilling and has begun discussions with U.S. operators  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and Anadarko (N:APC) as well as Italy's Eni (MI:ENI), a source at the state energy company told Reuters on Sunday. 
The North African OPEC member nation has struggled to attract oil investment in recent years because of tough terms that have made foreign companies wary. 
Sonatrach last year began a more flexible approach to bilateral talks with foreign partners.
Low oil prices have also pressured Sonatrach, prompting it to focus on developing production at more mature fields in the southern Sahara and bringing online delayed gas projects. Offshore drilling could offer another area for growth.
""Seismic operations carried out by Sonatrach have shown an interesting potential in the areas including Bejaia and Oran,"" said the source, who asked not to be identified. Bejaia is an eastern port and Oran is a port city in western Algeria.
Algeria needs the know-how and expertise of major international firms to launch offshore drilling, the source said.
""Foreign partners, including Anadarko, Exxon Mobil and Eni were invited by Sonatrach to provide technical assistance given the experience they acquired in the Gulf of Mexico and deep water in Mozambique,"" the Sonatrach source said.
""The offshore is complementary to our operations in the south. It will also contribute to boosting our output,"" the source said.
The source did not give any information on the timing or scale of any offshore projects.
Such details, including when the drilling will start, are expected to be announced soon by Sonatrach's leadership, the source said.
Algeria's earnings from oil and gas fell to $27.5 billion in 2016 from $35.7 billion in 2015 and more than $60 billion in 2014.

Algeria's oil output was previously estimated at 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) but it has cut production by 50,000 bpd under an agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC producers aimed at raising crude prices.

""I think there are some regulations that in the near-term need to be rolled back in a very aggressive way. And I think maybe next week you may be hearing about some of those,"" EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told the Conservative Political Action summit in Washington DC.
Pruitt added the EPA's focus on combating climate change under former President Barack Obama had cost jobs and prevented economic growth, leading many Americans to want to see the EPA eliminated completely.
""I think its justified,"" he said. ""I think people across this country look at the EPA much like they look at the IRS. I hope to be able to change that."" 
Pruitt was confirmed as EPA head last week. His appointment triggered an uproar among Democratic lawmakers and environmental advocates worried that he will gut the agency and re-open the doors to heavy industrial pollution. He sued the EPA more than a dozen times as his states' top attorney and has repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change. 
But his rise to the head of the EPA has also cheered many Republicans and business interests that expect him to cut back red tape they believe has hampered the economy.
Trump campaigned on a promise to slash regulation to revive the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries.
PUDDLES AND DRY CREEK BEDS
Pruitt mentioned three rules ushered in by Obama that could meet the chopping block early on: the Waters of the U.S. rule outlining waterways that have federal protections; the Clean Power Plan requiring states to cut carbon emissions; and the U.S. Methane rule limiting emissions from oil and gas installations on federal land.
A Trump official told Reuters late Friday that the president was expected to sign a measure as early as Tuesday aimed at rescinding the Waters of the U.S. rule.
Pruitt said in his comments to the CPAC summit that rule had ""made puddles and dry creek beds across this country subject to the jurisdiction of Washington DC. That's going to change.""
He also suggested longer-term structural changes were in store at the EPA. 
""Long-term, asking the question on how that agency partners with the states and how that affects the budget and how it effects the structure is something to work on very diligently,"" Pruitt said.

Like Trump, he said cutting regulation could be done in a way that does not harm water or air quality.

CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - Opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline who were pushed out of their protest camp this week have vowed to keep up efforts to stop the multibillion-dollar project and take the fight to other pipelines as well.
The Oceti Sakowin camp in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, was cleared by law enforcement on Thursday and almost 50 people, many of them Native Americans and environmental activists, were arrested.
The number of demonstrators had dwindled from the thousands who poured into the camp starting in August to oppose the pipeline that critics say threatens the water resources and sacred land of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The tribe has said it intends to fight the pipeline in court.
The 1,170-mile (1,885 km) line, built by Energy Transfer Partners LP, will move crude from the shale oilfields of North Dakota to Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico, where many U.S. refineries are located.
Tonya Olsen, 46, an Ihanktonwan Sioux from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, who had lived at the camp for 3-1/2 months, said she was saddened by the eviction but proud of the protesters.
She has moved to another nearby camp on Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation land, across the Cannon Ball River.
""A lot of people will take what they've learned from this movement and take it to another one,"" Olsen said. She may join a protest if one forms against the Keystone XL pipeline near the Lower Brulé Sioux Reservation in South Dakota, she added. 
Tom Goldtooth, a protest leader and executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, said the demonstrators' hearts were not defeated.
""The closing of the camp is not the end of a movement or fight, it is a new beginning,"" Goldtooth said in a statement on Thursday. ""They cannot extinguish the fire that Standing Rock started.""
Many hope their fight against the project will spur similar protests targeting pipelines across the United States and Canada, particularly those routed near Native American land. 
""The embers are going to be carried all over the place,"" said Forest Borie, 34, a protester from Tijuana, Mexico, who spent four months in North Dakota. 
""This is going to be a revolutionary year,"" he added.
NEXT TARGETS 
Borie wants to go next to Canada to help the Unist'ot'en Native American Tribe in their long-running opposition to pipelines in British Columbia.
Energy Transfer Partners, the Dallas-based company constructing the Dakota Access pipeline, is already facing pushback from a diverse base of opposition in Louisiana, where it is planning to expand its Bayou Bridge pipeline.
Other projects mentioned by protesters as possible next stops include the Sabal Trail pipeline being built to transport natural gas from eastern Alabama to central Florida, and Energy Transfer Partners' Trans-Pecos in West Texas. Sabal Trail is a joint project of  Spectra Energy  Corp (NYSE:SE),  NextEra Energy Inc  (NYSE:NEE) and  Duke Energy  Corp (NYSE:DUK).
Another protest is focused on Plains All American Pipeline's Diamond Pipeline, which will run from Cushing, Oklahoma, to  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO) Corp's Memphis refinery in Tennessee. 
Anthony Gazotti, 47, from Denver, said he will stay on reservation land until he is forced out. Despite construction resuming on the Dakota pipeline, he said the protest was a success because it had raised awareness of pipeline issues nationwide.
""It's never been about just stopping that pipeline,"" he said.
June Sapiel, a 47-year-old member of the Penobscot Tribe in Penobscot, Maine, also rejected the idea that the protesters in North Dakota had failed. 

""It's waking people up,"" she said in front of a friend's yurt where she has been staying. ""We're going to go out there and just keep doing it.""

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude futures for April delivery slid 0.83% to settle at $53.99 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent lost 59 cents to settle at 55.99 a barrel. Despite the slump on Friday, crude ends the week 1.1% higher.
On Friday, oilfield service firm Baker Hughes reported its weekly count of U.S. oil rigs rose by 5 and topped 600 for the first time since October, 2015, which added to concerns that record U.S. crude production may curtail OPEC's effort to drain excess supply in the industry.
Speaking at the International Petroleum Week conference in London last week, OPEC Secretary General, Mohammed Barkindo estimated that OPEC member states are about 90% in compliance with a global pact to cut production and noted the willingness of non-OPEC members to comply with the deal.
In November last year, OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in an effort to combat the oversupply issue that has pressured prices over the last two years.
The rise in U.S. oil rigs came against a bullish report on crude inventories, released a day earlier, as the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said that crude oil inventories rose by only 0.564 million compared to estimates of an increase of 3.745 million barrels.

LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC has so far surprised the market by showing record compliance with oil-output curbs and could do so further in coming months as the biggest laggards - the United Arab Emirates and Iraq - pledge to catch up quickly with their targets.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has pledged to curb its production by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1, the first cut in eight years, to boost prices and get rid of a supply glut.
Compliance with output restrictions has often been problematic in OPEC's history but this time the group has delivered reductions amounting to as much as 90 percent of the target in the first month alone.
That prompted the International Energy Agency (IEA) to call it one of the deepest cuts on record.
Iraq and the UAE have delivered smaller portions of their pledged reductions, based on their own figures and OPEC production estimates by government agencies, consultants and industry media.
Still, officials and industry sources say the UAE will try to move closer to its OPEC target in coming months, improving average compliance during the six-month duration of the supply cut rather than focusing on month-by-month performance.
""The UAE is fully committed to the OPEC cuts and is undertaking the necessary measures that will ensure it is fully compliant over the six-month period with the OPEC agreement,"" the UAE's OPEC governor, Ahmed Al Kaabi, told Reuters in a statement.
The UAE, among the core Gulf OPEC group that traditionally shows high compliance with output agreements, has focused on expanding its production capacity in the last few years, rather than on limiting output. 
It doubled the capacity of its Ruwais refinery last year to more than 800,000 barrels per day to feed rising domestic demand.
Oilfield maintenance could also help to push compliance higher. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co has work planned at fields producing Murban and Das light crude in March and May, people familiar with the matter said.
OPEC's average compliance is put by the IEA at a record 90 percent in January, and based on a Reuters average of production surveys it stands at 88 percent. 
Top exporter Saudi Arabia cut production by even more than called for in the OPEC deal, helping to push compliance higher, according to its own figures and those of independent analysts.
IRAQ 'RESPECTS' OPEC COMMITMENT
The UAE and Iraq's own figures suggest they have further to go than other big OPEC producers to reach targeted output.
According to data the countries reported to OPEC, while both cut production substantially in January, they did so from higher levels than the supply baselines used in the agreement, meaning that technically they are not complying at all.
Iraq had initially been reluctant to limit supply. In negotiations last year on the supply cut, Iraq argued that it should be exempt due to a need for cash to fight Islamic State militants.
Baghdad also pushed to be allowed to cut production from a higher level than estimated by the secondary sources OPEC uses to monitor its output. Eventually, to get a deal, it accepted a cut from a lower baseline.
Iraq's OPEC peers are privately urging Baghdad to make further reductions, sources say, and there are indications compliance may at least not worsen. Partial export figures for February suggest no increase in shipments, and March allocations were reduced sharply.
""Iraq's allocations in March are low due to OPEC cuts, mainly,"" a source familiar with the matter said. ""Iraq respects its commitment.""
The table below is based on OPEC production in January as estimated by OPEC secondary sources, OPEC members themselves, news agencies Reuters and Bloomberg and bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
OPEC's six secondary sources are oil-pricing agencies Platts and Argus, ‎the IEA, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates and industry newsletter Petroleum Intelligence Weekly.

U.S. crude futures for April delivery were down 0.84% at $53.99 a barrel, off Thursday’s eight-week high of $54.94.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday after U.S. crude inventories rose for a seventh week, showing the market is still struggling to ease oversupply despite many producers' efforts to rein in output.
U.S. crude stocks  rose by 564,000 barrels in the week to Feb. 17, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), although the gain was below analysts' expectations for an increase of 3.5 million barrels. [EIA/S]
The continued rise in U.S. inventories comes as members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers have cut output.
Their joint compliance with a production-reduction deal reached at the end of last year was around 86 percent in January, according to OPEC sources quoting results from a technical committee meeting held this week.
The United States, which is not part of the deal, continues to ramp up production. Analysts at ING said they expected U.S. output to keep rising as prices remained strong enough to encourage further drilling.
Benchmark Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was down 48 cents at $56.10 a barrel at 0908 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (CLc1) traded at $54.06 a barrel, down 39 cents.
""Prices continue to retreat on repeated failure to rise above the upper end of their trading ranges and yesterday's inventory data also weighs,"" said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt.
However, signs have started to emerge that traders are depleting storage levels, beefed up while oil prices were weak.
In the United States, traders are draining the priciest storage tanks as strengthening markets make it unprofitable to store for future sale and cuts in global production open export opportunities. 
""Current oil prices are neither sustainable for OPEC or the industry,"" AB Bernstein said in a note. ""As such, inventories will have to fall, which we expect will be clearer in the spring after the seasonal build.""
In Asia, traders are selling oil held in tankers anchored off Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. 

More than 12 million barrels of oil has been taken out of storage in tankers berthed off Southeast Asian countries this month, shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2017 04:40AM ET</span>",Oil futures suggest bullish funds' big bet on price may pay off,"By Amanda Cooper
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil investors have placed the biggest bet in history that prices will rise, as the world's largest exporters cut output to reduce a glut in supply, and the futures market is suggesting for the first time in a year that they could be onto a winner.
Fund managers now hold more Brent oil futures and options contracts than at any time on record, equivalent to some 480 million barrels of oil and nearly double the amount held just two months ago.
The pace of the increase in the benchmark April Brent futures contract (LCOc1) price in that time hasn't been as intense. The price is some 15 percent higher, around $57 a barrel, but for the first time since April last year this front-month contract is on the verge of trading above the price of longer-dated futures.
This phenomenon, known as backwardation, only tends to take place when investors and traders expect prompt demand for oil to improve to the point where it overtakes supply.
Total world demand averaged 97.3 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2016, while supply was running at 97.9 million bpd, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
""We estimate that the physical oil market is now in deficit, and that oil inventory levels should be falling,"" Investec Asset Management portfolio manager Tom Nelson, who helps manage a part of the company's $114 billion in assets. 
""With approximately $1 trillion of lost investment through the recent downward trend and more constrained access to capital, we expect oil markets to remain structurally tighter for several years, suggesting a more positive period for oil prices,"" he said. 
For almost three years the world has been awash with billions of barrels of unwanted oil, after the explosion in U.S. shale production and OPEC's strategy of producing as much crude as possible to drive out less profitable rivals.
But the agreement in late November between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some of its competitors such as Russia to cut oil output by up to 1.2 million barrels per day in the first half of this year, and possibly beyond, has pushed benchmark Brent futures near 18-month highs.
The Brent April contract now commands a premium of $1.50 over the December 2018 contract  and is within a few cents of trading above the second-position May contract , something which has not happened in nearly a year, aside from contract-expiry days when these price gaps can fluctuate.
BET BIG AND THE REST WILL FOLLOW
With the cutting of production by OPEC, a major supplier to the ever-hungry Asian refineries, exports of crude from the North Sea hit a record of over 10 million barrels in January, and although West African exports eased that month, they held within sight of 17-month highs.
When the market is in contango and near-dated prices are below those for future delivery, it becomes profitable to store oil, rather than sell it on the spot market. When this structure inverts into backwardation, stocks of oil are more likely to find their way into the market as their owners can achieve a higher selling price.
Crude inventories held in the world's richest nations are still high, but they have begun to drain, according to the IEA, which said stocks fell below the 3-billion barrel mark in December for the first time in a year. [IEA/M]
""It does clearly show the market is seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,"" Saxo Bank senior manager Ole Hansen said.
""U.S. production increases are unlikely to outweigh cuts that we're seeing from OPEC and then adding expectations for a continued strong rise in global demand we have a market that is moving toward balance, but it is going to be uneven.""
The funds are betting that OPEC and its allies will be successful in forcing oil out of storage, although with crude demand growth expected to moderate to around 1.4 million bpd this year, from 1.6 million bpd in 2016, and non-OPEC production, including U.S. shale, picking up rapidly, it is far from a done deal.
Considering some of the headwinds, it's not so much the size of the total position that bothers some market watchers, but rather the percentage of all Brent futures and options that are concentrated in investors' hands, rather than those of traders or producers and consumers.
Investors now hold a record 17 percent of the total 2.85 million lots of Brent futures and options <3ICELCOOI>, each equivalent to 1,000 barrels of oil, compared with a historical average of closer to 9 percent.
Consultant JBC Energy is less optimistic on the outlook for inventories and estimates stocks will continue to build.

""In other words, the longs out there better believe that OPEC/non-OPEC alliance will continue the cuts through the second half as well if they want to avoid a rude awakening,"" JBC said in a note.

Late Wednesday, the minutes of the Fed’s January policy meeting showed that policymakers thought it may be appropriate to raise interest rates again ""fairly soon.""
However, the minutes also revealed the central bank’s uncertainty over the lack of clarity of the Trump administration's economic program, dampening demand for the greenback.
The dollar was also weighed by a report by the U.S. Department of Labor on Thursday showing that initial jobless claims increased by 6,000 to 244,000 last week. Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 2,000 to 241,000.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 100.94, just off Thursday’s three-day low of 100.86.
A weaker U.S. dollar usually supports gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
The precious metal was also supported by ongoing political uncertainty in Europe and the U.S.

January's volume accounted for almost 20 percent of the latest U.N. annual sales quota of 7.5 million tonnes or $400.9 million, whichever is smaller, on North Korea's biggest export.
The imports came before Beijing's decision on Saturday to ban coal shipments entirely after Pyongyang tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile in its first direct challenge to the international community since U.S. President Donald Trump took office. 
North Korea was China's biggest supplier last year of high-grade anthracite coal, used mainly by the country's steel mills, with imports reaching 22.4 million tonnes, up 14.5 percent compared with 2015.
Analysts have said steel mills will likely be forced to buy more expensive domestic anthracite or seek alternatives further afield from Russia or Australia, driving up costs.

740,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2017 01:20AM ET</span>",Traders drain pricey U.S. oil storage as OPEC deal bites,"By Catherine Ngai and Liz Hampton
NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Traders are turning the spigots to drain the priciest storage tanks holding U.S. crude stockpiles as strengthening markets make it unprofitable to store for future sale and cuts in global production open export opportunities.
That could signal the beginning of the end for a two-year trade play that came about during an international price war and global oil glut. It is also what the world's largest oil exporters wanted to see when they agreed last year to work together in a historic supply cut to end the glut.
From Houston through Louisiana to floating storage in the Gulf of Mexico, traders are starting to ship crude out of inventories as the rising price of oil for near-term delivery erodes the profits to be had by holding onto oil for later sale.
To be sure, shipments from storage have so far made only a small dent in record U.S. crude inventories. But if prompt oil prices continue to strengthen, more storage will empty out.
""Right now, traders aren't incentivized (to store),"" said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research at Morningstar. 
""It won't all stampede out of the gate, but inventory levels will come down. What will happen is that some of it will go to refineries, but a fair amount will be exported too.""
To make money by holding crude, the spread between oil prices for future months needs to be wide enough to cover the cost of leasing tank space and borrowing the money to buy the fuel to fill it. For the last two years, U.S. traders have rushed to that opportunity as those price spreads widened.
Since November, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC producers agreed to cut output, the spread, or discount of prompt barrels to later supplies known as a contango, between the front and second month U.S. benchmark  crude price has narrowed to as little as 26 cents from 95 cents a barrel. That is no longer enough to cover the more expensive storage options, traders said.
In the Houston area, traders that took out storage at the height of capacity issues in 2015 at around $1.20 a barrel are finding it no longer economical. 
In the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), the only deep-water U.S. oil port and a major conduit for the country’s crude oil imports, drawdowns have been reflected in the costs of storing oil, traders said.
The futures contract for oil storage there  has fallen to around 40 cents per barrel, down about half in a month and still double the difference between front- and second-month crude prices.
One of the most expensive storage options is to hold oil on tankers at sea. During the massive build up in inventory through 2015 and 2016, even some of that was profitable. 
Floating storage is now falling. In the U.S. Gulf, crude in offshore tankers fell to 26 million barrels last week from 35 million barrels a month ago, according to data provider ClipperData.
Not all of that crude was considered to be held in floating storage. Some of it may have simply been waiting to discharge.
The largest, and typically cheapest, U.S. storage facility is in Cushing, Oklahoma, which is also the delivery point for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures contract (CLc1), one of the world's two most important benchmarks for oil prices.Even at Cushing, market participants are emptying storage. Stocks have fallen on average by more than 600,000 barrels per week since the end of 2016, and analysts expect another two to three million barrels to empty out in March.
The going rate for putting oil in tanks in Cushing is around 35-50 cents per barrel per month, though some secured cheaper space still considered profitable before the oil price rout began in mid-2014. 
Even as traders sell from the pricier storage tanks, total inventories in the United States have reached a record level. [EIA/S]
That build up is likely due to high imports that were booked before the OPEC production cut, traders and analysts said. It takes around six week for crude from the Middle East to make its way to the United States, and further shipments should fall in coming weeks.
""There is unlikely to be much more of a tail to the increased flow from the Middle East into the U.S.,"" Paul Horsnell, global head of commodities research at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN), said in a note.
Stocks have also built because refineries are piling up inventories during their seasonal maintenance periods. As they return ahead of summer demand season, inventory builds should reverse. 
Record exports of U.S. crude in February and March, particularly to Asia, are also expected to boost prices and encourage shipments from storage.
Exports from the United States hit a record high of 1.22 million barrels per day (bpd) last week and domestic production rose to above 9 million bpd, the highest since April, the U.S. Energy Administration Agency said.

""With those two together, the U.S. is becoming an export juggernaut,"" said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital.

CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - Dozens of armed law enforcement officials swept through a protest camp near the site of the Dakota Access pipeline Thursday, clearing the camp that for months served as a base of opposition to the multi-billion dollar project. 
About 50 police in riot gear, aided by National Guardsmen, moved slowly through the camp in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, checking structures for any of the several dozen protesters who had stayed beyond the Wednesday deadline to evacuate. 
The Oceti Sakowin Camp was completely vacated shortly after 2:00 p.m. CST, the Morton County Sheriff's Department said in a statement. Forty-seven people were arrested on Thursday, said Maxine Herr, spokeswoman for the department. 
About a dozen Humvee vehicles entered the camp at around 12:30 p.m. CST and a helicopter flew low overhead, with more police officers and National Guard members stationed outside the site.
Around 200 law enforcement officials from North Dakota, Indiana, Wisconsin and Alabama took part in the operation, Herr said.
""Things went very smoothly. We are very happy with the operations,"" she said.
Members of the Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the land where the camp was built, also began entering the site for cleanup efforts. By Thursday afternoon, heavy equipment was being used to tear down structures at the site. 
""It's really hard being here right now but we know we need to be here because we know that they are wrong and we are right,"" said Raymond  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF), 59, a protester from Seattle, Washington. 
Some protesters were helping with cleanup efforts. Several buildings that were set on fire on Wednesday ahead of the deadline were still smoldering, sending acrid smoke across the camp. 
Other protesters who stayed past the deadline said they were not afraid of another confrontation with law enforcement, which has clashed multiple times with demonstrators, resulting in more than 700 arrests. 
""They have been pointing a gun at our head since day one, so the feeling of fear becomes pretty normal,"" said Jeremiah Barnes, 24, a protester from Oregon who has spent the past five months at the camp.
Thousands poured into the protest camp starting in August to oppose the 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline that Native Americans and environmental activists say threatens the water resources and sacred land of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. 
But a push by President Donald Trump since he took office in January to quickly complete the $3.8 billion project has dealt a series of setbacks to those wanting to see the pipeline stopped or redirected from passing under Lake Oahe on the Missouri River.
The Army Corps of Engineers and Republican Governor Doug Burgum set a Wednesday afternoon deadline to clear the camp. 
 Energy Transfer Partners LP  (N:ETP) said Thursday that 99 percent of the pipeline is complete after receiving all necessary federal authorizations earlier this month. 
Those in opposition to the pipeline used social media to generate widespread support from Hollywood celebrities, military veterans and politicians. During Energy Transfer Partners' earnings call on Thursday, one analyst said the project was ""probably a PR failure,"" for the Dallas-based company. 
""There is no way we can defend ourselves there,"" Kelcy Warren, the chief executive officer of Energy Transfer Partners, said during the call. 

""There was a mistake on my part,"" he added. ""I underestimated the power of social media. I didn't realize people could just say things that aren't true and freely do it, but they did.""

ARLINGTON, Va. (Reuters) - Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, whom U.S. President Donald Trump has tipped to become ambassador to China, said on Thursday that he would work to open that market to U.S. beef exports when he begins his term.
""Mad cow disease is long since gone in this country, and there is no reason why the Chinese should continue to restrict American beef,"" Branstad said at the U.S. Agriculture Department's annual Agricultural Outlook Forum. ""I want to serve it in the embassy, and I want to serve it in the ambassador's residence, and I want the Chinese, with a growing population and interest in more protein, to have the opportunity to get that.""
Another priority is gaining quicker approval of genetically modified traits for corn and other U.S. agricultural exports headed to China, the world's second-largest economy, he added.
Branstad said his longstanding relationship with Chinese leaders would be crucial in convincing them to relax the current process, noting that trust and friendship were important to business in the culture.
He has visited China at least six times, and Chinese President Xi Jinping has traveled to Iowa twice, including once while Branstad was governor.
Trade is important to U.S. farmers, whose incomes have declined for three years in a row due to slumping prices. The USDA recently said farm incomes would keep falling in 2017.
Branstad said he was optimistic that new trade deals negotiated by Trump would improve market access that benefits rural America.
U.S. House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway, who also spoke at the Forum, said the now-abandoned Trans-Pacific Partnership provided a good baseline for new bilateral agreements. Trump removed the United States from the years-in-negotiation TPP, which was heavily supported by the agricultural community, before it could be approved.

Conaway, a Texas Republican, added that he hoped the House of Representatives would take up the Farm Bill, which his committee is working on, late in the fourth quarter or in early 2018. The current Farm Bill, which covers everything from farm support programs to food stamps, expires at the end of 2018.

748,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2017 12:07PM ET</span>",Oil prices up but gains pared after 7th straight stock build,"By Catherine Ngai
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose but gains were pared Thursday after U.S. government data showed a seventh straight build in crude stocks, suggesting high inventories could undermine OPEC's move to cut output. 
Benchmark Brent crude oil (LCOc1) rose 81 cents a barrel to $56.65 by 11:30 a.m. EDT (1630 GMT) after touching a high of $57.26. U.S. light crude (CLc1) traded up 75 cents at $54.34 a barrel after touching $54.94 a barrel.
While prices extended gains by more than 2 percent soon after the inventory data was released, much of those advances dissipated over the next 30 minutes. 
Both benchmarks are near the top of relatively narrow $4 ranges that have contained trade so far this year, reflecting a period of low volatility since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters agreed to cut output.
OPEC and producers including Russia aim to cut production by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to drain an oversupply that has kept prices depressed for more than two years.
But some analysts considered the trading range a growing concern, particularly since high compliance among OPEC members to curb output is having little upside, according to Tariq Zahir, an analyst at Tyche Capital Advisors.
""If someone told me that the OPEC cuts would be well above historic numbers, you would expect prices to be up to $60 or $65 a barrel,"" he said. ""We're at 90 percent (compliance) last month, what if it falls to 80 or 85 percent?"" 
So far, OPEC appears to be sticking to its deal, but other producers, notably U.S. shale companies, have also increased output, helping swell stocks in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer.
U.S. crude stocks rose 564,000 barrels last week, its seventh consecutive rise, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed on Thursday, although less than previously expected. 
Still, in Cushing, inventories fell by more than 1.5 million barrels, its largest draw since October. 
Distillate stocks also dropped by the most since October 2014, EIA data added. [EIA/S]
Tony Nunan, risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp, said the market needed to see that stocks outside the United States were also falling for prices to break out of their trading ranges.
""It's a battle between how quick OPEC can cut without shale catching up,"" Nunan said, referring to U.S. drilling in shale formations that has shown an upsurge this year. [RIG/U]

""What OPEC really has to do is get the inventories down.""

Crude oil for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained 115 cents, or 2.15%, to trade at $54.75 a barrel by 11:04AM ET (16:04GMT) compared to $54.71 ahead of the report.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 0.564 million barrels in the week ended February 17. Market analysts' had expected a crude-stock build of 3.475 million barrels, though the American Petroleum Institute late Wednesday reported a supply draw of 0.884 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 1.528 million barrels last week, the EIA said. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 518.7 million barrels as of last week, according to press release, which the EIA considered to be “near the upper limit of the average range for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories decreased by 2.628 million barrels, compared to expectations for a draw of 0.888 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles fell by 4.924 million barrels, compared to forecasts for a decline of 0.483 million.
The report came out one day later than usual due to Monday's Washington’s Birthday holiday.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for April delivery traded up 96 cents, or 1.72%, to $56.80 by 11:09AM ET (16:09GMT), compared to $57.05 before the release. 
Meanwhile, Brent's premium to the WTI crude contract stood at $2.28 a barrel by 11:10AM ET (16:10GMT), compared to a gap of $2.25 by close of trade on Wednesday.
Futures have been trading in a narrow range around the lower-to-mid-$50s over the past month as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers and expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production.
U.S. drilling activity has risen by almost 7% since mid-2016, taking it back to levels seen in late 2014, when strong U.S. crude output contributed to a collapse in oil prices.
The revival in U.S. drilling has raised concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade as global producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
Latest data showed the group’s production in January declined by 890,000 barrels a day from the previous month to 32.14 million barrels a day. The drop indicates a 90% compliance level so far by producers who had agreed to curtail their output.
The OPEC technical committee two-day meeting finished on Wednesday with the Qatar energy minister stating that findings on compliance were “encouraging”.
The next monitoring meeting is tentatively scheduled for March 22 and 23 in Kuwait.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million through the end of June.
Though several OPEC energy ministers have commented that the deal could be extended beyond the current deadline, most have stated that it is far too early to reach a decision on whether that will be necessary.
OPEC’s next official meeting is currently scheduled for May 25 in Vienna."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Syria's state grain buyer has signed contracts with local traders for 1.2 million tonnes of Russian wheat, a government source said, the country's second attempt at a huge wheat deal since October as it tries to secure supplies of the food staple.
""We have signed six contracts each for 200,000 tonnes. These are local firms who will source the Russian wheat for us,"" the government source close to the deal told Reuters, declining to name the firms involved.
The government has allocated 52 billion Syrian pounds ($101 million) for a portion of the deals, the source said.
Russia's agriculture ministry declined to comment. 
Flat bread is a subsidized staple for Syrians, who have suffered under a conflict estimated to have killed several hundred thousand people and forced millions to flee their homes. 
Syria's state buyer, the General Establishment for Cereal Processing and Trade (Hoboob), had struck a deal in October to buy one million tonnes of wheat from its ally Russia to feed government held areas and prevent bread shortages after a sharp drop in the country's wheat production last season.
""This new arrangement doesn't cancel out the previous deal, we are still trying to get procedures moving for that one,"" the source said.
The October deal, struck with a little known firm called Zernomir, has so far not been fulfilled and may never be, according to Syrian and Russian government sources.
One European trader was more optimistic the new deal with Syrian firms would be fulfilled. 
""Two or three Syrian companies seem to have been awarded this volume and are trying to buy 11.5 percent protein wheat in the Russian market,"" he said. 
""It is a surprise to hear they are trying to buy 1.2 million tonnes. They have been trying to disguise how much they need and buy spot supplies."" 
President Bashar al-Assad's government managed to collect only around 400,000 tonnes of the 1.3 million tonnes of wheat that the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimated Syria produced last year.
The Syrian government source declined to give a figure to the country's strategic stock.

That compared with a withdrawal of 114 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 117 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 158 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.356 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2.5% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 6.6% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Prices of the heating fuel are down a whopping 28% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Futures touched the lowest level in around six months earlier this week as forecasts called for mostly warmer-than-normal weather in key regions across the U.S. for the rest of the winter.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.

Minutes from the Fed's latest meeting showed policymakers thought it may be appropriate to raise interest rates again ""fairly soon"" should jobs and inflation data come in line with expectations.
However, the U.S. central bank gave no firm signal on the timing of its next rate move, with policymakers noting uncertainty over economic policy under the Donald Trump administration.
Fed fund futures priced in about a 22% chance of a rate hike in March, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, little changed from before the release of the Fed minutes. Odds of a May increase was seen at around 54%, while June odds were at 74%.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 101.32 in London morning trade, retreating from the prior session's high of 101.71.
Treasury yields were little changed, with the U.S. 10-Year yield around 2.415%.
On the data front, Thursday's calendar features weekly jobless claims at 8:30AM ET (13:30GMT) and FHFA home prices at 9AM ET (14:00GMT).
Market players will also focus on comments from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who appears on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" at 7AM ET (12:00GMT), for further hints on tax reform and fiscal stimulus.
Mnuchin on Wednesday praised the strong dollar as a reflection of confidence in the U.S. economy, telling The Wall Street Journal in an interview that it was ""a good thing"" in the long run.

Overnight, crude settled more than 1% lower, despite a late slump in the dollar, after the release of the Federal Reserve Open Committee (FOMC) minutes in which the signal for a rate cut ""fairly soon"" was loud and clear.
Despite the tick lower in global oil prices, crude futures remained near their 52-week high of $55.24, as positive comments from OPEC support prices amid hopes that OPEC may cut production further in an effort to combat the supply glut in the industry.
Speaking at the International Petroleum Week conference in London, Barkindo estimated that OPEC member states are about 90% in compliance with a global pact to cut production and noted the willingness of non-OPEC members to comply with the deal.
Mr. Barkindo’s comments were supported by an OPEC report last week, which revealed that OPEC and other producers, including Russia, were in high compliance with last year’s agreed production cut.
In November last year, The OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in an effort to combat the oversupply issue that has pressured prices over the last two years.
Last week’s batch of U.S. energy reports from both the Energy information Agency (EIA) and oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, revealed a rise in U.S. crude inventories to record levels and an increase in the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil, respectively.

758,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2017 06:30PM ET</span>",Clampdown on North Korean trade squeezes Chinese border towns,"By Brenda Goh
DANDONG, China (Reuters) - As Beijing tightens its grip on trade with North Korea, the economies of Chinese towns along the 1,400-km border the two countries share are floundering.
On Saturday, China said it would ban all coal imports from North Korea, the latest move to enforce United Nations sanctions aimed at depriving Pyongyang of hard currency for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
The sanctions have had a wider impact on trade, locals on the border complain, as North Koreans struggle to finds funds to pay for goods. Even smugglers are feeling the pinch.
""A few of my friends who used to smuggle goods from North Korea have gotten out of the business in the last two years because it's getting dangerous and not as lucrative,"" said an owner of a events hall in Kuandian, about 100 km (60 miles) north of Dandong, the largest city on the border. 
""I don't know whether it's related, but people are spending less these days. It's getting harder to earn money.""
While Beijing, North Korea's sole major ally, has previously said it would comply with UN sanctions, it has been criticized by the United States for not vigorously enforcing them. 
China buys 70 percent of North Korea's exports and Dandong, the main gateway for trade with the hermit state, is the best place to gauge the impact of the restrictions it has put in force.
Linked to the North Korean city of Sinijiu via the Friendship Bridge, Dandong has boomed in recent years, swept up by speculation that North Korea's young leader, Kim Jong Un, would, in time, copy China's export-oriented economic reforms. 
More than 1,000 border trading companies set up shop in office complexes overlooking the river, while developers flocked to build new apartment blocks.
But many of those firms have since folded, residents and traders say. Construction on at least two apartment complexes in Dandong has stalled and empty shopfronts are scattered across the city.
""These shops couldn't carry on because they rely on the North Koreans, and there are fewer North Koreans coming here too,"" said a trader, who only wanted to give his name as Jin, who helps North Korean buyers procure goods such as washing machines and construction materials from China. 
""Three years ago we could make a profit of 30-40 percent on an order, now you can't even hope for 20 percent."" 
COAL BAN
It is not in China's interest to ditch its old ally totally. A sudden regime collapse could throw North Korea into chaos and send hundreds of thousands of North Koreans fleeing across the border, diplomats have said. 
But China seems to be increasingly irked by what it sees as Kim's recalcitrance on the nuclear weapons issue. 
Saturday's coal ban came after Beijing had announced in April last year that it would stop importing North Korean coal. But it made exceptions for deliveries intended for ""the people's wellbeing"" and not connected to the weapons programs.
In fact, China bought about 22 million tonnes of coal from North Korea last year, up 15 percent, with most of it arriving by sea through five ports along China's east coast.
Still, the impact of the April ban had already been felt heavily in Dandong.
""They've stopped letting in coal since July,"" said a security guard at the biggest coal yard in the inland port city, now empty barring two small mounds of coal. ""All the workers were sent home by the company in October. Once the government decided, the port stopped allowing in the coal, it's not like we could do anything,"" he said, only giving his surname as Tang. 
Local management at state-owned Liaoning Greenland Energy Coal Group, which runs the yard, confirmed the suspension of coal shipments, which used to arrive by boat on the Yalu river that separates China from North Korea.
It remains unclear how rigorously the latest coal ban will be enforced.
Many people in Dandong complained that trade across the river had already fallen broadly.
""Dandong's economy relies on trade with North Korea,"" said a truck driver waiting to cross the Friendship Bridge, who estimated his income had fallen by around a third as a result.

""We don't have any factories that churn out goods. We don't have light industries, nor do we have heavy industry.""

CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - Protesters opposed to the Dakota Access pipeline braced for a showdown with authorities as some vowed to defy Wednesday's deadline to abandon the camp they have occupied for months to halt the project.
President Donald Trump has pushed for the completion of the multibillion-dollar pipeline since he took office last month, despite objections from Native Americans and environmental activists who say it threatens the water resources and sacred land of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
Republican Governor Doug Burgum and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers set a deadline of Wednesday afternoon for protesters to leave the Oceti Sakowin camp, located on Army Corps land in Cannon Ball, North Dakota.
Freezing rain and snow fell on Wednesday morning and smoke billowed over the camp as demonstrators burned some of the remaining structures.
Chase Iron Eyes, a Standing Rock Sioux member, said the activists would all stay at the camp until the 2 p.m. CST (2000 GMT) deadline.
""Then people will make their individual decisions about what their level of commitment is,"" he said by telephone on Tuesday. ""Some will get arrested.""
Protesters and law enforcement have clashed multiple times and hundreds of people have been arrested since demonstrations began in August.
The Standing Rock Sioux asked protesters to leave the area in December as they challenged the pipeline plans in court, but some 300 demonstrators have remained. 
Ed Higgins, a 39-year-old military veteran from Lowell, Massachusetts, said he has spent three months at the camp, and that he plans on getting arrested peacefully on Wednesday.
He said he was unsure how many other fellow protesters would be taken into custody: ""We will not know until it happens.""
Law enforcement officials have urged people to leave the camp ahead of the deadline, saying they could be at risk from spring floods, as well as to remove anything that could be damaged during cleanup efforts.
Law enforcement officials have agreed to a request by camp leaders that only Native American cleanup crews be used. One activist, HolyElk Lafferty, said she had asked that government-contracted crews not begin their work until after the camp is cleared.
""It would raise the alarm and panic and not promote a peaceful process today,"" Lafferty said. ""I want people to be safe on both sides.""
State officials have set up a travel assistance center to provide departing protesters with food, water and health check-ups, as well as a voucher for one night's accommodation at a Bismarck hotel and a bus ticket home.
""We're making sure that we're taking care of people that may not have means,"" said a spokesman for the state highway patrol, Lieutenant Tom Iverson.
Trump, a Republican, signed an executive order clearing the way for the $3.8 billion pipeline to proceed. 
A judge denied a request earlier this month by two tribes seeking to halt construction. The tribes are seeking an injunction to order the Army Corps to withdraw the easement. 

The pipeline will be complete and ready for oil between March 6 and April 1, according to court documents filed Tuesday.

763,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2017 10:27AM ET</span>",Oil slips on dollar strength but cushioned by OPEC optimism,"By Sabina Zawadzki
LONDON (Reuters) - Global oil prices slipped on Wednesday as the U.S. dollar (DXY), in which payments for crude are made, rose but they traded broadly at multi-week highs after OPEC signaled optimism over its deal with other producers to curb output.
The U.S. West Texas Intermediate April crude contract (CLc1), the new front-month future, was down 71 cents, or 1.3 percent, at $53.62 a barrel at 1500 GMT. 
Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 77 cents, or 1.4 percent, at $56.83, having touched its highest since Feb. 2 at $55.89 in the previous session.
Nevertheless, an agreement by major oil producers under the OPEC umbrella, which came into place at the start of this year, lent a floor to oil prices. 
Mohammad Barkindo, secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, told a conference on Tuesday that January data showed conformity from member countries in the output cut at above 90 percent.
Adding to the bullish sentiment, hedge funds raised their combined net long position in the three main derivative contracts linked to Brent and WTI by 51 million barrels last week, holding a net long position equivalent to a record 903 million barrels of oil.
The combined net long position has a notional valuation of more than $49 billion. 
""While net length in Nymex crude has grown more or less uninterrupted since the OPEC cut decision towards the end of last year, its share of total open interest in the contract has now reached the highest level since July 2014, back when WTI was trading in triple digits,"" JBC Energy analysts said in a note. 
Both OPEC's Barkindo and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), according to a new research note to clients, expect global inventories to fall, which would boost prices.
Such predictions have prompted several analysts and market players to note the near backwardation of both Brent and WTI oil prices as investors begin to reduce their future hedges. 
""The race is now on for the near-term market structure to shift into backwardation. Excluding expiry dates, this has not happened since April 2016 on Brent and November 2014 on WTI,"" analysts at PVM wrote in a note.
Goldman Sachs, however, noted that a rebound in U.S. drilling activity had exceeded even its own above-consensus expectations.
""While the reduction in supplies out of core OPEC in the Gulf and Russia has exceeded our and consensus expectations, the market is starting to doubt that this will be sufficient to translate into large oil inventory draws by 2Q17,"" it said.
In the meantime, crude oil inventory data from the United States will potentially guide the markets for the rest of the week. The data is set to be released on Thursday, a day later than normal, following a U.S. public holiday on Monday. [EIA/S]

""The DoE data tomorrow will be where we get our next impetus,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, referring to the U.S. Department of Energy's official weekly numbers on stockpiles.

Natural gas for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange sank to a session low of $2.522 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since in six months.
It was last at $2.587 by 10:20AM ET (15:20GMT), up 2.3 cents, or around 0.9%, after sinking 27.0 cents, or 9.5%, a day earlier.
The more actively-traded April contract rose 2.9 cents, or 1.1%, to $2.720, after sliding to $2.641 earlier.
Prices of the heating fuel are down a whopping 30% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 86 and 97 billion cubic feet in the week ended February 17.
That compares with a withdrawal of 114 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 117 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 158 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.445 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 12.4% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 3.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (21:30GMT) later on Wednesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Thursday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock rise of 3.3 million barrels.
The reports come out one day later than usual due to Monday's President's Day holiday.
Last week's numbers showed U.S. output helped boost crude and gasoline inventories to record highs, feeding concerns about a global glut.
Crude oil for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange lost 67 cents, or around 1.2%, to $53.67 a barrel by 9:35AM ET (14:35GMT). The U.S. benchmark reached $55.03 on Tuesday, a level not seen since January 3.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London shed 71 cents, or about 1.2%, to $55.95 a barrel, after touching $57.31 a day earlier, just shy of its highest level of the year.
Oil prices rallied after OPEC Secretary-general Mohammad Barkindo said compliance rate among cartel members who agreed to participate in the production cut deal is expected to increase above the current 90%.
Oil inventories would decline further this year, he added.
Hedge funds extended their bullish bets on oil to an all-time high last week as OPEC and non-OPEC countries made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million by the end of June.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
OPEC could extend its oil supply-reduction pact with non-members or even apply deeper cuts from July if global crude inventories fail to drop to a targeted level, OPEC sources said last week.
Futures have been trading in a narrow $5 range around the lower-to-mid-$50s over the past two months as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers and expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil traders from around the world, including the United States, Britain and Brazil, have tripled their sales to Asia as they take advantage of an emerging supply gap following OPEC-led production cuts announced late last year.
Around 30 supertankers have this month made long-haul trips to ship crude oil from the Americas, the North Sea and the Mediterranean to refineries across Asia, the world's biggest and fastest growing consumer, data extracted from Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts shows.
The unusual movements follow the decision late last year by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers including Russia to cut production by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of this year in a bid to rein in global oversupply and prop up prices.
Companies most involved in the long-haul deals include major oil producers such as  BP  (L:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), private commodity traders Trafigura, Vitol and Mercuria, and Chinese refiner Unipec (SS:600028), trading sources say. Energy and mining giant  Glencore  (L:GLEN), Azerbaijan's state-oil firm Socar and Brazil's Petrobras (SA:PETR4) have also been involved.
Taking advantage of relatively low freight costs and regional crude oil price differentials - known as arbitrage, or arb - traders can profit from supply shortages in one region and oversupply in another. 
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1), for example, currently trade at around $54.50 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) costs $56.90 - a Brent premium over WTI of $2.40 a barrel, compared with near parity in late November, just before OPEC announced its cuts. 
""The OPEC cuts have ... led to an open arb for long-haul cargoes, leading to a rise in long-haul crude imports (which) make up for the decline in OPEC (supplies),"" said Tushar Bansal, director of Ivy Global Energy, a Singapore-based consultancy. 
The cuts are an OPEC policy reversal after two years of pumping out oil and keeping prices low as the cartel sought to squeeze rival exporters.
""OPEC production cuts... created distortions in the Asian crude market, changing global trade patterns,"" BMI Research said in a note to clients.
OPEC CEDES MARKET SHARE
Helping fill the OPEC gap, crude shipments to Asia from the United States, Britain, Brazil, and even war-torn Libya jumped to over 35 million barrels in February, or 1.26 million bpd, from 10.4 million barrels in October, or 336,000 bpd, the data shows.
For OPEC, which typically meets around 70 percent of Asia's oil demand, that means a 5 percent loss of market share since October.
""Under current oil market conditions, OPEC risks losing market share with further production cuts,"" said Carole Nakhle, director of advisory firm Crystol Energy in London.
Although OPEC's relationship with customers in Asia tends to be good, refiners in North Asia's consumer hubs of Japan, China, and South Korea say they will readily turn to other suppliers in order to meet their needs.
Loading schedules show U.S. crude exports to Asia increased to more than 3.5 million barrels this month - including a first U.S. oil cargo delivery to India - from below 1 million in October. UK shipments have jumped to more than 10.5 million barrels from just 1.6 million.
Shipments to Asia from Brazil have hit a record 16.7 million barrels in February, up from 6.9 million in October, and Libya, an OPEC-member exempted from the cuts, doubled its Asia shipments to 2 million barrels last month.
Shipping schedules show the trend continuing into March.
BMI said the OPEC cuts, especially of medium and sour crude grades, were ""providing opportunities for (similar)... Mediterranean crudes to flow into the Asian market,"" which include Libyan oil.
WILL THE ARB LAST?
One of the first major long-haul shipments to Asia in this round of arbitrage trading was by BP, which late last year used more than half a dozen tankers to ship almost 3 million barrels of U.S. crude as far as 30,000 km (18,641 miles) to Australia, Thailand and Japan.
In similar deals, Unipec and Trafigura have shipped U.S. oil from the Gulf of Mexico to China. Shippers of North Sea crude to Asia have included Vitol, Mercuria, Trafigura, Glencore, Shell, Unipec and Socar. The main exporter from Brazil has been state-owned Petrobras, shipping data shows, with traders saying its crude has replaced oil from OPEC-member Angola.
Oystein Berentsen, managing director for crude oil trader Strong Petroleum in Singapore, said arbitrage for North Sea and U.S. oil to Asia has been possible due to the OPEC-led cuts, and these routes ""may continue depending on freight and price spreads.""
Benchmark Middle-East to Japan freight rates for supertankers (VLCC) <.BAWC> are at 71 points on a so-called Worldscale rate based on 100, compared to a long-term average rate of around 76 over the last 10 years.
""The whole reason arb opportunities are there is because of weak freight,"" said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services in Dubai.
It's not clear how long this arb window will remain open.
Strong Petroleum's Berentsen said that despite the OPEC cuts ""there is still oversupply, but the market will probably balance in the third quarter. Then we'll see if the arb still works.""

769,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2017 04:31AM ET</span>",Pipeline fights move from Dakota prairie to Louisiana bayous,"By Liz Hampton
HENDERSON, Louisiana (Reuters) - When Hope Rosinski's father gave her a six-acre plot in Louisiana more than a decade ago, she was surprised to find oil and gas pipelines crisscrossing the property.
Pipeline companies later secured her permission for two more lines, one of which has since caused flooding and consistently leaves her land saturated.
Now she's had enough. Rosinski is fighting the latest request for a right-of-way, this time from Energy Transfer Partners - the company behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. She said ETP declined to make contract changes she wanted or to properly compensate her for lost property value.
Opposition to the company's planned extension of the Bayou Bridge pipeline has made Louisiana bayous the latest battleground in a nationwide war against new pipeline construction.
The pushback here is one example of the increasingly broad and diverse base of opposition nationally, which now extends beyond traditional environmental activists. In Louisiana, opponents include flood protection advocates, commercial fishermen and property owners such as Rosinski.
Their fight follows high-profile protests in North Dakota that were led by Native Americans and joined by military veterans, who together succeeded in convincing the Obama administration to delay construction.
Although the new administration of President Donald Trump has since cleared that project's completion, pipeline companies are nonetheless taking the rising political opposition seriously. Alan Armstrong, chief executive at pipeline firm Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB), told a conference in Pittsburgh that Trump's action would not hamper the protest movement.
“It may even enhance it,” he said the day after Trump cleared the Dakota pipeline in January. 
Pipeline supporters argue that more infrastructure is essential for the oil and gas industry to provide affordable energy and reduce dependence on foreign imports and dirtier energy sources such as coal.
Opponents counter that pipeline companies can't be trusted to prevent leaks. Technology designed to detect spills only accomplished that goal in 20 percent of known pipeline leaks between 2010 and 2016, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. 
Energy Transfer and its affiliates had among the most spills of any pipeline company, with nearly 260 leaks from lines carrying hazardous liquids since 2010, according to the Reuters analysis. An ETP spokesperson said most of those spills were small and occurred on company property.
The company said in a statement that it seeks to work with landowners and communities to “build the pipeline in the safest, most environmentally friendly manner possible."" 
ETP's relations with Rosinski, however, have apparently broken down. She told Reuters that the firm has threatened to take her to court for the right of way, citing legal rights of pipeline companies to build infrastructure for broader public benefit.
Rosinski wants to resist, but knows a court battle could be costly and lengthy. 
“I’m a single mom,"" she said. ""I don’t have the finances."" 
ETP declined to comment specifically on Rosinski's case but said it typically gets voluntary agreements on easements from owners in about 9 out of 10 cases, without legal action.
NOT IN MY BACKYARD
Some pipeline protesters are driven by opposition to any expansion of fossil fuel development, but many have more local and specific concerns. 
Many protests so far - including the encampment in North Dakota, led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe - have focused largely on fear of water contamination.
Similar objections have cropped up in West Texas from protesters of Energy Transfer's Trans-Pecos gas line, and in Arkansas and Tennessee over the Diamond Pipeline operated by Plains All American Pipeline.
Activists in Pennsylvania have been fighting a Williams Companies pipeline plan for three years. The company is looking to add 185 miles of new pipeline to its Atlantic Sunrise line, connecting the northeastern Marcellus natural gas shale region with the southeast part of the state. Opponents have argued the expansion could cause an explosion or taint the local water that supplies farms.
They're borrowing tactics from Standing Rock tribe's standoff. Malinda Clatterbuck, 46, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who leads the group Lancaster Against Pipelines, said residents are setting up a camp in Conestoga, where a right-of-way has been granted, and plans to live on and off at the camp with her family.
“I’m exhausted and angry about this,"" she said. ""Why do we have to upend our lives just to try to get justice for our community?""
Williams said it has operated 60 miles of pipeline safely in Lancaster County and that the company plans to exceed federal safety standards for the extension.
“We’ve also heard from thousands of people who support the project - individuals, chambers and business groups - who recognize the economic benefit,” the company said in a statement. 
DEAD CRAWFISH IN THE BAYOUS
In Louisiana - home to massive oil refineries and about 50,000 miles of pipelines - ETP's planned Bayou Bridge extension would run across southern Louisiana for about 160 miles, between Lake Charles and St. James.
The state has a mutually beneficial but testy relationship with the oil industry, which is widely blamed for cutting through wetlands and contributing to coastal erosion that has left Louisiana more vulnerable to hurricanes and flooding.
Some opponents of the Bayou Bridge are concerned that its construction will pollute drinking water and constrict drainage systems during heavy rains. Others want to see pipeline companies take better care of the environment during and after construction.
Jody Meche, 47, of Henderson, fears economic damage. He has fished in the Atchafalaya Basin for a quarter century. For years, he has been pushing companies to remove spoil banks caused by pipeline construction and oil exploration because they hurt the commercial fishing industry.
The spoil banks act as dams inside the basin, damaging the local ecosystem by stopping water flow.
Meche can sees the impact in the crawfish traps he pulls up from the bayou daily during the season, from February to early summer. The critters resemble tiny lobsters and are in high demand at bars and backyard boils from New Orleans to Houston.
“The stagnant water is not good for them at all,"" Meche said. ""They don’t grow as well, they don’t eat as much, they are very lethargic."" 
Meche can sell large, healthy crawfish for about $1.50 a pound. But the smaller ones he often catches these days fetch half that, and many in his traps these days are dead and worthless. 
CONTRACT DISPUTE
Rosinski, meanwhile, is still fighting with Enterprise Products Partners, the pipeline company she said damaged her property during construction of an ethane line a few years ago. She said she has spent the last year trying to get Enterprise to restore her land and stop the flooding.
The cost to fix it could be as little as $1,200, she said.
Enterprise told Reuters it hopes to resolve the issue amicably, but that it has not gotten clear guidance from an attorney hired by Rosinski.
Rosinski received the right-of-way request from Energy Transfer Partners as she was squabbling with Enterprise. She suggested 30 changes to the contract and requested more compensation. ETP refused, she said, and told her it may take up the dispute in court.

""I've done my part,"" she said of her previous agreements to allow pipelines through her property. ""They’re consuming my land.""

770,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2017 04:22AM ET</span>",Goldman says global crude stocks likely to keep falling,"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects global crude oil inventories to keep falling due to production cuts and strong growth in demand, although stocks are likely to rise in the United States.
""We do not view the recent U.S. builds as derailing our forecast for a gradual draw in inventories, with in fact the rest of the world already showing signs of tightness,"" analysts at the bank said in a note dated Feb. 21.
""Given our unchanged 1.5 million barrels per day growth forecast for 2017, this higher base demand level should fully offset higher U.S. output.""
The Wall Street bank reiterated its forecast for Brent and U.S. crude prices to rise to $59 and $57.50 per barrel respectively in the second quarter, before dropping to $57 and $55 for the rest of 2017.
Oil prices held near multi-week highs on Wednesday, with the U.S. West Texas Intermediate April crude contract up 18 cents at $54.51 a barrel at 0228 GMT (5:28 a.m. ET), while Brent crude was up 24 cents at $56.90. 
Surging U.S. output has pushed crude and gasoline inventories to record highs, keeping a lid on prices after they climbed following an agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd).
""While the production cuts have so far reached a historically high level of compliance at 90 percent, the rebound in U.S. drilling activity has exceeded even our above consensus expectations,"" Goldman said.

However, the increase in U.S. drilling points to factors including further improvement in shale productivity and funding for the industry, rather than expectations of an increase in prices, the bank said.

771,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 22, 2017 04:19AM ET</span>",Oil stays near 7-week highs amid optimism over OPEC cuts,"Investing.com - Oil prices were little changed during European morning hours on Wednesday, staying near the prior session's seven-week highs amid optimism that OPEC and its allies have been following through on their commitment to cut production.
Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London shed 21 cents, or about 0.4%, to $56.45 a barrel by 4:15AM ET (09:15GMT), after reaching $57.31 a day earlier, just shy of its highest level of the year.
Elsewhere, crude oil for April delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped 17 cents, or 0.3%, to $54.16 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark rose to $55.03 on Tuesday, a level not seen since January 3.
Oil prices rallied after OPEC Secretary-general Mohammad Barkindo said compliance rate among cartel members who agreed to participate in the production cut deal is expected to increase above the current 90%.
Oil inventories would decline further this year, he added.
Hedge funds extended their bullish bets on oil to an all-time high last week as OPEC and non-OPEC countries made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million by the end of June.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
OPEC could extend its oil supply-reduction pact with non-members or even apply deeper cuts from July if global crude inventories fail to drop to a targeted level, OPEC sources said last week.
Futures have been trading in a narrow $5 range around the lower-to-mid-$50s over the past two months as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers and expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production.
Data from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes on Friday revealed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by six last week, the fifth weekly increase in a row.
That brought the total count to 597, the most since November 2015, raising concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
Market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Wednesday and Thursday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
The reports come out one day later than usual due to Monday's President's Day holiday.
Last week's numbers showed U.S. output helped boost crude and gasoline inventories to record highs, feeding concerns about a global glut.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for March was steady at $1.493 a gallon, while March heating oil shed 0.9 cents ,or 0.6%, to $1.632 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for April delivery lost 3.6 cents, or 1.4%, to $2.655 per million British thermal units, adding to Tuesday's almost 9% plunge, as forecasts continued to call for mostly warmer-than-normal weather in key regions across the U.S. for the rest of the winter.

U.S. gold futures shed $3.65, or about 0.3%, to $1,235.35 a troy ounce by 3:05AM ET (08:05GMT), after ending Tuesday's session little changed. Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,234.65 per ounce.
The Federal Reserve will release minutes of its most recent policy meeting on Wednesday at 2:00PM ET (19:00GMT).
The U.S. central bank held interest rates steady following its meeting on February 1 and painted a relatively upbeat picture of the economy, although it gave no firm signal on the timing of its next rate move amid considerable uncertainty over economic policy under the Donald Trump administration.
Besides the Fed minutes, there are two Fed speakers Wednesday. Fed Governor Jerome Powell speaks at 1:00PM ET (18:00GMT) in New York at the Forecasters Club of New York on the economic outlook and policy. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan discusses issues facing the global economy at a Dallas Fed event at 7:05PM ET.
On the data front, Wednesday's calendar features existing home sales at 10AM ET (15:00GMT).
Fed fund futures priced in about a 22% chance of a rate hike in March, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. Odds of a May increase was seen at around 50%, while June odds were at 73%.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.2% to 101.60 in London morning trade, within sight of last week's more than one-month high of 101.75.
Meanwhile, 10-year U.S. government bond yields were steady at 2.443%.
Both a strong dollar and higher interest rates are typically bearish for gold, which is denominated in dollars and struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when borrowing costs rise.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for March delivery dipped 3.3 cents, or 0.2%, to $17.96 a troy ounce.
Meanwhile, platinum was down 0.2% to $1,004.50, while palladium inched up 0.2%, to $779.92 an ounce.
Elsewhere in metals trading, copper futures shed 2.2 cents, or about 0.8%, to $2.724 a pound, despite concerns over supply disruptions in Chile and Indonesia supported prices.
Prices of the red metal rallied to a 20-month peak of $2.822 last week after strikes at BHP Billiton (LON:BLT)'s Chilean Escondida and Freeport McMoran (NYSE:FCX)'s Indonesian Grasberg mine.
Combined, the mines produce roughly 10% of the world's total copper supply.

Overnight, gGold bounced off session lows but ultimately traded lower on Tuesday, pressured by a spike in the dollar, after two Federal Reserve policymakers hinted at a possible rate hike in March.
Gold started the session on back foot, after the dollar surged to session highs, following bullish comments from two Federal Reserve policymakers.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Monday that he would likely support an interest rate increase at the central bank’s next meeting in March should the economy continue to strengthen.
Harker’s comments, came fresh of the heels of Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester's statement, the Cleveland Fed member said she would be “comfortable” raising interest rates at this point as inflation pressures pick up.
The yellow-metal recovered from an early session slump, as the dollar was pegged back, following a report from Markit, a market research group, which revealed U.S. Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) eased to 53.9 in February, falling short of analysts’ expectation of increase to 55.8.

Later on Wednesday, the American Petroleum Institute will release its estimates of crude oil supplies at the end of last week, followed on Thursday by official data from the U.S. Department of Energy.
Analysts expect crude oil stocks rose 3.325 million barrels at the end of last week, while gasoline inventories are seen down 1.625 million barrels and distillates declined by 1.075 million barrels.
Overnight, crude prices settled higher, after hitting a 19-month high in intraday trade, after OPEC secretary General Mohammed Barkindo, reiterated that the oil cartel was sticking to its agreement to cut production and expressed confidence that compliance would be higher in the coming months.
Speaking at the International Petroleum Week conference in London, Barkindo estimated that OPEC member states are about 90% in compliance with a global pact to cut production and noted the willingness of non-OPEC members to comply with the deal.
Barkindo’s comments were supported by an OPEC report last week, which revealed that OPEC and other producers, including Russia, were in high compliance with last year’s agreed production cut.
In November last year, The OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in an effort to combat the oversupply issue that has pressured prices over the last two years.
Despite the rally in crude prices, oversupply issues continue to cap upside momentum, as concerns over record supply levels continue to mount. Last week’s batch of U.S. energy reports from both the Energy information Agency (EIA) and oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, revealed a rise in U.S. crude inventories to record levels and an increase in the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil, respectively.

775,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2017 05:57PM ET</span>",Wall Street challenges U.S. regulator over proposed commodities rule,"By Olivia Oran
(Reuters) - Wall Street is pushing back against a proposed rule to force U.S. banks like  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) to hold more capital against investments in commodities, placing what some see as an overly restrictive limit on banks' ties to the sector. 
In a comment letter filed late on Friday and not yet made public, the industry argues the proposed rule would hurt the economy, and that fears about environmental risks from physical commodities activities are overblown. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve handed down the proposal in September, after a public backlash stemming from the belief that big banks’ involvement in commodities markets hurt consumers by driving up prices. The comment letter, filed by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the Institution of International Bankers and seen by Reuters, comes as big banks face an uncertain future in Washington. Even though President Donald Trump has said he favors deregulation and has hired several Wall Street executives as advisers, it is unclear how he or the new Congress will approach various rules. 
Apart from Goldman Sachs, few banks have large exposure to physical commodities any longer. At one time, it was a big and lucrative business for both Goldman and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), due to a quirk in their regulatory structure. Other banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), eventually plunged into the business as well, but exited as global capital requirements got more onerous, making such investments too costly to maintain. 
The Fed’s proposed rule would formalize and increase those standards, imposing what it has called a 1,250 percent risk weighting on banks that own, trade and move physical commodities. Among other measures, $1 in capital would need to be held for every $1 investment, the regulator's highest charge for the riskiest investments.
The rule could potentially force banks to withdraw from the commodities business altogether, because such capital charges would severely depress returns. 
In its proposal, the Fed said new measures would shield banks and the broader financial system from a costly mishap like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Advocates say the rule is also needed to help mitigate commodity price fluctuations and social conflicts that arise from commodity-related activities. 
In the letter filed on Friday, the bank-affiliated groups said the rule would hurt “competition, end users, the liquidity of commodities markets ... and thus the real economy."" A number of utility and power companies, including Calpine Corp, have also cited liquidity and price concerns. 
Big banks have been using similar arguments in lobbying to roll back existing rules, including the Volcker rule limiting risky, speculative trading and the Durbin rule, which caps the fees they can charge retailers for processing debit card transactions. 
Industry sources say the fight against the Fed’s proposal is more about regaining a competitive edge than protecting an existing source of revenue. Between 2007 and 2009, commodities trading accounted for as much as one-fifth of revenue for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. 
But over the past five years, Morgan Stanley has decreased its physical commodity assets to $179 million from $9.7 billion. Goldman Sachs has shed much of its energy infrastructure as well, though it is still a major trader of fossil fuels, trading more natural gas than both  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp in certain quarters, according to Natural Gas Intelligence. 

As regulated banks have scaled back, specialists like  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc, Vitol Group and Mercuria Energy Group have gained ground.

776,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2017 04:36PM ET</span>",Demonstrators vow face-off against North Dakota pipeline,"By Timothy Mclaughlin and Terray Sylvester
(Reuters) - Protesters near the site of the Dakota Access pipeline are bracing for a stand-off with law enforcement as they face orders to evacuate a camp that has served as the base of their opposition to the multibillion-dollar project. 
Native Americans and environmental activists have lived at the Oceti Sakowin camp in North Dakota for months, fighting the construction of the pipeline that they say threatens the water resources of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and sacred land. 
North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have set a Wednesday afternoon deadline for protesters to clear out of the camp in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, which is on Army Corps land.
However, some protesters intend to remain, forcing a potential showdown that could end in arrests of many protesters, law enforcement and camp leaders said on Tuesday. 
""A lot of them are going to stay and they're not going to give up, no matter what army they bring in to make people back off,"" Lewis Grassrope, a leader at the camp, said in a telephone interview. 
Law enforcement officials on Tuesday were planning how to handle Wednesday's evacuation deadline of 2 p.m. local time, said Maxine Herr, a spokeswoman for the Morton County Sheriff's Department. 
""There are certainly those that are planning to stay,"" Herr said. ""As much as they are tearing down, they are building."" 
The protest garnered support from Hollywood celebrities and U.S. military veterans, with thousands traveling to the camp last year to protest the pipeline being built by Energy Transfer Partners LP. 
An Energy Transfer Partners spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. 
The mood in the camp was jubilant in December when the Army Corps ruled against an easement to drill under Lake Oahe, the final link in the 1,172-mile (1,885-km) project. The Standing Rock Sioux subsequently asked protesters to disperse, but some remained. 
However, President Donald Trump, just days after taking office, signed an executive order clearing the way for the pipeline to proceed. 
A judge denied a request earlier this month by two tribes seeking to halt construction, which resumed. The tribes are seeking an injunction to order the Army Corps to withdraw the easement. 
On Tuesday, leaders said around 300 protesters remained at the camp, now sodden from rain and melting snow. 
Governor Burgum, a Republican, has said floods pose a safety threat and trash at the camp could pollute the Missouri River, but demonstrators say that fear is overhyped. 
Despite the setbacks, Melaine Stoneman, a camp leader, said protesters were not dismayed. 

“The fight continues on as it has for over 500 some years of them trying to exterminate and eliminate us (Native Americans),"" she said.

777,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2017 03:48PM ET</span>",Oil rises 1 percent as OPEC sees higher compliance with cuts,"By Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices ended about 1 percent higher after touching three-week highs on Tuesday on OPEC's optimism for greater compliance with its deal with other producers including Russia to curb output in an effort to clear a glut that has weighed on the market.
OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo told an industry conference in London that January data showed conformity from participating OPEC nations with output curbs had been above 90 percent and oil inventories would decline further this year.
""All countries involved remain resolute in the determination to achieve a higher level of conformity,"" Barkindo said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers outside the group agreed in November to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in an effort to drain a glut that has depressed prices for over two years.
Barkindo said it was too early to say if the supply cut, which lasts for six months from Jan. 1, would need to be extended or deepened at the next OPEC meeting in May.
""While Barkindo's statement puts a confident spin on market fundamentals, we'd say questions do remain, given that Iran seems to be signaling increased production rather than improved compliance,"" Tim Evans, an energy futures specialist at Citi Futures said in a note. 
Under the deal, Iran was allowed to boost output from its October level and Tehran expects its oil production to reach 4 million barrels per day by mid-April. 
Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh told state TV that OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers are committed to the production cut.
Brent crude (LCOc1) ended the session at $56.66 a barrel, up 48 cents or 0.9 percent, after hitting its highest since Feb. 2 at $57.31.
The U.S. March crude contract (CLc1) expired 66 cents, or 1.2 percent, higher at $54.06, after peaking at $54.68, its highest since Jan. 3.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange Crude Oil Futures for March delivery rose 1.2% to settle at $54.02 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 1.09% to settle at $56.70 a barrel.
Speaking at the International Petroleum Week conference in London, Barkindo estimated that OPEC member states are about 90% in compliance with a global pact to cut production and noted the willingness of non-OPEC members to comply with the deal.
Mr. Barkindo’s comments were supported by an OPEC report last week, which revealed that OPEC and other producers, including Russia, were in high compliance with last year’s agreed production cut.
In November last year, The OPEC and other producers, including Russia agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd)  in an effort to combat the oversupply issue that has pressured prices over the last two years.
Despite the rally in crude prices, oversupply issues continue to cap upside momentum, as concerns over record supply levels mount. Last week’s batch of U.S. energy reports from both the Energy information Agency (EIA) and oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, revealed a rise in U.S. crude inventories to record levels and an increase in the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil, respectively.

Gold started the session on the back foot, after the dollar surged to session highs, following bullish comments from two Federal Reserve policymakers.
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Monday that he would likely support an interest rate increase at the central bank’s next meeting in March should the economy continue to strengthen.
Harker’s comments, came fresh off the heels of Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester's statement, the Cleveland Fed member said she would be “comfortable” raising interest rates at this point as inflation pressures pick up.
The yellow-metal recovered from an early session slump, as the dollar was pegged back, following a report from Markit, a market research group, which revealed U.S. Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) eased to 53.9 in February, falling short of analysts’ expectation of an increase to 55.8.
Market participants’ turn their attention to the minutes from the Fed’s January meeting, due to be released on Wednesday, for clues on the likelihood of a March interest rate hike.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.

There was no settlement in NYMEX oil prices on Monday, due to the President’s Day holiday in the U.S.
Prices of the heating fuel are down a whopping 29% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 86 and 97 billion cubic feet in the week ended February 17.
That compares with a withdrawal of 114 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 117 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 158 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.445 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 12.4% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 3.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

Top OPEC exporter Saudi Arabia's crude oil shipments fell in December to 8.014 million barrels per day (bpd) from 8.258 million bpd in November, official data showed on Monday.

Prices got a slight lift from a weaker dollar (DXY) as well. A strong greenback typically makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.

""Presumably the decrease in production and exports in December should be seen against this backdrop, and could already have been undertaken to pre-empt the production cuts due to take force from January.""
Signs of rising output in the United States have tempered money managers' appetite to push prices higher. Since the start of the month oil prices have gained around $2.
""There is still a general consensus that the OPEC/non-OPEC agreement helps supply to get in line with demand. This bullish stance is countered by the ever-increasing inventories in the U.S. and rising rig counts,"" PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said in a note.

Natural gas for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange sank to a session low of $2.745 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since November 18.
It was last at $2.766 by 8:20AM ET (13:20GMT), down 7.3 cents, or around 2.6%. The more actively-traded April contract slumped 6.9 cents, or 2.3%, to $2.882.
Trading activity was likely to stay light as markets in the U.S. remain closed for President’s Day on Monday.
Prices of the heating fuel sank 7% last week, taking its losses for the year to almost 24%, as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Based on data from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s extremely warm winter has pushed heating demand for natural gas to nearly 20% below average.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 86 and 97 billion cubic feet in the week ended February 17.
That compares with a withdrawal of 114 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 117 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 158 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.445 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 12.4% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 3.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Without significant demand for natural gas, inventories could stay near record levels and may even continue to pull prices even lower.

794,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 20, 2017 08:06AM ET</span>",Brent oil benchmark updated for first time in over a decade,"Investing.com - Leading oil pricing agency S&P Global Platts said Monday it will add Norway's Troll crude to the existing basket that makes up the dated Brent benchmark from January of next year.
Platts said it would add Norway's Troll crude to the four British and Norwegian crudes it already uses to assess dated Brent from January 1 2018.
Toll will join Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk, or BFOE as they are known.
Dated Brent is at the core of the Brent crude complex and represents the most competitive grade of a basket of crudes loading in the North Sea on any given day.
The overhaul of the Brent oil assessment is being made to ensure there is sufficient supply underpinning the benchmark price for most of the world's oil.
""Dated Brent is a robust and well-supplied crude benchmark, but it is important to prepare for the future, in particular, the expected decline in North Sea production and the changing quality of the whole crude slate,"" Jonty Rushforth, Global Editorial Director of S&P Global Platts said.
""Troll is the closest to the existing BFOE grades in characteristics and should provide an additional quarter of a million of barrels a day of deliverable crude.""
Troll is a light sweet crude oil grade with a typical production of 10-15 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each month.
The inclusion of Troll marks the first change to the dated Brent benchmark in over a decade. The last crude grade to be added was Ekofisk, in 2007."
795,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2017 04:10AM ET</span>","After OPEC cuts heavy oil, China teapot refiners pull U.S. supply to Asia","By Florence Tan and Liz Hampton
SINGAPORE/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chinese independent, or teapot, refiners are bringing in rare cargoes of North American heavy crude in a new long-distance flow that traders say has only been made possible by OPEC's output cuts and ample supplies in Canada and the United States.
In April, at least 1 million barrels of the heavy crude Mars, pumped from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, are expected to land in China's Shandong province and 1 million barrels of a second unidentified heavy grade will arrive in China, trade and shipping sources said last week. This follows the arrival in January of 600,000 barrels of U.S. Gulf Blend, a heavy crude made up of a blend of various U.S. and Canadian grades loaded onto ships on the U.S. Gulf Coast, according to the sources and shipping data.
Heavy crude is typically more dense and viscous than other oil grades. Refiners with facilities that can process these grades value heavy crude because its lower cost results in higher margins from producing fuels from these grades.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) output cuts have targeted heavy crude, with linchpin producer Saudi Arabia and Venezuela reducing their exports of heavy crude. That has increased the price of Middle East heavy crudes for Asian delivery, making it economical for traders to ship crude from Russia, the Atlantic Basin and the United States to Asia.
""The OPEC cuts started from medium and heavy grades and Venezuela (a key supplier to China) is exporting less,"" said a Singapore-based crude oil trader.
The tightening heavy crude supplies are occurring at a time when demand for these types has increased after refiners upgraded their plants, the trader said. Heavy crude typically yields a higher percentage of residue fuels when first processed at a refinery and that residue is then reformulated into higher-value fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel in so-called cracking units.
Since late last year, China, the world's second-largest oil consumer, has stepped up imports from North America, one of the few regions where oil production is growing.
Asia's strong pull for heavy sour crude from the Americas led Mars to hit its highest level in a year relative to North American price benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) as traders forecast increased export demand from Asia.
The Ligurian Sea, a Suezmax tanker, loaded 600,000 barrels of U.S. Gulf Coast Blend from Port Arthur in Texas. The tanker then went around South Africa to arrive at Lanshan port in Shandong in early January after a 55-day journey, shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed.
The cargo contained Canadian Access Western Blend, a heavy sour grade with an API gravity of about 22 degrees and nearly 4 percent sulfur, said two trade sources who track oil flows.
Chinese agent Sinoenergy sold the bulk of the cargo to Shandong Tianhong Chemical and the rest went to Shandong Haiyou Petrochemical Group, they said.
The Mars cargo may go to Chinese independent refiner Shandong Wonfull Petrochemical Group, who are close to buying the heavy-sour grade for the first time for April delivery, said a source with knowledge of the proposed deal. The source declined to be named due to company policy.
Wonfull will likely buy the cargo from Swiss trader Trafigura [TRAFG.UL], an active seller of U.S. crude in Asia, said a second trader who closely tracks oil deals in Shangdong.
Castleton Commodities International (CCI) also plans to ship 1 million barrels of an unknown heavy crude grade from the United States to China onboard the Suezmax tanker Erviken which is scheduled to load on Feb. 20, according to one trader, a source in the shipping industry and shipping data.
Sinoenergy, Trafigura, Wonfull, CCI and Haiyou declined to comment. Tianhong could not be reached for comment.
China's largest refiner Sinopec imported heavy crude from the U.S. Gulf late last year, a source with knowledge of the matter said, confirming an earlier Reuters story.

Global financial markets will focus on Wednesday’s minutes of the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting in the week ahead for more clues on the timing of the next U.S. rate hike.
Market players will also keep an eye out on U.S. housing data to gauge if a recent increase in consumer spending and inflation is translating into higher home prices and a pick-up in home sales.

Last week, oil futures added a few pennies on Friday, but posted their first weekly decline in five weeks as concerns over rising production and swelling stockpiles in the U.S. offset efforts by major producers to cut enough output to reduce a global glut.
Concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand pressured crude prices.
Data from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes on Friday revealed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil rose by six last week, the fifth weekly increase in a row. That brought the total count to 597, the most since November 2015.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude supplies rose by 9.5 million barrels last week to an all-time high of 518.0 million barrels.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade. Latest data showed the group’s production in January declined by 890,000 barrels a day from the previous month to 32.14 million barrels a day. The drop indicates a 90% compliance level so far by producers who had agreed to curtail their output.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.

""We were due to reach 4 million barrels ...by the end of the (Iranian) year (March 20). This will be realized with a one-month delay,"" said Ali Kardor, head of the state-run National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), quoted by the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Friday, retreating from the previous day's gains under pressure from a stronger dollar and rising U.S. shale oil output, but losses were limited by expectations that producing countries will eventually cut enough output to reduce a global glut. 
Rising U.S. output has helped boost domestic crude and fuel inventories to record highs. [EIA/S] Still, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers including Russia agreed to cut output almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of 2017.
Estimates suggest compliance by OPEC is around 90 percent, and Reuters reported on Thursday that OPEC could extend the pact or even apply deeper cuts from July if global crude inventories fail to drop to a targeted level.
""It's encouraging that it may not be a six-month deal but one of the issues is if you look at OPEC and other members basically reducing their supply and U.S. shale producers profiting from it, that's going to produce some turmoil,"" said Mark Watkins, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank Private Client Group.
""At some point, it's going to be difficult for that agreement to stay in place when member countries can drill more and make more money.""

806,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2017 10:20AM ET</span>",U.S. shale oil braces for the unfamiliar in 2017: inflation,"By Swetha Gopinath and Arathy S Nair
(Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are facing their first production cost increase in five years in 2017 as industry activity picks up and energy service providers hike fees to take a bigger share of the profits generated by higher oil prices.
Drilling innovations over the past decade have generated a dizzying reduction in the cost of pumping oil from shale formations across the United States - the world's largest energy consumer - triggering an energy revolution and a production boom.
When that boom ended with the onset of a two-year global price war in 2014, shale producers responded with even deeper cost cuts. Technological breakthroughs allowed producers to wring more oil from the rock and halved the per-barrel price needed to turn a profit.
But for the first time since 2012, shale producers will see a rise in break-even production costs this year, according to data from Rystad Energy, which surveys producers. The per-barrel costs will rise an average of $1.60 across the shale patch to $36.50.
For a chart of the fall and recent rise of shale oil production costs, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2lxKeeX
The drive to lower costs has run its course for now, and service firms are leveraging power in the more crowded oilfields, such as the Permian basin in West Texas, to eke out higher payments from producers. 
Firms that supply rigs, crews, technological expertise are clamoring to take back discounts they extended during the slump, in some cases asking for between 10 percent and 15 percent more as the number of rigs and crews deployed in the fields rises.
Producers expect that to continue.
""In the Permian, activity has picked up, and going forward we would expect to see some pressure,""  Chevron  Corp's (N:CVX) Chief Executive John Watson said on an earnings call last month. 
Oil service providers acknowledge, however, that their price hikes may not stick until drillers generate enough demand to burn through the remaining spare capacity in the oil service sector.
In a securities filing on Feb. 8, service provider  Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI) cautioned that drilling ""activity needs to increase meaningfully before excess service capacity can be substantially absorbed and meaningful pricing recovery takes place.""
PERMANENT COST SAVINGS
Service inflation represents only a fraction of the expected rise in international crude prices this year. A Reuters poll of 31 analysts and economists forecast benchmark U.S. oil prices will average $56.08 per barrel in 2017, up from $43.47 last year. 
Between half and two-thirds of the cost savings achieved during the oil price slump are likely to become permanent even if oil prices tick higher, according to industry experts and company estimates.
Shale companies deployed more rigs than they have done in sixteen months last week, and have steadily increased the number in the field to take advantage of crude prices that have mostly held at more than $50 per barrel since the world's top oil exporters, both OPEC and non-OPEC, agreed to cut supplies in late November.
A further rise in the oil price could quickly stir drilling activity across the United States, which would in turn accelerate service fee and labor cost inflation. That is a worrying development for an industry that has lately gotten used to costs heading only down.
There were 207 hydraulic fracturing fleets at work in January across the U.S., up 20 percent from last June, according to data from Houston-based Primary Vision, which tracks oilfield service equipment usage. 
 Pioneer Natural Resources  Co (N:PXD) has its own fracturing crews, which it hopes will help offset rising service costs elsewhere.
""I believe we will be able to keep our inflation numbers down to more like approximately 5 percent, but the internal plan is to make sure that cost inflation is offset by our efficiency gains,"" Pioneer Natural Chief Executive Tim Dove said on a post-earnings call earlier this month.
HEDGING AGAINST INFLATION
Other companies have locked in contracts to insulate themselves from the rise in service and labor costs. WPX Energy, a leading shale oil producer in North Dakota and Texas, has sought to protect against price inflation through contracts for sand, stimulant, equipment and services, said CEO Rick Muncrief in an interview.
Other companies including  Hess Corp  (N:HES) hope to beat the inflation forecasts with yet more efficiency gains.
Hess hopes to wring more barrels out of each well with new techniques that allow it to conduct hydraulic fracturing at 60 spots along a well, up from the usual 50, president Greg Hill said on a conference call last month. 
In addition, using more sand and other proppants - used to keep fissures in shale rock open - in the wells should help boost production, Hill said.
Oil producers can already count on many cost savings achieved in recent years, such as reductions in the time it takes to drill wells, said Gürcan Gülen, an energy economist at the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin.
    ""Once you know better how to do things, you're not going to change that when oil prices move higher,"" said Gülen.
But the possibility of more deep cost reductions are, for the most part, gone.
A number of companies saw break-even costs at the wellhead - the price required to profit from oil at a new well - stagnate between the third and fourth quarters, data from Rystad Energy showed.

""To certain producers, there's a little bit of opportunity to lower costs more,"" said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group. ""But those are few and far between.""

807,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2017 09:49AM ET</span>",Sportsmen fight Trump energy plans alongside environmental left,"By Valerie Volcovici and Annie Knox
WASHINGTON/SALT LAKE CITY, Utah (Reuters) - When Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz of Utah introduced legislation last month to transfer about 3 million acres of federally-held public land to state control, he was bombarded by thousands of angry phone calls, letters and social media posts urging him to back off.
The pressure came not only from liberal environmentalists – but also from gun-toting, often conservative outdoors enthusiasts who are central to Chaffetz’ political base. Both camps fear that transferring federal lands to state control could open them up to drilling and coal mining rather than recreation and preservation.
""I hear you,"" Chaffetz wrote in a post on his Instagram account announcing the withdrawal of the bill. ""I am a proud gun owner, hunter and love our public lands.""
Chaffetz's office did not respond to requests for comment on his reversal.
Outdoor sporting groups - long associated with conservatism because of their support for guns rights and small government - are now collaborating with the environmental left to fight U.S. President Donald Trump’s push to open more public lands to energy development. Such areas include national forests, parks and Native American tribal territories and account for about one fifth of the United States.
Recent funding data from the Foundation Center database, which aggregates information from tax filings, shows groups such as the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers and the Outdoor Alliance have accepted grants from big environmental and liberal foundations, including the Turner Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
The Hewlett Foundation gave $100,000 in 2015 to Backcountry, a conservation group created in 2004. The money accounted for more than two-thirds of its foundation grants that year, and Backcountry told Reuters it is an annual gift with no conditions.
Hewlett said it supports Backcountry because of its ""critical work to preserve America's outdoor heritage of hunting and fishing and protect wild places.""
The Turner Foundation gave an unrestricted donation of $100,000 to the Outdoor Alliance in 2015, the group's only foundation grant that year.
""Conservation is a nonpartisan issue, and it is a shame it is being politicized,"" said Judy Adler, president of the Turner Foundation.
The Environmental Policy Alliance, a pro-development organization, has said environmentalists finance sportsmens' groups as a way to provide conservative cover for a liberal agenda - turning the outdoors groups into “green decoys.”
The alliance, which says it aims to ""uncover the funding and hidden agendas"" of environmentalists, did not respond to requests for comment.
Highlighting the odd-bedfellows nature of such collaborative lobbying, the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers counts the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., as a lifetime member.
Officials at the Trump Organization, where Donald Trump Jr. is an executive, did not respond to requests for comment. A Trump administration official declined to comment.
Trump has made previous statements opposing the transfer of federal land to states, but has strongly supported more energy development in such areas.
BIGGER THAN THE COAL INDUSTRY
The outdoor recreation industry is concentrated heavily in conservative western states and generates more than $640 billion annually, according to the Outdoor Industry Association, which represents hundreds of companies and organized the pressure campaign against Chaffetz. That figure would make the outdoors industry about 10 times bigger than the coal industry.
For a graphic comparing the outdoor industry's economic output to other sectors, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2kHoU6U
The cause of protecting public lands is among precious few issues that bind U.S. conservatives and liberals. Outdoors companies such as Patagonia and North Face are building lobbying strength quickly in response to rising threats to federal lands, said Jessica Wahl, government affairs manager for the Outdoor Industry Association.
""We are a bipartisan industry,"" Wahl said. ""We are stronger when talking with a unified voice.”
In one example of that clout, more than 30 companies this week - including Patagonia, REI, North Face, KUHL, and others – wrote an open letter to Utah's Republican Governor Gary Herbert saying they will try to force an annual outdoor retailers’ convention out of the state unless he protects public lands.
Patagonia had earlier announced it would boycott the convention - which brings Utah about $45 million each year - because Herbert had opposed a move by former Democratic President Barack Obama to protect 1.3 million acres near the iconic Bears Ears buttes.
Tawney, of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, said he supports partnerships with environmental groups to advocate for wilderness conservation. But he dismisses assertions that the outdoor enthusiast organizations have become pawns of the environmental left.
""Everything we do is about hunting and fishing,"" he said.
Some traditional environmental lobbying organizations such as the Sierra Club say they are happy to let outdoor sports advocates be the public face of the conservation movement. The arguments of sportsmen tend to resonate better with business-friendly Republicans and their constituents in rural communities, he said.
 “They speak from more of an economic voice,” said Matt Kirby, who directs the Sierra Club’s public lands policy work for western states.
FISHING WITH TRUMP JR.
Elsewhere, local outdoor industry companies have had success engaging with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to have more input on local oil and gas leasing decisions. 
Ashley Korenblat - owner of Utah-based mountain biking outfitter Western Spirit Cycling and a member of the Outdoor Industry Association - was instrumental in shaping the Moab Master Leasing Plan, which preserves bike trails near Moab, Utah while allowing some oil and gas drilling.
Many hunters, fishermen and campers may not think of themselves as conservationists, Korenblat said, but “when you can no longer get to the river where you fish - when the trail you’ve been riding has been replaced by a 30-foot gravel road to a well - suddenly you really care.” 
Some of the most passionate conservation advocates are in Utah, where two-thirds of the state is federally protected.
""I’m just disgusted,"" said Grant Bench, a fly-fishing guide who works with Sundance Mountain Resort. ""Do we see oil pumps in Yellowstone next?""
Last winter, Bench said, he took Donald Trump Jr. fishing on the Provo River. Bench told him he wants future generations of his family to enjoy the same pristine wilderness that currently sustains Bench’s livelihood.
Trump Jr. agreed that preserving public lands is important, said Bench, who hopes Trump’s son will carry that message to his father.
Reuters could not reach Donald Trump Jr. for comment. Bench provided a photograph of himself with Trump Jr. standing outside in waders, waterproof pants used by fly fishermen to walk through streams.
The conservation battles have made Bench start to question his traditionally conservative politics.
""I’m leaning further left every day that this stuff goes on,"" he said.

808,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2017 09:27AM ET</span>","Brazil races against time to save drought-hit city, dying crops","By Anthony Boadle
CAMPINA GRANDE, Brazil (Reuters) - The shrunken carcasses of cows lie in scorched fields outside the city of Campina Grande in northeast Brazil, and hungry goats search for food on the cracked-earth floor of the Boqueirao reservoir that serves the desperate town.
After five years of drought, farmer Edivaldo Brito says he cannot remember when the Boqueirão reservoir was last full. But he has never seen it this empty.
""We've lost everything: bananas, beans, potatoes,"" Brito said. ""We have to walk 3 kilometers just to wash clothes.""
Brazil's arid northeast is weathering its worst drought on record and Campina Grande, which has 400,000 residents that depend on the reservoir, is running out of water.
After two years of rationing, residents complain that water from the reservoir is dirty, smelly and undrinkable. Those who can afford to do so buy bottled water to cook, wash their teeth with, and even to give their pets.
The reservoir is down to 4 percent of capacity and rainfall is expected to be sparse this year.
""If it does not fill up, the city's water system will collapse by mid-year,"" says Janiro Costa Rêgo, an expert on water resources and hydraulics professor at Campina Grande's federal university. ""It would be a holocaust. You would have to evacuate the city.""
Brazil's government says help is on the way.
REROUTING THE RIVER
After decades of promises and years of delays, the government says the rerouting of Brazil's longest river, the São Francisco, will soon relieve Campina Grande and desperate farmers in four parched northeastern states.
Water will be pumped over hills and through 400 kilometers of canals into dry river basins in Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco, and Paraíba, the small state of which Campina Grande is the second-biggest city.
Begun in 2005 by leftist president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the project has been delayed by political squabbles, corruption and cost-overruns of billions of dollars.
Brazil's ongoing recession, which economists calculate has shrunk the economy of the impoverished northeast by over four percent during each of the past two years, made things even worse.
Now, President Michel Temer is speeding up completion of the project, perhaps his best opportunity to boost support for his unpopular government in a region long-dominated by native-son Lula and his leftist Workers Party.
In early March, Temer plans to open a canal that will feed Campina Grande's reservoir at the town of Monteiro. The water will still take weeks to flow down the dry bed of the Paraíba river to Boqueirão.
With the quality of water in Campina Grande dropping by the day, it is a race against time.
Professor Costa Rêgo says the reservoir water will become untreatable by March and could harm residents who cannot afford bottled water.
Helder Barbalho, Temer's minister in charge of the project, says the government is confident the water will arrive on schedule.
""We have to deliver the water by April at all costs,"" he said.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change has worsened the droughts in Brazil's northeast over the last 30 years, according to Eduardo Martins, head of Funceme, Ceará state's meteorological agency.
Rainfall has decreased and temperatures have risen, increasing demand for agricultural irrigation just as water supplies fell and evaporation accelerated.
Costa Rêgo blames lack of planning by Brazil's governments for persistent and repeated water crises, shocking for a country that boasts the biggest fresh water reserves on the planet.
The reservoir supplying São Paulo, Brazil's largest city and a metropolitan region of 20 million people, nearly dried up in 2015. The capital, Brasilia, resorted to rationing this year.
In Fortaleza, capital of Ceará and the northeast's second largest city, the vital Castanhão reservoir is down to 5 percent of its capacity.
While that city will also get water from the São Francisco project, it will not arrive until at least year-end because contractor Mendes Junior abandoned work after being implicated in a major corruption scandal.
""Water from the São Francisco river is vital,"" Ceará Governor Camilo Santana told Reuters. He said the reservoir can supply Ceará only until August.
After that, the state must use emergency wells and a mandatory 20 percent reduction in consumption to keep Fortaleza taps running until water arrives.
RATIONING
Ceará has had to cut back on irrigation, hurting flower and melon exporters, cattle ranchers and dairy farmers. They stand to flourish when the transfer comes through, but quenching the thirst of the cities will take priority.
In Campina Grande, a textile center, companies including industry leaders Coteminas and Alpargatas have curtailed expansion plans and drastically cut back consumption by recycling the water they use.
There, too, new water will first go towards solving the crisis in Campina Grande and surrounding towns. Only then will officials think about agriculture.
""First we have to satisfy the thirst of urban consumers. Only then can we think of producing wealth,"" said Joao Fernandes da Silva, the top water management official in Paraíba.
Rationing has particularly hurt poorer urban families. Many have no running water or water tanks and instead store water in plastic bottles.
For those who have waited decades for the São Francisco transfer, they will believe it only when they see the water flow.
Brito said he and his neighbors survive on the social programs that were the hallmark of Lula and his Workers Party administration. Though tainted by corruption allegations, Lula remains Brazil's most popular politician ahead of presidential elections next year.
""Without the Bolsa Familia program, we would be dying of hunger,"" said Brito, who believes shortages could persist even after the river transfer. ""It's political season again, so they promise us water, just for our votes.""

U.S. crude futures for March delivery were down 0.15% at $53.28 a barrel.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the April Brent contract edged down 0.18% to trade at $55.55 a barrel.
Oil prices initially strengthened after Reuters reported that OPEC’s supply reduction pact could be extended if all major producers showed ""effective cooperation"".
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade as global producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day.
If carried out as planned, the deal should reduce global supply by about 2%.
 However, output cuts have recently been clouded by reports of rising production in the U.S. The U.S. Energy Department said on Wednesday that U.S. crude oil and gasoline inventories hit all-time records last week.
Separately, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted that U.S. shale oil production will rise by a total of 80,000 barrels a day to 4.87 million barrels a day in March – the highest rate of shale oil production since May last year."
811,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2017 04:15AM ET</span>","As U.S. shale oil activity surges, sand could be in short supply","By Jarrett Renshaw
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Demand for frac sand has surged in recent weeks as U.S. producers rush back to the oil patch, stoking concern that supplies of the key component of drilling may not be able to keep up with demand later this year, industry professionals said. 
The growing appetite for frac sand comes as oil producers have added hundreds of rigs in U.S. oil fields from Texas to North Dakota. Last week, the U.S. rig count hit 591, the highest since October 2015 and nearly double the figure seen seven months ago.
Raymond James predicts the number of rigs could approach 1,000 by the end of 2018.
“The worm has turned,” said Chris Keene, CEO of Rangeland Energy LLC, a privately held logistics company in Sugar Land, Texas.
U.S. producers pump frac sand and other materials into wells to break up shale rock and produce oil. Wells are getting longer and wider, requiring larger amounts of sand. 
The frac sand industry was among the hardest hit during the oil rout of the past two years, as producers slashed capital budgets and looked to shed – or renegotiate – long-term supply contracts with sand companies that had been made during the boom years. Several of the major frac sand companies saw shares plummet amid investor skepticism.
But frac sand producers like Fairmount Santrol Holdings and U.S. Silica Holdings are regaining their price leverage and producers are once again looking to lock in long-term supply contracts amid widespread optimism that global oil production cuts will provide stable, higher prices.
Raymond James, in a January investor note, estimated frac sand demand would hit record levels this year at roughly 55 million tons and exceed 80 million tons by next year, 60 percent above 2014 levels, due in large part to producers requiring more sand per well. 
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co ran a U.S. demand model early last year that significantly underestimated demand for 2017 and 2018, forcing the bank to revise its forecast in December to predict record demand for 2018. Tudor says tightening supplies and logistical challenges could send frac sand prices to 2014 levels, when there were 1,500 rigs in U.S. oil patches.
Rangeland operates a frac sand terminal in New Mexico that delivers roughly 2 million tons of sand annually to producers in the Delaware Basin, an oil patch that stretches from West Texas into New Mexico. Rangeland CEO Keene said January frac sand deliveries out of the company's terminal reached record levels. 
OIL PRODUCERS 'SCRAMBLING'
Taylor Robinson, president of PLG Consulting, which helps companies solve transportation issues, said frac sand demand has “significantly” picked up in the past six weeks, and demand is expected to skyrocket over the next seven months.
“I think people are looking at the potential demand numbers, and, for the first time, people are scared that there will not be enough sand to meet the demand,” Robinson said.
“Oil producers are scrambling to lock in long-term contracts to avoid being caught short. People are really gearing up for the next wave.” 
The increased demand will push sand prices up by 60 percent, hitting the $40 per ton range over the next 18 months, Raymond James said. Sand costs are about $25 per ton today and reached $70 per ton prior to the downturn and when supplies were short.
Keene said the real concern is the logistical challenges that come with moving high volumes of sand. 
Some producers are using a unit train - roughly 75 or more rail cars in a line - on each well, Keene says. He said that presents some significant logistical challenges that could hamper production. 

""People are going to have to build large, unit-train scale facilities at these volumes,"" he said. ""Once you start fracking a well, you need to keep sand on it.""

815,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2017 07:50PM ET</span>",U.S. corn farmers worry as Mexico woos South American suppliers,"By Mark Weinraub and Karl Plume
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Mexico's attempts to diversify its supplies of corn could threaten a crucial market for U.S. farmers who are increasingly dependent on exports to unload record stockpiles that are depressing prices.
Mexico buys nearly all its corn imports from the United States - shipments that totaled 13.603 million tonnes in the year ending Aug. 31, 2016. The sales account for about 28 percent of total U.S. corn exports, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
But now Mexico wants to lessen that dependence as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens to upend trade between the countries. On Thursday, Mexico's agriculture minister revealed plans to visit Argentina and Brazil to buy yellow corn.
A grain buyer at a corn mill in Mexico told Reuters in an email on Thursday he had already asked for price quotes from Brazilian and Argentine exporters for corn shipments to Mexico.
Mexico tends to import grain from South America or countries other than the United States only when it is cheaper or supplies are tight.
U.S. corn prices of around $190 per tonne are about $10 to $15 lower than South American grain delivered to Mexico, trade sources said.
""The extent to which there is any switching that takes place (by Mexico) to South America frankly all depends on price. At the moment it doesn't work so there would have to be something else that triggers it,"" Soren Schroder, chief executive of grain trader  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG), said on a call with analysts on Wednesday.
U.S. farmers are concerned that the new administration's early maneuvering on trade threatens exports, which are a rare bright spot in an agricultural economy where farm income could fall to its lowest since 2002 in inflation-adjusted terms.
Trump, who was supported by many Midwest grain states when he won the presidential election in November, has already withdrawn the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal. He has raised the prospect of re-negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which food producers say has quadrupled U.S. agricultural exports in the region during the past two decades.
""We are concerned that growing rhetoric is creating an environment in which Mexican buyers feel they need to look at alternate suppliers, which could affect U.S. market share,"" the U.S. Grains Council, a trade group that develops export markets for corn and other grains, said in an email to Reuters.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2017 07:31PM ET</span>","Big bets on oil remain stalwart, despite bearish signals","By Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil traders for the last two weeks have shrugged off reports that U.S. stockpiles are brimming at their largest levels ever recorded, as the market continues to bet that crude prices will climb higher.
Oil has maintained its buoyancy because the market is betting that cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will largely rebalance the oil market, despite continued production increases from shale formations in the United States.
A second consecutive massive build in U.S. crude stockpiles on Wednesday left the market relatively unimpressed, as it was little changed during the session, as the market awaited further evidence that OPEC cuts were in effect. 
As of last week, noncommercial traders had a net long position of 477,000 U.S. crude contracts, just short of the previous week's level that represented a record long position in oil futures, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
That speculation has helped crude prices remain supported in recent weeks whenever the market has threatened to slip to lower levels, traders said. The two highest-volume trading days of 2017 occurred when U.S. crude rebounded from lows around $51 a barrel as buyers came into the market. U.S. oil has not dropped below $50 a barrel since early December.
While speculation by hedge funds and other money managers is contributing to this net long position, it may also be driven in part by the start of institutional investors' return to oil markets after an absence during the crude oil rout. 
""It seems that a significant amount of the 'net length' likely belongs to passive institutional investors, which are taking a keener look at commodities and energy once again after several years of absence,"" Energy Aspects wrote in a research note. 
So far in February there has been about $90 million invested in energy-commodities ETPs after outflows in January, per Lipper data. This compares with $455 million in November 2016 and $1.1 billion in January 2016. 
The United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) exchange-traded fund and ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil both had inflows last week, after three weeks of outflows, according to data from Morningstar. Another large exchange-traded product, VelocityShares 3x Long Crude Oil ETN, continues to have outflows. 
Year-to-date, USO has had outflows, said fund manager John Love. Since the Nov. 30 OPEC cut announcement, USO's holdings have fallen from 74,501 contracts to 53,840 on Feb. 15, the last date for which data is available. 
The fund started the year with about $3.2 billion under management and is now down to $2.8 billion, he said. The pullback indicates that the fund has a smaller percentage of open interest than previously. 

USO holds about 2 percent of open interest in all NYMEX WTI contracts, but the share is smaller if ICE contracts are also included.

Crude prices have come under pressure in recent sessions, as the latest drilling reports from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), compounded fears that increase drilling activity from U.S. crude will underpinned OPEC and other producers’ efforts to combat the demand and supply imbalance in the industry.
It remains to seen whether crude can hold onto recent gains, as U.S. oil inventories have risen sharply in the past few weeks, with crude and U.S. gasoline inventories hitting all-time records last week, the U.S. Energy Department said on Wednesday.
The EIA predicts U.S. shale oil production will rise by a total of 80,000 barrels a day to 4.87 million barrels a day in March – the highest rate of shale oil production since May last year.
Crude prices were also helped by a decline in the dollar as market participants weighed up the possibility of an interest rate hike at the Fed’s March 14-15 meeting.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. declined by 114 billion cubic feet in the week ended February 10, below market expectations for a drop of 124 billion cubic feet.
That compared with a withdrawal of 152 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 163 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 156 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.445 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 12.4% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 3.5% above the five-year average for this time of year.
The natural-gas market has been on the defensive in recent days after forecasting models showed cold air exiting the Northeast, with the updated 6-10 day forecast looking warmer than previously projected.
Prices of the heating fuel are down almost 21% since the start of the year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.

Up until Wednesday, the dollar index had enjoyed a 10-session winning streak.
Market players digested another raft of mostly upbeat U.S. economic data, which reinforced the idea that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as early as next month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Thursday as record crude and gasoline inventories in the United States dragged on prices, though OPEC supply cuts helped to support the market.
Brent crude was up 10 cents at $55.85 a barrel by 1005 GMT. U.S. light crude gained 10 cents to $53.21.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other exporters have agreed to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of 2017, with industry data showing that most producers are sticking to the deal.
Despite this, inventories remain bloated and supplies high, especially in the United States.
U.S. crude and gasoline inventories soared to record highs last week as refineries cut output and gasoline demand softened, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. [EIA/S]
Crude inventories rose 9.5 million barrels in the week to Feb. 10, nearly three times more than analyst expectations, boosting commercial stocks to a record 518 million barrels.
Gasoline stocks rose by 2.8 million barrels, compared with a forecast of a 752,000 barrel drop in a Reuters poll of analysts. That pushed gasoline inventories to a record at 259 million barrels.
The bloated stocks come as U.S. crude oil production has risen 6.5 percent since mid-2016 to 8.98 million bpd. 
Analysts say oil market is balanced between these opposing factors: OPEC cuts and rising U.S. inventories and production.
Both Brent and WTI crude futures have traded within a $5 per barrel price range since the start of the year.
""Prices have not seen this kind of stability for several years,"" said David Wech, managing director of Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy. ""However, if crude prices are to break out of their recent range in the next few weeks, the risk is to the downside.""
Gavin Wendt, founding director and senior resource analyst at commodity research firm MineLife, agreed: ""There's no doubt that the world oil market is very much in wait-and-see mode, which is why the price has remained in the mid-$50s per barrel range since mid-December.
""The biggest factor is what might happen with U.S. shale production,"" he added, indicating that rising shale output had the potential to damage oil price stability.

Wendt said oil is likely to trade between $45 and $55 a barrel this year.

Crude oil for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 3 cents, or less than 0.1%, to $53.13 a barrel by 4:05AM ET (09:05GMT), after declining 7 cents, or about 0.2%, on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London inched up 6 cents, or 0.1%, to $55.80 a barrel. The global benchmark slipped 22 cents, or 0.4%, a day earlier.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade as global producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
Latest data showed the group’s production in January declined by 890,000 barrels a day from the previous month to 32.14 million barrels a day. The drop indicates a 90% compliance level so far by producers who had agreed to curtail their output.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
Gains were limited amid ongoing concerns over rising U.S. oil and fuel stockpiles. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude supplies rose by 9.5 million barrels last week to an all-time high of 518.0 million barrels.
Gasoline stocks rose 2.8 million barrels, pushing inventories of the fuel to a record at 259.0 million barrels.
Futures have been trading in a narrow range around the lower-to-mid-$50s over the past two months as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers and expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2017 01:31AM ET</span>",Argentina's rising grains production strands vessels in river traffic,"By Hugh Bronstein
ROSARIO, Argentina (Reuters) - When a boat carrying soy oil destined for India ran aground on the Parana River near Buenos Aires in late January, ships loaded with most of Argentina's grains exports were blocked for hours.
It was the latest accident on one of the world's great food highways, which is straining to carry rising volumes of Argentine agricultural products embarking on the first leg of the journey from the fields of the Pampas to the feeding troughs of cattle, pigs and chickens worldwide.
Increasing congestion on the Parana, which carries 80 percent of Argentina's grains exports, could hamper President Mauricio Macri's efforts to expand farm output and pull the country out of recession.
Macri wants Argentina to grow 25 percent more grains to boost rural income and has cut export taxes to attract more investment in the sector. But to haul all that grain to market, Macri needs the log jams on the river to end.
The government is studying how to accommodate the growing flotilla plying the waterway without driving up shipping costs - which could cancel out the benefits of the export tax cut to farmers and agricultural businesses.
""The entire river system is at its current limit,"" said Koen Robijns, Argentine operations manager for Jan De Nul, the privately-owned, Luxemburg-based company that operates the Parana and is responsible for dredging.
The grounding in January made commerce grind to a halt, Robijns said in an interview aboard one of the company's dredging vessels near Argentina's main grains hub of Rosario, some 300 kilometers northwest of Buenos Aires.
""Every ship behind it, all the way up to Rosario, had to stop or slow down for more than an hour,"" he said.
Efforts to develop the waterway to carry more of Argentina's burgeoning exports, however, could be delayed by negotiations between the channel's operator and the traders that ship grain along it.
Jan De Nul favors dredging the channel deeper. The firm declined to provide an estimate on how much that would cost, but the shippers say the bill would be billions of dollars. That would likely mean an increase in the toll, currently $3 per net ton, which the shippers would pass on by paying the farmers less for their grains.
The world's largest bulk grains traders Bunge, Cargill (CARG.UL), Louis Dreyfus Company [AKIRAU.UL] and ADM - who together ship much of the grain exported via the Parana - would prefer the less expensive option of widening the river at trouble spots, said two industry groups representing the shippers and traders using the waterway.
The industry groups declined to give an estimate on how much cheaper it would be to widen rather than deepen the river.
""Rather than dredging deeper, we need wider curves in places where vessels have run aground,"" said Guillermo Wade, a spokesman for the Rosario-based maritime chamber.
Macri's government says it aims to cut the cost of exporting grains by 30 percent, including lowering tolls on waterways. But the government has not said yet which option it favors, and is unlikely to do so until a report on the project is completed.
Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus declined to comment. ADM did not respond to requests for comment.
PUSHING THE LIMIT
Argentina is the world's top exporter of soymeal feed for animals, key to global meat production and meeting the protein needs of a global population growing toward 9 billion. The South American country is also the world's third-largest supplier of corn and soybeans and the seventh largest supplier of wheat.
Macri's government expects farm output of 130 million tonnes this season, up from 123 million before he took office. Macri is targeting 150 million tonnes by the end of his first term in late 2019.
Groundings are becoming more common as exporters, under pressure to haul as much grain as possible, often overload vessels. There were 15 groundings on the waterway last year, up from 12 in 2015 and nine the previous year, according to port data.
The January accident took place in the Mitre section of the Parana, just north of the capital city Buenos Aires.
The same vessel, the Theresa Success, ran aground near Rosario several days earlier. That time, it took longer for tug boats to pry the vessel loose, but traffic was able to move around the blockage as the river was wider there.
Baltzer, the vessel's Rosario-based shipping agency, declined to comment on the groundings.
Other incidents have seen ships stuck for days while floating cranes arrive to unload cargo until vessels are light enough to float.
TOLLS AND TOP OFFS
Jan De Nul has had the Parana concession since 1995. The contract ends in 2021, and the company wants to renew it.
The toll it charges for plying the waterway is negotiated by Jan De Nul, the port terminal owners and the government.
The Parana's shipping canal is maintained at 34 feet from the ocean to the port of San Martin, 35 kilometers north of Rosario, said Pieter Jan De Nul, an area manager for the company and son of its owner.
The firm could easily dredge to 36 feet, he said.
The additional two feet of depth would allow larger vessels carrying several thousand tonnes more cargo to load in Rosario before heading out to sea, he said. Larger cargoes would reduce shipping costs.
Currently, traders have to load part of their cargo in Rosario and then stop to add more in deep-water Atlantic ports before heading into international waters. That means additional port and loading costs, as well as longer shipping times.
The privately-owned Rosario Grains Exchange favors deepening, because larger ships could load and therefore fewer vessels would be needed to carry the rising volume of grains.
""Everyone wins with the deepening of the Parana River,"" analysts for the exchange said in a report.
Deputy Transport Secretary Jorge Metz said the service on the river needs to improve, as delays can cost shippers $40,000 to $50,000 a day, a cost that is eventually passed on to farmers.
Decades of underinvestment in roads and rail have made transportation one of the biggest costs faced by growers, said Martin Fraguio, executive director of the Maizar corn industry chamber.
""Argentina has the possibility of increasing its farm production enormously,"" he said. ""We need the Parana to be as competitive as possible, as soon as possible.""

Republican Doug Burgum ordered demonstrators to leave the camp located on land owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers by Feb. 22, citing safety concerns that have arisen due to accelerated snowmelt and rising water levels of the nearby Cannonball River. 
Burgum also said in his executive order that the camp poses an environmental danger to the surrounding area. His order reaffirms a Feb. 22 deadline set by the Army Corps for the demonstrators to clean up and leave.
Environmentalists and Native Americans who have opposed the pipeline, saying it threatens water resources and sacred sites, have faced a series of set-backs since President Donald Trump took office in January. 

A federal judge on Monday denied a request by Native American tribes seeking to halt construction of the final link of the $3.8 billion pipeline after the Corps of Engineers granted a final easement to Energy Transfer Partners LP last week.

Pruitt is scheduled to face a Senate confirmation vote on Friday. Unless more Republicans join Collins in opposing Pruitt, his nomination is likely to be approved. Republicans hold 52 of the 100 seats in the chamber and Vice President Mike Pence could cast the deciding vote in case of a tie.
""Due to my concerns about Mr. Pruitt's commitment to the mission of the EPA, I will cast my vote in opposition to his confirmation,"" Collins said in a statement.
President Donald Trump has vowed to cut regulation to revive the oil, gas and coal industries, and has said he can do so without compromising air and water quality. 
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approved Pruitt's nomination two weeks ago after Democrats boycotted the vote over concerns about Pruitt's environmental record.
As Oklahoma attorney general, Pruitt sued the EPA more than a dozen times on behalf of the oil-drilling state and he has cast doubts on the science of climate change.
""His actions leave me with considerable doubts about whether his vision for the EPA is consistent with the agency's critical mission to protect human health and the environment,"" Collins said.
She said Pruitt had sued the EPA on issues of importance to Maine, including mercury controls for coal-fired power plants and efforts to reduce cross-state air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.
Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the energy committee, and several other Democrats have asked Senate Leader Mitch McConnell to delay a procedural vote on Pruitt scheduled for Thursday.
They want the vote delayed until after the conclusion of an emergency hearing in Oklahoma to be held at 4 p.m. ET that will consider whether emails between Pruitt's office and officials at oil and gas companies should be released. 
Access to those records was requested by the Center for Media and Democracy, a watchdog group, more than two years ago.
Conservative group FreedomWorks blasted Collins, who also voted against the nomination last week of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Pence's vote was needed to break a tie before DeVos was confirmed.

FreedomWorks Chief Executive Adam Brandon said in a statement it was ""a shame"" that Collins was again aligning herself with ""far-left Democrats and special interests.""

On the New York Mercantile Exchange Crude Oil Futures for March delivery eased 0.11% to $53.05 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent was last quoted at $55.70, up 0.09%.
Last week oilfield services firm Baker Hughes said the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by 8 last week, the 14th gain in 15 weeks.
Overnight, crude futures struggled for direction on Wednesday but ultimately settled lower after the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a larger-than-expected rise in crude inventories, which rose 9.5 million barrels last week, nearly three times more than forecast.
Total U.S. crude inventories rose to 518.12 million barrels, which is at the upper limit of the average range for this time of the year, according to EIA, while gasoline inventories rose to a record high of 2.8 million.
However, the glut in crude inventories was offset by a decline in crude oil imports and a drop of 689,000 barrels in distillate inventories.
Moves in crude prices were volatile throughout the session, as the EIA’s latest report does little to calm fears that increased drilling activity from both U.S. crude and shale oil producers will underpinned OPEC and other producers’ efforts to combat the demand and supply imbalance in the industry.
The EIA predicts U.S. shale oil production will rise by a total of 80,000 barrels a day to 4.87 million barrels a day in March – the highest rate of shale oil production since May last year.
On Monday the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers, including Russia, confirmed in a report that its members were in high compliance with last year’s agreed production cut.
The oil cartel and other exporters including Russia trimmed output in January by 1.7 million barrels a day – close to the agreed cut of almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd).

830,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2017 08:19PM ET</span>",Proposed border tax could harm U.S.-Mexico energy trade: official,"By David Alire Garcia and Adriana Barrera
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A border tax floated by aides to U.S. President Donald Trump is ""not a good idea"" for bilateral energy trade, a senior Mexican official said on Wednesday, also confirming that Mexico's second-ever deepwater oil auction would happen this year.
A 20 percent border tax on Mexican imports to the United States has been pitched by the Trump administration as one way to force Mexico to pay for a new border wall, a top campaign promise.
Separately, a so-called border adjustment tax has been proposed by the new administration and its Republican allies in Congress that in theory would tax imports but not exports.
Both proposed taxes face opposition from U.S. oil refiners and automakers, among other sectors, warning they would raise consumer prices.
""We don't see this kind of a tax as a good idea,"" said Aldo Flores, Mexico's deputy energy minister for hydrocarbons.
""Our position continues to be that free trade and the free flow of these goods has benefited both countries, strengthening the energy security of both,"" he said.
Relations between the United States and Mexico are especially tense as Trump has threatened to upend nearly a quarter century of free trade, deport millions of illegal immigrants and build his signature border wall while getting Mexico to pay it, something the Mexican government has said it will not do.
For decades, the two neighbors have nurtured a robust cross-border energy trade, with crude oil produced by state company Pemex sold to U.S. refiners, while American producers sell natural gas and fuels like gasoline and diesel to Mexican buyers.
Last year, the total value of U.S. energy exports to Mexico totaled $20.2 billion, while Mexico exported mostly crude oil worth $8.7 billion to the United States, in a reversal of the historic balance of energy trade between the two countries, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.
Similarly, Mexico's crude shipments could be pressured if the United States approves the new Trump-backed permit for TransCanada's (TO:TRP) proposed Keystone XL pipeline and the project brings new supplies of Canadian heavy crude to U.S. refineries.
""Supposing that (the pipeline) is completed, that changes the competitive playing field for Mexican crude,"" said Flores, adding that producers of oil in Mexico would have to be more creative in how they market their output.
DEEPWATER AUCTION
Mexican and Canadian heavy crudes have competed for years for buyers among U.S. Gulf coast refineries.
While Mexico's oil regulator is planning three new oil auctions later this year, covering shallow water and onshore fields, a new deepwater auction is also planned.
""It will be toward the end of the year,"" said Flores, who also sits on the Pemex board and took over as deputy energy minister in August.
He declined to specify where the deepwater blocks would be located.
Flores added that a first-ever auction of shale oil and gas blocks would ""probably"" be scheduled, noting that necessary regulations would be published before the end of the year.
Last year, Mexico concluded four first-ever oil auctions, part of a landmark energy opening finalized in 2014 that ended Pemex's decades-long monopoly, including a December deepwater auction that awarded 10 blocks to a wide range of international oil majors.

While Mexican crude output has declined over the past dozen years from a peak of 3.4 million barrels per day, Flores said he expected output to total 1.9 million to 2.0 million bpd in 2018, similar to a forecast of 1.94 million bpd for this year.

Gold’s comeback from its three-month low of $1123.50 set on Dec 1, appears to be at risk as expectations of a March rate hike accelerate. On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in a testimony to congress said that it would be unwise to keep interest rates lower for longer. 
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and Boston Fed President Eric Rosenberg further fueled expectations of a rate hike sooner rather later, as they both said they see at least three-rate hikes this year.
In a rising dollar and higher interest rate environment, gold typically loses its shine among investors as its denominated in dollars and doesn’t yield a rate of return.
Gold shrugged of expectations of an rate hike and bounced off session lows of $1217.50, as the dollar rally fizzled out, which prompted a revival in commodities across the board.

U.S. crude oil inventories jumped 9.5 million barrels last week taking the total to a record 518 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said Wednesday, in line with an industry estimate from the American Petroleum Institute (API) of a 9.94 million barrels build.
Gasoline stocks rose 2.8 million barrel and distillate stockpiles fell by 689,000 barrels, in line with forecasts, EIA said. Last week, crude oil inventories in the U.S. jumped by 13.8 million barrels, the EIA said, a surprise above the expected 2.8 million barrels gain. Also last week, API reported a 14.23 million barrels build in crude stocks.
The builds come against more upbeat estimates of reduce oil output globally.
On Monday, OPEC said output by the cartel members in January fell 890,000 barrels per day (bpd) from December to 32.14 million (bpd), putting the supply and demand balance globally on track to even out this year from a glut.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil turned negative Wednesday, as falling gasoline futures weighed down crude prices on concerns that oversupply in the U.S. would limit the effect of OPEC's record compliance with its supply-cut accord.
U.S. crude stocks rose 9.5 million barrels last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said, nearly three times more than forecast, but confirming a trade group's report late Tuesday of a larger-than-expected build. [EIA/S]
U.S. crude inventories hit a peak at 518.12 million barrels, while gasoline stocks also touched a record, rising 2.8 million barrels to 259.1 million barrels, according to the EIA.
Gasoline futures (RBc1) fell 0.66 cents a gallon, or 0.45 percent, by 11:35 a.m. ET (1635 GMT).
""Gasoline is playing a leading role in trade action,"" said Tony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging. ""With the excess supply of gasoline, particularly on the East Coast, that's substantial."" 
Brent crude (LCOc1) futures fell 30 cents to $55.67 a barrel. U.S. crude (CLc1) futures dipped 26 cents to $52.94 a barrel.
""The U.S. witnessed yet another week of higher-than-expected stock builds; nonetheless, the build was less than last week’s, which helped prices recoup some of the earlier losses,"" said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy's Global Gas Analytics in London. 
""A build in gasoline stock is in tandem with seasonal norms and further builds are expected in the coming weeks as demand for the fuel remains low."" 
To support prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, are cutting output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day in the first half of 2017.
Although OPEC has made a strong start in complying with the cuts, rising U.S. stocks and a revival of U.S. oil output have limited the price rise.
OPEC in January delivered record compliance of over 90 percent with its output curbs, according to estimates from the International Energy Agency and figures collected by OPEC's headquarters. 
Within OPEC, adherence is mixed. Top exporter Saudi Arabia, keen to make the deal work, said it cut output by more than the amount called for by the agreement.
BMI Research, in a report, said a compliance rate of just 40 percent by Iraq, OPEC's second-biggest producer, ""could prove problematic to group cohesion."" 

Russia and the other non-OPEC producers have so far delivered smaller cutbacks. The oil minister of Oman, one of the participating non-OPEC countries, said he expected compliance to improve.

Crude oil  for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 23 cents, or around 0.4%, to $52.97 a barrel by 10:35AM ET (15:35GMT). Prices were at around $53.06 prior to the release of the inventory data.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 28 cents, or about 0.5%, to $55.64 a barrel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 9.5 million barrels in the week ended February 10. Market analysts' expected a crude-stock gain of 3.5 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply increase of 9.9 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 702,000 barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 518.1 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be at the upper limit of the average range for this time of year.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 2.8 million barrels, compared to expectations for a drop 752,000 barrels.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a decline of 689,000 barrels.
Futures have been trading in a narrow range around the lower-to-mid-$50s over the past month as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers and expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production.
U.S. drilling activity has risen by almost 7% since mid-2016, taking it back to levels seen in late 2014, when strong U.S. crude output contributed to a collapse in oil prices.
The revival in U.S. drilling has raised concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade as global producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
Latest data showed the group’s production in January declined by 890,000 barrels a day from the previous month to 32.14 million barrels a day. The drop indicates a 90% compliance level so far by producers who had agreed to curtail their output.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.

Prices of the heating fuel sank to $2.887 on Tuesday, a level not seen since November 21, amid forecasts for warmer weather in key regions across the U.S. during the next few weeks.
The natural-gas market is on the defensive in recent days after forecasting models showed cold air exiting the Northeast, with the updated 6-10 day forecast looking warmer than a day ago.
Prices of the heating fuel are down almost 21% since the start of the year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Natural gas markets have been volatile in recent weeks, changing course rapidly in response to shifting outlooks in short-term weather patterns.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw of 130 billion cubic feet in the week ended February 10.
That compares with a withdrawal of 152 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 163 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 156 billion cubic feet.

840,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2017 06:21AM ET</span>","Spanish lettuce shortage likely to continue into March, say farmers","By Emma Pinedo and Francisco Bonilla
LOS ALCAZARES, Spain (Reuters) - A shortage of iceberg lettuce is likely to continue into March, Spanish farmers say, because freak weather conditions in the south of the country early in the agricultural year prevented the planting of seedlings to replace ruined crops.
The southern region of Murcia, where most Spanish lettuce grown for export is cultivated, suffered the worst floods in two decades followed by its first snow storm in over 30 years in December and January.
""This has been extraordinary, it's not normal to have so many problems at once,"" said Jose Antonio Canovas, a farmer and salesman in Murcia for Kernel Export, which grows, packages and delivers a range of vegetables from cauliflower to broccoli.
The ruined harvest and subsequent shortage of produce has led some British supermarkets like  Tesco  (L:TSCO) and  Sainsbury  (L:SBRY) to ration iceberg lettuces to three per visit. The limited supply follows a shortage of courgettes in Britain and supplies of broccoli and aubergines have also been affected.
Vegetable production in the European Union has fallen to 60 percent of normal levels in recent weeks due to bad weather affecting producers across the Mediterranean, from Greece to Spain, Spanish exporters say. Spain accounts for around half of EU vegetable exports.
Not only did floods and snow ruin crops, leaving lettuces ready for harvest withered and battered in the fields, but the bad weather prevented the planting of polytunnel-grown seedlings which meant more delays to the next harvest of Spain's biggest fruit and vegetable export after tomatoes.
""We have notified our customers that there may be production delays in March because the planting of seedlings has been delayed and in the rush to supply the market some crops were picked ahead of time,"" said Fernando Gomez, general manager of The Murcian Federation of Producers and Exporters of Fruit and Vegetables (Proexport).
The production of lettuces, one of the most badly affected crops, has fallen by up to a third in the peak winter months of production when Spain harvests over 100,000 tonnes of the 700,000 tonnes it exports annually.
Production is likely to return to normal by the end of March or the beginning of April, Proexport's Gomez said.
Many farmers in the area do not insure their crops. In a sector with very slim profit margins of between 1.5 and 4 percent, profit relies on big volumes. Higher prices have not made up for the losses farmers have suffered.
Alongside the hit from ruined crops, the hiring of specialized labor to work the flooded and frozen fields has also eaten into profit margins at farms.

The 2,500-member union at BHP Billiton (LON:BLT)'s Escondida mine has been on strike since Thursday. Labor leaders say they are far from reaching an agreement, and BHP has already said it will not be able to fulfill copper delivery contracts.
The stoppage at Escondida, combined with export issues at Freeport-McMoRan Inc's Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia, the world's second-largest, have sent prices for the metal to 20-month highs amid supply concerns.
Workers at mines representing around 12 percent of global output are due to renegotiate contracts in Chile in 2017, with any stoppage likely to affect volatile copper prices.
Escondida's labor relations have long been fractious, and strikes paralyzed the mine in 2011 and 2006, when previous collective labor contracts were renegotiated.
This time, negotiations stalled in part because of a freshly minted labor code that aims to return power lost by unions decades ago, people with knowledge of the talks told Reuters.
The law does not take effect until April, but its provisions and language have influenced the union's negotiating position.
Last year, the center-left government of President Michelle Bachelet passed the sweeping, complex reform to strengthen the hand of organized labor, which government supporters say never recovered from suppression under the 1973-1990 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.
Union sources say workers broke off wage talks with Escondida in part because they believed the company was using underhanded tactics to dilute the impact of that reform.
BHP declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.
But one legal source with knowledge of BHP's negotiating strategy said the reform had effectively narrowed the pay and benefit proposals the company could successfully take to the union.
The situation at Escondida bodes ill for other mining companies ahead of wage talks expected elsewhere in Chile this year.  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc and  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc's Collahuasi mine and Barrick Gold Corp and Antofogasta Plc's Zaldivar mine are among those on that list.
Those two mines account for about a half-million tonnes per year of copper output and more than 2 percent of global supply.
Labor leaders at both deposits said they had good relationships with management. They added, however, they would use the powers granted them in the reform in the coming negotiations.
""It brings some rather powerful tools to the workers' movement,"" said Raul Torres, president of Zaldivar's main union.
An  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) spokeswoman said the company was already working with unions to define what activities a company can perform during a legal strike under the reform. Collahuasi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Escondida, majority-controlled by BHP with minority participations by  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) and Japanese companies including Mitsubishi Corp, produced about 5 percent of the world's copper alone last year.
LEGAL COMPLEXITIES
At Escondida, a principal point of contention between the company and workers is a proposal by BHP to offer new workers fewer benefits than those awarded to laborers already at the mine, the union said. The union says this is a BHP ploy to undermine a provision in the new labor code.
Under that provision, known as the minimum-floor rule, a company will not be permitted during wage talks to offer workers benefits weaker than those afforded in the previous contract.
If junior workers have fewer benefits than their colleagues, that could lower the negotiating floor for the next round of wage talks, years down the road, union leaders say.
""It's very probable that the company intends to lower benefits (for new workers) so that the next negotiation starts with what that established,"" union spokesman Carlos Allendes said.
""(For us) that's the last straw, the last thrashes of a drowning man.""
Other aspects of the law, such as provisions that give unions greater powers over nonunionized workers, were also affecting negotiations, the legal source said, and workers were adopting the language of the new rules.
""The words that were put into the labor reform have become the words of the union,"" added the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the talks.
Workers have also said that if the strike stretches into April, when the reform goes into effect, they would need to examine what additional demands to make, if any.
However, under Chilean law, the negotiation would largely continue under the old regulations, so the concrete benefits of holding out until the reform takes effect would be limited, lawyers say.
The labor reform passed Congress last April after a bruising battle that opened up divisions within the governing coalition. But a constitutional court struck down several sections of the legislation, leaving lawyers uncertain about how much of the reform can be implemented.
A government representative was not immediately available to comment for this story, but proponents of the law say more workers' protections are needed to battle Chile's biting inequality.
Industry analysts are watching negotiations at Escondida and elsewhere for a sense of how the reform will play out throughout Chile's economy.
""In some respects, this strike is a kind of transition between the old system and the new,"" said Juan Carlos Guajardo, president of Chilean copper consultancy Plusmining.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Soros Fund Management LLC got out of gold in the fourth quarter of 2016 while Paulson & Co reduced its stake in SPDR Gold Trust (P:GLD), as bullion prices saw their weakest quarterly performance in 3-1/2 years, regulatory filings showed on Tuesday.
The firm that invests the personal fortune of billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros eliminated its shares in Barrick Gold Corp in the October to December period, the fund's last remaining stake in bullion after dissolving its shares in the world's biggest gold exchange-traded fund SPDR Gold Trust in the previous quarter.
New York-based Paulson & Co, led by longtime gold bull John Paulson, cut its stake in SPDR Gold Trust to 4.4 million shares, worth $478 million, from 4.8 million shares, worth $600 million, at the end of the third quarter, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Spot gold prices fell to a 10-1/2-month low at $1,122.35 an ounce in December, following the U.S. presidential election and after the U.S. Federal Reserve sounded an unexpectedly hawkish note on U.S. interest rates.
Paulson held stakes unchanged in AngloGold Ashanti Ltd, IAMGold Corp and RandGold Resources Ltd, but reduced them in NovaGold Resources Inc, the filings showed.
In the fourth quarter, spot gold prices dropped 12.5 percent, their biggest quarterly tumble in 3-1/2 years. Prices rallied briefly after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election in early November, but then fell. 
By early February, prices reached a three-month high as attention shifted to worries over Trump's policies and political risks posed by elections in Europe.

Earlier this month CI Investments Inc, an investment manager of Toronto-based CI Financial Corp, reported that it also cut shares in SPDR Gold Trust and dissolved shares in Barrick Gold, though it held onto some of its shares of option calls in the miner.

849,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2017 12:09PM ET</span>",Oil pares gains as U.S. supply concerns overshadow OPEC cuts,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil pared gains on Tuesday as concerns about rising supply from U.S. shale output overshadowed an OPEC-led effort to cut global output, which has supported oil prices in a higher range. 
Brent crude was 61 cents higher at $56.20 a barrel by 11:30 Eastern (1530 GMT), after earlier rising to $56.46 a barrel. U.S. light crude was up 45 cents at $53.38.
The two benchmarks fell 2 percent on Monday. They are both now near the middle of $5-per-barrel trading ranges seen since early December.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters including Russia have agreed to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of 2017 in a bid to rein in a global fuel supply overhang.
The market has largely priced in the production cuts that OPEC and other producers agreed to in November, leaving little room for prices to break out of the range, said Tariq Zahir, managing member of Tyche Capital in New York. 
""It would take either a supply outage or serious cuts to move it,"" he said. ""The first month, obviously, OPEC is going to do the best it can, but after that, let's see what the second and third month bring."" 
Rising production in the United States, where increased drilling activity especially by shale oil producers, has undermined these efforts. U.S. crude output is up 6.5 percent since mid-2016 to 8.98 million bpd, its highest level since April last year. .
U.S. shale oil production for March is expected to rise by the most in five months to 4.87 million bpd, its highest rate of since May last year, government data showed on Monday.
""Oil just appears to be caught in a range at the moment and mainly focused on those supply considerations,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.
Although OPEC countries are largely sticking to their agreement with compliance around 90 percent, investors suspect the cuts may not be maintained, preventing them from having a bigger impact on prices. 
""OPEC producers want the market to believe they will stick to the agreed production freeze (cut). But lessons from the past have made the market deeply suspicious,"" said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) Bank in Amsterdam.
Many analysts say oil producers will have to cut production more quickly to drain the global oversupply this year.
""Based on OPEC’s own numbers the message is loud and clear,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at London broker PVM Oil Associates.

""Improve on compliance, cut production further and extend the deal for the second half of the year if you want to avoid yet another year of global oil inventory builds.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are buying up physical cobalt anticipating that shortages of the metal, a key component of lithium-ion batteries used in electrical cars, will spur prices to their highest levels since the 2008 financial crisis.
Prices for cobalt metal have climbed nearly 50 percent since September to five-year peaks around $19 a lb as stricter emissions controls boost demand for electric vehicles, especially in China, struggling with ruinous pollution levels in some cities. (For a graphic on how Lithium-ion battery works click http://tmsnrt.rs/2kOUBNQ)
Consultants CRU Group say electric car and plug-in hybrid vehicle sales could hit 4.4 million in 2021 and more than six million by 2025, from 1.1 million last year. 
By 2020, 75 percent of lithium-ion batteries will contain cobalt, whose properties allow electric cars to extend their range between charges, according to eCobalt Solutions, which produces battery grade cobalt salts.
Some 98 percent of cobalt is produced as a by-product of copper and nickel output, so for investors pure equity exposure to cobalt is tricky. 
""Cobalt isn't going to massively impact share prices. The funds looked at LME (London Metal Exchange) cobalt contracts, but they aren't liquid enough for the millions they want to invest,"" a Europe-based cobalt trader said.
""So they are buying cobalt with the intention of sitting on it until prices rise, looking for $25 (a lb) or more.""
Swiss-based Pala Investments, a fund focused on the mining sector, and Shanghai Chaos Investment, one of China's largest commodities funds, bought cobalt last year, industry sources familiar with the matter said, declining to specify amounts. 
Pala Investments declined to comment, while calls to Shanghai Chaos went unanswered.
""Future demand for cobalt from the EV (electric vehicle) sector is looking tangible and is more positive than originally expected,"" one commodity-focused fund manager said. ""China has some aggressive plans in terms of electric vehicles...It will be a major driver behind cobalt consumption growth."" (For a graphic on cobalt prices vs light vehicle sales click China's State Reserves Bureau, in charge of building the country's stocks of commodities from oil to rare earth minerals, bought 5,000 tonnes of cobalt metal last year and in 2015, traders said. It is expected to buy more this year.  Highlighting the metal's importance, the U.S.'s Defense Logistics Agency deemed lithium cobalt oxide and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide compounds as strategic and has been stockpiling since 2014. Cobalt is also widely used for superalloys in turbines, space vehicles, rocket engines and power plants. HOARDING After seven years of surplus and overcapacity the market will move into a deficit this year, exacerbated by an insecure supply chain. Almost 60 percent of the world's cobalt lies in politically risky Democratic Republic of Congo. At the same time, many traders are hoarding cobalt, most of it bought when the price was around $10 a lb in Dec. 2015 due to a market surplus of more than 2,000 tonnes. They are waiting for higher prices. On Monday, trader and miner  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) tightened its grip on Congo's copper and cobalt resources by buying the remaining stake in one mine and upping its share in another for $960 million. It said the complex had the potential to become the world's largest cobalt producer. Other copper and cobalt producers include privately owned Eurasian Resources Group, Canada's Sherritt International and China Molybdenum. Canadian small-cap LiCo Energy Metals, which is exploring for materials used in lithium-ion batteries, could appeal to investors looking for exposure to reliable sources of cobalt from a politically stable country. Global total demand for cobalt last year was around 100,000 tonnes, of which around half was used in batteries to power electric cars, as well as mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras and cordless drills.  ""In terms of overall demand, EVs (electric vehicles) only consumed around 6.5 percent of refined cobalt in 2016. This will increase to 16.9 percent in 2021 helping lift demand to nearly 130,000 tonnes,"" CRU senior consultant Edward Spencer said. ""We expect a deficit in the region of 900 tonnes this year. However, a far larger deficit could open quickly if mine and refinery capacity growth fails to keep pace."" Analysts at Macquarie Research expect deficits of 885 tonnes next year, 3,205 in 2019 and 5,340 in 2020.  ""Cobalt has limited new supply projects coming through. Meanwhile refined output in key supply countries such as Australia, Russia and Zambia are well down on levels seen a decade ago,"" Macquarie analyst Colin Hamilton said. ""The global cobalt market is becoming ever more dependent on supply from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where geopolitical risk is again rising...with a transfer of presidential power due next year, a process which has not gone smoothly over history.""

Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (21:30GMT) later on Tuesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock rise of 3.2 million barrels.
Crude oil for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 71 cents, or around 1.4%, to $53.65 a barrel by 9:25AM ET (14:25GMT), after losing 93 cents, or 1.7%, a day earlier.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rose 82 cents, or about 1.5%, to $56.41 a barrel. The global benchmark lost $1.11, or nearly 2%, on Monday.
Futures have been trading in a narrow $5 range around the lower-to-mid-$50s since December as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers and expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production.
U.S. drilling activity has risen by almost 7% since mid-2016, taking it back to levels seen in late 2014, when strong U.S. crude output contributed to a collapse in oil prices.
The revival in U.S. drilling has raised concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade as global producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
Latest data showed the group’s production in January declined by 890,000 barrels a day from the previous month to 32.14 million barrels a day. The drop indicates a 90% compliance level so far by producers who had agreed to curtail their output.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.

Natural gas for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange sank to a session low of $2.903 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since November 21.
It was last at $2.916 by 8:45AM ET (13:45GMT), down 2.9 cents, or around 1%, after losing 9.0 cents, or about 3%, a day earlier.
The natural-gas market is on the defensive after forecasting models showed cold air exiting the Northeast, with the updated 6-10 day forecast looking warmer than a day ago.
Prices of the heating fuel are down almost 23% since the start of the year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.
Natural gas markets have been volatile in recent weeks, changing course rapidly in response to shifting outlooks in short-term weather patterns.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 122 and 133 billion cubic feet in the week ended February 10.
That compares with a withdrawal of 152 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 163 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 156 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.559 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 11.3% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 1.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.

Combined, the mines produce roughly 10% of the world's total copper supply.
Copper for March delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped 0.2 cents, or around 0.1%, to trade at $2.781 a pound by 8:20AM ET (13:20GMT), after rising 1.5 cents, or about 0.6%, a day earlier.
Nymex copper rallied to $2.823 on Monday, the most in 20 months.
Meanwhile, three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange shed 0.2% to $6,113.25 a metric ton after rising to $6.202.25 in the prior session.
Workers at the Escondida mine in northern Chile have been on strike since last Thursday after talks between management and workers broke down.
The workers union has warned that the strike could be lengthy, potentially affecting global supplies.
The mine, which is owned by BHP Billiton, produces roughly 5% of the world's total copper supply.
Prices received additional support after Freeport-McMoRan said that an export ban remains in place at its Grasberg mine in Indonesia, the world's second biggest, because it has not yet reached agreement with the government on a new mining permit.
That comes against a backdrop of encouraging demand signals from China, which posted much stronger-than-expected trade data for January as demand picked up at home and abroad.
The Asian nation is the world’s largest copper consumer, accounting for nearly 45% of world consumption.

Crude oil for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 38 cents, or around 0.8%, to $53.36 a barrel by 4:10AM ET (09:10GMT), after losing 93 cents, or 1.7%, a day earlier.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London inched up 50 cents, or about 0.9%, to $56.09 a barrel. The global benchmark lost $1.11, or nearly 2%, on Monday.
Futures have been trading in a narrow range around the lower-to-mid-$50s over the past month as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers and expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production.
U.S. drilling activity has risen by almost 7% since mid-2016, taking it back to levels seen in late 2014, when strong U.S. crude output contributed to a collapse in oil prices.
The revival in U.S. drilling has raised concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade as global producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
Latest data showed the group’s production in January declined by 890,000 barrels a day from the previous month to 32.14 million barrels a day. The drop indicates a 90% compliance level so far by producers who had agreed to curtail their output.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for March rose 2.0 cents, or 1.3%, to $1.564 a gallon, while March heating oil added 1.5 cents ,or 1%, to $1.642 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for March delivery slumped 2.7 cents, or 0.9%, to $2.917 per million British thermal units, the lowest in 12 weeks, as forecasts continued to call for mostly warmer-than-normal weather in key regions across the U.S. for the rest of the winter.

Gold for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up $2.55, or about 0.2%, to $1,228.35 a troy ounce by 3:15AM ET (08:15GMT), after losing $10.10, or around 0.8%, a day earlier.
Prices of the yellow metal fell to a one-week low of $1,220.30 on Monday as investors piled into the U.S. dollar and stocks amid optimism over President Donald Trump's economic agenda.
Since the election, the Fed has taken a back seat to the market optimism around the pro-growth tax and stimulus policies of President Trump.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen is set to deliver her semi-annual monetary policy testimony on the economy before Senate and House committees in Washington DC.
Yellen is scheduled to testify on the economy before the Senate Banking Committee at 10:00AM ET (15:00GMT) Tuesday. On Wednesday, she will appear in front the House Financial Services Committee also at 10AM ET.
Her comments will be monitored closely for any new insight on policy and the timing of when it might raise interest rates.
Investors will also keep an eye out on a number of U.S. economic reports in the week ahead, including the January producer price index on Tuesday, the January consumer price index and retail sales on Wednesday and housing-related data on Thursday.
The Fed left borrowing costs unchanged earlier this month and gave no firm signal on the timing of its next rate hike.
Fed fund futures are pricing in a less than 15% chance of a rate hike in March, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool, while odds of a June increase was seen at around 60%.
The U.S. central bank has previously projected three rate increases this year. However, traders remained unconvinced, with markets continuing to price in just two rate hikes during the course of this year.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for March delivery tacked on 2.2 cents, or 0.1%, to $17.84 a troy ounce.
Meanwhile, platinum added 0.1% to $1,001.10, while palladium rose 0.5% to $778.65 an ounce.
Elsewhere in metals trading, copper futures jumped 1.2 cents, or about 0.4%, to $2.795 a pound.
Prices of the red metal rallied to a 20-month peak of $2.822 on Monday amid concerns over a disruption to global supplies after strikes at BHP Billiton (LON:BLT)'s Chilean Escondida and Freeport-McMoran (NYSE:FCX)'s Indonesian Grasberg mine.
Combined, the mines produce roughly 10% of the world's total copper supply.

Also on the Comex, silver futures for March delivery rose 0.12% to $17.843 a troy ounce, while copper futures gained 0.25% to $2.791 a pound amid concerns over an ongoing strike at the Escondida copper mine in Chile, the largest in the world. The mine produces roughly 5% of the world's total copper supply.
Investors also noted China's consumer inflation rate quickened to 2.5% in January from a year earlier, the highest since May 2014 and a faster pace than expected.
Overnight, gold prices were slightly lower as recent actions by U.S. President Donald Trump helped soothe investor worries about uncertainty surrounding the new administration’s controversial policies.
Prices of the yellow metal rallied to a three-month high of $1,246.60 last week amid growing concerns over political risks in Europe and economic uncertainty in the U.S. But futures pulled back as markets shifted focus back on Trump's efforts to boost economic growth after the president said his administration would be announcing ""something phenomenal in terms of tax"" over ""the next two or three weeks"" during a meeting with airline executives last Thursday.
Meanwhile, a closely watched two-day U.S.-Japan summit held over the weekend was seen to have ended smoothly, further supporting sentiment. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appeared to have established a quick friendship, allaying investor fears of the meeting ending acrimoniously with Trump talking tough on trade, currency and security issues.

On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent for April delivery rose 0.41% to $55.79 a barrel. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in March gained 0.32% to $53.10 a barrel.
Overnight, oil settled weaker in the U.S. on Monday after a forecast by the government showed an expected higher production level from U.S. shale drillers in response to higher prices.
Shale oil output in the U.S. is expected to grow by 79,000 barrels per day by March, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Monday, taking the overall output levels in the U.S. to 4.83 million bpd .
The forecast comes as OPEC said earlier Monday that overall output by the cartel members in the pact in January fell 890,000 barrels per day (bpd) from December to 32.14 million (bpd), putting the supply and demand balance globally on track to even out this year from a glut. The figures, estimates from industry sources, are seen as the most official view of the success so far of the OPEC leg of a pact the has helped keep oil prices steadily above $50 a barrel for the past two months.
Two of the 11 OPEC member, Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the cuts, while Iran has been allowed a higher production quota within the overall effort.
OPEC said that of the members with target cuts totalling 29.888 million bpd for January, the average was 84,000 bpd above the target, implying a 93% compliance rate, or about 1.16 million bpd, compared to the 1.2 million average sought for OPEC on average in the first half of this year.
An additional 558,000 bpd is coming from non-OPEC nations led by Russia.
Last week, oil futures finished sharply higher, though figures on U.S. rig counts held back further gains.
Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by 8 last week, the 14th gain in 15 weeks.

861,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2017 05:13PM ET</span>",Judge denies tribes' request to block final link in Dakota pipeline,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Monday denied a request by Native American tribes seeking to halt construction of the final link in the Dakota Access Pipeline, the controversial project that has sparked months of protests by activists aimed at stopping the 1,170-mile line. 
At a hearing, Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., rejected the request from the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, who argued that the project would prevent them from practicing religious ceremonies at a lake they contend is surrounded by sacred ground. 
With this decision, legal options for the tribes continue to narrow, as construction on the final uncompleted stretch is currently proceeding. 
Last week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers granted a final easement to  Energy Transfer Partners LP  (N:ETP), which is building the $3.8 billion pipeline (DAPL), after President Donald Trump issued an order to advance the project days after he took office in January. 
Another hearing is scheduled for Feb. 27, as the tribes seek an injunction ordering the Army Corps to withdraw the easement. 
Lawyers for the Cheyenne River Sioux and the Standing Rock Sioux wanted Judge Boasberg to block construction with a temporary restraining order on the grounds that the pipeline would obstruct the free exercise of their religious practices. 
“We’re disappointed with today’s ruling denying a temporary restraining order against the Dakota Access Pipeline, but we are not surprised,"" Chase Iron Eyes, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, said in a statement.
The company needs to build a 1,100-foot (335 meter) connection in North Dakota under Lake Oahe, part of the Missouri River system, to complete the pipeline. 
The line would run from oilfields in the Northern Plains of North Dakota to the Midwest, and then to refineries along the Gulf of Mexico, and could be operating by early May. 
Judge Boasberg ordered Energy Transfer Partners to update the court on Monday and every week thereafter on when oil is expected to flow beneath Lake Oahe. 
The company did not respond to requests for comment.
Iron Eyes said during an earlier conference call that the pipeline would also cause economic harm to Native Americans.
In his statement, he said the tribe was still seeking an injunction against the pipeline, which would also be heard in Boasberg's court. They also are continuing to push for a full environmental impact statement that was ordered in the last days of the Obama Administration.
""We continue to believe that both the tribes and the public should have meaningful input and participation in that process,"" he said.
Thousands of tribe members, environmentalists and others set up camps last year on Army Corps land in the North Dakota plains as protests intensified. In December, the Obama Administration denied the last permit needed by Energy Transfer Partners, but with Trump's stated support of the pipeline that victory was short-lived for the tribes.
The Army Corps has said it would close remaining camps on federal lands along the Cannonball River in North Dakota after Feb. 22. 
Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, one of the primary groups protesting the pipeline, said people would continue to leave the main camp. He said he expected more demonstrations around the country. 

Only a few hundred protesters remained, and crews have been removing tipis and yurts. The Standing Rock tribe has asked protesters to leave.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell more than 1 percent on Monday after an OPEC report showing high compliance with last year's landmark production- cut deal underwhelmed investors while signs of rising U.S. crude output continued to weigh on prices.
Global benchmark Brent crude futures were down 96 cents at $55.74 a barrel at 1518 GMT and touched a session low of $55.65. 
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 82 cents at $53.04 a barrel and traded as low as $53.01 earlier in the day.
""The good compliance rate of OPEC seems to be priced in. The U.S. rig count from Friday is weighing, the numbers support the shale comeback story,"" said Frank Klumpp, oil analyst at Stuttgart-based Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.
U.S. oil drillers over the past month have added the most drilling rigs since 2012, bringing the total to 591 rigs, the highest since October 2015, oil services company Baker Hughes said in a weekly report.
Speculators cut net long positions on Brent last week by 10,000 contracts, weekly ICE data showed, highlighting investor concerns about rising U.S. production. 
In turn, bullish gasoil bets rose to their highest level in four years as demand is expected to increase due to cold weather and maintenance.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, agreed late last year to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of 2017.
The group's first official data since then showed on Monday that OPEC member Saudi Arabia had cut more deeply than expected, taking compliance in the first month following the agreement to as high as 93 percent.
Crude supply from the 11 OPEC members with production targets under the deal fell to 29.888 million bpd in January, according to figures from secondary sources which OPEC uses to monitor its output.
But high compliance had been expected and the report failed to push oil prices into positive territory on Monday.

Analysts at ABN Amro are skeptical about production cuts delivering higher oil prices and reduced Brent forecasts for the first half of this year to $50 from $55 a barrel.

Workers at the Escondida mine in northern Chile have been on strike since last Thursday after talks between management and workers broke down.
The workers union has warned that the strike could be lengthy, potentially affecting global supplies.

Prices of the yellow metal rallied to a three-month high of $1,246.60 last week amid growing concerns over political risks in Europe and economic uncertainty in the U.S.
But futures pulled back as markets shifted focus back on Trump's efforts to boost economic growth after the president said his administration would be announcing ""something phenomenal in terms of tax"" over ""the next two or three weeks"" during a meeting with airline executives last Thursday.
Meanwhile, a closely watched two-day U.S.-Japan summit held over the weekend was seen to have ended smoothly, further supporting sentiment.
Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appeared to have established a quick friendship, allaying investor fears of the meeting ending acrimoniously with Trump talking tough on trade, currency and security issues.
The market's near-term focus was on Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's congressional testimony scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. Her comments will be monitored closely for any new insight on policy and the timing of when it might raise interest rates.
Investors will also keep an eye out on a number of U.S. economic reports in the week ahead, including the January producer price index on Tuesday, the January consumer price index and retail sales on Wednesday and housing-related data on Thursday.
The Fed left borrowing costs unchanged earlier this month and gave no firm signal on the timing of its next rate hike.
Fed fund futures are pricing in a less than 15% chance of a rate hike in March, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. However, odds of a June increase was seen at more than 65%.
The U.S. central bank has previously projected three rate increases this year. However, traders remained unconvinced, with markets continuing to price in just two rate hikes during the course of this year.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for March delivery tacked on 2.0 cents, or 0.1%, to $17.95 a troy ounce after rising to $18.01 earlier, the most since November 11.
Meanwhile, platinum added 0.2% to $1,013.85, while palladium shed 0.2% to $781.48 an ounce.
Elsewhere in metals trading, copper futures jumped 2.0 cents, or about 0.7%, to $2.789 a pound.
Prices of the red metal rallied to a 20-month peak of $2.822 earlier amid concerns over an ongoing strike at the Escondida copper mine in Chile, the largest in the world.
The mine produces roughly 5% of the world's total copper supply.

872,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2017 02:32AM ET</span>","Exclusive: China mulls radical output cuts, port coal ban in war on smog - document","By Meng Meng and Josephine Mason
BEIJING (Reuters) - China is considering forcing steel and aluminum producers to cut more output, banning coal in one of the country's top ports and shutting some fertilizer and drug plants as Beijing intensifies its war on smog, a draft policy document shows.
The Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) has proposed the measures in the document seen by Reuters. If implemented, they would be some of the most radical steps so far to tackle air quality in the country's most polluted cities.
The move comes after China's northeast has battled some of the worst pollution in years as emissions from heavy industry, coal burning in winter and increased transport have left major cities including Beijing blanketed in thick smog.
The document outlines plans to cut steel and fertilizer capacity by at least half and aluminum capacity by at least 30 percent in 28 cities across five regions from around late November to late February.
By July, it would stop Tianjin, one of the nation's busiest ports, handling coal, with shipments diverted to Tangshan, 130 kms (80 miles) to the north, which would shift large volumes of coal transport from trucks to rail.
Tianjin, China's second largest by cargo volume, is the key hub for trading 100 million tonnes a year of seaborne coal and domestic coal that flows south from Inner Mongolia, the report said.
By September, ports in Hebei province would not be allowed to use trucks to carry coal from railways to ships.
Based on the cuts over three months, the measures would reduce China's total annual steel output by 8 percent annually and aluminum output by 17 percent, according to Reuters calculations.
A source with direct knowledge of the proposal said the environmental watchdog has distributed the draft to relevant local governments and companies seeking reaction.
The Ministry declined to comment on the draft. The Ministry of Transportation did not respond to requests for comment. 
It's not known when the Ministry expects to decide on whether to implement the plan, one of the most extreme since the government launched its offensive on pollution three years ago.
FUELLING RALLIES
If introduced, the steps would likely further support rallies in aluminum, steel and coal prices, which have been buoyed by China's efforts to shut excess capacity and clean up polluting sectors.
Highlighting the difficulties enforcing that policy, Greenpeace said on Monday that China's operational steel capacity actually rose in 2016 after a high-profile closure program concentrated on already idled plants.
Still, prolonged cuts in capacity will reignite worries about demand for raw materials like iron ore and coking coal.
The steps will also cause major upheaval for utilities, miners and traders, as they seek alternative routes and storage for their coal.
""I think these proposals are too radical. (The government) hasn't thoroughly considered the likely consequences and solutions to make it happen,"" said a coal trader based in China.
The plans go further than an earlier proposal by Beijing's regional environmental watchdog to ban coal trucks and storage in Tianjin, which it estimated would cost the port 670 million yuan ($97 million) a year in business.
MOST POPULATED, MOST SMOGGY
The five regions affected are some of the most populated and most smog-plagued: Beijing, the port city of Tianjin and the neighboring province of Hebei, as well as Shandong, Shanxi and Henan.
They account for one third of China's crude steel output, while Hebei, Henan and Shandong are the top three aluminum producing regions accounting for around 70 percent of total output.
The Ministry also plans to close pesticide and pharmaceutical factories and fertilizer plants that use urea unless the chemicals and drugs are critically needed for the population, according to the document. 
The news comes as the country's northern regions braces for more heavy smog this week. On Monday, state media reported Chinese cities that sit on three pollution ""highways"" have been told to coordinate efforts to reduce emissions.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude for March delivery rose 1.62% to settle at $53.86 a barrel, while on London's Intercontinental Exchange, Brent gained 1.92% to $55.70 a barrel.
Global oil output dropped 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in January, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday, putting supply and demand on a path to balance later in this year after a major glut of crude on the markiet for nearly two years.
Key to the drop was a coordinated pledge by OPEC and non-OPEC nations led by Russia to trim nearly 1.8 million bpd on averag in the first six months of this year with compliance a touch over 90% in January, led by the world top exporter Saudi Arabia, IEA said.
""Some producers, notably Saudi Arabia, (are) appearing to cut by more than required. This first cut is certainly one of the deepest in the history of OPEC output cut initiatives,"" the Paris-based IEA said.

DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC has delivered more than 90 percent of pledged oil output curbs in January, according to figures the exporter group uses to monitor its supply, making a strong start to implementation of its first production cut in eight years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is cutting its crude output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1 to prop up oil prices (LCOc1) and reduce a supply glut. Russia and 10 other non-OPEC countries agreed to cut half as much.
Supply from the 11 OPEC members with production targets under the deal has fallen to 29.921 million bpd, according to the average assessments of the six secondary sources OPEC uses to monitor its output and which were seen by Reuters. 
This amounts to 92 percent compliance, according to an OPEC calculation -- more than many analysts expected.
""It is encouraging,"" an OPEC source said of the compliance data so far. 
""That's the highest in OPEC history,"" another OPEC source said.
Oil (LCOc1) rose on Friday, trading above $56 a barrel, supported by a report from the International Energy Agency -- one of the six secondary sources OPEC uses -- that put OPEC compliance at a record initial rate of 90 percent. [nL5N1FV1Y2]
The OPEC figure of 92 percent comfortably exceeds the initial 60 percent achieved when OPEC's previous deal was implemented in 2009 and adds to indications that adherence has been high. 
However, the 11 non-OPEC producers that joined the deal have not cut as much, delivering 40 percent of their promised curbs in January, two OPEC sources said, citing OPEC calculations based on data from the IEA. [nL5N1FV5RR]
Non-OPEC's lower compliance figure to date is partly due to the phased implementation of the deal by Russia, the largest non-OPEC producer cooperating with the organisation.
OPEC is scheduled to publish its first assessment of its January production based on the secondary sources in its monthly oil market report on Monday. The figures could be revised before they are published, OPEC sources said.
The group uses two sets of figures to monitor its output -- figures provided by each country and by secondary sources that include industry media. This is a legacy of old disputes over how much countries were really pumping.
OPEC's production cut agreed last year was from levels as assessed by the secondary sources.

The other five secondary sources used by OPEC are oil-pricing agencies Platts and Argus, ‎the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) and industry newsletter Petroleum Intelligence Weekly (PIW).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose nearly 2 percent on Friday after reports that OPEC members delivered more than 90 percent of the output cuts they pledged in a landmark deal that took effect in January.
Supply from the 11 members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with production targets under the deal fell to 29.921 million barrels per day, according to the average assessments of the six secondary sources OPEC uses to monitor output, or a 92 percent compliance.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) - one of OPEC's six sources - said the cuts in January equated to 90 percent of the agreed reductions in output, far higher than the initial 60 percent compliance with a 2009 OPEC deal.
""Some producers, notably Saudi Arabia, (are) appearing to cut by more than required,"" the agency said in a report.
While the deal has boosted oil prices, Capital Economics analysts said in a note, ""we think U.S. production is likely to rebound and that it will be strong growth in demand that will eventually eat into stocks and rebalance the market.""
Global benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) was up $1.07, or 1.92 percent, at $56.70 a barrel by 10:38 a.m. EST (1538 GMT). It touched a session high of $56.76.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) traded up 99 cents, or 1.87 percent, at $53.99 a barrel.
Brent was on track for its first weekly drop in four weeks while U.S. crude headed for its fourth straight week of gains.
Crude has also benefited from recent strength in gasoline prices (RBC1) as a glut seems to be gradually eroding. [EIA/S] 
Gasoline futures were leading the energy complex on Friday, trading up about 2.2 percent. 
The IEA, which advises industrial nations on energy policy, said if current compliance levels hold, the global oil stocks overhang that has weighed on prices should fall by about 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the next six months.
The agency also raised global oil demand growth expectations for 2017 to 1.4 million bpd, up 100,000 bpd from its previous estimate.
Nevertheless, producers will probably have to extend the production cuts beyond six months if they want to achieve their goal of balancing the oil market.
Weekly U.S. rig count data from Baker Hughes later on Friday will indicate whether drillers are continuing to ramp up activity. [RIG/U]
SEB chief commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop said he expected 198 new U.S. oil rigs to come into action in 2017, with 51 added already this year.

""We calculate that one extra rig added today will lead to a stream of new wells which cumulatively will produce 5.3 million barrels to the end of 2019,"" he said.

886,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2017 05:20AM ET</span>",Oil overhang points to need for extended OPEC output cuts,"By Ahmad Ghaddar
LONDON (Reuters) - An OPEC-led production cut may well be accelerating a drawdown in global oil stocks that began last year, but implementing the reduction for just six months means the producer group will fall short of achieving its objective of rebalancing the market.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers in December reached their first deal since 2001 to curtail oil output jointly, by around 1.8 million barrels per day.
In the months leading up to the deal and after it was struck, OPEC ministers said tackling an overhang in crude and oil product inventories that has depressed oil prices for over two years was one of their main objectives.
So far, OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia, which is contributing the biggest chunk of the cut, has said the deal does not need to be extended beyond a six-month period.
This contrasts with price hawk Iran, whose oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said OPEC should cut production further in the second half of 2017. Under the deal, Iran was allowed to boost output slightly above October levels.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) said inventories of crude, natural gas liquids and oil products in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) remained 286 million barrels above the five-year average of around 2.7 billion barrels. This is despite a draw of 800,000 bpd in the fourth quarter of 2016.
The overhang is almost evenly split between crude and liquids on one side and oil products on the other.
The agency forecasts a stockdraw of 600,000 bpd in the first half of 2017 if compliance with the output deal is maintained at January levels. 
""If OECD stocks were to continue to draw in 2017 at the same pace as that seen over July-December, then it would take us around a year to return to the five-year average in stocks,"" IEA oil analyst Olivier Lejeuene said. 
The problem for OPEC is that while high compliance with the agreed production cuts will help to bring down stocks, demand underperformance and rising non-OPEC supplies could temper the effectiveness of the move. 
""What it (OPEC and non-OPEC cut) does is basically avoid an even worse surplus than what has been the case in 2015 and the first half of 2016,"" said David Wech, managing director of consultancy JBC Energy. 
""But it does not eliminate (the surplus) in the first half of the year,"" he added.
Oil supply is expected to grow year-on-year in the first half of 2017 in large non-OPEC producers such as Canada, Brazil and Kazakhstan,  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) said in a research note this week.
""The key question is the extent of the renaissance of the U.S. shale oil sector, given a continual rise in the rig activity since May 2016 and high hedge ratios for 2017 among producers,"" the French bank said. 
A threat to the deal's success could also come from within OPEC as Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from the cuts, raise output. Libya has added 190,000 bpd of production since October.  
REGIONAL IMBALANCE 
While OECD stocks are declining, inventories in non-OECD countries have been crawling up - especially in China and India, where reliable data on stock levels is harder to find.
Stock balances for China, the IEA has said, show an implied build of about 600,000 bpd for August to November.
The rebalancing, therefore, could be uneven: shifting an overhang from one region to another. 
OPEC and Russia have so far shielded Asia from export reductions stemming from lower output, mainly focusing on the United States and Europe. 
That could lead to continued builds in Asia as key producers fight for market share there. 
""Our view has always been that there was a good chance of an extension largely because we always recognized that the focus was on bringing down that overhang and that that process is very likely to take more than six months,"" Energy Aspects analyst Richard Mallinson said.
Energy Aspects estimates the global commercial overhang(excluding strategic petroleum reserves) was just under 400 million barrels at the end of last year. 
This includes about 300 million barrels from the OECD and 100 million barrels from non-OECD.
The energy consultancy forecasts a stockdraw of around 700,000 bpd on average over the first half of this year.

""It could be higher if the current higher demand trend persists,"" Mallinson said.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery were down 1.12% at $1,223.00, the lowest since February 6.
The April contract ended Thursday’s session 0.22% lower at $1,236.80 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,206.20, the low of February 3 and resistance at $1,243.50, Thursday’s high.
The dollar strengthened after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he would announce the most ambitious tax reform plan since the Reagan era in the next few weeks.
During a meeting with airline CEOs on Thursday, Trump promised a “phenomenal” tax plan, without giving any specific details of the plan.
The comments came after the U.S. Department of Labor said initial jobless claims decreased by 12,000 to 234,000 in the week ending February 4. Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 4,000.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 100.69, just off a two-week high of 100.75 hit overnight.

Overnight, gold prices were slightly higher in North American morning trade on Thursday, hovering below the prior session's three-month high amid ongoing worries over political risks in Europe and economic uncertainty in the U.S.
Uncertainty about European politics has boosted gold in recent sessions. Polls this week have shown German Chancellor Angela Merkel falling behind a candidate from the country's Social Democrats in this year's elections scheduled to take place in September.
Polls have also suggested France's Marine Le Pen, who has vowed to pull France out of the euro zone, is gaining ground.
Adding to the mood of uncertainty, elections will also be held in the Netherlands in March and possibly Italy.Traders also eyed political risk elements in the U.S., with President Donald Trump's administration on the back foot over its immigration and other policies.
Market participants continued to speculate over the timing of the next U.S. rate increase. Fed fund futures priced in a less than 10% chance of a hike in March, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. However, odds of a June increase was seen at around 60%.
The Fed, which raised rates in December, has forecast three rate increases this year. However, traders remained unconvinced, with markets continuing to price in just two rate hikes during the course of this year.Fed Chair Janet Yellen will present the U.S. central bank's semiannual report on monetary policy and the economy in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee next week.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.

890,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2017 06:44PM ET</span>",Construction resumes on Dakota pipeline despite tribe's challenge,"By Terray Sylvester and Liz Hampton
CANNON BALL, N.D./HOUSTON (Reuters) - The company building an oil pipeline that has fueled sustained public protests said on Thursday it has started drilling under a North Dakota lake despite a last-ditch legal challenge from a Native American tribe leading the opposition.
 Energy Transfer Partners LP  (N:ETP) is building the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) to move crude from the Northern Plains to the Midwest and then on to the Gulf of Mexico, now saying it could be operational by early May.
The project had been put on hold under the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama, but new President Donald Trump, a Republican, helped put it back on track.
The federal government this week cleared way for the project to resume, leading the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to file a court challenge on Thursday seeking a temporary restraining order to halt construction and drilling for the pipeline.
The court set oral arguments on the legal challenge for Monday. 
Legal experts say the tribe faces long odds in convincing any court to halt construction,
Energy Transfer Partners needs only to cross beneath Lake Oahe, part of the Missouri River system, to connect a final 1,100-foot (335 meter) gap in the 1,170-mile (1,885 km) pipeline, which will move oil from the Bakken shale formation to a terminus in Patoka, Illinois.
From there the oil would flow to another pipeline connecting south-central Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico and that region's numerous oil refineries.
Native American tribes and climate activists have vowed to fight the pipeline, fearing it will desecrate sacred sites and endanger a source of the country's largest drinking water reservoir.
""This administration (Trump's) has expressed utter and complete disregard for not only our treaty and water rights, but the environment as a whole,"" the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said on Thursday in a statement on its website.
Supporters say the pipeline will be safer than transporting oil by rail or road, and industry leaders have praised the project for creating high-paying jobs 
With work on the final tranche now under way, Energy Transfer Partners expects the Dakota Access Pipeline to begin operations in approximately 83 days, according to a company spokeswoman.
""We have started to drill to go beneath Lake Oahe and expect to be completed in 60 days with another 23 days to fill the line to Patoka,"" spokeswoman Vicki Granado said in an email.
She declined to specify when drilling began except that it was after the company received federal permission on Wednesday. 
Public opposition drew thousands of people to the North Dakota plains last year including high-profile political and celebrity supporters. Large protest camps popped up near the site, leading to several violent clashes and some 700 arrests.
A few hardy protesters have remained camped out near the lake, braving sub-freezing temperatures.
Among them is Frank Archambault, 45, who has lived in the camp since August when he left his home on the Standing Rock reservation.
""It angers me. It angers me because people are pushing other people around, breaking laws,"" Archambault said. ""They’re trying to kill us off by contaminating the water. We’ve had enough."" 
Ptery Light, 55, of Portland, Oregon, who has lived in the main camp since Oct. 31, said he was not giving up hope.
""I just pray that there’s no oil spill,"" Light said. ""This is purely about greed.""
For now, their hopes are pinned on the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe winning a legal victory. 
To obtain the temporary restraining order, the tribe must convince the judge there will be immediate harm suffered and prove it has a strong overall case should its lawsuit to halt the project result in a full trial. 

The U.S. district judge in the case, James Boasberg, previously rejected the tribe's request to block the project, ruling in September that the Army Corps of Engineers likely complied with the law in permitting the pipeline to go forward.

892,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2017 12:30PM ET</span>","Venezuela falls behind on oil-for-loan deals with China, Russia","By Marianna Parraga and Brian Ellsworth
HOUSTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's state-run oil company, PDVSA, has fallen months behind on shipments of crude and fuel under oil-for-loan deals with China and Russia, according to internal company documents reviewed by Reuters. 
The delayed shipments to such crucial political allies and trading partners - which together have extended Venezuela at least $55 billion (£43.9 billion) in credit - provide new insight into PDVSA's operational failures and their crippling impact on the country's unraveling socialist economy. 
Because oil accounts for almost all of Venezuela's export revenue, PDVSA's crisis extends to a citizenry suffering through triple-digit inflation and food shortages reminiscent of the waning days of the Soviet Union.
The total worth of the late cargoes to state-run Chinese and Russian firms is about $750 million, according to a Reuters analysis of the PDVSA documents.
At the end of January, PDVSA was late on nearly 10 million barrels of refined products that the company owes the firms - with shipments delayed by as much as 10 months, according to the documents. It also failed to make timely deliveries of another 3.2 million barrels of crude shipments to China's state-run China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). 
For a graphic detailing the delayed cargoes, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2keq9Kr
Shipments to China and Russia are critical for PDVSA's financial health because firms from the two countries purchase about a third of the PDVSA's total oil and fuel exports. The administration of Venezuela president Nicolas Maduro has for years relied on credit from the two nations, particularly China, to finance infrastructure and social investment in Venezuela.
PDVSA did not respond to requests for comment. Venezuela's Petroleum Ministry declined to comment.
During the decade-long oil boom that ended in 2014, Venezuela borrowed nearly $50 billion from China that it agreed to pay back in crude and fuel deliveries to state-run Chinese firms. Venezuela was the seventh largest crude supplier to China in 2016 and the largest in Latin America.
Russia's state-run Rosneft (MM:ROSN) lent at least $5 billion under similar arrangements, but the details of those deals have not been disclosed. 
Now, PDVSA is struggling to make good on those promises. A total of 45 cargoes bound for Russian and Chinese companies are late for a variety of reasons, according to internal operational reports about shipments of crude and refined products.
The problems include operational mishaps, such as refining outages and delayed cleaning of tanker hulls, and financial disputes with service providers owed money by PDVSA.
The backlog of delayed or canceled fuel cargoes represents about three months of the 88,000 barrels per day (bpd) of jet fuel and diesel that PDVSA must deliver under financing deals to Russia's Rosneft (MM:ROSN), China's PetroChina (SS:601857) and ChinaOil.
Rosneft, the Kremlin and the Russian Energy Ministry declined to comment. 
PetroChina did not respond to requests for comment, and ChinaOil, a unit of PetroChina, declined to comment. The Chinese foreign and commerce ministries did not respond to requests for comment.
OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL STRUGGLES
The delayed deliveries suggest that PDVSA will struggle this year to meet a planned increase in shipments to China and other countries, as laid out in a broad strategy document seen by Reuters. That document said PDVSA aims to boost crude deliveries to China by 55 percent in 2017, in part by reducing exports to India by 15 percent. 
Last year, the company produced about 2.5 million barrels a day, lowest in 23 years, and this year's production projections are virtually unchanged, according to the PDVSA strategy document.
An internal PDVSA email exchange from Nov. 21, between PDVSA executives in charge of loading operations, details a myriad of operational and financial problems that are delaying the cargoes it owes Chinese and Russian customers. 
In one of the emails, a company official said PDVSA was unable to deliver a 1.8 million-barrel cargo of fuel oil to PetroChina because Bahamas terminal Borco, where PDVSA rents storage space, has intermittently prevented the firm from using the tanks since 2016 due to lack of payment.
Another 2 million-barrel cargo of fuel oil bound for China in November was postponed because of stained crude tankers, which cannot navigate international waters due to environmental regulations.
The emails also discussed potential delays to a fuel oil cargo for Rosneft, also because of dirty tankers and unpaid bills. 
Separately, four cargoes of Venezuelan Boscan crude owed to China's CNPC have also been postponed this year.
FALLING OIL PRICES MEAN HEAVIER DEBTS
The fall in crude prices has made the oil-for-loan agreements more onerous. Because loan payments were negotiated when crude prices were higher, the agreements require PDVSA to ship more oil in order to continue servicing the debts at the same rate. 
That saps its ability to ship to other customers - such as India, or customers in the United States - who would pay in cash, which PDVSA desperately needs. 
""PDVSA is taking a legal risk by postponing cargoes to key customers and a financial risk if it also delays deliveries to customers who pay by cash,"" said Francisco Monaldi, fellow in Latin American energy policy at Baker Institute in Houston. 
The top buyer of Venezuelan crude in India is  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI), operator of the world's biggest refining complex. The company imported 353,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude in 2016, 5 percent less than a year ago. To replenish its heavy sour Venezuelan crude supplies, it has stepped up imports from Mexico, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.
If PDVSA can't meet its obligations to Russia and China, Monaldi said, the countries could recover money through projects or assets outside the oil sector, he added.
The Chinese and Russian financing schemes, however, offer Venezuela and PDVSA more repayment flexibility than they get from the holders of $50 billion in bonds they have sold to investors. Because of default concerns, yields on those bonds are currently among the world's highest, paying an average of 21 percentage points more than benchmark U.S. Treasury bonds.
China and Russia, which have provided unwavering support for Venezuela in diplomatic forums, have stayed quiet about any misgivings with Caracas. The problem of delayed cargoes would most likely be discussed discreetly through diplomatic channels, analysts said.
An escalation into a commercial dispute, with Chinese or Russian firms demanding prompt payments, could affect Venezuela by triggering default clauses on bonds, or lead PDVSA to lose control of U.S. subsidiary Citgo, almost half of which was pledged to Russia as collateral. 
While that scenario is unlikely, PDVSA clearly does not have enough oil or money to satisfy its many creditors, said a trader who works at a company that regularly buys Venezuelan oil. 

""At this point, everybody is trying to collect pending debts from PDVSA by receiving cargoes,"" said the trader, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""But production is not enough.""

Natural gas for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.9 cents, or around 0.3%, to $3.138 per million British thermal units by 10:40AM ET (15:40GMT). Futures were at around $3.171 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. declined by 152 billion cubic feet in the week ended February 3, compared to market expectations for a drop of 153 billion cubic feet.
That compared with a withdrawal of 87 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 70 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 138 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.559 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 11.3% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 1.8% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Prices of the heating fuel are down around 17% so far this year as forecasts for warm winter weather weighed on heating demand expectations.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday after an unexpected draw in U.S. gasoline inventories pointed to higher demand in the world's biggest oil market, although bloated crude supplies meant that fuel markets remain under pressure.
Benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 60 cents a barrel at $55.72 per barrel by 1435 GMT. U.S. light crude (CLc1) was 80 cents higher at $53.14 a barrel.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday gasoline inventories  fell by 869,000 barrels last week to 256.2 million barrels, versus analyst expectations for a 1.1 million-barrel gain. [EIA/S]
The fall in gasoline stocks suggested U.S. consumption was stronger than expected, and may be healthy enough to support prices at time when most fuel oil markets are very well stocked.
""U.S. gasoline draws are supporting prices today,"" said Tamas Varga, senior analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates. ""They are an indication of stronger U.S. demand.""
The EIA report also said U.S. commercial crude inventories rose by 13.8 million barrels to 508.6 million barrels, well above analysts' forecasts.
U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said high fuel inventories and rising U.S. crude production meant oil markets would be over-supplied for some time, but that they would drain gradually.
""We do not view the recent excess U.S. builds as derailing our forecast for a gradual draw in inventories, with in fact the rest of the world already showing signs of tightness,"" the bank said in a note to clients.
""The draws that we expect will start from a high base,"" the bank said. ""U.S. production has also rebounded ... and we view the faster shale rebound as creating downside risk to our 2018 WTI price forecast of $55 per barrel, but not to our expectation that the global oil market will shift into deficit in 1H17.""
High oil inventories have been undermining efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia to tighten the market by cutting production.

OPEC and other big exporters have agreed to trim output by almost 1.8 million bpd during the first half of this year in order to prop up prices and rebalance the market.

Crude oil for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 83 cents, or 1.6%, to $53.17 a barrel by 9:35AM ET (14:35GMT), after gaining 17 cents, or around 0.3%, a day earlier.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London tacked on 64 cents, or about 1.2%, to $55.76 a barrel. The global benchmark eased up 7 cents, or 0.1%, on Wednesday.
Oil's turnaround came after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that gasoline inventories fell by 869,000 barrels last week to 256.2 million barrels, versus analyst expectations for a 1.1 million-barrel gain.
However, the EIA report also showed that U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 13.8 million barrels to 508.6 million barrels, underlining concerns over ample domestic supplies.
Futures have been trading in a narrow range around the low-to-mid-$50s over the past month as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers and expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade as global producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
However, a revival in U.S. drilling in recent months could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
U.S. drilling activity has risen by more than 6% since mid-2016, taking it back to levels seen in late 2014, when strong U.S. crude output contributed to a collapse in oil prices.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for March ticked up 1.1 cents, or 0.7%, to $1.564 a gallon, while March heating oil rose 1.8 cents ,or 1.1%, to $1.653 a gallon.

902,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2017 09:05PM ET</span>",North Dakota tribe says running out of options to stop pipeline,"By Ernest Scheyder and Terray Sylvester
HOUSTON/CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - The leader of a Native American tribe attempting to block the Dakota Access oil pipeline said on Wednesday the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe may have exhausted legal options to stop the project after the company building it won federal permission to tunnel under the Missouri River.
Legal experts agreed the tribe faces long odds in convincing any court to halt the $3.8 billion project led by Energy Transfer Partners LP, which could now begin operation as soon as June. 
The U.S. Army said on Wednesday it had granted the final permit for the pipeline after an order from President Donald Trump to expedite the project. The army owns the land through its Corps of Engineers.
""We're running out of options, but that doesn't mean that it's over,"" David Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""We're still going to continue to look at all legal options available to us.""
Native American tribes and climate activists have vowed to fight the pipeline, fearing it will desecrate sacred sites and endanger drinking water. Supporters say the pipeline is safer than rail or trucks to transport the oil. 
The 1,170-mile (1,885-km) line will move crude from the shale oilfields of North Dakota to Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico, where many U.S. refineries are located.
Public opposition has drawn thousands of people to the North Dakota plains, including high-profile political and celebrity supporters. Large protest camps popped up near the site, leading to several violent clashes and some 600 arrests. 
The opposition sensed victory last year when the administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, delayed completion of the pipeline pending a review of tribal concerns and in December ordered an environmental study.
But those fortunes were reversed after Trump, a Republican, took office on Jan. 20. Trump issued an order on Jan. 24 to expedite both the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) and to revive another multibillion-dollar oil artery, Keystone XL. The Obama administration had blocked that project in 2015. 
On Wednesday, some 350 people converged in lower Manhattan, hoisting signs such as ""Water is Life,"" ""Dump Trump"" and ""Respect Native Sovereignty.""
""This isn't just a Native American problem, this isn't just an issue over race, this goes way beyond that,"" said Matene Strikefirst, who said he is a member of the tribe of Ojibwe and Dakota. ""We need to get over our dependence on fossil fuels; we need to ensure drinking water for everyone.""
Another 100 gathered near the White House, denouncing 
Trump.
""We know there is going to be bloodshed,"" said Eryn Wise, spokeswoman for the International Indigenous Youth Council.
""This is cultural genocide,"" said Linda Black Elk, a resident of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. 
BIG HURDLE
In a court filing on Tuesday, the Army said it would allow the final section of the DAPL to tunnel under Lake Oahe, part of the Missouri River system. The permit was the last bureaucratic hurdle to the pipeline's completion.
The tribe said on Wednesday it would attempt to use a ""legal battle and temporary restraining order"" to shut down pipeline operations.
But Wayne D'Angelo, an energy and environmental lawyer with Kelley Drye & Warren in Washington, said he believed the Trump administration was on ""pretty solid legal ground.""
The tribe would have to prove a very difficult standard: that approval for the pipeline was ""arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion or inconsistent with the record before the agency,"" D'Angelo said.
The protest camps dwindled after the Obama administration ordered the environmental review in December as the tribe urged people to leave due to concerns about trash buildup in a flood plain. 

But a few holdouts have remained, including some who braved temperatures of minus 9 Fahrenheit (minus 23 C) on Wednesday.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Three industry groups representing U.S. grain and ethanol producers urged the White House and U.S. trade officials this week to prioritize industry complaints against China over import duties on U.S. ethanol and distiller's dried grains (DDGS) animal feed.
China last month increased punitive tariffs on imports of U.S. DDGS and ethanol, leading to the cancellation of several shipments from the United States. China has in recent years become a top importer of both products.
The Renewable Fuels Association, Growth Energy and the U.S. Grains Council, in a letter dated Feb. 7 that was released to the media, called China's higher tariffs ""protectionist trade barriers"" that have harmed U.S. producers.
""China's recent actions are significantly injuring U.S. ethanol producers and farmers, and undermining the substantial investments our industries have made in developing a cooperative and mutually beneficial trade relationship with China,"" the groups wrote.
""We respectfully request that your Administration, and specifically the incoming U.S. Trade Representative, place the Chinese government's injurious trade barriers against U.S. ethanol and DDGS near the top your China trade agenda."" they wrote.
The letter was among the most strongly worded official communications from the agriculture industry since the president took office last month.
When the administration officially backed out of the TPP trade agreement and vowed to renegotiate NAFTA, two deals hugely beneficial for U.S. agriculture, farmer groups and agriculture companies wrote to highlight past trade successes and to pledge assistance in working with the White House on better deals in the future.

(Reuters) - U.S. crude stockpiles surged last week, driven by a big rise in imports and inventory build at the key oil hub at Cushing, Oklahoma, while gasoline drew down unexpectedly, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.
Crude inventories  were up 13.8 million barrels in the week to Feb. 3, compared with expectations for an increase of 2.5 million barrels. 
Crude imports  jumped, rising 1.1 million barrels per day, with a big increase in imports at the Gulf Coast, where crude stocks rose by 10.9 million barrels, the largest weekly rise on record, to 267.6 million barrels. That figure is also a record.
Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures  rose 1.1 million barrels, EIA said.
Demand for the feedstock slipped as refinery crude runs  fell 54,000 bpd and refining utilization rates  edged down 0.5 percentage point to 87.7 percent of the nation's total capacity.
Gasoline stocks  fell 869,000 barrels, versus analyst expectations for a 1.1 million-barrel gain, offsetting some of the bearish crude data.
""It appears gasoline demand as measured for the week has rebounded to near-normal levels, which offsets some of the report's other bearish elements,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.
Oil prices rose after the data, with U.S. crude rebounding into positive territory. By 11:13 a.m., U.S. futures (CLc1) were up 30 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $52.47 a barrel, off the day's low of $51.22, as U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) jumped 2.4 percent. 
Brent crude (LCOc1) gained 43 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $55.48 a barrel.
The rise in oil prices was somewhat surprising, as the big build in stocks undermines expectations for tighter supply. However, industry group American Petroleum Institute reported a slightly bigger crude build of 14.3 million barrels on Tuesday, so the EIA data confirmed already lofty expectations. [API/S]
Speculators have maintained long positions in this market, anticipating further gains in oil as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries continues to reduce production. 
""The crude oil inventory build was really terrible for the market but the market does not seem to care because the products inventories were better than expected and are dragging crude oil prices up with it,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.
Distillate stockpiles , which include diesel and heating oil, rose 29,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 300,000-barrel increase, the EIA data showed.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories jumped by 13.830 million barrels in the week ended February 3. Market analysts' had expected a crude-stock build of only 2.529 million barrels, though the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply surge of 14.227 million barrels, the second largest in its history.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, increased by 1.143 million barrels last week, the EIA said. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 508.6 million barrels as of last week, according to press release, which the EIA considered to be “near the upper limit of the average range for this time of year”.
However, the report also showed that gasoline inventories decreased by 0.869 million barrels, compared to expectations for a build of 1.071 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles grew by only 0.029 million barrels, compared to forecasts for a gain of 0.300 million.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for April delivery dropped 42 cents, or 0.76%, to $54.63 by 10:37AM ET (15:37GMT), compared to $54.76 before the release.
Meanwhile, Brent's premium to the WTI crude contract stood at $3.01 a barrel by 10:38AM ET (15:38GMT), compared to a gap of $2.88 by close of trade on Tuesday.
Futures have been trading in a narrow range around the mid-$50s over the past month as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers and expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production.
U.S. drilling activity has risen by more than 6% since mid-2016, taking it back to levels seen in late 2014, when strong U.S. crude output contributed to a collapse in oil prices.
The revival in U.S. drilling has raised concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
Indeed, the Energy Information Administration said that the U.S. will pump the most crude next year since 1970, as OPEC cuts lift prices and benefit domestic producers.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade as global producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
According to recent reports, OPEC compliance with the deal stood at 91%, but as expert in the global energy industry Ellen R. Wald, Ph.D. remarked, “The real test for
OPEC will be whether these cuts are reflected in higher oil prices throughout the six-month period of the deal.”
In that light, oil ministers for Iran and Qatar said on Wednesday that OPEC and other major crude-producing nations may need to extend output cuts into the second half of the year to re-balance the market, although they both said it was too early to judge if it would be necessary."

""If the official data from the U.S. Department of Energy were to show a similar inventory build ... U.S. crude oil stocks would be catapulted to almost a record level,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said in a note. 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration publishes its official data later on Wednesday. 
Gasoline stocks rose by 2.9 million barrels, compared with expectations for a 1.1-million-barrel gain.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said that the data pointed to ""U.S. gasoline demand falling sharply by 460,000 barrels per day (bpd) year on year in January, with such declines only previously (seen) during recessions.""
The EIA said on Tuesday it expects U.S. crude production to grow by 100,000 bpd to 8.98 million barrels this year, 0.3 percent less than previously forecast, but expects production to jump by 550,000 bpd in 2018.
Growing U.S. supplies undermine a deal led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to curb output and support prices. 
But OPEC, for the time being at least, is not greatly concerned with rising U.S. output. 
""The market is gradually accommodating for shale oil as well as shale gas - the demand is healthy. With that continuous demand increase I think all available oils are going to be accommodated,"" Qatari Energy Minister Mohammed al-Sada told Reuters on Wednesday.
Prices also came under pressure from signs of slowing demand from the world's biggest energy consumer. 
China's 2016 oil demand grew at its slowest pace in at least three years, Reuters calculations based on official data showed.
China's implied oil demand growth eased to 2.5 percent in 2016, down from 3.1 percent in 2015 and 3.8 percent in 2014, led by a sharp drop in diesel consumption and as gasoline usage eased from double-digit growth.

912,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2017 06:49AM ET</span>",Controversial Dakota pipeline to go ahead after Army approval,"By Valerie Volcovici and Ernest Scheyder
WASHINGTON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Army will grant the final permit for the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline after an order from President Donald Trump to expedite the project despite opposition from Native American tribes and climate activists.
In a court filing on Tuesday, the Army said that it would allow the final section of the line to tunnel under North Dakota's Lake Oahe, part of the Missouri River system. This could enable the $3.8 billion pipeline to begin operation as soon as June. 
Energy Transfer Partners (N:ETP) is building the 1,170-mile (1,885 km) line to help move crude from the shale oilfields of North Dakota to Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico, where many U.S. refineries are located.
Protests against the project last year drew drew thousands of people to the North Dakota plains including Native American tribes and environmental activists, and protest camps sprung up. The movement attracted high-profile political and celebrity supporters.
The permit was the last bureaucratic hurdle to the pipeline's completion, and Tuesday's decision drew praise from supporters of the project and outrage from activists, including promises of a legal challenge from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.
""It's great to see this new administration following through on their promises and letting projects go forward to the benefit of American consumers and workers,"" said John Stoody, spokesman for the Association of Oil Pipe Lines. 
The Standing Rock Sioux, which contends the pipeline would desecrate sacred sites and potentially pollute its water source, 
vowed to shut pipeline operations down if construction is completed, without elaborating how it would do so. The tribe called on its supporters to protest in Washington on March 10 rather than return to North Dakota.
""As Native peoples, we have been knocked down again, but we will get back up,"" the tribe said in the statement. ""We will rise above the greed and corruption that has plagued our peoples since first contact. We call on the Native Nations of the United States to stand together, unite and fight back.""
Former President Barack Obama's administration last year delayed completion of the pipeline pending a review of tribal concerns and in December ordered an environmental study.
Less than two weeks after Trump ordered a review of the permit request, the Army said in a filing in District Court in Washington D.C. it would cancel that study. The final permit, known as an easement, could come in as little as a day, according to the filing.
There was no need for the environmental study as there was already enough information on the potential impact of the pipeline to grant the permit, Robert Speer, acting secretary of the U.S. Army, said in a statement.
Trump issued an order on Jan. 24 to expedite both the Dakota Access Pipeline and to revive another controversial multibillion dollar oil artery: Keystone XL. Obama's administration blocked that project in 2015.
At the Dakota Access construction site, law enforcement and protesters clashed violently on several occasions throughout the fall. More than 600 people were arrested, and police were criticized for using water cannons in 25-degree Fahrenheit (minus 4-degree Celsius) weather against activists in late November. 
""The granting of an easement, without any environmental review or tribal consultation, is not the end of this fight,"" said Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, one of the primary groups protesting the line.
""It is the new beginning. Expect mass resistance far beyond what Trump has seen so far."" 
LEGAL CHALLENGE TOUGH
Any legal challenge is likely to be a difficult one for pipeline opponents as presidential authority to grant such permits is generally accepted in the courts. The tribe said in a statement the decision ""wrongfully terminated"" environmental study of the project.
Deborah Sivas, professor of environmental law at Stanford and director of Stanford's Environmental Law Clinic, said a challenge by the tribe would likely rely on the reasons the Army Corps itself gave for why more review was needed in December.
""The tribe will probably argue that an abrupt reversal without a sufficient explanation for why the additional analysis is not necessary is arbitrary and should, therefore, be set aside,"" she said in an email.
Supporters say the pipeline is safer than rail or trucks to transport the oil. 

Shares of Energy Transfer Partners finished up 20 cents at $39.20, reversing earlier losses on the news.

Crude oil for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange slumped to a session low of $51.22 a barrel, a level not seen since January 19.
It was last at $51.77 by 3:10AM ET (08:10GMT), down 40 cents, or about 0.8%, after losing 84 cents, or 1.6%, a day earlier.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London shed 21 cents, or around 0.4%, to $54.84 a barrel, after falling to $54.44 earlier, the lowest since January 20. The global benchmark declined 67 cents, or 1.2%, in the prior session.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories rose by a whopping 14.2 million barrels in the week ended February 3.
The API report also showed a gain of 2.9 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks rose 1.4 million barrels, highlighting continued builds in refined products seen as an overhang on the market.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its official weekly oil supplies report at 10:30AM ET (15:30GMT) Wednesday, amid analyst expectations for a rise of 2.6 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories are expected to rise by 1.1 million barrels while stocks of distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, are forecast to climb by 300,000 barrels.
Futures have been trading in a narrow range around the mid-$50s over the past month as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers and expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production.
U.S. drilling activity has risen by more than 6% since mid-2016, taking it back to levels seen in late 2014, when strong U.S. crude output contributed to a collapse in oil prices.
The revival in U.S. drilling has raised concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade as global producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for March ticked up 0.7 cents, or 0.5%, to $1.482 a gallon, while March heating oil slipped 0.4 cents ,or 0.3%, to $1.617 a gallon.

914,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2017 04:11AM ET</span>",Exclusive: White House eying executive order targeting 'conflict minerals' rule - sources,"By Sarah N. Lynch and Emily Stephenson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is planning to issue an executive order targeting a controversial Dodd-Frank rule that requires companies to disclose whether their products contain ""conflict minerals"" from a war-torn part of Africa, according to sources familiar with the administration's thinking.
Reuters could not learn the precise timing of when the order will be issued, or exactly what it will say.
However, the 2010 Dodd-Frank law explicitly gives the president authority to order the Securities and Exchange Commission to temporarily suspend or revise the rule for two years if it is in the national security interest of the United States.
The sources spoke anonymously because it is not public and they were not authorized to speak on the record.
The plan for the executive order comes on the heels of another order issued by the White House last week that takes aim more broadly at the Dodd-Frank rules put into place after the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
That order did not single out any one particular rule, but it called on the Treasury Secretary to consult with other regulators, including the SEC, and to come back with a report outlining possible regulatory changes and legislation.
The conflict minerals rule is one of several disclosure regulations that was tucked into Dodd-Frank that are unrelated to the financial crisis itself.
A second Dodd-Frank SEC disclosure rule that required oil, gas and mining companies to disclose payments to foreign governments, meanwhile, was repealed by the Republican-controlled Congress last week.
The conflict minerals rule was pushed by human rights groups who want companies to tell investors if their products contain tantalum, tin, gold or tungsten mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the hopes it will help curb the funding of armed groups.
But business groups have staunchly opposed the measure, saying it forces companies to furnish politically-charged information that is irrelevant to making investment decisions.
They have also complained it costs too much money for companies to trace the source of the minerals through the supply chain.
In 2014, a U.S. appeals court struck down a part of the conflict minerals law after the Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers sued the SEC over the rule.
The court found part of it violated the free speech rights of companies by forcing them to publicly state that their products are not conflict free.
The rest of the rule, however, remained intact and companies are still required to carry out due diligence and report the details of those inquiries in public reports filed with the SEC.
The SEC cannot permanently repeal the rule without a law passed by Congress. However, it can use its broad exemptive powers to scale back some of the requirements or stop enforcing the rule entirely.
Last week, Acting SEC Chair Michael Piwowar took steps toward doing just that, by announcing he has asked SEC staff to reconsider how companies should comply with it and whether ""additional relief"" is warranted.
Piwowar did not explicitly ask Trump to utilize his powers under Dodd-Frank to temporality suspend the rule; however, in his statement, he spoke about how he had traveled to Africa to study the rule's impact and raised concerns about its effect on national security.

Gold for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange shed $2.70, or about 0.2%, to $1,233.35 a troy ounce by 3:00AM ET (08:00GMT), after gaining $4.00, or 0.3%, a day earlier.
Prices of the yellow metal touched $1,237.50 on Tuesday, the highest since November 11.
Investors were largely focused on French politics, with recent opinion polls showing centrist Emmanuel Macron slightly ahead of conservative Francois Fillon in the first round, but behind far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen. She has vowed to pull France out of the euro zone and hold a vote on its membership in the European Union.
The first round of the election is scheduled for April 23, followed by the final run-off vote on May 7.
Adding to the mood of uncertainty, elections will also be held in the Netherlands in March, Germany in September and possibly Italy.
Traders also eyed political risk elements in the U.S., with President Donald Trump's administration on the back foot over its immigration and other policies.
Headlines from Washington will continue to dictate market sentiment as traders focus on Trump for further details on his promises of tax reform, infrastructure spending and deregulation as well as trade policies.
Investors often buy gold as a refuge against economic and political uncertainty.
Gains were limited due to a stronger U.S. dollar, as dollar-priced commodities become more expensive to investors holding other currencies when the greenback gains.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.2% at 100.55 in early trade, pulling away from last week's two-month low of 99.19.
Market participants continued to speculate over the timing of the next U.S. rate increase. Fed fund futures priced in a less than 10% chance of a hike in March, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. However, odds of a June increase was seen at around 60%.
The Fed, which raised rates in December, has forecast three rate increases this year. However, traders remained unconvinced, with markets continuing to price in just two rate hikes during the course of this year.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen will present the U.S. central bank's semiannual report on monetary policy and the economy in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on February 14, the panel said on Tuesday.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for March delivery shed 9.3 cents, or 0.5%, to $17.66 a troy ounce.
Meanwhile, platinum dipped 0.3% to $1,010.35, while palladium dropped around 0.4% to $761.85 an ounce.
Elsewhere in metals trading, copper futures jumped 5.1 cents, or almost 2%, to $2.683 a pound, on news that workers at the Escondida copper mine in Chile, the largest in the world, were set to strike on Thursday.
The workers union has warned that the strike could be lengthy, potentially affecting global supplies.
Chile is the world’s biggest producer of the red metal, providing almost a third of the world's supply.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 1 percent on Tuesday, pressured by growing gasoline stockpiles in the United States as evidence of a burgeoning revival in U.S. shale production could complicate efforts by OPEC and other producers to reduce a supply glut.
Brent crude (LCOc1) settled down 67 cents, or 1.2 percent, at $55.05 a barrel, while U.S. crude (CLc1) ended 84 cents, or 1.6 percent, lower at $52.17.
U.S. gasoline futures (RBc1) fell to $1.4875 a gallon, after dropping earlier in the session below the 200 day moving average on a continuous chart, a bearish technical signal. 
""It's a supply-driven setback ... We are within 2 million barrels of the record in U.S. gasoline stocks that we saw last February,"" said Tony Headrick, energy markets analyst at CHS Hedging. ""A strong build in inventory reports could weigh on gasoline in a seasonal time frame where gasoline demand is weak.""
Analysts forecast that U.S. crude stockpiles rose 2.5 million barrels last week - a fifth straight weekly build - while gasoline inventories grew 1.1 million barrels - a sixth consecutive weekly build. 
U.S. gasoline stocks are rising much faster than normal at the start of the year, threatening to leave refiners struggling to clear an overhang of motor fuel later in the year.
Inventory estimates from trade group the American Petroleum Institute are due on Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. (2130 GMT) while U.S. government data will be released on Wednesday. 
The oil market has been supported for two months as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters have agreed to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) since the start of the year. OPEC and Russia have together cut at least 1.1 million bpd so far.
But market players are concerned that rising U.S. shale production and signs of slowing demand growth could offset these efforts. 
The U.S. government slightly trimmed its forecast for 2017 production but the market shrugged off the monthly report as its demand forecast was little changed. 
""The general perception is that OPEC is cutting production, which is supporting prices, but high stock levels, rising rig counts and growing U.S. production are capping gains,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
 Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) oil analyst Michael Wittner said U.S. shale oil output was recovering faster than expected.
""Rig counts are increasing at an accelerating pace, and given the technological advances of the past three years, this should translate into significant supply,"" Wittner said.
""U.S. shale is coming back, and it’s coming back strong.""

Chinese oil demand grew in 2016 at the slowest pace in at least three years, Reuters calculations showed, the latest sign of slower demand from the world's largest energy consumer.

U.S. drilling activity has risen by more than 6% since mid-2016, taking it back to levels seen in late 2014, when strong U.S. crude output contributed to a collapse in oil prices.
The revival in U.S. drilling has raised concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade as global producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil fell on Monday as ample U.S. supplies and excess speculative length outweighed OPEC output curbs and rising tensions between the United States and Iran.
Brent futures fell $1.09, or 1.9 percent, to settle at $55.72 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude lost 82 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $53.01. That was the lowest close for both contracts since Jan. 31.
The Brent premium over WTI narrowed to $2.09 a barrel at the close, its smallest since Jan. 19.
""We feel that the bulk of the price decline related to the larger-than-expected increase in net WTI speculative length as well as another hefty increase in the (U.S.) oil rig count,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note.
Ritterbusch and others also said the crude decline was associated with weakness in gasoline futures. U.S. gasoline futures fell 2.8 percent on Monday.
Hedge funds and other speculators boosted their bullish bets in U.S. crude futures and options in the week to Jan. 31 to the highest level on record, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.
""There are a lot of longs in the market, and if we don’t see prices rise those longs will get discouraged and exit the market as fast as they entered over the past few weeks,"" said Tariq Zahir, trader at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.
Oil prices, while supported by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) supply cuts since the start of the year and a new spike in tension between Iran and the United States, are struggling for new direction.
The Trump administration's new sanctions against Iran, though not affecting oil output, raised concern about the potential for further developments that could hinder export growth in OPEC's third-largest producer.
Tension between Tehran and Washington has risen since an Iranian missile test that prompted the United States to impose sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the Revolutionary Guards.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said last week that U.S. crude inventories have built sharply for four straight weeks, while data on Friday showed that the number of U.S. oil drilling rigs rose to the highest level since October 2015. [EIA/S]

LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss-based commodities giant  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) has extended a deal with Libya's state oil firm to be the sole marketer of one third of the country's current crude oil production, sources familiar with the matter said.
It was not clear for how long Glencore would continue to have exclusivity over the output and whether some parts of the deal would be renegotiated.
The deal extends Glencore's dominance over rivals such as Vitol and Trafigura in handling barrels from the North African country for a second year running.
A spokesman for Glencore declined to comment. Officials at Libya's state-owned National Oil Corp. (NOC) also declined to comment.
Libya has struggled for years to end a crippling blockade of its oil ports amid a civil war and Islamic State intrusions. Between security fears and erratic supply, refiners eventually stopped attempting to buy from the North African country.
With a dwindling revenue stream, NOC needed an intermediary that was comfortable managing the risks, able to market the oil globally and pay cash upfront for the cargoes.
Glencore snapped up the opportunity in September 2015 to resell the only relatively stable onshore output - from the Sarir and Mesla oilfields loaded at the country's easternmost Marsa el-Hariga port. Libya's small offshore production also continued.
Since 2015, the trader has been the only company able to buy Sarir and Mesla crude output directly from Libya's NOC and is expected to continue as NOC has largely finalised its 2017 allocations.
Libya's production has recovered to around 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) and NOC hopes output will rise to 1.2 million bpd by the end of the year.
""It is a big mosaic at the moment, but Glencore has kept a large chunk of the trade,"" one of the sources said.
Glencore's deal entitles it to around 230,000 bpd from the Sarir and Mesla oilfields, the sources added. It also regularly delivers crucial refined fuel as Libya's refining system operates well below capacity. Glencore trades about 4.4 million bpd of crude and refined products.
Vitol and Petraco have also been picking up cargoes but on a small scale, and producers with stakes in oilfields in the country such as Total, Repsol (MC:REP), OMV have returned to loading tankers, as have buyers such as Unipec, the trading arm of China's state-owned Sinopec.

OPEC's No. 3 oil producer hopes to draw foreign companies to invest in Iran and boost output after years of under-investment. However, foreign firms have so far made little inroads into the country despite the lifting of sanctions.
President Donald Trump's new U.S. administration on Friday imposed fresh sanctions on Iran, which it said were just initial steps. It said Washington would no longer turn a ""blind eye"" to Iran's hostile actions.
Dismissing the new sanctions, Zamaninia said ""such actions have had no effect, and international companies are still keen to do business with Iran.""

Anglo-Dutch oil firm Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) signed a provisional deal in December to develop Iranian oil and gas fields South Azadegan, Yadavaran and Kish.

But average hourly earnings rose 2.5% in January from a year earlier, slowing from 2.8% in December. The slowdown in wage growth prompted speculation that the Fed will avoid hiking interest rates too quickly.
In its latest monetary policy statement on Wednesday the Fed stuck to its view that the economy is strengthening, but gave no clear signal on the timing of its next rate hike as officials wait to assess the possible economic impact of the Trump administration’s protectionist policies and recent remarks about currencies.

London-traded Brent futures rose 0.16% to $56.89, while on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in March rose 0.15% to $53.91 a barrel. In China, the Caixin Services PMI stayed in expansion at 53.1, but missed the expected 53.6 level and was below the previous month figure of 53.4.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer. Meanwhile, investors will keep an eye out for the International Energy Agency's monthly report to gauge global supply and demand levels.
Last week, oil futures finished higher on Friday, logging a weekly gain, as traders cheered signs that global supply was beginning to tighten in wake of a planned agreement by major crude producers to cut output.
News that the U.S. imposed fresh sanctions on some Iranian individuals and entities, days after the White House put Tehran ""on notice"" over a ballistic missile test, further supported gains.
Oil was boosted after Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that crude producers had cut their output as agreed under a deal with OPEC, adding to signs of compliance with a global pact to scale back production.
Novak said that Russian companies might cut oil production more quickly than required by its deal with late last year. He added that 1.4 million barrels per day was already cut from global oil output last month as part of the deal.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
Futures have been trading in a narrow range around the mid-$50s over the past month as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers and expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production.
Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by 17 last week, the 13th gain in 14 weeks. That brought the total count to 583, the most since November 2015. The data raised concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.

942,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2017 11:59PM ET</span>",Dakota Access Pipeline to start in second quarter: stakeholder,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chief executive of Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) said on Friday he expects the Dakota Access Pipeline to start operations in the second quarter, even though the project - which has sparked protests by Native Americans and environmentalists - is still in the midst of legal battles and a U.S. regulatory review.
Phillips 66 has a 25 percent stake in the $3.8 billion project led by Energy Transfer Partners LP. Phillips 66's CEO, Greg Garland, made the comments on a conference call with analysts to discuss quarterly earnings.
The pipeline was originally set to start in late 2016 but has faced intense protests and legal challenges from climate activists and Native Americans, led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose land in North Dakota runs adjacent to the route..
""Commercial operations are expected to begin in the second quarter of 2017, pending the issuance of an easement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete work beneath the Missouri River on DAPL,"" Phillips 66 said in its earnings news release.
On Wednesday, the U.S. Army said it had taken initial steps to ""expeditiously review requests for approvals to construct and operate"" the pipeline per an order issued by President Donald Trump, but the project's easement has not yet been approved.
It is unclear whether the second-quarter timeline would be met unless the easement is granted soon. The comment period ends on Feb. 20, and even if the easement were granted immediately after, ETP has estimated a 90-to-120-day drilling period. 
Late on Wednesday, three Democratic U.S. senators sent a letter to the Trump administration objecting to its move to expedite the review process, saying it undermined federal law and treaty responsibility to Native tribes.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has given protesters until Feb. 22 to leave the campsite, which they have occupied for months, ABC News reported on Friday. 
The Army said that the campsite, which is on federal property, may flood in the coming weeks making it dangerous for protesters, according to ABC News. 

The pipeline is expected to carry some 470,000 barrels per day of crude oil from North Dakota's Bakken shale play into Illinois, and is more than 95 percent complete, according to a Phillips 66 filing on Friday.

China also called into question the way in which the U.S. anti-dumping investigation is being conducted, Wang Hejun, head of the trade remedy and investigation bureau at the Ministry of Commerce, said in a statement on the ministry's website. 
""In the anti-dumping probe, investigating departments disregarded the cooperation of the Chinese government and Chinese enterprises,"" Wang said.
Earlier this week, the United States moved closer to slapping duties on imports of stainless steel sheet and strip from China, issuing a final determination that the products were being subsidized and dumped in the U.S. market at below fair value.
The U.S. Commerce Department said it affirmed anti-dumping duties ranging from 63.86 percent to 76.64 percent on the imports. 
The duties will go into effect for five years if the U.S. International Trade Commision subsequently affirms its earlier finding that U.S. producers were being harmed. The commission is due to make its final determination on or about March 20.

Gold Futures for April delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.11% to $1,220.75 a troy ounce. Copper futures slumped 2.55% on the Comex to $2.617 as BHP Billiton (LON:BLT)'s Escondida mine in Chile, the world's biggest copper operation, has resumed work as the company has requested government mediation to avoid a looming strike.
The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned more than two dozen Iranian, Chinese, and Emirati businesses and persons for supporting Iran’s ballistic missile program and named officers and business executives tied to Iran’s elite military unit, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, for their suspected role in aiding the Lebanese militia, Hezbollah, and Tehran’s defense industries.
U.S. officials said the sanctions, the first issued against Iran in more than a year, didn’t violate the landmark nuclear agreement Tehran reached with the U.S. and other world powers in 2015. President Donald Trump issued a cryptic tweet after the sanctions.
""Iran is playing with fire - they don't appreciate how ""kind"" President Obama was to them. Not me!""
Friday's report showed that January non-farm payrolls rose by 227,000 jobs, the largest gain in four months. But the unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.8 percent and wages increased modestly, suggesting there was still some slack in the labor market that would keep inflation in check.
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve held its fire on interest rates as widely expected on Wednesday, but was optimistic on the outlook for the economy in keeping its benchmark overnight lending rate target at 0.5% to 0.75% following a 25 basis point hike in December.
“Measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late,” the committee said in its statement, using new language that jibes with voices on Wall Street following the election of Donald Trump as president.
“Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate stayed near its recent low,” the statement said, reflecting just a minor tweak from language at the December meeting.

Rising tension between Iran and the U.S. over a ballistic missile test by Tehran this week has led to some sharp words from the White House on Thursday.
In response, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned more than two dozen Iranian, Chinese, and Emirati businesses and persons for supporting Iran’s ballistic missile program and named officers and business executives tied to Iran’s elite military unit, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, for their suspected role in aiding the Lebanese militia, Hezbollah, and Tehran’s defense industries.

The China Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for January slowed from December, missing a Reuters poll forecast, but continued to show the mainland's economy was recovering. The reading on Thursday came in at 51.0 in January, down from December's 47-month record of 51.9 and below a Reuters' poll forecast for 51.8. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below signals contraction.
On Tuesday, the official manufacturing PMI came in at 51.3 for January, down a smidgen from 51.4 in December, but still better than a Reuters poll forecast of 51.2. The official figures tend to focus on larger companies, while the private China Caixin PMI focuses on smaller and medium-sized firms.
On Thursday, Russia's energy ministry said January output fell by 100,000 bpd, less than hoped for but in the right direction, and Iraq has also moved to trim output at least in spirit. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak however said that overall OPEC and non-OPEC nations have trimmed 1.4 million barrels-per-day (bpd) of crude supplies to the market in January under a coordinated effort to cut nearly 1.8 million bpd on verages in the first half of 2017.
As well, the gains came even after crude oil inventories in the U.S. showed a higher than expected 6.5 million barrels build at the end of last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday, well above the 2.6 million barrels build seen while stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub rose by 530,000 barrels.

SINGAPORE/TOKYO (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Friday on news that U.S. President Donald Trump could be set to impose new sanctions on multiple Iranian entities, raising geopolitical tensions between the two nations.
Comments by Russian energy minister Alexander Novak that oil producers had cut their output in accordance with a pact agreed in December also helped support prices, analysts said.
Reuters reported on Thursday that Trump's administration is prepared to roll out new measures against more than two dozen Iranian targets following Tehran's ballistic missile test, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Brent crude futures had risen 45 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $57.01 a barrel by 0750 GMT (02:50 a.m. ET), after settling down 24 cents at $56.56 in the previous session. Brent is set to gain 2.6 percent for the week. 
Front month U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures climbed 48 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $54.02 a barrel, after ending Thursday down 34 cents. For the week, the contract is up a little over 1 percent. 
Moves by the U.S. to impose new sanctions on Iran is ""something at the back of short-term traders' minds,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at Sydney's CMC Markets.
""It's on the risk radar more than it otherwise might have been,"" he said. 
The sources, who had knowledge of the administration's plans, said the package of sanctions was formulated in a way that would not violate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. 
Supply concerns were also raised when Russia's energy minister said global oil output was cut by 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) last month as part of the deal last year between OPEC and other producers.
""Oil markets have been supported by OPEC and as long as things hold people will look for evidence output curbs have chiseled away at inventories,"" Spooner said. 
Novak also said Russian companies may cut oil production quicker than had been initially agreed with OPEC and that he expected the market to rebalance by the middle of this year. 
Oil prices have stabilized about 15 percent higher than they were before OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed in December to curb output, National Australia Bank said in a note on Friday. 
""We now expect oil prices to average around the mid to high $50s in Q1 and Q2, before reaching the low $60s by end-2017 and stabilizing at around those levels in 2018,"" the bank said. 

Brent prices could also come under pressure due to refinery maintenance in Europe and Asia in the first half of this year creating a situation where crude exports remain high while crude demand weakens, energy consultancy BMI Research said in a report on Friday.

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for April delivery were down 0.30% at $1,215.75, not far from Thursday’s two-and-a-half month high of $1,224.20.
The April contract ended Thursday’s session 0.92% higher at $1,219.40 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,197.90, Wednesday’s low and resistance at $1,224.20.
The greenback recovered from losses posted after Federal Reserve policymakers said on Wednesday that some market-based measures of inflation were still low.
However, the central bank also said that job creations remained solid, inflation had increased and economic confidence was rising.
The comments came after the Fed left interest rates unchanged at the end of its two-day policy meeting, in a widely expected move.
The U.S. dollar has also been under pressure in recent weeks due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s protectionist policies and immigration bans, spurring ongoing uncertainty in global markets.
On Thursday, Trump suggested the possibility of imposing new sanctions on multiple Iranian entities, seeking to increase pressure on Tehran.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was steady at 99.88, off Thursday’s two-and-a-half month trough of 99.19.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Market participants were looking ahead to U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, due later in the day, for further indications on the strength of the jobs market.
Earlier Friday, data showed that China’s Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers’ index ticked down to 51.0 in January from 51.9 the previous month. Analysts had expected the index to slip to 51.8 last month.
The data fueled fresh concerns over a slowdown in China, which is also the world’s biggest gold consumer.

950,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2017 03:01AM ET</span>","U.S. reversal on transparency could sting Canadian, European oil companies","By Ernest Scheyder and Nia Williams
HOUSTON/CALGARY (Reuters) - Canadian and European oil companies will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage to their American rivals if U.S. lawmakers scrap tighter transparency requirements on the industry, as expected, according to company executives, legal experts and trade groups.
The U.S. Senate is poised to overturn the so-called ""resource extraction rule"", a regulation requiring U.S. natural resources companies to disclose taxes and other payments to foreign governments, in a vote that could come as early as Friday.
The rule is among a handful of regulations ushered in during the final months of Barack Obama's presidency that Republican lawmakers - who now control Congress - have targeted as being overly burdensome and bad for the U.S. economy. Democrats have no way to keep the law in place as Republicans need only a simple majority to kill the measure.
But overturning the regulation, set to take effect next year, would leave Canadian and European natural resource companies with the most-stringent reporting standards in the world for payments to foreign governments - as U.S. behemoths like  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) get a reprieve. 
Certain details of contract negotiations and terms of bids to access reserves are currently required under regulations now in place in both Canada and Europe. Such information could reveal to competitors negotiating tactics and other metrics that many companies consider proprietary, observers say.
""It definitely could put Canada at a disadvantage because we are fairly stringent on our rules, both domestically and internationally, on how our companies operate,"" said Mark Salkeld, chief executive officer of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada, an industry trade group.
European oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa), meanwhile, pointed out that a reversal in the United States would go against the broader global trend toward transparency in the notoriously murky industry.
""The trend that we have, with access to information, with bringing distant countries into our space all the time, we will have to live with that. I don’t think any single political system can turn that around,"" CEO Ben van Beurden told reporters when asked about the proposed change in U.S. regulation.
""BANG FOR THEIR BUCK"" 
Required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's extraction rule was finalized last summer. 
Canadian and European regulations were modeled after the Dodd-Frank efforts. 
But the rule was quickly targeted by Congressional Republicans after victories in the November election that brought President Donald Trump and his anti-regulation, pro-energy agenda into the White House. 
Trump has signaled a sweeping reduction in regulation to bolster the American drilling and mining industries, including by undoing Obama's initiatives to combat climate change.
Vivek Warrier, a partner at Bennett Jones, a law firm in Calgary, said that could put Canadian companies at an even steeper disadvantage.
""When a potential investor comes in, they will look at the additional regulatory compliance costs that will impact Canadian companies and probably conclude there's better bang for their buck south of the border,"" he said.
 Suncor Energy  Inc (TO:SU), Canada's largest oil and gas producer, said reporting on payments to foreign governments is a minor administrative burden. ""But generally speaking we support reporting payments to governments as it contributes to greater transparency,"" said Sneh Seetal, a Suncor spokeswoman.

American oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, meanwhile, say that the regulation had threatened to put them at a competitive disadvantage to huge state-controlled oil companies like Russia's Rosneft Ltd and China's CNOOC Ltd (HK:0883).
""As publicly traded companies, we have to compete globally with state-owned companies who hold a large majority of proved reserves and have no similar transparency or reporting obligations,"" Exxon spokesman William Holbrook said. 
Stephen Comstock, director of tax policy for the American Petroleum Institute, said revoking the U.S. extraction rule is ""a necessary step by Congress to establish sensible regulations that balance increasing transparency without diminishing our industry's competitive advantage."" 
Exxon and the API said they support an alternative scheme whereby a host country would report to its citizens at a regular interval how much money in total was generated from extractive industries, without breaking out company details.

The U.S. oil industry also said that the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act would still remain in effect, prohibiting bribery of foreign officials.

Natural gas for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped 4.3 cents, or about 1.4%, to $3.129 per million British thermal units by 10:33AM ET (15:33GMT). Futures were at around $3.130 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. declined by 87 billion cubic feet in the week ended January 27, compared to market expectations for a drop of 88 billion cubic feet.
That compares with a withdrawal of 119 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 152 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 166 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.711 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 9.8% lower than levels at this time a year ago and within the five-year average for this time of year.

Crude oil for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose to a daily peak of $54.34 a barrel, the most since January 3.
It was last at $54.10 by 9:50AM ET (14:50GMT), up 21 cents, or about 0.4%, after jumping $1.07, or around 2%, a day earlier.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London added 29 cents, or 0.5%, to $57.09 a barrel. Futures touched $57.45 earlier, a level not seen since January 6.
On Tuesday, London-traded Brent rallied $1.22, or 2.2%, after data showed that Russian oil output shrank by 100,000 barrel per day in January, adding to signs that major oil producers are sticking to their pledge to cut back output.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
Gains were limited amid ongoing concerns over rising U.S. oil inventories. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude supplies rose by 6.5 million barrels last week to 494.8 million barrels.
Futures have been trading in a narrow range over the past month as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production and hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers.
U.S. drilling activity has risen by more than 6% since mid-2016, taking it back to levels seen in late 2014, when strong U.S. crude output contributed to a collapse in oil prices.
The revival in U.S. drilling has raised concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.

The Fed held interest rates steady as expected on Wednesday, in its first meeting since President Donald Trump took office.
The U.S. central bank painted a relatively upbeat picture of the economy, noting that job gains remained solid, inflation had increased and economic confidence was rising, although it gave no firm signal on the timing of its next rate move.
Some had expected the Fed to signal that the March meeting would come into play for the next rate hike. The market currently expects the next hike in June, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
The yellow metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. interest rates. A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases.
The dollar sank to the lowest level since mid-November against a basket of other major currencies as investors continued to digest the Fed's latest stance on interest rates.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, fell to a daily low of 99.20, a level not seen since November 14. It was last at 99.30 during New York morning hours, down around 0.4%.
The greenback has been under pressure amid growing concern about the potential impact of the Trump Administration’s protectionist stance.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday as evidence that OPEC and other big exporters were cutting production outweighed a sharp rise in U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles.
Brent crude was up 50 cents at $57.30 a barrel by 1145 GMT after settling up $1.22 in the previous session. U.S. light crude gained 30 cents to $54.18 after climbing by $1.07 on Wednesday.
Both crude oil benchmarks are now near the top of recent price ranges. Brent has spent most of the past two months trading between $53 and $58 a barrel, at a premium of around $2.50 to the U.S. crude futures contract.
""The current sentiment is bullish,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates, but added, ""We are still firmly within the ranges. I think buyers will shy away if the market jumps another dollar.""
U.S. crude oil inventories rose last week by an unexpected 6.5 million barrels to 494.76 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. The build in crude stocks far exceeded analysts' expectations for an increase of 3.3 million barrels. 
Gasoline stocks climbed by 3.9 million barrels, compared with analyst expectations of a 1 million barrel gain.
Inventories in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, have been near record highs for much of the past year and domestic production is rising as U.S. companies drill for shale oil.
But prices have been underpinned by indications that producers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters are cutting output. 
The curbs follow an agreement last year by OPEC and other exporters to reduce supplies by a combined 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to prop up prices that remain at about half their mid-2014 levels.
A Reuters survey this week found that most key oil producers were sticking to the deal, with compliance above 80 percent.[OPEC/O]
Russian oil output contracted in January by 100,000 bpd, Energy Ministry data showed on Thursday.

Tension between the United States and Tehran is also rising after Iran tested a ballistic missile, raising the possibility of future sanctions that could curb Iranian oil supply.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2017 06:03AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Japan considers buying more U.S. energy as Abe prepares to meet Trump,"By Tomo Uetake and Nobuhiro Kubo
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is considering increasing energy imports from the United States, two sources familiar with the plan told Reuters, as he prepares to meet President Donald Trump, who has complained about Japan's trade surplus.
Japan is putting together a package of plans for Japanese companies to invest in infrastructure and job-creation projects in the United States for Abe to take to the Feb. 10 meeting with Trump in Washington. 
Another idea is to offer to increase liquid natural gas (LNG) imports from the United States, a source in the ruling coalition told Reuters.
Another option, if Abe determines that Trump is most concerned about the trade gap, is to increase imports of U.S. shale oil or gas on top of the investment package, according to a top executive at a major Japanese corporation who is close to Abe.
Japanese officials have been scrambling to respond to Trump's scattershot comments since he took office. 
He has threatened to impose a tax on car imports from Mexico, criticized Japan's trade gap with the United States and most recently accused Japan, along with China and Germany, of devaluing their currencies to the detriment of U.S. companies.
""(Abe) wants to know what's the most important thing for Trump,"" said the executive, who declined to be identified.
""If it is the trade surplus that Trump cares the most about, for instance, then we could come up with a few possible solutions,"" including importing more U.S. shale oil or gas. 
Abe's approach toward Trump would be ""not accommodating, not opposing"", he said.
Utilities would be resistant to buying more U.S. shale gas because they have already committed to buying large amounts and Japan's demand for energy is falling, an executive at a Japanese gas importer told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 
Prices for LNG in Asia  have fallen by almost a fifth this year amid a supply glut.
Japan is the world's biggest buyer of the gas cooled to liquid form for transport on ships and takes in nearly a third of global shipments.
Once seen as a panacea for Japan's energy crisis after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 led to the shutdown of most reactors in the country, U.S. shale gas is now just one of many options for Japan to meet its needs.
Japan took in its first shipment of shale gas in liquid form this month and more shipments are likely to come as more export terminals start shipments this year and next.

The Yomiuri newspaper said on Thursday Abe's growth and jobs initiative would include a plan for Japan and the United States to jointly develop a $450 billion ""infrastructure market"", into which the Japanese government and companies would invest $150 billion over 10 years.

966,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2017 03:04PM ET</span>",Oil rallies to settle up $1 a barrel,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude futures rallied late Wednesday, jumping more than $1 a barrel after briefly trading lower on a bearish U.S. government report early in the day. 
Oil markets have been trapped in a range as traders wait to see whether OPEC production cuts can outweigh U.S. supply growth. 
Oil futures pared gains immediately after weekly U.S. supply data showed a much bigger build than expected, but prices rebounded. 
Brent crude (LCOc1) settled up $1.22 a barrel at $56.80. U.S. crude (CLc1) settled up $1.07 a barrel at $53.88. 
""U.S. crude could be in consolidation from $51 to $55 for awhile, until there's more evidence on OPEC production cuts or more evidence of production picking up or stabilizing in the U.S.,"" said Bill Baruch, senior market strategist at iitrader.com.
U.S. crude stockpiles for the week ended Friday rose 6.47 million barrels, nearly double the expected increase. The larger-than expected build initially exacerbated concerns that efforts to cut production globally may not be sufficient to reduce a supply glut.
""It was a very bearish report on several fronts, from the large across-the-board builds in the major categories, and the continued decline in refinery runs,"" said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York. ""Crude oil imports were elevated again, as well, with the Gulf Coast seeing a big increase in crude oil inventories.""
Still, data in the report also suggested U.S. production could be lower in the week, Baruch said. That energized bulls to push crude upward, he said. 
Russia cut production in January by around 100,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to data seen by Reuters. A day earlier, a Reuters survey found high compliance by OPEC with agreed cuts. [OPEC/O]
""Any hopes of a sustained recovery in price will depend on increasing efforts by OPEC to curb output though the prospect of an upside breakout will be undermined by the budding revival in U.S. crude production,"" Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM said.
The cuts by Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries follow last year's agreement to lower supplies by a combined 1.8 million bpd, to prop up prices that still are half their mid-2014 levels.
A Russian cut of 100,000 bpd would be a third of Moscow's pledge to reduce its output by 300,000 bpd. However, Russia has said its planned output reduction would be gradual.
OPEC has implemented most of its reduction. A Reuters survey on Tuesday found that OPEC members in January have delivered on about 82 percent of their deal to lower supply by 1.16 million bpd.
""With data now coming out for the first month affected by the OPEC and non-OPEC output cuts, it appears fairly safe to say that compliance with the pledged reduction has been relatively high,"" analysts at JBC Energy said in a report.

JBC estimates OPEC delivered on 88 percent of its pledged reduction. Petro-Logistics, a company which tracks OPEC supply, also estimates compliance has been high.

967,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2017 11:59AM ET</span>",Royal Mint bullion coin sales surge on wave of political turmoil,"By Jan Harvey
LLANTRISANT, Wales (Reuters) - In a warehouse a dozen miles to the northwest of Cardiff, the Royal Mint is running its machines through the night to keep up with demand for one of the big beneficiaries of the last year's political turmoil - gold and silver bullion.
The 1,100-year-old Mint, based here since the 1960s, is producing 50 percent more gold bullion coins and bars than it was this time last year, director of bullion Chris Howard says, while its sales in January rose by a third. 
With growth prospects for its core minting business limited by the advent of the cashless society, the Mint has focused heavily on growing its bullion arm in the last few years.
Its contribution to the overall business's bottom line has gone from negligible levels in 2012 to more than a quarter in the last year.
""We used to send these out by the box,"" head of bullion sales Nick Bowkett says, indicating stacks of silver coins packed for transit in the Mint's bullion striking room. ""Now we ship them out by the pallet.""
Next door, the Mint's core business -- producing commemorative coins and legal tender for 60 different countries -- is churning out crates of coinage, including the new 12-sided British pound, due to launch in March. But it's the bullion arm that is really ramping up. 
While in global terms the Mint is still small -- its total gold sales of 237,000 ounces last year were dwarfed by the U.S. Mint's 1.2 million ounces of gold Eagle and Buffalo coin sales, the Austrian Mint's 534,000 ounces of gold Philharmonic coin sales, and the Perth Mint's 520,000 ounces of gold sales -- its bullion unit expanded both revenue and profit by two-thirds last year.
It is forecasting similar growth this year, through expansion in its already core U.S. and German markets, and elsewhere.
About 30 percent of its bullion sales - largely Britannia coins, but also sovereigns, and bars ranging in size from 1 gram to 1 kilogram - are made through the Mint's website, while a further 70 percent goes to wholesale clients. 
RETAIL EXPLOSION 
Global retail investment in gold has exploded in the last 15 years. At nearly 1,000 tonnes last year, it was two and a half times the levels seen in 2001. 
While a sharp rise in investors selling gold back onto the market after prices surged last year weighed on the net demand figure, gold sales in Europe jumped after the Britain's Brexit vote and resulting fluctuations in the currency markets.
The government-owned Mint's sales to Germany more than doubled last year in volume terms, while UK sales rose by more than a quarter. 
""The excitement around Brexit, and the uncertainty, brought a lot more (business), especially on to our ecommerce platform,"" Howard, a veteran of designer retail brands such as Guess and Swarowski, said. 
""The level of trading after Brexit was much higher than it was before, and it has continued to be at that level.""
Gold prices rose for the first year since 2012 last year, by 10 percent, while in sterling terms gold performed even more strongly, climbing 30 percent. 
The turmoil seen in stock markets this month after U.S. President Donald Trump took office and optimism over his plans for the U.S. economy dissipated suggests that investors will continue to need havens from risk.
A monthly Reuters poll of investment professionals across Europe, the United States and Japan this week showed U.S. equity holdings at their highest since June 2015, but also suggested markets may have overcooked the ""reflation"" trade.
This year Howard expects sales to the United States and Germany to stay strong, and he tips Asia -- home to the two biggest physical bullion markets, China and India -- as a key growth market.
That's not necessarily an easy sell. The mint has worked around import restrictions into India through a licensing agreement with Swiss-Indian refiner MMTC-PAMP, which produces sovereigns on its behalf. 

Howard admits that China, where last year traders reported that Beijing was restricting imports, has been a tough market to crack. ""From 25 years of working in other industries, it's been the same challenge everywhere,"" he says. ""Everyone sees this great opportunity, that China is where you should be -- but how do you do it? It's exactly the same with bullion.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers on Wednesday said it had taken initial steps to review requests to approve the final permit to finish the controversial Dakota Access pipeline, which has been the focus of protests for months. 
The move does not mean easement to the tunnel under the Missouri River - the last remaining stretch of the pipeline in North Dakota to be built - has been granted. On Tuesday, two North Dakota politicians said they had been told by Army officials that the project would be completed. 
Native American groups and climate activists have been protesting the $3.8 billion project, which runs adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in southern North Dakota. 
""The Assistant Secretary for the Army Civil Works will make a decision on the pipeline once a full review and analysis is completed in accordance with the directive,"" the Corps said in a statement.
Energy Transfer Partners LP's Dakota Access pipeline stretches for 1,170 miles (1,885 km) from North Dakota's oil-producing Bakken region to Patoka, Illinois. 
The tribe had successfully won delays from the Obama Administration for further environmental review, but last week President Donald Trump signed an executive order telling the Corps of Engineers to expedite review of the project.
Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II last week said he has requested a meeting with Trump, but has not received a response. 
North Dakota Senator John Hoeven said in a statement on Tuesday that Acting Secretary of the Army Robert Speer had told him and Vice President Mike Pence that Speer directed the Corps to proceed with the easement. Congressman Kevin Cramer also said he had been informed of the directive.
The Army's statement, however, said that the steps for review ""do not mean the easement has been approved."" 
Opponents of the project, including the Standing Rock Sioux, claimed on Tuesday that Hoeven and Cramer were jumping the gun and that an environmental study underway must be completed before the permit can be granted.

Crude oil for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up 24 cents, or around 0.4%, to $53.05 a barrel by 10:35AM ET (15:35GMT), after gaining 18 cents, or about 0.3%, a day earlier. Prices were at around $53.11 prior to the release of the inventory data.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for April delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London added 33 cents, or 0.6%, to $55.91 a barrel. Futures rose 26 cents, or nearly 0.5%, on Tuesday.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories rose by 6.5 million barrels in the week ended January 27. Market analysts' expected a crude-stock gain of 3.3 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday reported a supply increase of 5.8 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, decreased by 1.245 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 494.8 million barrels as of last week, which the EIA considered to be at the upper limit of the average range for this time of year.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 3.9 million barrels, compared to expectations for a gain of 1.0 million barrels.
For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a gain of 1.6 million barrels.
Futures have been trading in a narrow range around the low-to-mid $50s over the past month as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production and hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers.
U.S. drilling activity has risen by more than 6% since mid-2016, taking it back to levels seen in late 2014, when strong U.S. crude output contributed to a collapse in oil prices.
The revival in U.S. drilling has raised concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade as global producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.

Trump had campaigned on a promise that Washington should boost U.S. energy independence from oil cartels such as OPEC, of which Saudi Arabia is its de facto leader and by far the group's biggest producer.
But Saudi Arabia's Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, Khalid al-Falih, told the BBC that ""there are huge areas of alignment"" in interests between the two traditional allies.
""President Trump has policies which are good for the oil industries and I think we have to acknowledge it ... He has steered away from excessively anti-fossil fuels, unrealistic policies,"" Falih told the BBC in an interview broadcast on Wednesday.
""I think he wants a mixed energy portfolio that includes oil, gas, renewables, and make sure that the American economy is competitive. We want the same in Saudi Arabia.""
Last year Saudi Arabia unveiled sweeping plans aiming to end the kingdom's ""addiction"" to oil and transform it into a global investment power through a broad reform plan dubbed Vision 2030.
Asked whether there is a worry about Trump's promise to pursue energy independence and block crude imports from Saudi Arabia, Falih said: ""We have no problem with the growth of American indigenous oil supply. I have said repeatedly, as long as they grow in line with global energy demand, we welcome them.
""We had billions of dollars invested in refining and distribution in the United States and we may be increasing that investment on the back of pro-industry, pro-oil and gas policies of the Trump administration.""
Falih added that he is looking forward to coordinating energy policies with the nominee for U.S. Energy Secretary, former Texas Governor Rick Perry.
Trump and Saudi Arabia's King Salman spoke by telephone on Sunday, agreeing to step up counter-terrorism and military cooperation and enhance economic relations, a senior Saudi source told Reuters.
""The relationship between (the U.S. and) Saudi Arabia is very, very strong,"" Falih said in Wednesday's broadcast. 

""Saudi Arabia and the United States cannot afford not to work together... to confront the challenges that are facing the world.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will grant the final approval needed to finish the Dakota Access Pipeline project, U.S. Senator John Hoeven and Congressman Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said on Tuesday.
However, opponents of the $3.8 billion project, including the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation is adjacent to the route, claimed that Hoeven and Cramer were jumping the gun and that an environmental study underway must be completed before the permit was granted.
For months, climate activists and the Standing Rock Sioux tribe have been protesting against the completion of the line under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that is part of the Missouri River. The one-mile stretch of the 1,170-mile (1,885 km) line is the only incomplete section in North Dakota.
The project would run from the western part of the state to Patoka, Illinois, and connect to another line to move crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Hoeven said Acting Secretary of the Army Robert Speer had told him and Vice President Mike Pence of the move. ""This will enable the company to complete the project, which can and will be built with the necessary safety features to protect the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and others downstream,"" Hoeven, a Republican, said in a statement.
Representatives for the Army Corps of Engineers could not be reached immediately for comment late on Tuesday. The Department of Justice declined to comment.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week allowing Energy Transfer Partners LP's Dakota Access Pipeline to go forward, after months of protests from Native American groups and climate activists pushed the administration of President Barack Obama to ask for an additional environmental review of the controversial project.
The approval would mark a bitter defeat for Native American tribes and climate activists, who successfully blocked the project earlier and vowed to fight the decision through legal action.
On Tuesday evening, the Standing Rock tribe said the Army could not circumvent a scheduled environmental impact study that was ordered by the outgoing Obama administration in January. ""The Army Corps lacks statutory authority to simply stop the EIS,"" they said in a statement.
The tribe said it would take legal action against the U.S. Army's reported decision to grant the final easement.

""JUMPED THE GUN""
Jan Hasselman, an Earthjustice lawyer representing the tribe, told Reuters that Hoeven and Cramer ""jumped the gun"" by saying the easement would be granted and that the easement was not yet issued.
Dallas Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environment Network, which has been a vocal opponent of the pipeline, said on Twitter that lawmakers were ""trying to incite violence"" by saying the easement was granted before it was official.
There have been numerous clashes between law enforcement and protesters over the past several months, some of which have turned violent. More than 600 arrests have been made.
Heavy earth-moving equipment had been moved to the protest camp in recent days to remove abandoned tipis and cars, with the camp to be cleared out before expected flooding in March.
There were more than 10,000 people at the camp at one point, including Native Americans, climate activists and veterans. Several hundred remain.
A spokesman for Hoeven, Don Canton, said it would probably be a ""matter of days rather than weeks"" for the easement to be issued.
Oil producers in North Dakota are expected to benefit from a quicker route for crude oil to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.
North Dakota Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp said the timeline for construction was still unknown but said she hoped Trump would provide additional law enforcement resources and funding to ensure the safe start of pipeline construction.

""We also know that with tensions high, our families, workers, and tribal communities deserve the protective resources they need to stay safe,"" Heitkamp said.

981,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2017 05:26PM ET</span>",Gold becomes one of investors' favorite safe havens with Trump uncertainty,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some of Wall Street's largest fund managers have taken a contrarian bet on gold, wagering that U.S. President Donald Trump's governing style and upcoming elections in Europe will combine to create more stock market volatility and boost the prices of a metal long seen as a safe haven. 
Fund managers from IVA, Ridgeworth and Fidelity are among those who are bullish on gold at a time when the VIX, Wall Street's main measure of volatility, is near two-year lows amid a stock market rally that has pushed the S&P 500 up 6.5 percent since Election Day in November.
Charles de Vaulx, portfolio manager of the $8 billion IVA Worldwide Fund, said the U.S. stock market had been ""amazingly unvolatile.""
""With the unpredictability of President Trump and how well he works with Congress, there remains a lot that is unknown,"" he added. 
De Vaulx said Trump was short on specifics of his spending plans, which could undercut the value of the dollar and push gold prices higher. At the same time, upcoming elections in France and Germany could have a long-term impact on the future of the European Union, leading to more stock market volatility.
The dollar was on course to its worst start in more than a decade on Tuesday after Trump commented on currency devaluation by other countries and his new National Trade Council director remarked on the euro. 
Spot gold prices rose 1.6 percent to $1,214.19 an ounce, with analysts citing the uncertainty of Trump's policies as a main factor.. 
Despite the recent moves, gold has been one of the worst-performing assets since Trump's election. 
Funds have flowed out of the $30 billion SPDR Gold ETF (NYSE:GLD) for 10 out of the 11 weeks since Election Day, including a 1 percent decline in the week ended on Jan. 25, according to Lipper data. 
Gold prices are down 5.5 percent since the election and have fallen 10.5 percent over the last six months. 
The new administration has been widely expected to enact new policies that would boost the dollar and U.S. economic growth, cutting into the appeal of the metal.
At the same time, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December and said that it expected three additional increases totaling 0.75 percentage points in 2017.
Ramin Arani, a co-portfolio manager of the $25 billion Fidelity Puritan fund, said that he sees gold as an attractive ""insurance"" for his equity exposure given the rising political risks. 
""In terms of unpredictability, there is a tail risk with this administration that did not exist with the prior,"" he said. ""There is a small but present possibility that government action is going to lead to unintended consequences."" 
Not every portfolio manager who is bullish on gold credits political uncertainty as the main catalyst. 
Richard Bernstein, whose oversees $3.6 billion as head of Richard Bernstein Advisors, said he added to his exposure to gold and gold mining stocks before the presidential election in anticipation of higher inflation driven by rising wages. 
""If you think inflation is going up, you want to hold real assets,"" he said. 
The move by mutual fund managers into gold mirrors bets by well-known hedge fund managers, including Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn, who is bullish on the metal.

“Our sense is that Mr. Trump doesn’t hold any core policy beliefs and is apt to change his mind as he sees fit,” Einhorn wrote in a Jan. 17 letter to investors. ""This will lead to more political and economic uncertainty and less stability.""

(Reuters) - Oil markets are starting to tighten, prompting industry analysts to raise their 2017 price forecasts, but they remain cautious that rising U.S. production could offset any major price gains from OPEC'S output deal. 
Brent crude futures will average $58.01 a barrel in 2017, according to a Reuters poll of 31 analysts and economists. The current forecast is slightly higher than the $57.43 forecast in the previous survey. 
It is the second consecutive monthly poll in which analysts have raised their price outlook for both Brent and U.S. crude average prices in 2017.
Brent (LCOc1) has averaged about $55.45 so far this year and analysts believe U.S. President Donald Trump's administration could bring in new legislation to support the oil and gas industry. 
""The Trump presidency should benefit the oil sector. It's not clear which measures will be implemented, but lower taxation and lower concerns about tighter environmental constraints would benefit U.S. domestic production,"" said Intesa SanPaolo analyst Daniela Corsini.
There is a risk Trump's proposed policies may lead to an even greater rise in U.S. oil production, which has been growing more quickly than many expected in the last year, according to several analysts.
""U.S. shale oil production could surprise to the upside this year,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Carsten Fritsch said. U.S. crude oil output has risen by about 6.3 percent since the middle of last year to 8.96 million barrels per day (bpd). 
U.S. energy companies last week added oil rigs for a 12th week in the last 13, extending an eight-month recovery that is tapping into OPEC's commitment to curb production that has kept crude prices above $50 a barrel since early December. 
A further rise in shale oil output could be tempered by lower prices and the possibility of a renewal of U.S. sanctions against Iran, some analysts believe.
""At the end of the day, U.S. shale oil drilling will depend on the prevailing market prices and there's not much Trump can do about that,"" said Capital Economics analyst Thomas Pugh. 
One of the keys for the balance between supply and demand of oil this year is adherence by OPEC and a number of other exporters to an agreement to cut output.
OPEC and some of its non-OPEC rivals, including Russia, in late November agreed to a joint cut in production for the first time since 2008, by around 1.8 million bpd.
Analysts said the market should rebalance by the middle of this year, but it would take an extension of the OPEC output cut beyond the originally planned six months to maintain stability. 
Relations between the United States and other key producers like Middle Eastern countries and Russia, a stronger dollar, and the geopolitical situation in Libya and Nigeria were among other factors that could continue to affect prices, analysts said. 
    The poll forecast U.S. light crude (CLc1) will average $56.08 a barrel in 2017 and $60.61 in 2018. WTI has averaged about $52.63 so far in 2017.

    Raymond James had the highest 2017 Brent forecast at $73 per barrel, while Commerzbank had the lowest at $50.

LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC's oil output is set to fall by more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) this month, a Reuters survey found on Tuesday, pointing to a strong start by the exporter group in implementing its first supply cut deal in eight years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut its output by about 1.20 million bpd from Jan. 1 - the first such deal since 2008 - to prop up oil prices (LCOc1) and get rid of a supply glut.
Supply from the 11 OPEC members with production targets under the deal in January has averaged 30.01 million bpd, according to the survey based on shipping data and information from industry sources, down from 31.17 million bpd in December.
Compared with the levels that the countries agreed to make the reductions from, in most cases their October output, this means the OPEC members have cut output by 958,000 bpd of the pledged 1.164 million bpd, equating to 82 percent compliance.
For details of January production by country, see

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday as news of another increase in U.S. drilling activity spread concern over rising oil output just as many of the world's oil producers are trying to comply with a deal to pump less in an attempt to prop up prices.
The number of active U.S. oil rigs rose to the highest since November 2015 last week, according to Baker Hughes data, showing that drillers are taking advantage of oil prices above $50 a barrel.
Global benchmark Brent crude oil prices were down 25 cents at $55.26 a barrel at 1010 GMT, while U.S. crude futures slipped 8 cents to $53.09.
""Oil prices are down because of the rise in the U.S. rig count,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates in London. 
He also added that Petro-Logistics' report that OPEC members had cut production by 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January was ""not very encouraging"" because it implied that only 75 percent of the OPEC production cut target was being met.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia agreed to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 to relieve a two-year supply overhang.
Oil prices have remained above $50 a barrel since producers agreed the deal in December, incentivizing drillers in low-cost U.S. shale producing regions to ramp up activity.
""In our view the strong rise in U.S. shale oil rigs is a good thing because it will be needed over the next three years as non-OPEC, non-U.S. crude production continues to be hurt by the deep capex cuts both past and present in that segment,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets in Oslo.

He estimates the U.S. rig count will continue rising at a rate of seven rigs per week over the first half of the year.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude futures for March delivery fell 1.13% to $53.17 a barrel, while Brent futures on London's Intercontinental Exchange dropped 1.28% to $55,52 a barrel.
U.S. drillers added 13 rigs by the end of last week, taking the total active to 566, Baker Hughes said on Friday with the oilfield services firm now noting gains in 12 of the past 13-week period and up from 498 a year ago.
The gains come on the back of a recovery in global crude prices above $50 a barrel since late last year and into 2017 when a pact between OPEC and non-OPEC nations agreed to nearly 1.8 million barrels-per-day of supply cuts to global markets for the first six months of the year.
The Baker Hughes oil rig count plunged from a record 1,609 in October 2014 to a six-year low of 316 in May. U.S. crude collapsed from over $107 a barrel in June 2014 to near $26 in February 2016.
As well, investors took note of U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis figures that said gross domestic product grew 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016, disappointing expectations for 2.2% and after a 3.5% growth rate in the three months to September. Separately, the Census Bureau said U.S. durable goods orders fell 0.4% in December, compared to expectations for a 2.6% gain. Core durable goods orders, which exclude transportation items increased by 0.5% last month, in line with expectations.
Also this week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude supplies rose by 2.9 million barrels last week to 488.3 million barrels, sparking concerns over the levels of global oil supplies as OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade, energy ministers said over the weekend as producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
If carried out as planned, the deal should reduce global supply by about 2%.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2017 03:40PM ET</span>","Border tax ideas roil oil markets, favor Gulf Coast refiners","By Liz Hampton and Catherine Ngai
HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As with many industries now fretting over the uncertain future of U.S. trade policy, the oil business is sizing up the potential impact of the various protectionist measures being bandied about Washington - which have sent crude markets into a tizzy.
The trade proposal with the most momentum may be the controversial tax reform, pushed by Republicans in Congress, that could slap a tax of up to 20 percent on all imports, including crude oil. That would spark a rise in fuel costs across the country that would hurt East and West Coast refiners more than those near the Gulf of Mexico. 
It would also hit the pocketbooks of drivers and airline passengers, as refiners pass on the nearly $30 billion that the tax could cost them each year on crude imports.
""The consumer is really the one that suffers,"" Cynthia Warner, executive vice president for operations at refiner  Tesoro  Corp (NYSE:TSO), said earlier this month at a conference in Houston. Tesoro operates seven refineries: two in California, two in North Dakota and one each in Utah, Alaska and Washington. 
The ""border adjustment"" tax could also redraw trade maps for global flows of crude and refined products. U.S. crude producers would be the obvious beneficiaries as their overseas rivals bear heavy taxes on imports, which are used often by coastal refiners, especially those without direct access to U.S. pipelines.
Higher prices for domestic crude would make pumping from more U.S. fields economically viable - encouraging higher output from the shale patch and giving more momentum to a nascent recovery in the U.S. shale industry after a brutal international price war.
While that likely would not put a big dent in the 7.9 million barrels per day (bpd) that the U.S. imports, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimates that U.S. oil exploration and production firms would benefit to the tune of $20 billion from higher domestic crude price and increased production.
Crude markets have been buffeted by the public back-and-forth between President Donald Trump and the Republican party over various tax proposals. 
Contradictory signals from Trump sent the oil markets up and down in recent days. U.S. crude fell to its biggest discount to Brent crude in five months last week after Trump appeared to poured cold water on the idea as ""too complex"". 
The next day, he said the tax would be discussed - and U.S. crude rose relative to Brent. 
Traders had speculated on the tax with an options bet that the value of U.S. crude would rise above the global Brent crude benchmark. Trump's comments caused volatility in trade of those options, which in turn impacted benchmark oil prices.
Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimated in a report this week the border tax proposal had a 20 percent chance of passing. But White House chief of staff Reince Priebus seemed to move the President closer to supporting the border adjustment tax on Thursday, in the context of discussing how to make Mexico pay for a security wall on U.S. border with Mexico, his signature campaign promise. 
Asked if Trump favored a border adjustment tax, Priebus said such a tax would be ""one way"" of paying for the border wall.
$30 BILLION IN IMPORT COSTS
Border taxes are part of a broader tax reform plan that is being pushed by Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan as an alternative to a variety of protectionist trade policies discussed in a more ad hoc way by Trump. 
While Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on specific industries or countries in an effort to boost U.S. manufacturing, Ryan's border adjustment tax would tax all imports at 20 percent. Exports would be tax-free. 
That could add more than $30 billion to the annual import bill for U.S. refiners, assuming an oil price of $53 per barrel on the 7.9 million bpd of imports that fuel the world's largest economy.
A steep rise in import costs would squeeze the margins of refiners dependent on foreign crude shipments such as  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and PBF Energy.
But all refiners would see feedstock prices rise if the tax pushed up domestic crude prices - and it would, because there is not enough U.S. crude to meet demand.
To cover the costs to refiners, retail gasoline prices would need to increase by 13 percent, or 30 cents a gallon, energy consultant Philip Verleger estimated in a report last month. Diesel would rise by 11 percent, or 27 cents a gallon. 
That would be the equivalent of adding $300 to $400 per year to the average consumers' gasoline tab,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Capital said earlier this month.
Aside from oil refiners, automakers and retailers oppose the tax. Those against the measure include billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, who spend heavily to support Republican candidates and conservative policies and own a refinery that imports crude.
Republicans, who now control the House and Representatives and the Senate, say that if U.S. companies want the lower corporation tax from its current level of 35 percent - a move supported by both Trump and Ryan - then they have to accept the border tax on imports.
COSTS FOR COASTAL REFINERS
The refining industry as a whole opposes the tax, which would separate it from the global oil marketplace. But East and West Coast refiners have more reason to worry. 
Coastal refiners import more foreign oil and typically have a competitive advantage over inland counterparts in accessing imports because they can buy a wider range of crude oil in various qualities.
That advantage would evaporate with the tax.
""Anybody who is importing crude and not exporting very much - mostly refiners on the East and West Coasts - is going to be in a worse position,"" said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research at Morningstar. ""Their raw material cost will have gone up, and that will eat into their margins.""
Chevron, which operates two refineries in California with capacity of more than 500,000 barrels per day, is the largest importer of foreign crude, according to government data from 2016. 
For the first ten months of 2016, Chevron imported some 213 million barrels, excluding Canadian imports. That's followed by  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO), which imported 194 million barrels, and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), which imported 130 million barrels. 
Phillips 66 said it was analyzing the potential impacts of such a law, while Chevron, Valero and PBF Energy did not respond to requests for comment.
West Coast refiners may feel the pinch less than those on the East Coast, because they have access to Alaskan crude cargoes. 

U.S. Gulf refiners would be on the best footing, traders say, because of their easy access to domestic and foreign supplies and proximity to export markets for tax-free fuel shipments out.

DUBAI/KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia/LONDON (Reuters) - The first independent audit of Saudi Aramco's [IPO-ARMO.SE] oil reserves has confirmed the state oil company's own figures, sources familiar with the situation said, ahead of its planned share market listing next year.
The listing, expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO), is a centerpiece of a Saudi Arabian government plan to transform the country by enticing investment and diversifying the economy away from oil.
Based on a figure of 265 billion barrels, Aramco's fields contain about 15 percent of the world's proven reserves. Any finding that the reserves are significantly above or below that could affect the company's market value in the listing.
""The independent audit produced no surprises,"" a source familiar with the situation said on Friday. ""Aramco's reserves have always been reported internally in line with international practice.""
Aramco had asked two U.S. oil reserve auditing specialists to review its deposits. 
These are Gaffney, Cline and Associates, part of Baker Hughes and Dallas-based DeGolyer and MacNaughton. DeGolyer and MacNaughton completed its audit last year, two of the sources said.
Aramco and DeGolyer could not be reached for immediate comment on Friday. Gaffney Cline also could not be reached for immediate comment.
Saudi Arabia's proven oil reserves have been listed at about 265 billion barrels in oil industry reference publications such as the  BP  (LON:BP) Statistical Review of World Energy for many years. 
Aramco said its crude oil and condensate reserves were 261.1 billion barrels in its 2015 annual report.
The reserves audit produced figures ""definitely not below"" those published by Aramco, a second source familiar with the matter said, while a third source said the auditing firm's estimate was higher than Aramco's own.
The IPO plan is being championed by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees energy and economic policy in the world's top oil-exporting country.
Prince Mohammed has said he expects the IPO, which will offer up to five percent of the company, to value Aramco at a minimum of $2 trillion.
Senior oil industry figures have welcomed the Aramco IPO for casting more light on Saudi Arabia's oil reserves. Many of the world's biggest sovereign reserves holders have not changed their numbers for years.

The head of Russian oil company Rosneft Igor Sechin said last year the Aramco listing would give transparency over reserves data which had not been updated for 30 years.

U.S. crude futures for March delivery were down 0.69% at $53.40 a barrel, off Thursday’s three-week highs of $54.06 a barrel.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco's decision to shelve a plan to partner with Malaysia's state oil company threatens the country's ambitious plans for an oil and gas processing hub, which it may struggle to keep on course if it cannot find another foreign investor.
The Saudi oil major suspended plans for a joint venture with Petroliam Nasional Berhad, or Petronas, on the $27 billion project in the southern Malaysian state of Johor due to concerns it would not yield high returns, sources told Reuters this week.
Petronas - which has been hit hard by the slump in oil prices, cutting jobs, capital expenditure and its contribution to government coffers - insists the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project at Pengerang, on Malaysia's southern tip, remains on track and will begin operations as planned in 2019.
Analysts say the project is too politically important for Prime Minister Najib Razak, mired in a corruption scandal involving state fund 1MDB, to be scrapped or drastically pared back, but believe Petronas will need a strategic investor to bring in funds and industry expertise. 
""They may scale it down, but it's going to go ahead. It might get staggered,"" said Subbu Bettadapura, senior director of energy, Asia Pacific, at consultancy Frost and Sullivan.
""(Malaysia) would definitely try to channel funds into Pengerang because a lot is riding on that. All the forces, political and industrial, would be trying to make this a reality."" 
Industry analysts and consultants say Petronas is in talk with other foreign investors.
Najib - who has said RAPID will create jobs, raise standards of living and boost the country's economy - will want to ensure the project in electorally key Johor state faces no further hurdles before the next national election due by 2018.
With Western oil majors also hurting from a slump in oil prices, the most likely solution for RAPID would be to recruit Chinese players to partner with Petronas. 
Some analysts say cash-rich Chinese refiners looking to expand into new markets could be interested in RAPID.
Najib has been moving closer to Beijing diplomatically as the fallout from the 1MDB scandal strains ties with the United States, returning from a November state visit to China with about $34 billion in deals.
""Najib needs to ensure that RAPID can still go on,"" said Achmad Sukarsono, analyst at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. ""Politically Najib would want to involve China more.""
PROJECT ECONOMICS
Others, however, caution that RAPID may not make sense for China, which already has enough refineries to meet even its huge oil thirst. Chinese energy firms, they say, would rather invest in more crude production.
A bigger concern is the economics of the project, which have been called into question after sources said Aramco had concluded it would not generate sufficient returns.
Petronas said in a statement on Thursday that RAPID - which includes a 300,000-barrel-per-day oil refinery producing gasoline and diesel - was expected to deliver positive returns and value as planned.
The project, part of the huge Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex (PIPC), was announced in 2011 when oil traded at $110 a barrel. Crude prices have since halved.
Like neighboring Singapore, the Pengarang peninsula sits between the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea, through which almost all the Middle East oil and gas bound for northern Asia's industrial powerhouses of China, Japan and South Korea is shipped. 
If fully developed, PIPC would become one of Asia's biggest hubs for oil storage, fuel refining and petrochemical production, as well as imports and exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Sushant Gupta, research director of refining and chemicals at energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, predicted Asian markets will be short of gasoline by 2020, meaning RAPID could hit the market at the right time to benefit from improving refining margins.
""So it will be prudent for the sponsors to get the refinery ready on time to capture the expected upswing in margins,"" Gupta said.
CANADIAN SACRIFICE?
The RAPID setback means Petronas now faces questions over two of its biggest projects.
It is in the middle of making a final investment decision on a $27 billion liquefied natural gas project in Canada that has faced several delays due to environmental concerns.
The state-run company is also wrestling with lower profit and cash flow. In early 2016, Petronas said it would cut spending by up to 50 billion ringgit ($11.27 billion) over the next four years. 
With the questions hanging over RAPID, Petronas may be forced to re-think the Canada project. 
""RAPID will still come online, it's just there is a greater financial burden on Petronas now,"" said Peter Lee, an oil and gas analyst at BMI Research. ""If anything were to give way or be delayed further, I would think it is the Canada project first.""

1015,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2017 05:20AM ET</span>",Red tape chokes off drilling on Native American reservations,"By Valerie Volcovici
FORT BERTHOLD, North Dakota (Reuters) - When the U.S. oil boom hit North Dakota a decade ago, wells sprang up quickly on the edges of the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, an expanse of prairie and rolling hills three times larger than Los Angeles.
Tribe members here, facing a 40 percent unemployment rate and sending their children to 1950s-era school buildings, were eager to tap some of state’s most promising reserves. But layers of federal regulation - applying only to tribal lands - slowed them down for years, frightened away investors and cost them millions of dollars.
""The reservation looked like the hole of a donut,"" said Marcus Levings, who was chairman of Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara (MHA) Nation's reservation at the time. ""Everything around us was moving, and there was nothing in the middle.""
Fort Berthold has since caught up to become one of the state's most productive regions. But the initial delays undermined the MHA Nation’s sense of sovereignty and cost it badly needed revenue - an experience echoed in widespread complaints from other tribes and from energy firms, including some owned by Native Americans. 
Now, with U.S. President Donald Trump in office and oil prices rising, their frustration is fueling a renewed push to streamline approvals for drilling and mining on Indian reservations.
Clearing regulatory hurdles for a single project on tribal lands can take as many as 50 steps, compared to a half dozen for oil wells on private property. The process can take three times as long to complete, according to tribal leaders, lawyers specializing in Native American issues, oil company executives and federal regulators.
Officials at the agency overseeing that process - the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), a division of the Department of Interior - did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A spokesperson for Trump, who campaigned on a promise to slash energy regulation, declined a request for comment.
The stakes are high. Native American reservations cover just 2 percent of the nation's surface, but by some estimates contain as much as a fifth of all U.S. oil and gas reserves, along with vast coal stockpiles. 
Some tribes, for environmental or cultural reasons, have shunned the idea of developing these reserves, but many others want to tap the vast wealth beneath their homelands.
A coalition of Native Americans appointed by Trump's team to guide his Indian policy is researching proposals to make energy development easier on tribal lands - including the controversial idea of transferring them to private ownership. 
That coalition met privately in Washington last month with tribal representatives and Trump’s team, and the group listed deregulation of energy development on reservations as a high priority, according to a person who attended the meeting.
Representatives of the coalition did not respond to requests for comment. 
Congress, now firmly in Republican control after November’s election, also appears poised to act. The Indian affairs committees in the House and Senate are planning to re-introduce legislation this year that would streamline Bureau of Indian Affairs approval processes for tribal energy resource agreements, said Senator John Hoeven, a Republican from North Dakota and the new chair of the Senate Indian affairs committee.
U.S. Representative Raul Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, has opposed previous efforts to relax energy regulations on tribal lands, including a 2015 proposal he argues would have undermined public input before project approvals. That could weaken the legal arguments of residents impacted by environmental damage, he said in an interview.
""The regulations are there for the public, including tribal members, to know what the intended and unintended consequences of that project are going to be,"" he said.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT
The United States holds title to about 56 million acres of tribal lands, a vestige of the treaties made between 1778 and 1871 to end wars between indigenous Indians and European settlers. The tribes have rights to the land – and the resources under the surface – but they do not own it. 
On Fort Berthold and other reservations, energy development requires a uniquely large number of easements and environmental permits, all of which must be approved by multiple federal agencies in a process overseen by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Former North Dakota Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan - who was in office when the shale boom hit his state - said he understood that regulations can preserve Native American culture by keeping tribal lands environmentally sound and off the real estate market. But he also said he recognized them as a bottleneck.
""It shouldn’t be a reason for holding up development,"" Dorgan told Reuters in an interview. ""If ever there was a place in North Dakota that needed this development most, it is on reservations.""
A 2015 report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found that the problems went beyond the processes in law and regulations. Poor management by the Bureau of Indians Affairs has hindered energy development and resulted in lost revenue for tribes, the office concluded. 
One tribe, according to the report, saw permit reviews stretching to as long as eight years and missed out on than $95 million in revenues it could have earned from royalties, oil and gas severance taxes and tribal permitting fees. The report also found that BIA offices were understaffed and had failed to keep adequate records.
Dave Williams, CEO of MHA Nation-chartered energy company Missouri River Resources, said his firm has learned how to work around the regulatory process, but called it frustrating. He said he knows most of the employees at the BIA's regional office on the reservation in New Town, and tries to prod them to get things done ""with a friendly touch.""
""It is discouraging because everything gets bureaucratized - just wait, wait, wait - especially if you’re an oil guy, and most of your life you are on time and get things done,"" he said. 
Deregulation could also benefit private oil drillers including  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY),  BP  (LON:BP) and others that have sought to develop leases on reservations through deals with tribal governments. Those companies did not respond to requests for comment. 
     
TRIBAL OPPOSITION, SOLIDARITY
A substantial segment of the Native American community continues to oppose energy development on tribal land or would like to see it limited. The Northern Cheyenne in Montana, for example, live atop rich coal reserves but have shunned mining it because they fear it will bring pollution and undermine their way of life. 
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota has galvanized the U.S. environmental movement with its ongoing protests against a pipeline constructed near its reservation. But many tribes that supported the Standing Rock protests were motivated by protecting a tribe's right to govern itself rather than by opposition to fossil fuel development.
Among the tribes backing the protests were the Southern Ute Tribe in Colorado, the Ute Tribe of Utah, the Montana Crow and the Navajo Nation across the Southwest, all of which are pursuing energy development on their own lands.
Tribes are also seeking to curtail what they call unjust taxation of energy projects on tribal lands by states in which their reservations are located.
For many tribal leaders, the desire for more control over drilling projects is as much about self-determination as money.
“We’ve always wanted jurisdiction over our people and our land to the fullest extent possible,” said Jackson Brossy, executive director of the Navajo Nation's Washington office. 
Back in Fort Berthold, MHA Nation Councilman Fred Fox said he felt it was time for Washington to hand more responsibility for tribal lands back to the tribes. They should not be managed as U.S.-owned ""public lands,"" he said, but rather as sovereign Native American nations. 

""We have ancestors that owned these lands,"" he said, looking out over a snow-covered settlement in the White Shield section of the reservation. “Let us collect our own taxes. Let us create economic viability for our people. Let us create the regulatory system.”

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for February delivery were down 0.64% at $1,182.85, the lowest since January 11.
The February contract ended Thursday’s session 0.67% lower at $1,189.80 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,156.30, the low from January 4 and resistance at $1,202.80, Wednesday’s high.
Demand for gold weakened as sentiment on the greenback improved after Trump suggested the implementation of a 20% tax on Mexican goods to pay for a border wall.
The comments came after the U.S. President on Thursday ordered construction of a U.S.-Mexican border wall and punishment for cities shielding illegal immigrants.
 Donald Trump was also planning 'extreme vetting' of visa applications and a temporary ban on virtually all refugee admissions into the U.S.
The dollar had been under heavy pressure since Donald Trump’s inauguration last Friday amid concerns over a lack of clarity on his economic policies and fears that his protectionist trade stance could hit corporate profits and act as a drag on growth.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.20% at 100.72, off the previous session’s seven-week low of 99.77.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
 Demand for the safe-haven precious metal also remained under pressure since the Dow topped 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday amid optimism over Trump’s policies and a solid round of corporate earnings.
Market participants were looking ahead to U.S. economic growth data, as well as reports on durable goods orders and consumer sentiment, due later in the day.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices firmed on Friday as rising crude output from the United States was offsetting efforts by OPEC and other producers to prop up the market by cutting supplies.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1), the international benchmark for oil prices, were trading at $56.41 per barrel at 0753 GMT, up 17 cents from their last close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $53.99 a barrel, up 21 cents.
Trading activity during Asian business hours was low due to the start of the Lunar New Year holiday in most countries of the region, including China and Singapore.
Traders said prices were lifted by production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers including Russia, aimed at reducing a global fuel overhang.
However, they added that rising output in the United States was partially offsetting those efforts.
""U.S. producer hedging via futures and increasing shale production offset the progress OPEC has made with its production cut implementation,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore.
""Market participants are hyper-focused on two issues: shale's response to higher prices and OPEC compliance,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) bank said.
""Producers and OPEC countries are all talking their books, yet the jury is still out,"" it added, referring to widespread scepticism over compliance with announced cuts.
The British bank said it expected Brent and WTI prices to average $55 and $53 per barrel respectively for the first quarter.
OPEC and other producers have agreed to cut production by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first half of 2017 to fight a supply overhang that has seen between 1 million and 2 million bpd of crude being produced in excess of consumption over the past two years.
U.S. oil production, however, has risen by around half a million barrels per day since mid-2016 to 8.96 million bpd.
Despite the possibility that the OPEC-led supply reduction might not lift prices much further, investment bank Jefferies gave a bullish outlook for the industry's profitability based on cost-cutting efforts by all producers.
""Conditions for the integrated oil sector are arguably the most favorable since 2012 (as) company self-help measures have driven break-even prices down to $50 per barrel, while OPEC intervention in the oil markets has likely put a floor on Brent prices in the low-$50's,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note.

1022,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2017 11:20AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco selects U.S. firms to audit its reserves for IPO: sources,"By Rania El Gamal, Reem Shamseddine and Alex Lawler
DUBAI/KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia/LONDON (Reuters) - State oil giant Saudi Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] has tasked two U.S. industry leaders in oil reserves auditing to review the content of its deposits as it pushes ahead with a share listing next year, industry sources said on Thursday.
Aramco, whose fields are estimated to contain 15 percent of the world's oil, has asked a unit of oil services firm  Baker Hughes  (N:BHI) - Gaffney, Cline and Associates - to carry out the review, three sources familiar with the move told Reuters.
Two separate sources said Aramco had also asked Dallas-based DeGolyer and MacNaughton, one of the world's oldest names in reserves auditing, to perform some work.
Baker Hughes and Aramco declined to comment. DeGolyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The listing, expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO), is a centerpiece of a Saudi Arabian government plan to transform the kingdom by enticing investment and diversifying the economy away from a reliance on oil. 
Aramco, once U.S.-based and run by Americans, has long been a Saudi state corporation. It dwarfs all others in the industry by production and reserves, with crude reserves of 265 billion barrels.
The plan to list Aramco, the kingdom's crown jewel, is being championed by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees energy and economic policy in the world's top oil-exporting nation. 
He is leading a reform drive, called Vision 2030, to address falling oil revenue and fiscal deficits by boosting the private sector, ending government waste and diversifying the economy.
Last year, Prince Mohammed said he expected the IPO would value Aramco at a minimum of $2 trillion, but that he thought the figure might end up higher. 
Any valuation would account for oil price expectations and the size of Saudi Arabia's proven crude reserves.
Industry sources say the right to own the reserves is a sovereign issue retained by the Saudi government, while Aramco is most likely to keep its concession, meaning it would have direct access to those reserves with sole rights of exploration and production.
The main question is how much of the oil reserves would be reflected in Aramco's financial books after an independent audit as a result of the concession, the sources say.
""Aramco is in talks with a company to audit its reserves and another one to audit its finances,"" another Saudi-based industry source said. 
""Whether (all) the oil reserves would be IPO-ed or not, that's still being discussed."" 
The Wall Street Journal was first to report that Aramco had hired Gaffney, Cline & Associates to assess its oil reserves, citing sources.
MILESTONES
Saudi officials and their advisers are aiming for two key milestones in 2017 as they push ahead with the flotation.
Saudi-based industry sources say 2018 remains the planned date and up to 5 percent is the stake size being considered for the offer, though this could be raised depending on oil prices and market reaction to the listing.
""There are two key milestones this year. Choosing banks for the IPO and choosing an exchange,"" said a senior industry source familiar with the IPO plans.
""Aramco is looking at all options – ranging from North America, Europe and Asia. In terms of deadlines, 2018 is still the plan to list the company.""
Aramco had said it was considering several options for the flotation, including a single domestic stock exchange listing and a dual listing with a foreign market.
Officials from the oil firm plan ""discovery trips"" to foreign exchanges in the next few months and have invited banks to pitch for an advisory position in the IPO, the sources said.

 Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and HSBC (L:HSBA) are among the banks that have received a request for proposals. The invitation was to evaluate Aramco's business and help it with measures surrounding the share sale.

1023,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 26, 2017 10:35AM ET</span>",U.S. natural gas surges 4% after bullish storage data,"Investing.com - U.S. natural gas futures rose for the fourth day in a row on Thursday, hitting a more than one-week high after data showed that natural gas supplies in storage in the U.S. fell more than expected last week.
Natural gas for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rallied 13.0 cents, or about 3.9%, to $3.474 per million British thermal units by 10:35AM ET (15:35GMT), after rising 5.1 cents, or 1.6%, a day earlier.
Futures were at around $3.458 prior to the release of the supply data after climbing to a session high of $3.492 in the immediate aftermath of the storage report, a level not seen since January 17.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. declined by 119 billion cubic feet in the week ended January 20, exceeding market expectations for a drop of 117 billion cubic feet.
That compared with a withdrawal of 243 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 211 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 176 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.798 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 11.1% lower than levels at this time a year ago and less than 1% below the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, a colder system will sweep across the central and eastern U.S. later this week to finally end the current mild spell as overnight lows drop below freezing across all but the far southern U.S.
Extended models pointed to colder conditions from January 31 through February 3, maintaining near to stronger than normal natural gas demand.
Weather models initially predicted mild temperatures throughout most parts of the U.S. during the period.
Natural gas markets have been volatile in recent weeks, changing course rapidly in response to shifting outlooks in short-term weather patterns.
Prices typically rise during the winter as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand. About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.

Crude oil for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped $1.03, or nearly 2%, to $53.79 a barrel by 10:00AM ET (15:00GMT), after falling 43 cents, or 0.8%, a day earlier.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rallied $1.22, or about 2.2%, to $56.30 a barrel. The international benchmark declined 36 cents, or around 0.7%, on Wednesday.
Market players shrugged off concerns over rising U.S. oil inventories. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude supplies rose by 2.9 million barrels last week to 488.3 million barrels.
Futures have been trading in a narrow range around the low-to-mid $50s over the past month as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production and hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers.
U.S. drilling activity has risen by more than 6% since mid-2016, taking it back to levels seen in late 2014, raising concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade, energy ministers said over the weekend as producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
Ministers said that 1.5 million barrels a day of the roughly 1.8 million in cuts pledged by OPEC and non-OPEC countries have already been taken out of the market.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for February ticked down 0.1 cents, or 0.1% to $1.529 a gallon, while February heating oil climbed 2.7 cents, or 1.7%, to $1.639 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for March delivery rallied 11.1 cents, or 3.3%, to a one-week high of $3.457 per million British thermal units, as market players looked ahead to weekly storage data due later in the day.

1025,By Business Insider,"<span>Jan 26, 2017 09:51AM ET</span>","You know, Trump also just made the Keystone XL way more expensive (and illegal) to build","In all the tumult over US President Donald Trump's signing of a memorandum in favor of the speedy resumption of building the Keystone XL pipeline, something important has been lost.
It's that he also signed a memorandum that would make the pipeline way more expensive and in violation of international trade law.
First, let's clarify that memorandum are not executive orders. They do not mean things happen at the snap of a finger. They are more of a presidential pat on the bum to get things going – and going the president's way – if they're going to get done at all.
Trump's way, as  Reuters' John Kemp put it, is a violation of about 70 years of international trade law. His second memorandum requires the  Keystone pipeline to be built with US steel. Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, must submit a plan in 180 days ""under which all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipelines, inside the borders of the United States ... use materials and equipment produced in the United States.""
That's going to be difficult, to say the least.
That's because this is the kind of action that gets you sued by the World Trade Organization. Member-nations (Like the United States) are supposed to allow companies to compete fairly on the price of goods. They're not supposed to favor their domestic goods or materials over the goods or materials of other nations.
From the ""General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade"", WTO, 1947 and 1994  via Reuters:
""The products of the territory of any contracting party imported into the territory of any other contracting party shall be accorded treatment no less favorable than that accorded to like products of national origin in respect of all laws, regulations and requirements affecting their internal sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution or use.""
The Obama Administration sued China to kingdom-come for this kind of behavior. It's why  we have a 500% tariff on Chinese steel, for example. After that, China said it would continue a controversial tax rebate for its steel exporters.
Either way, member-nations, including the Chinese, will not take kindly to this particular Trump dictum. It will become fuel to fire an impending trade spat.
We should also note that this US steel requirement is doubly rich considering the fact that US Senator Al Franken (D-MN) proposed the same requirement in early 2015 and  got shot down by Republicans.
What's more, forcing American steel onto the Keystone pipeline will undoubtedly make it more expensive. After we slapped that tariff on Chinese steel, all it did was suppress demand here in the US. Manufacturers who use steel as a raw material didn't want to buy the expensive US steel.
""While output has been carefully managed by US producers to help maintain the tariff-driven price premium over other regions, apparent demand is clearly not good at -10% YoY over 2016 to date,"" analysts at Macquarie wrote back in August.
""While destocking can explain part of this, we would reiterate our concern that higher steel prices are hurting US manufacturing competitiveness (and thus steel demand). As our recent note showed, the US is the biggest negative drag on global industrial production at the present time.""
Then they threw down this chart:
Note the word ""losers,"" there... That's us. We're the losers. Trump wouldn't like that."

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices were driven higher by a weakening dollar on Thursday, although gains were capped by plentiful supplies and bulging inventories in spite of efforts by producers to cut output.
Benchmark Brent crude was up 45 cents a barrel at $55.53 by 1245 GMT, while U.S. light crude futures were up 35 cents at $53.10.
Traders attributed the gains largely to the dollar, which has lost 3.9 percent in value since peaking in January. Oil is traded in the U.S. currency and a weaker dollar makes fuel purchases less costly for countries using other currencies, potentially spurring demand.
However, oil prices were capped by data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showing an increase of 2.84 million barrels last week in U.S. crude inventories to 488.3 million barrels, pointing to ample supply in the world's biggest market.
U.S. oil production has risen by 6.3 percent since the middle of last year to 8.96 million barrels per day (bpd).
""Crude oil and other liquids inventories grew by 2 million bpd in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by an increase in production and a significant, but seasonal, drop in consumption,"" the agency said.
Rising U.S. output and inventories are likely to limit the impact of the agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, to cut supplies in an effort to reduce a global glut.
OPEC and other exporters have said they will reduce output by almost 1.8 million bpd during the first half of 2017. Industry data suggest many of those cuts have already been made.
But key customers in Asia are being spared any significant cuts because producers fear losing market share to competitors.
Saudi crude supplies to Japan will not be reduced, a senior Saudi official said on Thursday.
The two benchmark crudes have stayed within fairly narrow trading ranges since OPEC agreed to limit production.
""Oil prices have hardly budged at all for several days now,"" said Carsten Fritsch, senior commodities analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt. ""Brent appears stuck at between $55 and $56 per barrel, while WTI is hovering around the $53 per barrel mark.""
Fritsch argues the current range is unlikely to last if U.S. oil production keep rising:

""We still believe there are more arguments in favor of prices breaking out of their current corridor and embarking on a downward trajectory.""

1029,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2017 05:40AM ET</span>","Anglo American boosts 2016 output overall, copper down in fourth quarter","By Barbara Lewis
LONDON (Reuters) -  Anglo American  (L:AAL) on Thursday reported a sharp production fall at its Los Bronces copper mine in Chile at the end of last year offsetting an overall increase in mineral output across its mines.
The dip in output late last year weighed on Anglo American shares, which fell around a percent by 1010 GMT, although analysts said Anglo American's figures were broadly positive.
They remain confident in the global mining sector, which recovered strongly last year led by Anglo American, the top performer in the FTSE 100 index (FTSE) as the company's shares rebounded from a big sell-off in 2015.
Anglo American said it had seen operational improvements across its portfolio, but Los Bronces output was difficult, as grade quality deteriorated, weather was bad and contractors carried out ""illegal industrial action,"" Anglo said.
""Together with positive contributions from ongoing ramp-ups at Minas-Rio, Grosvenor and Gahcho Kue, we will be reporting a 2 percent increase in copper equivalent production volumes for 2016 as a whole,"" CEO Mark Cutifani said in a statement.
For the final quarter of 2016, the Los Bronces problems led to a 19 percent fall in copper output compared with the same time a year ago.
Anglo American has put copper, along with platinum and diamonds, at the heart of its portfolio.
Production at its diamond business De Beers rose 10 percent in the last quarter of 2016 compared with a year earlier as output was boosted in line with improved trading conditions relative to a difficult 2015.
For platinum, up 2 percent, Anglo American said it continued to ""maintain discipline by mining to demand"".
Bernstein analysts said in a note the news was positive.
""Today's results do not materially change our view on the stock,"" it said, adding it maintained its ""outperform"" rating.
Also on Thursday, Kaz Minerals (L:KAZ), a copper company focused on large scale, low-cost open pit mining in Kazakhstan reported 73 percent year-on-year output growth as new production came online.
""We successfully ramped up Bozshakol and the Aktogay oxide plant,"" Chief Executive Oleg Novachuk said. ""Our growth will continue in 2017 as Bozshakol reaches capacity and we commence production from sulfide ore at Aktogay.""
Kaz Minerals also said full-year gross cash costs would be around 20 percent less than the previous guided range of 140 to 160 U.S. cents per pound of copper.
Share prices in the mining sector are broadly speaking extending last year's rally, but traders took profits in Kaz Minerals as well as Anglo American on Thursday.
Reversing earlier small gains, Kaz Minerals was also down around a percent, slightly more than a dip in the overall sector. (FTNMX1770)
Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange were roughly flat.
They jumped 18 percent last year, the first annual rise since 2012. Copper has been billed as the bulk commodity most likely to run into short supply, although output is still ample for now.

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2017 04:14AM ET</span>",TransCanada has not yet broached Keystone XL with shippers: CEO,"By Jim Morris
WHISTLER, British Columbia (Reuters) -  TransCanada Corp  has yet to discuss the Keystone XL oil pipeline with shippers and is not certain if all were still in support of it, the company's CEO said on Wednesday in his first public comments since President Donald Trump revived the project.
The new U.S. president signed an order on Tuesday that allowed TransCanada (TO:TRP) to reapply for a permit for Keystone XL, after it was rejected in 2015 by then-President Barack Obama on environmental concerns.
TransCanada Chief Executive Russ Girling said the firm was ""diligently"" preparing its application for the 1,179-mile (1,900 km) pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, across the U.S. border to Steele City, Nebraska.
Girling said he believes the project remains attractive for shippers, given that it will supply the popular Gulf Coast market. 
""But we haven't engaged in direct conversation on that issue,"" he said at an investors conference. ""This wasn't in our planning horizon in the middle of last year, so we've only just re-engaged with our shippers again.""
Analysts and traders said the C$8 billion ($6.1 billion) pipeline was far from being a certainty.
Since it has been proposed nearly a decade ago, TransCanada has lost some initial support from shippers during its arduous approval process, said a Canadian crude trader familiar with the pipeline contract who declined to be identified due to a lack of authorization to speak to the media.
The pipeline has faced fierce opposition over environmental concerns and still needs to get approval from the state of Nebraska. 
TransCanada late Wednesday did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the shippers' commitment to the project.
If operational, Keystone XL would bring more than 800,000 barrels per day of heavy crude from Canada, which holds the world's third-largest crude reserves but lacks the infrastructure to move it easily. 

The project has received regulatory approval and government backing in Canada.

Oil's gains on Thursday came as the U.S. dollar wallowed near a seven-week low against a basket of major currencies amid concerns over President Donald Trump's protectionist stance.
Oil prices typically strengthen when the U.S. currency weakens as the dollar-priced commodity becomes cheaper for holders of other currencies.
Gains were limited amid ongoing concerns over rising U.S. oil inventories. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude supplies rose by 2.9 million barrels last week to 488.3 million barrels.
Futures have been trading in a narrow range around the low-to-mid $50s over the past month as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production and hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers.
U.S. drilling activity has risen by more than 6% since mid-2016, taking it back to levels seen in late 2014, raising concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade, energy ministers said over the weekend as producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
Ministers said that 1.5 million barrels a day of the roughly 1.8 million in cuts pledged by OPEC and non-OPEC countries have already been taken out of the market.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for February ticked up 0.5 cents, or 0.3% to $1.535 a gallon, while February heating oil climbed 1.7 cents, or 1.1%, to $1.628 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for March delivery rallied 6.7 cents, or 2%, to a one-week high of $3.414 per million British thermal units, as market players looked ahead to weekly storage data due later in the day.

The Dow closed atop the 20,000-mark for the first time on Wednesday, boosted by solid earnings. Investors are also turning more optimistic as President Donald Trump begins to offer more details of his policies.
Trump signed two executive orders on Tuesday to move forward with construction of the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, rolling back key Obama administration environmental actions in favor of expanding energy infrastructure.
He also signed orders rolling back some regulation and environmental rules, in order to expedite approval of infrastructure projects.
But concerns over his protectionist stance remain after Trump signed executive orders on immigration on Wednesday, including one of border security and the intent to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Earlier this week, the president signed to formally withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with leaders of Canada and Mexico.
Market players will continue to focus on Trump for further details on his promises of tax reform, infrastructure spending and deregulation, as well as insight regarding policies on China and the domestic economy.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2017 01:28AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil stuck at sea in dirty tankers,"By Marianna Parraga and Mircely Guanipa
HOUSTON/PUNTO FIJO, Venezuela (Reuters) - More than 4 million barrels of Venezuelan crude and fuels are sitting in tankers anchored in the Caribbean sea, unable to reach their final destination because state-run PDVSA cannot pay for hull cleaning, inspections, and other port services, according to internal documents and Reuters data.
About a dozen tankers are being held back because the hulls have been soiled by crude, stemming from several oil leaks in the last year at key ports of Bajo Grande and Jose, which has resulted in delayed operations for loading and discharging.
Since debt-laden PDVSA cannot afford to have the ships cleaned, they have to wait for weeks to navigate international waters, delaying shipments.
Dirty tankers are the latest of a litany of problems weighing on PDVSA, the source of most of Venezuela's export revenue and critical to the government's budget. 
Oil production and exports are currently at lows not seen in more than two decades. PDVSA's difficulty with paying creditors and service providers makes pulling itself out of that hole more onerous. That has contributed to a deep, years-long recession in the OPEC country.
As of Jan. 25, vessels carrying some 1.4 million barrels of crude, diesel, gasoline, fuel oil and liquefied petroleum gas were anchored in Venezuelan and Caribbean waters waiting for cleaning, according to PDVSA's trade documents, verified by Reuters shipping data. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
""PDVSA almost solved this situation in Bajo Grande in early December because it needed to drain inventories, but it is now taking at least three weeks to complete the cleaning,"" said an inspector at Lake Maracaibo, who was not authorized to speak to the press.
The dozen or so tankers that have not been cleaned are mostly from PDVSA's fleet of owned and leased vessels, according to a series of PDVSA's internal operational reports confirmed by Reuters vessel tracking data.
In addition, another 11 tankers in early January are being held up for ""financial retention,"" a classification used by PDVSA in its internal reports to identify loaded vessels that have been embargoed or temporarily retained by port authorities, inspection firms or maritime agencies due to unpaid bills.
Those tankers, along with several smaller ones retained for other operational delays, are holding a combined 2.9 million barrels, according to the data. 
The list includes the Aframax Hero, loaded in September with 520,000 barrels of fuel oil bound for China. The cargo is moored in Curacao, delayed by more than 100 days, until a payment to inspection firm Saybolt (N:CLB) is made. [nL1N1CY00P]
PDVSA's crude exports fell to 1.59 million barrels per day (bpd) in the last quarter of 2016 from 1.82 million bpd in the first quarter, a 13 percent decline, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data. [http://tmsnrt.rs/2baTeGm] 
DIRTY BUSINESS
Vessels started to become soiled by crude in PDVSA's ports last year amid intermittent oil leaks at Bajo Grande terminal in Venezuela's Lake Maracaibo, according to sources close to that operation. 
Maritime laws prohibit stained tankers from navigating international waters until hull cleaning is performed. While PDVSA's debts to cleaning firms grow, the leaks have not been repaired, so dozens of vessels have traveled within the country in recent months, spreading the problem to other terminals, including Puerto la Cruz, La Salina, Cardon and Amuay, the documents state.
Cleaning, which is performed at the Guaranao Port, located close to Venezuela's largest refinery, has taken as much as two months in some cases, an inspector said.
A crude spill at Jose in January stained more tankers, this time affecting vessels waiting to load crude for exports. 
PDVSA last week said the affected dock at Jose resumed operations, but there is a logjam of ships needing cleaning, affecting regular foreign buyers of Venezuelan crude, the inspector and a trader from a firm buying Venezuelan oil said. [nL1N1F71I7][nL1N1F80NG]

Some of PDVSA's joint venture partners in projects in the Orinoco belt have proposed picking up part of the bill, paying cleaning companies in dollars to amortize debts faster and ease the bottleneck, but the state-run firm has refused due to its cash flow constraints, the trader said.

GE's plan and similar promises from companies like Italy's Eni (MI:ENI) to work with Nigeria to rehabilitate the country's three oil refineries could help the government as it tries to reduce costly imported oil products. 
The work was raised during a meeting with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), a GE spokeswoman said late on Tuesday.
""We propose that work commences either with the Warri or Port Harcourt refinery as a pilot, as we set a target to improve the refinery capacity before the end of 2017,"" GE told the NNPC, according to a statement from the state oil firm.
Imports are consuming a large portion of the nation's scarce foreign currency, but the run-down state of the refineries themselves, which are also subject to frequent pipeline attacks, has hampered progress.
Nigeria's Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu has said that  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and Total were also interested in working on the refineries.

GE and NNPC could also cooperate on national power projects, said the Nigerian firm, as the country remains plagued by cuts and shortages and a creaking power grid.

Crude oil for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 34 cents, or nearly 0.7%, to $52.83 a barrel by 3:05AM ET (08:05GMT), after rising 43 cents, or 0.85, a day earlier.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 35 cents, or about 0.6%, to $55.09 a barrel. The international benchmark gained 21 cents, or around 0.4%, on Tuesday.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its weekly report on oil supplies at 10:30AM ET (15:30GMT) Wednesday, amid analyst expectations for a rise of 2.8 million barrels.
Gasoline inventories are expected to rise by 498,000 barrels while stocks of distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, are forecast to fall by 970,000 barrels.
After markets closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories rose by 2.9 million barrels in the week ended January 20.
The API report also showed a gain of 4.8 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks rose 2.0 million barrels.
Futures have been trading in a narrow range around the low-to-mid $50s over the past month as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production and hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week jumped by 29 to 551, the biggest one-week increase in nearly four years.
U.S. drilling activity has risen by more than 6% since mid-2016, taking it back to levels seen in late 2014, when strong U.S. crude output contributed to a collapse in oil prices.
The data raised concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade, energy ministers said over the weekend as producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
Ministers said that 1.5 million barrels a day of the roughly 1.8 million in cuts pledged by OPEC and non-OPEC countries have already been taken out of the market.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for February ticked down 0.3 cents, or 0.2% to $1.554 a gallon, while February heating oil slumped 1.4 cents, or 0.9%, to $1.627 a gallon.

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2017 11:11PM ET</span>",Trump clears way for controversial oil pipelines,"By Steve Holland and Valerie Volcovici
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed orders on Tuesday smoothing the path for the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines in a move to expand energy infrastructure and roll back key Obama administration environmental actions. 
Oil producers in Canada and North Dakota are expected to benefit from a quicker route for crude oil to U.S. Gulf Coast refiners. But going ahead with the pipelines would mark a bitter defeat for Native American tribes and climate activists, who successfully blocked the projects earlier and vowed to fight the decisions through legal action.
Trump campaigned on promises to increase domestic energy production. Before taking office he said the Dakota pipeline should be completed and that he would revive the C$8 billion ($6.1 billion) Keystone XL project, which was rejected in 2015 by then-President Barack Obama.
U.S. crude imports have fallen dramatically in recent years as domestic production has boomed, but the world's largest oil consumer still relies heavily on imports.
Even though Canada is already the biggest source of U.S. crude imports, boosting the flow from a close ally is seen in Washington as a way to improve U.S. energy security.
""It goes to show we as a nation build infrastructure that is part of a comprehensive energy plan to make our energy secure,"" Republican Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota told Reuters. 
TransCanada Corp said it would resubmit an application for a permit for Keystone XL after Trump signed an order saying the company could re-apply. The application will be reviewed by the U.S. State Department, which has 60 days to reach a decision. 
The orders look set to undo victories won by protesters in North Dakota against Energy Transfer Partners, which has nearly completed construction of the Dakota line. Despite the advanced phase of the project, the Obama administration in December denied the company a permit to tunnel under the Missouri River.
Protesters rallied for months against plans to route the $3.8 billion pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, saying it threatened water resources and sacred Native American sites.
At one point, nearly 10,000 people had flocked to federal land in North Dakota, including 4,000 veterans after protests turned violent at times. The main protest camp has dwindled to several hundred after the Standing Rock tribe asked activists to leave when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied the easement.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Standing Rock Sioux said they would fight the orders.
""Americans know this pipeline was unfairly rerouted towards our nation and without our consent. The existing pipeline route risks infringing on our treaty rights, contaminating our water and the water of 17 million Americans downstream,"" said Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock tribe.
OIL INDUSTRY CHEERS
The North Dakota Petroleum Council, the trade group for state oil producers relying on Dakota Access to expand their crude transport options, cheered Trump's order. About 1 million barrels a day are currently produced in North Dakota.
""We think this is a great step forward for energy security in America,"" said Ron Ness, the council's president. 
The more than 800,000 bpd Keystone XL pipeline would bring heavy crude from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The project was conceived nearly a decade ago, but since then the U.S. shale revolution has redefined oil flows, with domestic refiners finding themselves awash with supply and needing fewer imports. 
Canadian Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said in Calgary that Keystone XL has all the regulatory approvals it needs in Canada, and that the project would be ""very positive for Canada."" 
Environmental activists campaigned against the Keystone XL pipeline for more than seven years, eventually winning a victory when Obama rejected the project in 2015. 
Trip Van Noppen, president of nonprofit environmental law organization Earthjustice, said in a statement that Trump ""appears to be ignoring the law, public sentiment and ethical considerations"" with the decision.
TransCanada shares closed up 2.7 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
Trump said on Tuesday in Washington that Keystone XL would create 28,000 jobs, but that figure is at odds with a 2014 U.S. State Department environmental study that said the project would create 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs. 
Shares of ETP, the company building the 450,000 barrel-a-day Dakota pipeline, ended the day up 3.5 percent in U.S. trading. 
Trump owned ETP stock through at least mid-2016, according to financial disclosure forms, and ETP's chief executive, Kelcy Warren, donated $100,000 to his campaign. 
'YOU CAN'T DRINK OIL' 
The protest against the 1,172-mile (1,885 km) Dakota pipeline was concentrated around blocking a permit to tunnel under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that forms part of the Missouri River, adjacent to the Standing Rock reservation.
The Army Corps earlier this month said it would begin an environmental assessment that could delay the project further. Tuesday's White House memoranda said the Army and the Army Corps of Engineers should review and quickly approve permits for Dakota Access. 
In Cannon Ball, North Dakota, protesters, many of whom have stayed at the camp for months, said they would continue fighting to protect the environment.
At a protest in front of the White House, a few hundred demonstrators shouted slogans and carried signs, including one that read: ""Now environmental rapist.""
""What happened today is an attack on our homes,"" said Jade Begay, a spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network, which fights against mining and dumping on native lands. ""We are going to continue to show up at your home, Donald Trump.""
In New York City, about 300 protesters gathered outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower, chanting slogans such as ""If all lives matter, then Native lives matter"" and ""You can't drink oil, even in the soil."" 
Actress and activist Jane Fonda, speaking to protesters with a bullhorn, called Trump ""the predator in chief"" and warned of the danger of oil spills.

1053,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2017 03:21PM ET</span>",Struggling U.S. farm sector faces new threat as TPP dies,"By Mark Weinraub
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to back out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, a $62 billion market for U.S. farmers, provides a fresh threat to a slumping agricultural economy that has grown increasingly dependent on exports.
Agricultural groups expressed disappointment over the move and urged the new administration to find alternative ways to boost product shipments to Asian countries. Trump announced the cancellation on Monday, quickly fulfilling a campaign promise.
Trump won nearly two-thirds of the rural vote in November, with big agricultural states including Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio and Indiana all lining up for the Republican.
The TPP, which was never approved by Congress, was a 12-nation trade pact which the Obama administration framed as way for the United States to establish economic leadership in the region. But Trump, who wants to boost manufacturing, claimed the deal hurt the U.S. job market.
""The TPP held great promise for us, and has been a key priority for several years now. We're very disappointed to see the withdrawal,"" said Ron Moore, president of the American Soybean Association. 
Soybeans have been a rare bright spot in the struggling agriculture sector and even helped boost overall U.S. economic growth as prices for most crops have faded. But strength in the oilseed's price was largely due to overseas demand.
A 10 percent jump in soybean shipments during the third quarter helped spur the biggest gross domestic product gains in two years. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) expects 2016-17 soy exports to hit a record 2.05 billion bushels, accounting for nearly half of the recently harvested U.S. crop.
The United States is a net exporter of agricultural goods, and shipments to the 11 other countries in the TPP deal totaled $61.735 billion in 2015, latest data shows. The Obama administration had touted TPP as a trigger for further gains. At its annual Outlook Forum in 2016, the USDA had themed its trade-related sessions ""U.S. Exports in the warm glow of a completed Trans-Pacific Partnership.""
Trump signaled he wants to strike trade pacts with individual countries instead of joining TPP, said U.S. Senator Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa. The message to the country was: ""I like trade and we need to negotiate down barriers,"" Grassley told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday.
Negotiating bilateral deals could take years, though, Grassley said, adding that ""it's just not an easy thing to do."" Japan is the top priority, he added.
THE CHINA FACTOR
U.S. farmers and trade groups are also concerned that backing out of the deal could provide other countries with better access to China, a major agriculture goods importer that was not part of the TPP negotiations.
""Mounting competition and new trade agreements within that region that exclude the U.S. continue to block opportunities for the U.S. feed industry to capture this demand,"" Joel Newman, president and chief executive of the American Feed Industry Association, said in a statement. 
Australia and New Zealand said on Tuesday they would encourage China and other Asian countries to join the trade pact. 
The U.S. Meat Export Federation, a trade group that promotes sales of U.S. meat overseas, wants to hear details on what the Trump administration plans to do to improve trade now that TPP is officially dead.
""We urge the new administration to utilize all means available to return the United States to a competitive position, so that our industry can continue to serve this important international customer base and further expand our export opportunities,"" Philip Seng, the federation's chief executive, said.
U.S. meat exporters could have made their biggest potential gains in Japan, which bought $2.88 billion of U.S. beef and pork in 2015, and Vietnam if TPP had been implemented, said Joe Schuele, federation spokesman. He declined to quantify in dollar amounts those possible gains. 

""We look at access to the Asia Pacific region as being very, very important to both the beef and pork industries,"" Schuele said.

Elsewhere, Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rose 30 cents, or about 0.5%, to $55.52 a barrel, after falling 26 cents, or around 0.5%, a day earlier.

That compares with a withdrawal of 243 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 211 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 176 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 2.917 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 12.9% lower than levels at this time a year ago and around 2.6% below the five-year average for this time of year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday on evidence that the global market was tightening as lower production by OPEC and other exporters drained stocks, but analysts said higher U.S. output could eventually limit gains.
Benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 40 cents at $55.63 a barrel by 1025 GMT. U.S. light crude (CLc1) was 40 cents higher at to $53.15.
Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and big producers outside the group said on Sunday that of the almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) they had agreed to remove from the market starting on Jan. 1, 1.5 million bpd had already been cut.
Ministers were engaged in a campaign of ""bullish rhetoric"", talking up their deal to make sure the market responds positively, said Tamas Varga, senior analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
""Call it a charm offensive or determination to succeed,"" Varga said. ""One thing is certain: the level and the depth of cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers is unprecedented.""
Bernstein Energy said global oil inventories declined by 24 million barrels to 5.7 billion barrels in the fourth quarter of last year from the previous quarter. This amounts to about 60 days of world oil consumption. 
""This is the biggest quarterly decline since the fourth quarter of 2013, confirming that inventory builds are now reversing as the market shifts from oversupply to undersupply,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note to clients.
Iraq's oil minister said on Monday most major oil companies working in its territory were participating in output reductions agreed as part of the OPEC deal.
But the reduction in supply by oil majors is being offset by an increase in U.S. production as prices rise.
U.S. drillers added the most rigs in nearly four years, data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed on Friday, extending an eight-month drilling recovery.
U.S. oil production has risen by more than 6 percent since mid-2016, though it remains 7 percent below the 2015 peak. It is back to levels seen in late 2014, when strong U.S. crude output contributed to a crash in oil prices.

""The rising oil supply from the United States in coming months is likely to preclude any further increase in oil prices,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Carsten Fritsch. ""In view of the record-high optimism exhibited by speculative financial investors, we see a risk of falling prices.""

Gold for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped $2.00, or around 0.2%, to $1,213.55 a troy ounce by 4:10AM ET (09:10GMT), after rallying $10.70, or 0.9%, a day earlier.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.2% at 100.15, recovering after slumping to a seven-week low of 99.88 earlier.
The dollar sold off after President Donald Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that an ""excessively strong"" dollar can have negative short-term impacts on the U.S. economy.
Mnuchin is still awaiting confirmation by the Senate, which has yet to schedule a vote.
Prices of the yellow metal jumped to $1,219.40 on Monday, a level not seen since November 22, as the U.S. dollar tumbled amid uncertainty around the economic policies of new U.S. President Donald Trump.
In his latest executive order, Trump signed to formally withdraw the U.S. from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, distancing America from its Asian allies.
Trump has also vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with leaders of Canada and Mexico.
Global financial markets will continue to focus on Trump for further details on his promises of tax reform, infrastructure spending and deregulation, as well as insight regarding policies on China and the domestic economy.
The president vowed “massive” cuts in taxes and said he could reduce regulations by ""75% or more"" to help businesses create more jobs in the U.S. in a meeting with top executives of U.S. companies at the White House on Monday. Trump also reiterated his pledge to impose a hefty border tax.

Iraq's oil minister said on Monday that most oil majors working on its territory were participating in oil output reductions agreed as part of the deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to help to balance the market.
Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rose 53 cents, or about 1%, to $55.75 a barrel by 3:10AM ET (08:10GMT), after falling 26 cents, or around 0.5%, a day earlier.
Elsewhere, crude oil for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 45 cents, or nearly 0.9%, to $53.22 a barrel.
The U.S. benchmark slumped 47 cents, or 0.9%, on Monday as prospects of rising U.S. production weighed on the market.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week jumped by 29 to 551, the biggest one-week increase in nearly four years.
U.S. drilling activity has risen by more than 6% since mid-2016, taking it back to levels seen in late 2014, when strong U.S. crude output contributed to a collapse in oil prices.
The data raised concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade, energy ministers said over the weekend as producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
Ministers said that 1.5 million barrels a day of the roughly 1.8 million in cuts pledged by OPEC and non-OPEC countries have already been taken out of the market.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
Futures have been trading in a narrow range around the low $50s over the past month as sentiment in oil markets has been torn between expectations of a rebound in U.S. shale production and hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by major global producers.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for February ticked up 0.5 cents, or 0.4% to $1.580 a gallon, while February heating oil added 0.8 cents, or 0.5%, to $1.634 a gallon.

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2017 08:20PM ET</span>",Trump’s new EPA transition team draws from oil industry groups,"By Valerie Volcovici and Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has drawn heavily from the energy industry lobby and pro-drilling think tanks to build its landing team for the Environmental Protection Agency, according to a list of the newly introduced 10-member team seen by Reuters on Monday.
The email lists at least three former researchers from think-tanks funded by the billionaire industrialist brothers Charles and David Koch and at least one former lobbyist for the mining industry. Several members of the team have also publicly argued against U.S. efforts to combat climate change, a key function of the EPA under former President Barack Obama.
The team's make-up has reinforced expectations that Trump will follow through on his promise to slash U.S. environmental regulation as a way to promote drilling and mining.
The team, charged with preparing the agency for new leadership, replaces the initial EPA transition group picked by Trump after the November election but before his swearing-in.
Trump’s nominee to run the EPA, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, is awaiting Senate confirmation.
""We are looking forward to working with the career professionals at the EPA to make this transition work as well as possible, and to carry out the Agency’s mission to protect public health and the environment,"" according to the email. ""While transitions are always hard, straight forward honest communication combined with respect for each other will make the process work much better.""
Charles Munoz was named in the email as White House liaison on the new EPA team. He was a top organizer for Trump in Nevada during his campaign for the White House and helped set up the state's chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a political advocacy group funded by the Kochs.
Another team member, David Schnare, is a lawyer and environmental scientist who spent 33 years as a staffer at the EPA. More recently Schnare was legal counsel at The Energy & Environment Legal Institute, which has received funding from the Koch brothers-linked Donors Trust fund. The institute describes itself as seeking to correct ""onerous federal and state governmental actions that negatively impact energy and the environment."" 
Schnare has also worked at the Center for Environmental Stewardship at the Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, which has been funded partially by the Charles Koch Foundation.
George Sugiyama, who was part of the initial EPA transition team, is also listed part of the new team. He was chief counsel for Republican Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, a vocal climate change doubter. Before working for Inhofe, Sugiyama lobbied on behalf of the National Mining Association.
David Kreutzer is also staying on from the initial team. Kreutzer was a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a group funded by foundations controlled by Koch Industries and other energy firms. He has called Obama’s efforts to combat climate change costly and unfair to certain industries, and has advocated for more Arctic drilling.
The new EPA team’s communications director is Doug Ericksen, a current Washington state senator who has served as Trump’s deputy campaign director for the northwestern state. Ericksen has a degree in environmental science and serves as chair of the state senate’s energy and environment committee. He opposes the climate policies of Washington state's Democratic Governor Jay Inslee, including targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Holly Greaves will oversee budget issues on the landing team. She was a senior audit manager at KPMG, and previously worked at Ernst & Young in the firm’s advisory services position.
Other team members included Justin Schwab, the EPA team's legal advisor, who used to work at law firm Baker Hostetler.

Washington State Senator Don Benton, a Republican who ran a county environmental department, was also listed, along with Patrick Davis, a Republican political consultant, and Layne Bangerter, an Idaho rancher who worked with Republican U.S. Senator Mike Crapo on wilderness management bills.

OPEC and several independent producers agreed last year to cut supply, the first such deal in 15 years, as of Jan. 1, 2017 to remove a glut. The effort has helped oil prices (LCOc1) to rise to $55 a barrel, from a 12-year low near $27 a year ago.
Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi said that to deliver Iraq's share of the reduction, the country had cut output from its ""national fields"" and those of international oil companies (IOCs) working in Iraq were also participating.
""We are in collaboration with IOCs to cut from their part,"" he told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference. ""We are in agreement with most IOCs, not all of them, that they will be in line with us. This is going well.""
Iraq agreed to lower its production by 210,000 barrels per day (bpd) under the deal and Luaibi said earlier on Monday Iraq was abiding by the accord. 
The Iraqi minister also told Reuters he was ""very happy"" with the progress of the output cutting agreement, and expressed hope that oil prices would increase further.
""It is heading toward $60 now. We hope it will get to the level of $60 and $60-$65 will be reachable.""
He said it was too early to say if the supply-limiting deal needed to be extended beyond the first half of 2017.
""We'll see. We think the market will balance.""
Iraq is now OPEC's second-largest oil producer having rapidly boosted output in recent years, and is aiming to increase supply further in future once the OPEC deal has ended.

""So far, we are on the level of 6-7 (million bpd),"" the minister said, asked where he saw the ideal level for Iraqi production in the longer term.

Crude oil for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange shed 26 cents, or around 0.5%, to $52.96 a barrel by 3:50AM ET (08:50GMT).
Elsewhere, Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dipped 15 cents, or about 0.3%, to $55.34 a barrel.
Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week jumped by 29 to 551, the largest weekly increase since a recovery in the rig count began in June and the highest level in around 14 months.
The data raised concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade, energy ministers said on Sunday as producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
Ministers said that 1.5 million barrels a day of the roughly 1.8 million in cuts pledged by OPEC and non-OPEC countries have already been taken out of the market.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.

Gold for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange touched a session high of $1,219.40 a troy ounce, a level not seen since November 22.
It was last at $1,214.50 by 3:10AM ET (08:10GMT), up almost $10.00, or 0.8%.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.5% at 100.25 in early trade, after slumping to a seven-week low of 100.17 earlier.
The dollar sold off after President Trump struck a protectionist tone in his inauguration speech on Friday, disappointing investors who hoped to hear further details on his promises of tax cuts and other stimulus.
Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
Investors will get back to the business of watching economic data for fresh indications on the health of the economy in the week ahead, with Friday's advanced reading for U.S. growth in the spotlight.
Besides the GDP report, this week's calendar also features U.S. data on existing home sales on Tuesday, initial jobless claims and new home sales on Thursday, followed by durable goods orders and revised consumer sentiment on Friday.
A recent string of solid data reinforced the view that the U.S. economy is sufficiently robust to warrant higher interest rates in the months ahead.
The Federal Reserve indicated last month that at least three rate increases were in the offing for 2017, according to a forecast of interest rates from members of the central bank, known as the dot-plot.
However, traders remained unconvinced. Instead, markets are pricing in just two rate hikes during the course of this year, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
A delay in raising interest rates would be seen as positive for gold, a non-interest-bearing asset, and negative for the dollar.

1076,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2017 08:50PM ET</span>",LME's pitch for share of gold market faces bumpy ride,"By Peter Hobson and Pratima Desai
LONDON (Reuters) - Fears of inflexibility and rising costs are sapping enthusiasm for the London Metal Exchange's new suite of gold contracts, potentially leaving the exchange reliant on the threat of an increasing regulatory burden to drive uptake.
London's $5 trillion-a-year gold trade has, along with the rest of the City of London, found itself under increased scrutiny since the Libor scandal, with U.S. lawsuits alleging rigging against the banks that set bullion prices.
Regulatory pressure sparked the fall of the near century-old telephone-based gold fix, or benchmark pricing, which was replaced by an electronic alternative in 2015, and reform of the management structure of the London Bullion Market Association.
The LME, owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEx) (HK:0388), says its contracts, which include spot, futures and options, would bring price-setting out of the back rooms of banks by creating a published forward pricing curve for gold and sliver out to five years. 
It also says the contracts' central clearing would free the banks and brokers that dominate London's over-the-counter (OTC) gold market from increasingly onerous capital requirements, creating savings that could be passed to others in the industry.
But a source at a major gold trading bank said: ""There's a lot of caution and probably outright scepticism from market participants whether this will add anything but another cost to the bottom line.""
""In the OTC market there are no fees, you call somebody for a quote and you trade it,"" a source at a metals broker said. 
The LME hasn't detailed the fees for trading and clearing using LME Clear, but said it is ""confident that fee levels will be competitive"".
Scepticism runs deep, however. Metal industry sources cite other failed attempts by the LME to establish new contracts including those for cobalt, molybdenum, plastics and aluminum premiums.
""CRITICAL MASS""
""This set of contracts was never intended to replace or undermine the OTC market."" said Robin Martin, head of market infrastructure at the World Gold Council, an industry body that worked with the LME to design the contracts. 
He said he expected most of the volume on the contracts to come from hedging between banks and brokers - which he said accounts for up to 90 percent of trading in the London market.
These could continue to agree trades bilaterally as under the OTC model, and then clear them on the exchange, enabling savings that would reduce costs for all the industry, he said. 
LME brokers say the specifications are restrictive and the contracts, though physically deliverable, appear to be designed for finance professionals and not the physical market.
A key criticism is the size of the contracts: 100 troy ounces for gold and 5,000 ounces for silver. On the over-the-counter (OTC) market gold and silver can be traded in any number of ounces.
""What happens if our customers want to trade 330 ounces of gold?"" asked one gold trader.
The monthly contract structure meanwhile undermines physical traders' ability to hedge specific dates beyond a month, said a source at a metals broker. 
Martin said at least 30 firms had been consulted during the design process. The contracts allow combinations of daily and monthly futures to hedge any date, he said, while defined lot sizes allow easier netting, compensating for lost flexibility. 
Most gold producers contacted by Reuters said they would not use the LME contracts to hedge, though one, Petropavlovsk, said it would consider doing so. 
Five banks, Goldman Sachs (N:GS), ICBC Standard Bank (SS:601398),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  Natixis  (PA:CNAT) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), and proprietary trader OSTC have partnered with the LME and committed to supply liquidity. 
But two of biggest gold trading banks, JPMorgan (N:JPM) and HSBC (L:HSBA), have not.
""We think we've got critical mass,"" said Martin.
Sources said the LME would struggle to gain a share of the market, particularly given that Shanghai and New York already offer well-established and liquid gold futures. 

""Trading will always go to the place with the most liquidity,"" a source at a major gold trading bank said.

Last week, oil futures finished higher on Friday, logging a modest weekly gain with traders encouraged by signs that global supply is tightening in wake of a planned agreement by major crude producers to cut output.
Oil jumped on Friday after Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said that 1.5 million barrels a day of the roughly 1.8 million in cuts pledged by OPEC and non-OPEC countries have already been taken out of the market.
The upbeat comments added to signs that the oil market is rebalancing.
Prices, however, finished off the session's highs after data showed a sharp weekly rise in the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. jumped by 29 last week to 551, the largest weekly increase since a recovery in the rig count began in June and the highest level in around 14 months.
The data raised concerns that the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production could derail efforts by other major producers to rebalance global oil supply and demand.
In a monthly report issued this week, the International Energy Agency said OPEC production has slowed, declining by 320,000 barrels a day to 33.09 million barrels in December.

The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
Some traders remain skeptical that the planned cuts will be as substantial as the market currently expects. Still, while some major oil producers, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have so far showed signs that they are sticking to their pledge to cut back output, others, such as Libya and Iraq have ramped up production.

VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC countries have made a strong start to lowering their oil output under the first such pact in more than a decade, energy ministers said on Sunday as producers look to reduce oversupply and support prices.
""The deal is a success ...All the countries are sticking to the deal ...(the) results are above expectations,"" Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after the first meeting of a committee set up to monitor the deal.
Ministers said 1.5 million of almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) had been taken out of the market already.
Countries involved in the deal could reduce their output by 1.7 million bpd by the end of the month, Interfax news agency quoted Novak as saying.
Eleven of OPEC's 13 members along with 11 non-OPEC countries have agreed to make cuts for the first half of the year. 
OPEC members Nigeria and Libya, both suffering setbacks in production, were given exemptions.
""The Kingdom [of Saudi Arabia] has taken the initiative and other countries took part in very significant actions,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters following the meeting. 
""Despite demand usually being lower in the first quarter in winter, the actions taken by the Kingdom and many other countries has impacted the market in a tangible way and we have seen the impact in spot prices,"" al-Falih said.
Brent oil prices (LCOc1) that fell to $27.10 a barrel a year ago have held above $50 per barrel since OPEC producers agreed on Dec. 10 to lower output in the first half of 2017.
The cuts are aimed at reducing a global glut in oil that has weighed on oil prices for more than two years.
Falih said implementation of agreed cuts had been ""fantastic"" and he hoped for 100 percent compliance in February.
""We will not accept anything less than 100 percent compliance,"" Kuwaiti oil minister Essam Al-Marzouq, who chairs the five-member ministerial compliance committee, told a news conference.
The other members of the committee represent Algeria, Venezuela, Russia and Oman.
Venezuela has achieved more than half of its planned 95,000 bpd cut, Oil Minister Nelson Martinez told reporters.
SHRINKING INVENTORIES
Full compliance could take global oil inventories back close to their five-year average by mid-2017, lowering oil in storage by around 300 million barrels, Falih said.
""[There are] no surprises so far in terms of demand or supply from other sources so there is no reason for us to suddenly come in January and say we need a bigger reduction or a longer period,"" he said.
Saudi Arabia is producing slightly below 10 million bpd and has informed buyers of substantial cuts scheduled for next month, he said.
Russia has cut its oil output by around 100,000 bpd, Novak said, double what was originally planned. He said Russian oil production had averaged around 11.15 million bpd this month.
He told reporters it was too early to talk about extending the current deal beyond the planned six months but that remained an option.
""Everyone sees that the agreements on oil production cuts have already have a positive effect on oil markets. The market has become more stable and predictable,"" Novak said.
NEXT MEETING
On Sunday it was agreed that a technical joint committee (JTC) would be created comprising a representative for each of the five members of the monitoring committee and as well as the OPEC presidency, which is currently held by Saudi Arabia. 
The JTC will cooperate with the OPEC Secretariat in compiling production data which will be presented to the ministerial monitoring committee by the 17th of every month, OPEC said in a news release.
The monitoring committee will communicate after the 17th of every month and plans two meetings ahead of the next ordinary OPEC meeting in Vienna on May 25.
The next meeting in March is set for Kuwait. 
SHALE IMPACT
Ministers were also keen to highlight that any increase in high-cost U.S. shale oil production as a result of rising oil prices would be absorbed by rising demand.
""We are not worried that production in the U.S. is increasing as prices go up because I think this will be absorbed by an increase in demand,"" Al-Marzouq said.
Qatari Energy Minister Mohammed Al-Sada said with increasing demand ""shale oil will all be catered for"".
Russia's Novak also said he was not worried about higher oil output in the United States.

""From this moment on, it's going to be America First,"" Trump said. ""Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.""
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for March delivery rose 0.67% to $1,209.50 a troy ounce, while copper futures gained 0.21% to $2.616 a pound with the industrial metal seen as a bellwether for global economic prospects.
The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies on Friday as Donald Trump became the 45th president of the United States and used his inaugural speech to hit populist themes on halting off-shoring of work that have raised concerns of a trade war with leading manufacturing exporters such as China.
The U.S. dollar index fell 0.33% to 100.07. In earlier trade, gold's safe-have status was sought as caution surrounded Trump’s future policies. The February contract ended Thursday’s session 0.87% lower at $1,201.50 an ounce.
However, gold faces resistance to higher prices on expected interest rate hikes this year with Fed Chair Janet Yellen noting on Thursday the central bank should continue to raise interest rates, but slowly.
Speaking at a conference in San Francisco, Yellen said that ""allowing the economy to run markedly and persistently ‘hot’ would be risky and unwise,"" before adding: ""I consider it prudent to adjust the stance of monetary policy gradually over time.""
The greenback also initially strengthened on Thursday following the release of strong U.S. jobless claims and housing starts data, as well as an upbeat Philly Fed manufacturing activity report on Thursday. A stronger dollar makes gold, denominated in greenbacks, more expensive in other currencies, particularly the world's top two buyers, India and China.
On Friday data showed that China’s gross domestic product rose 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016, in line with expectations. Year-on-year, China’s economy grew at a rate of 6.8%, slightly above expectations for a growth rate of 6.7%.

Crude oil for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 2.04% to settle at $52.42 a barrel. On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for March delivery rose 2.46% to settle at $55.49 a barrel.
However, price gains were tempered as U.S. oil drillers added 29 rigs by the end of last week taking the total to 551, compared to 510 a year ago, as drilling activity in shale formations continues to grow again with higher oil prices.
Since crude prices first topped $50 a barrel in May drillers have added a total of 235 oil rigs, with almost two-thirds in the Permian basin, the nation's biggest shale oil formation located in west Texas and eastern New Mexico. Other supply responses are coming from OPEC members Libya, Iran and Nigeria which are exempt from the cvuts.
Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said its output now stands at 722,000 bpd, resuming its rise from levels below 400,000 barrels a day late in December after warring factions allowed oil fields to resume output and ports to load supplies.

1085,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2017 07:56AM ET</span>",China-U.S. trade tensions high on Big Oil's worry list,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Oil executives and Middle East producers are concerned that trade tensions between the United States and China risk clouding the outlook for global energy demand growth and a recovery in the price of oil.
""It is not unique to our country to feel a certain level of anxiety (about tensions). But there is a lot of wisdom on both sides... I hope this anxiety will prove unfounded,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Reuters.
Chinese President Xi Jinping offered a vigorous defense of free trade in Davos on Tuesday, underscoring Beijing's desire to play a greater global role as the United States turns inward. 
""The two largest economies need to sort out their differences for the wellbeing of the global community,"" Falih, who represents the world's largest oil exporter, said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
This view was echoed by oil executives gathered at the meeting of politicians and business leaders in the Swiss Alps.
""The biggest risks for energy markets could come from U.S.-China antagonism, ranging from geopolitical issues in Asia to potential trade wars,"" said Majid Jafar, chief executive of Crescent Petroleum, a private Middle East oil company, headquartered in the UAE.
Xi cautioned other countries against blindly pursuing their national interests, in an apparent reference to the ""America first"" policies of Donald Trump.
Trump, who will be inaugurated as U.S. president on Friday, campaigned on a promise to confront China more aggressively on trade, including by levying new tariffs on goods from abroad.
""I hope cool heads will prevail on both sides,"" BP's chief executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in Davos.
China, the world's top goods exporter, is heavily dependent on free trade and would be hit hard by a new wave of protectionism and a broader backlash against globalization.
Beijing is also almost on par with the U.S. as the world's top oil importer and any slowdown of the Chinese economy would badly hit global demand since Beijing has been the locomotive of the global oil consumption growth for the past decade.
""The rise of China should be the source of stability - not conflict,"" Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir told a panel at the WEF, which is effectively the world's largest gathering of oil executives and officials.
Besides promising tougher policies on China, Trump has also said that Washington should boost U.S. energy independence from oil cartels such as OPEC.
Falih said that any attempt to introduce import tariffs on oil from abroad to support U.S. crude producers would primarily hit a very strong U.S. oil refining and chemical industry.

And when asked about the rising tensions, OPEC head Mohammed Barkindo said: ""The world needs stability in order to restore robust economic growth and ensure this task is achieve through collaboration at all levels"".

Speaking at a conference in San Francisco, Yellen said that ""allowing the economy to run markedly and persistently ‘hot’ would be risky and unwise,"" before adding: ""I consider it prudent to adjust the stance of monetary policy gradually over time.""
The greenback also strengthened following the release of strong U.S. jobless claims and housing starts data, as well as an upbeat Philly Fed manufacturing activity report.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
But sentiment on the U.S. dollar became more vulnerable on Friday morning, ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony amid sustained uncertainty over the new U.S. administration’s fiscal and economic policies.
Demand for gold was also boosted by data on Friday showing that China’s gross domestic product rose 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016, in line with expectations.

CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - Tensions have increased this week near the construction site of the Dakota Access pipeline, with repeated clashes between protesters and police ahead of Friday's inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, an unabashed fan of the $3.8 billion project.
Police used tear gas and fired bean-bag rounds to disperse crowds, and have arrested nearly 40 people since Monday, many of them on a bridge that has been the site of frequent confrontations, law enforcement officials said.
Demonstrators at the shrinking protest camp have voiced desperation and declining morale, citing weaker support from the local Standing Rock Sioux tribe that launched the effort last year and the backing that Trump, a Republican, will provide the pipeline once he takes office on Friday. 
“It's closing in on the inauguration, and people want to make sure that their voices are heard while they still have a chance,"" said Benjamin Johansen, 29, a carpenter from Iowa who has been at the camp for two months. ""There's a very real possibility that once the new president is inaugurated, our voices won't matter.”
This week's clashes between protesters and police are the most serious since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied an easement in December for the pipeline to travel under Lake Oahe. 
Native Americans and environmental activists have said that the pipeline threatens water resources and sacred lands. 
Members of the Standing Rock Sioux, whose reservation is near the pipeline, asked protesters to disperse following the Corps' decision, but around 600 remain in the main camp, now called Oceti Oyate. 
The tribe is asking that the camp be evacuated by Jan. 29, and is offering an alternate site on reservation land that avoids any risk of flooding. Tribal leaders and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum have warned about potential flooding at the protest site in early March.
The call for the protest to end has left those still on site in a darker mood, said Amanda Moore, 20, an activist with Black Lives Matter. 
""We're stressed with Donald Trump's inauguration coming so soon, and feeling that we have to stop the pipeline now,"" she said. 
Protesters and law enforcement faced off early Thursday morning on Backwater Bridge for the third straight night, with demonstrators throwing snowballs at officers and climbing onto a barricade before being pushed back. 
Law enforcement fired a volley of bean bags and sponges at protesters at around 2 a.m., sending protesters fleeing from the ice- and snow-covered bridge, according to a Reuters witness. Police said they also used pepper spray. 
The skirmish came as the Army began the process of launching an environmental study of the pipeline. 
At least one protester was taken to the hospital, the Morton County Sheriff's Department said in a statement. Since Monday, 37 have been arrested, adding up to 624 since August. 
""They come and say they want to pray and want us to fall back, then they get aggressive and try and flank our officers and get behind us,"" Maxine Herr, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's department said. ""What they say and what they do are two different things.""
Both Herr and protesters conceded that communication between the two sides had deteriorated in past months.
Kalisa Wight Rock, a volunteers from Georgia working as a medic, said focus shifting away from the protest had left some feeling abandoned after the widespread attention the opposition to the pipeline garnered last year. 

""A lot of people think this is over and that we're not still here,"" he said.

A monitoring committee charged with tracking adherence to the global deal is due to meet in Vienna for the first time on January 22.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its weekly report on oil supplies at 11:00AM ET (16:00GMT) Thursday, amid analyst expectations for a decline of 342,000 barrels.
Gasoline inventories are expected to rise by 2.0 million barrels while stocks of distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, are forecast to increase by 0.2 million barrels.
This week's report comes out one day later than usual due to Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.
After markets closed Wednesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories fell by 5.0 million barrels in the week ended January 13.
The API report also showed a gain of 9.75 million barrels in gasoline stocks, while distillate stocks rose 1.75 million barrels.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for February ticked up 0.6 cents, or 0.45% to $1.552 a gallon, while February heating oil added 1.7 cents, or 1.1%, to $1.627 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for February delivery shed 2.3 cents, or 0.7%, to $3.379 per million British thermal units.
Market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due at 10:30ET (15:30GMT), which is expected to show a draw of 231 billion cubic feet in the week ended January 13.
That compares with a withdrawal of 151 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 178 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 170 billion cubic feet.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Oil stocks around the world need to decline by at least another 270 million barrels to reach a five-year industry average for OPEC to be able to say the markets are becoming balanced, OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo told Reuters.
""The primary goal is to accelerate the stocks drawdown,"" Barkindo said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
""We are already seeing stocks coming down from the high levels. Our eyes will continue to focus on the level of drawdown to bring the level near a five-year industry average,"" he said.
""Stocks have already come down to below 3 billion barrels in OECD commercial stocks. The delta now (with the five-year average) is around 270 million,"" he said.
OPEC's latest monthly oil market report, issued on Wednesday, said OECD commercial stocks stood at 2.993 billion barrels in November.
Barkindo said the stocks drawdown would help rebalance the market and establish the ""equilibrium oil price"" that will encourage investments in the sector after two consecutive years of capital expenditure cuts by state and private firms around the world.
OPEC agreed to reduce output in tandem with non-OPEC Russia and several other producers in December, in the first such move in 15 years. Barkindo said he believed Russia was playing a long-term game with OPEC.
""I have no doubts in Russia's commitment to continue to participate with us and solidify this platform effectively establishing a stabilizing forum for the short, mid and long-term,"" Barkindo said.
OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed to establish a joint ministerial monitoring committee and Barkindo said a meeting this weekend in Vienna would adopt an oversight and compliance mechanism.

OPEC will meet in May when it will decide whether to propose to extend the output cutting measures together with non-OPEC countries.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices recovered from a one-week low on Thursday as the International Energy Agency said oil markets were tightening even before cuts agreed by OPEC and other producers took effect. 
Oil prices have gyrated this year as the market's focus has swung from hopes that oversupply may be curbed by output cuts announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers to fears that a rebound in U.S. shale production could swamp any such reductions.
Benchmark Brent crude was up 50 cents at $54.42 a barrel by 1220 GMT after closing down 2.8 percent in the previous session. U.S. crude was up 40 cents at $51.48 a barrel, having dropped to a one-week low on Wednesday of $50.91.
The IEA said that while it was ""far too soon"" to gauge OPEC members' levels of compliance with promised cuts, commercial oil inventories in the developed world fell for a fourth consecutive month in November, with another decline projected for December. 
It raised sharply its 2016 demand growth estimate, and said the data indicated that rising demand was slowly tightening global oil markets.
Still, analysts said it was crucial that OPEC and other producers cut output as promised, particularly as a resilient U.S. shale industry threatened to add more barrels to the market. 
""Discipline and strict adherence to the new quotas will be needed probably throughout 2017 and beyond to see the long-awaited and sustainable rebalancing finally arrive,"" PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga said.
OPEC has said its cuts will help balance the market and that its output had already fallen in December. But it also pointed to the possibility of a rebound in U.S. output amid higher oil prices.
The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, said in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday that he expected U.S. shale oil output to rebound by as much as 500,000 bpd over the course of 2017, which would be a new record.
U.S. data sent more mixed signals. American Petroleum Institute (API) data on Wednesday showed U.S. crude stocks fell by 5.04 million barrels in the week to Jan. 13, well above the expectations of a 342,000-barrel decline.
But the data also showed larger-than-expected, and potentially bearish, increases in stocks of gasoline and distillates. 

Weekly inventory data is due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) at 1600 GMT.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2017 06:01AM ET</span>","New year, new cuts stir debate about China's steel, coal excess","By Josephine Mason and David Stanway
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The new year has ushered in a new round of capacity cuts as China tries to combat excess in its bloated steel and coal sectors, but the moves are a drop in the ocean in the nation's long struggle to make its heavy industry more efficient.
For years, Beijing has been seeking to cut the share of coal in its energy mix to contain pollution and meet climate change goals while streamlining its unwieldy and over-supplied smoke-stack industries such as steel.
It also comes as the government tries to focus the nation's economy away from heavy industry and cheap manufacturing in favor of the high tech and service sectors.
Beijing far exceeded its targets to eliminate 250 million tonnes of coal and 45 million tonnes of steel capacity last year.
In the first eleven months of the year, it had slashed a whopping 315 million tonnes of coal, according to Reuters' review of provincial data. In steel, capacity cuts were as high as 80 million tonnes, S&P Global Platts estimated. 
Full-year output data will be released on Friday.
This year, the authorities have pledged to slash the same volumes from tens of thousands of plants and mines.
But the excess in both markets is so vast it will take until the end of the decade before the years-long push to shut down inefficient operations makes any inroads on oversupply and as regional governments remain wary of sweeping changes.
""Provinces that rely on steelmaking to provide employment will somehow have to generate new jobs and stop providing handouts to zombie mills for the sake of social stability. But this will not be a quick process,"" said Syliva Cao, steel analyst at S&P Global Platts. 
Much of the outdated, inefficient operations are being replaced with leaner, cleaner ones.
New projects or expansions of existing operations already underway will unleash a whopping 1.5 billion tonnes of new coal supply on the market by the end of 2018, according to industry consultant Wood Mackenzie. That's just under half of current annual output.
It also threatens to add to the glut in raw materials that has drawn accusations from rival producers in the United States and elsewhere that the country is exporting its surplus, hurting prices and crippling competitors abroad.
    ""There's still a lot of (coal) excess. Even though provinces have announced capacity cuts, it won't impact output,"" said Liu Cong, coal associate at Wood Mackenzie.
""We're replacing old with new and still building new highly efficient mines.""
OVERCAPACITY VS OVERPRODUCTION
Among the recent announcements, China's eastern province of Jiangsu was reported to be planning to phase out a total of 17.5 million tonnes of steel capacity by 2020.
But with total capacity estimated at 1.2 billion, the annual surplus could be as high as 400 million tonnes, which S&P Global Platts analysts say illustrates how far China still has to go to rationalize the bulging sector.
Most of the 2016 cuts were idled already, having little impact on actual supplies - output in for January-November 2016 was up 1.1 percent at around 740 million tonnes.
Against that backdrop, the run-up in prices and flurry of speculative buying that has pushed futures prices to multi-year highs in recent months may have been overdone.
""If you look at steel production last year, there was no change compared with 2015. .... The capacity cuts only changed the distribution of steel production, not the total amount,"" said Xu Zhongbo, head of Beijing Metal Consulting. 
An analysis of provincial data illustrates the depth of the cuts in coal that led to a third straight year of lower output as the government pushes ahead with its shift to cleaner, renewable fuels.
Top producing regions Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Shaanxi bore the brunt of the cuts, closing a combined 211.5 million tonnes of output in the first eleven months of last year, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, half of the nation's total closures over that period. 
Shanxi will cut 20 million tonnes of capacity this year, while Hubei province plans to shut its coal mines within two years, state news agency Xinhua reported this week. 
But the slowing growth of the world's second-largest economy, which will crimp manufacturing and demand for critical industrial products, have amplified the need for bigger cuts. 
Analysts warned steel demand may be reaching a peak and coal-fired power output is expected to drop as energy-intensive industries like glass and cement slow.

In a sign of growing supplies, inventories of rebar <0#SH-REBAR-INV>, used in construction, hit their highest since April this week at 4.9 million tonnes, up by 1 million tonnes since the start of December.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Trading house Mercuria is working with banks ING and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) on the first large oil trade based on blockchain technology, as the tradition-bound oil industry tests out digital technology. 
Mercuria is shipping an oil cargo with African crude to China, selling it to one of its shareholders - ChemChina - with ING and Societe Generale helping to execute the deal, Mercuria's chief executive and co-founder Marco Dunand told Reuters.
He announced the deal on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where digitalization is one of the key topics of this year's debates among some of the world's top oil companies and trading houses.
Blockchain works by creating permanent, public ""ledgers"" of all transactions that could potentially replace complicated clearing and settlement systems with one simple ledger. The technology is also behind the bitcoin electronic currency.
""The energy industry will have to digitalize more and more in oil production, refining, shipping. So traders will also have to participate,"" said Dunand.
The concept behind the deal is quite simple, according to Dunand.
Today, when the cargo is shipped from buyer to trader to seller, the ship captain has to stamp the so-called bill of lading - a document issued by a carrier to acknowledge receipt of cargo for shipment. 
The papers then have to go to customs, surveyors and other agents and officials while the carrier has to issue letters of indemnity in case documents are not processed in time.
""It is a pre-archaic process. So introducing blockchain will allow to pass title from buyer to shipper to seller without going through massive paperwork of bills of lading,"" said Dunand.
Dunand said that if the industry managed to standardize blockchain contracts, the whole process of oil trading would become safer, while costs associated with physical transactions and their financing would decline.

""Going forward the challenges will be on the legal side as the blockchain technology is still not recognized by many governments. So banks are now working with various jurisdictions to make sure it can work worldwide,"" said Dunand.

LONDON (Reuters) - World oil markets are slowly tightening as demand rises while investors wait to see if production cuts agreed by OPEC and other producers will be implemented as promised, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday.
In its monthly oil market report, the IEA said output cuts announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 non-OPEC producers in November had ""entered their probation period"".
OPEC agreed in November to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to 32.5 million bpd for the first six months of 2017, together with another 558,000 bpd in cuts from the likes of Russia, Oman and Mexico. 
""It is far too soon to see what level of compliance has been achieved,"" said the IEA, which advises advanced industrial economies on energy policy. ""The market awaits the outcome of the output deal.""
Meanwhile oil stocks are falling and demand is rising.
Commercial oil inventories in the major industrialized countries fell for a fourth consecutive month in November, the IEA said, although they remained more than 300 million barrels above the five-year average. In July last year, OECD commercial stocks hit a record high of 3.101 billion barrels.
The agency said stronger oil consumption had led it to raise its estimate of global oil demand growth over the last year by 110,000 bpd to 1.5 million bpd, well above the average rate of growth seen in this century of 1.2 million bpd. Global oil demand growth hit a five-year peak of 1.8 million bpd in 2015.
This year the agency expects world oil demand growth of around 1.3 million bpd.
Oil production in the United States and other countries outside of OPEC were beginning to respond to higher prices since the announcement of the OPEC production cuts, it said.
Benchmark Brent crude oil (LCOc1) is now trading close to $55 a barrel, up from between $40 and $50 in November and at a level sufficient to allow many new oil projects to operate profitably, industry analysts say.
U.S. oil production was rebounding, led by light tight oil, also commonly known as shale oil, as exploration drilling increased and wells became more efficient, the IEA said.
""Not only is the rig count rising, but recent reports tell us that the productivity of shale activity has improved in leaps and bounds,"" it said.
""Whether it be shorter drilling times or larger amounts of oil produced per well, there is no doubt that the U.S. shale industry has emerged from the $30 a barrel oil world we lived in a year ago much leaner and fitter,"" it added.
The IEA said it expected U.S. light tight production to grow by around 170,000 bpd after falling nearly 300,000 bpd in 2016.

The IEA said the oil market would continue to tighten, stabilizing prices and depleting stocks, if OPEC and fellow oil producers were able to produce close to their promised limits.

Crude oil for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on 65 cents, or around 1.3%, to $51.73 a barrel by 4:00AM ET (09:00GMT), after tumbling $1.37, or nearly 2.6%, a day earlier.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its weekly report on oil supplies at 11:00AM ET (16:00GMT) Thursday, amid analyst expectations for a decline of 342,000 barrels.
Gasoline inventories are expected to rise by 2.0 million barrels while stocks of distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, are forecast to increase by 0.2 million barrels.
This week's report comes out one day later than usual due to Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.
After markets closed Wednesday, the American Petroleum Institute said that U.S. oil inventories fell by 5.0 million barrels in the week ended January 13.

Meanwhile, investors awaited a monthly report from the International Energy Agency due later in the session for further evidence that crude producers are adhering to planned output cuts.
OPEC signaled a falling oil supply surplus this year in its own monthly oil market outlook released on Wednesday as the producer group's output declined from a record high.
The oil cartel said its members pumped 33.085 million barrels per day in December, down 221,000 bpd from November.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
OPEC cut its forecast of supply in 2017 from non-member countries following pledges by Russia and other non-members to join OPEC in limiting output.
OPEC now expects non-OPEC supply to rise by 120,000 bpd this year, down from growth of 300,000 bpd last month, despite an upwardly revised forecast of U.S. shale supply.
Some traders remain skeptical that the planned cuts will be as substantial as the market currently expects.
While some major oil producers, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have so far showed signs that they are sticking to their pledge to cut back output, others, such as Libya and Iraq have ramped up production.
A monitoring committee charged with tracking adherence to the global deal is due to meet in Vienna for the first time on January 22.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for February ticked up 1.1 cents, or 0.7% to $1.556 a gallon, while February heating oil added 2.2 cents, or 1.4%, to $1.632 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for February delivery rose 2.2 cents, or 0.7%, to $3.324 per million British thermal units.

1105,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2017 02:25AM ET</span>",Big Oil back on the acquisition trail as outlook brightens,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - The world's top oil companies are back in acquisition mode, targeting smaller exploration and development firms to boost oil and gas reserves rather than the mega-mergers that followed previous slumps in crude prices.
Since late November, major oil companies have announced 11 deals worth more than $500 million each with a combined value of $31 billion, the clearest sign yet that oil executives are more confident a recovery is underway.
When crude prices collapsed in the second half of 2014, large oil firms slashed spending on exploration and production and offloaded assets to reduce debt so they could cope with lower revenue from oil and gas sales.
But with crude reservoirs declining at a rate of 10 percent a year in some cases, major oil companies are now looking to snap up assets to start growing again and there are plenty of smaller firms burdened with debt looking to sell.
""You're seeing the majors sharpening their pencils after a long while and actually flipping around from disposals to acquisitions,"" said Tony Durrant, chief executive of British energy firm  Premier Oil  (L:PMO), which is looking to sell several stakes in its North Sea operations.
 Total  acquisitions of oil and gas fields, known as upstream assets, tripled to $31 billion in December from a month earlier, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut output for the first time in eight years, according to data from consultancy Energy Market Square (NYSE:SQ).
Deals in the last month of 2016 alone accounted for nearly a quarter of total activity during the year. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2jv9If6)
MAJOR DEALS 
 BP  (L:BP) announced a string of investments in the last two months of 2016, including a $1 billion partnership with Dallas-based Kosmos Energy (N:KOS) in Mauritania and Senegal in West Africa, as well as acquisitions in Abu Dhabi and Azerbaijan.
The British company also spent $375 million on a 10 percent stake in Eni's (MI:ENI) giant Zohr gas field in Egypt while Russian oil giant Rosneft (MM:ROSN) bought 30 percent stake of the same field for $1.575 billion.
France's Total (PA:TOTF) and Norway's  Statoil  (OL:STL) bought into Brazil's lucrative sub-salt deepwater oil fields while ExxonMobil Corp (N:XOM) bought assets in Papua New Guinea to meet growing Asian demand for liquefied natural gas.
The trend continued in January with Total boosting its stake in Uganda's Lake Albert oil project by snapping up most of Tullow Oil's (L:TLW) stake for $900 million. 
ExxonMobile and  Noble Energy  (N:NBL) also struck deals worth nearly $10 billion combined for a larger slice of the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oil field.
While deal making outside the United States almost ground to a halt at the start of 2016, acquisitions in North American shale basins have continued at a steady pace.
In the Permian Basin, for example, the time it takes to produce oil and gas after an initial investment is far quicker and cheaper than developing conventional fields over three to five years.
ONLY CHOICE
More deals are likely this year as the large overhang of crude oil in the world that has weighed on the market since 2014 continues to clear and oil prices rise.
""When you can cut capex (capital spending), two-and-a-half to three years later you see production decline and reserves depleting and you have one choice only and that is going after high quality resource,"" said Sachin Oza, co-manager with Stephen Williams of the Guinness Global Oil and Gas Exploration Trust.
""If you've not spent any time filling your hopper with these opportunities that take five years to build up, there is only one choice: you have to buy them,"" said Oza.
The Guinness Trust is a fund that invests in firms in the early stages of exploration or development of energy resources which it believes will attract investment from oil majors.
Investors reckon large firms will focus on underdeveloped basins in east and west Africa, Romania and Albania, as well as nascent Latin American reserves in places such as Colombia, all areas where the growth potential is seen as greater than in established regions such as North America and the North Sea.
While slides in oil prices typically unleash a wave of takeovers, companies emerging from the current downturn are generally shunning outright acquisitions and instead looking at specific deals for specific fields.
After a prolonged period of low oil prices in the late 1990s Exxon merged with Mobil, Total merged with Elf Aquitaine and Petrofina,  Chevron  (N:CVX) bought Texaco, BP snapped up Amoco and ARCO and Conoco (N:COP) and Philips merged.
This time round, the only stand-out acquisition has been Royal Dutch Shell's (L:RDSa) takeover of BG, which was announced in April 2015 and completed in February a year later for $53 billion.
BUYER'S MARKET
As large oil firms are wary of increasing their debt burden at this point, investors say corporate acquisitions are likely to be limited in numbers and scope but oil field assets are very much in the crosshairs.
Oil majors are opting for joint ventures to develop specific fields in complex deals, such as share swaps or deferred payments, to lower their risk and limit the amount they need to spend upfront following two years of budget cuts.
""The international (ex-U.S.) asset market is a buyer's market, as sellers continue in balance sheet preservation mode,"" said Charles Whall, energy portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management.
""European majors, which already have large dividend commitments, are unwilling to use equity for assets without immediate cash flow ... Most of these asset deals are structured to minimize the debt impact in the near term,"" he said.
Such deals also mean the sellers can retain a stake in the assets as their value rises with oil prices, said Oza and Williams at the Guinness Trust.
Analysts say for much of 2015 and 2016 there was subdued activity because buyers and sellers were too far apart on price.
Buyers hunting for bargain-basement deals were frustrated by sellers holding out for better terms but as oil prices have started to stabilize there has been more convergence.
According to Martijn Rats, equity analyst at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), most of the deals announced in recent months have been based on a long-term oil price of about $60 a barrel to $65 a barrel.

While that is significantly lower than before the collapse in oil prices from a 2014 peak of $115 a barrel, it is still above current long-term oil price forecasts, Rats said.

Global financial markets will continue to focus on Trump as he takes the Oath of Office and offers his inaugural address on Friday. Investors will welcome any detail he may give on his promises of tax reform, infrastructure spending and deregulation, as well as insight regarding policies on China and the domestic economy.
Trump has been credited with being a major catalyst behind the market's impressive rally since election day, although he has yet to outline his economic policies in detail.
The Fed had indicated in December that at least three rate increases were in the offing for 2017, according to a forecast of interest rates from members of the central bank, known as the dot-plot.
However, traders remained unconvinced. Instead, markets are pricing in just two rate hikes during the course of this year, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
A delay in raising interest rates would be seen as positive for gold, a non-interest-bearing asset, and negative for the dollar. On the data front, U.S. Commerce Department said that consumer prices gained 0.3% in December, in line with expectations and after a 0.2% advance the previous month.
Year-over-year, consumer prices increased 2.1% last month, the biggest year-on-year gain since June 2014, a sign that inflation pressures could be building.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light, sweet crude futures for delivery in February edged up 0.06% to $51.44 a barrel, while March Brent crude on London's ICE Futures Exchange was last quoted at $54.24 a barrel, down 0.04%.
The American Petroleum Institute said late Wednesday crude oil inventories dropped 5.0 million barrels in the U.S. at the end of last week, compared to an expected 300,000 barrels build, while gasoline supplies surged 9.75 million barrels. Distillate stocks rose 1.75 million barrels
The estimates come ahead of official data from the U.S. Department of Energy on Thursday, delayed by a day because of a public holiday.
Earlier on Wednesday, OPEC said a surplus of global crude supplies is on the way down and will be aided by demand and a coordinated effort by OPEC and non-OPEC countries to cut almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from the market in the first half of 2017, adding that other sources, including U.S. shale drillers, could pump enough to make a decline less pronounced.
OPEC said the group pumped 33.085 million bpd last month, according to figures OPEC collects from secondary sources, down 221,000 bpd from November.
""A continued normalisation of monetary policies, indicating improving economic conditions, together with the recent historic cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, should help to bring needed stability to the oil market,"" OPEC said.
In other OPEC news this week, shipping industry sources said exports from Iraq's southern Basra port has eased in January, signaling that OPEC's second-largest producer is following through on the group's decision to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd). OPEC members and several other large suppliers aim to reduce output by nearly 1.8 million bpd in the first half of 2017.
Saudi Arabia said on Monday it will meet its commitment to cut output under the global pact with Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said that since the deal came into effect at the New Year all is well.

1110,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2017 01:45PM ET</span>",Oil and Trump: Russians full of optimism in Davos,"By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Sujata Rao
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - What a difference a year makes.
Twelve months ago, the mood of the Russian delegation at the World Economic Forum in Davos was distinctly gloomy, with oil prices near 12-year lows below $30 per barrel and Western sanctions depressing their economy and financial markets. 
Since then, however, Russian stock and bond markets have risen about 50 percent, boosted by rebounding oil and - more recently - expectations the new U.S. presidency of Donald Trump will ease the sanctions imposed over Moscow's actions in Ukraine.
Russian officials and company executives at the forum attended by the world's political and business elites in the Swiss Alps this week were far more bullish, with many predicting the markets rally would continue this year. 
""This is one of the most positive forums in the last few years. Today our Western counterparties - bankers and investors - can talk freely again about investments in Russia,"" Andrei Guryev, chief executive of fertilizer giant PhosAgro, told Reuters on the sidelines of the forum. 
Russia's economy is still in the early stages of a recovery. There are however promising signs after more than two years of pain. Oil - a crucial source of revenue - has bounced back above $50 and Russian manufacturing expanded at its fastest pace since 2011 in December, a sign the economy is starting to grow again.
And then there's the Trump factor.
The U.S. real estate mogul won the U.S. election on Nov. 8 after a campaign that included pledges to improve ties with Russia, and this week - days before his inauguration as president - he proposed offering to end sanctions imposed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea in return for a nuclear arms reduction deal with Moscow.
""The easing of sanctions will reopen cheap foreign capital markets again for Russian companies,"" Guryev said. ""It will stimulate local business, allow the central bank to cut interest rates and as a result spur Russia's GDP growth."" 
He said the lifting of sanctions could remove the 20-40 percent share price discounts on listed Russian companies that he said the punitive measures had led to. 
The head of Russia's state Direct Investment Fund, Kirill Dmitriev, said corporate gains could be even steeper.
""We know that after past crises the Russian stock market was bouncing back by several times. There is potential for growth by another 50 percent and more and it is not necessarily linked to the easing of sanctions but also to economic growth,"" he said.
MEETING TRUMP ADVISER
A year ago in Davos, Dmitriev - an influential executive with close ties to the government and the Kremlin - met Saudi representatives and was the first Russian official to predict that Moscow and OPEC could reach a deal to cut oil production. 
Moscow agreed to cut output in tandem with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last month.
This year, Dmitriev met Anthony Scaramucci - a former U.S. hedge fund manager who will become a White House adviser and public liaison to government agencies and businesses - on the sidelines of the forum.
Dmitriev's $10 billion sovereign wealth fund was put on one of the U.S. sanctions lists, one which however does not strictly prohibit U.S. persons from dealing with it.
""I cannot discuss sanctions... As far as the meeting is concerned, we have a feeling the new administration is ready to support business and economic contacts between Russian and U.S. companies. This is an important step toward mutual understanding,"" said Dmitriev.
Russia figures among the top picks for 2017 trades for  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), UBS, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Rabobank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) among others, with Goldman predicting it ""to move from a recovery to a growth phase"".
Besides stock markets, Russia is also favored by bond investors because falling inflation may bring 150-200 basis points in official interest rate cuts next year. 
That would keep inflation-adjusted bond yields at among the highest in the world.
""I see that foreign investors are ready again to buy the Russian risk. This year, we will see new portfolio investors ... we will see more share flotations, the Eurobond market will also develop very actively,"" said Igor Bulantsev, the head of the investment banking arm at state lender Sberbank.
""Investment will also be flowing into the rouble bond market and the rouble carry trade will also likely continue,"" he said referring to a steep rouble appreciation last year which attracted a lot of fund inflows.
Russian corporate results have also been encouraging. Earnings-per-share, a measure of profitability, recently surpassed their 10-year average for the first time since 2012.  In recent months analysts have revised up their estimates of Russian companies' earnings at a faster pace than the rise in oil prices, Thomson Reuters Datastream shows.  However, Russia still scores poorly on all measures of corruption and transparency; its fortunes remain dependent on oil exports and a recent report by the anti-monopoly service found state ownership of the economy had doubled since 2005 to 70 percent. ""We would like to see more reform and decline in political risk but we are not convinced (this will happen),"" Devan Kaloo, global head of equities at Aberdeen Asset Management, told Reuters. 
""So we are mildly positive in Russia.""

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2017 12:52PM ET</span>",OPEC sees smaller oil glut in 2017 but flags U.S. shale recovery,"By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC signaled a falling oil supply surplus in 2017 on Wednesday as the exporter group's output slips from a record high ahead of a deal to cut supply and outside producers show positive initial signs of complying with the accord.
However, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, in a monthly report, also pointed to the possibly of a rebound in U.S. output, as higher oil prices following supply cuts by other producers support increased shale drilling.
OPEC and several independent producers agreed last year to cut supply, the first such deal in 15 years, as of Jan. 1, 2017 to remove a glut. The effort has helped oil prices (LCOc1) to rise to $55 a barrel, from a 12-year low near $27 a year ago.
""A continued normalization of monetary policies, indicating improving economic conditions, together with the recent historic cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, should help to bring needed stability to the oil market,"" OPEC said.
""Initial reports show positive signs of compliance with pledged production adjustments,"" OPEC added of non-members' contribution.
OPEC in November finalised a plan to cut its output by about 1.20 million barrels per day (bpd) to 32.50 million bpd. Russia and other non-member countries pledged curbs of around 560,000 bpd in December.
The OPEC figures published on Wednesday showed the group pumped 33.085 million bpd last month, according to figures OPEC collects from secondary sources, down 221,000 bpd from November.
The biggest reduction came from Saudi Arabia, which told OPEC it cut output to 10.47 million bpd. Losses in Nigeria, which is exempt from cutting output because its production has been curbed by conflict, provided the second largest.
OPEC also cut its forecast of non-OPEC supply growth in 2017 to 120,000 bpd after the cut pledges by the independent producers, although this was offset by a 230,000 bpd upward revision to U.S. supply.
""The main component of U.S. oil output – tight oil – is forecast to grow,"" OPEC said, using another term for shale.
A renewed jump in U.S. supply, effectively subsidized by the voluntary cuts elsewhere, could weigh on OPEC efforts to boost oil prices and provide an echo of developments which lead up to the price crash starting in mid-2014.
But OPEC leaders such as Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih say they do not expect a shale surge any time soon.
With demand for OPEC crude in 2017 expected to average 32.10 million bpd, the report indicates there will be an average surplus of 985,000 bpd if OPEC keeps output steady. Last month's report pointed to a 1.24 million bpd surplus.
The OPEC report, in relocating Indonesian production of about 740,000 bpd into non-OPEC, also made OPEC output appear closer to the production target which took effect on Jan 1.
Total OPEC output in December was just 585,000 bpd above the target, compared to 1.37 million bpd in last month's report, thanks in large part to Indonesia's departure from the group. 
OPEC said, when the target was adopted, that it included Indonesia and has not specified if the figure will be reduced to reflect the Asian country's departure.

1112,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2017 10:40AM ET</span>",World temperatures hit new high in 2016 for third year in a row,"By Alister Doyle
OSLO (Reuters) - World temperatures hit a record high for the third year in a row in 2016, creeping closer to a ceiling set for global warming with extremes including unprecedented heat in India and ice melt in the Arctic, U.S. government agencies said on Wednesday.
The data, supported by findings from other organizations, was issued two days before the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who questions whether climate change has a human cause.
Average surface temperatures over land and the oceans in 2016 were 0.94 degrees Celsius (1.69 degrees Fahrenheit) above the 20th-century average of 13.9C (57.0F), according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
U.S. space agency NASA reported almost identical data, and the UK Met Office and University of East Anglia, which also track global temperatures for the United Nations, said 2016 was the hottest year on record.
Temperatures, lifted both by man-made greenhouse gases and a natural El Nino event that released heat from the Pacific Ocean last year, beat the previous record in 2015, when 200 nations agreed a plan to limit global warming. That peak had in turn eclipsed 2014.
""We don't expect record years every year, but the ongoing long-term warming trend is clear,"" said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
Global temperature records date back to the 1880s. Temperatures are unlikely to set a new peak in 2017 after the El Nino faded, even as greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels keep building up in the atmosphere, led by China and the United States.
Piers Forster, climate expert at the University of Leeds, said this year was likely to be cooler. ""However, unless we have a major volcanic eruption, I expect the record to be broken again within a few years,"" he said. Ash from big eruptions can dim sunlight.
NATURAL DISASTERS
Among last year's extreme weather events, wildfires in Alberta were the costliest natural disaster in Canada's history while Phalodi in west India recorded a temperature of 51C (123.8°F) on May 19, a national record. 
North America also had its warmest year on record, the Great Barrier Reef off Australia suffered severe damage from rising temperatures, and sea ice in both the Arctic Ocean and around Antarctica is at record lows for mid-January.
At a conference in Paris in late 2015, governments agreed a plan to phase out fossil fuels this century and shift to renewable energies such as wind and solar power.
They agreed to limit warming to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) above pre-industrial times, while pursuing efforts for 1.5C (2.7F). By that yardstick, the rise stood at about 1.1C (2.0F) in 2016.
""Long-term indicators of human-caused climate change reached new heights in 2016,” Petteri Taalaas, head of the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organisation said, referring to rising levels of carbon dioxide and methane.
Trump, who has described climate change as a hoax, has threatened to cancel the Paris Agreement and shift to exploiting cheap domestic coal, oil and gas. At a meeting in Marrakesh days after Trump's victory, however, almost 200 nations said it was an ""urgent duty"" to combat climate change.

""The hottest year on record is such a clear warning siren that even President-elect Trump cannot ignore,"" said Mark Maslin, Professor of Climatology at University College London.

Crude oil for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell nearly 2.4% to a session low of $51.21 a barrel, a level not seen since January 11.
It was last at $51.57 by 10:15AM ET (15:15GMT), down 93 cents, or around 1.8%, after rising 11 cents, or 0.2%, a day earlier.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London slumped $1.01, or about 1.8%, to $54.46 a barrel, after falling 39 cents, or 0.7%, in the prior session.
Oil sold off after IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said that higher oil prices will trigger a “significant” increase in U.S. shale output as OPEC and other producers rein in supply.
Market players may be viewing the comments as a “pre-release” of the IEA’s monthly oil market report due Thursday.
OPEC signaled a falling oil supply surplus in 2017 on Wednesday as the producer group's output declines from a record high.
In its monthly oil market outlook released earlier, OPEC said its members pumped 33.085 million barrels per day in December, down 221,000 bpd from November.
As well as reporting lower output from its own members, OPEC cut its forecast of supply in 2017 from non-member countries following pledges by Russia and other non-members to join OPEC in limiting output.
OPEC now expects non-OPEC supply to rise by 120,000 bpd this year, down from growth of 300,000 bpd last month, despite an upwardly revised forecast of U.S. supply.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day to 32.5 million for the next six months.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
However, some traders remain skeptical that the planned cuts will be as substantial as the market currently expects.
While some major oil producers, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have so far showed signs that they are sticking to their pledge to cut back output, others, such as Libya and Iraq have ramped up production.
A monitoring committee charged with tracking adherence to the global deal is due to meet in Vienna for the first time on January 22.
Meanwhile, market players looked ahead to weekly data from the U.S. on stockpiles of crude and refined products.
Industry group the American Petroleum Institute is due to release its weekly report at 4:30PM ET (21:30GMT) later on Wednesday. Official data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Thursday, amid forecasts for an oil-stock drop of 960,000 barrels.
The reports come out one day later than usual due to Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for February declined 4.1 cents, or 2.6% to $1.560 a gallon, while February heating oil slumped 2.5 cents, or 1.5%, to $1.623 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for February delivery lost 6.3 cents, or 1.85%, to $3.349 per million British thermal units, as weather forecasts for the end of January turned warmer.

Weather models initially predicted colder temperatures throughout most parts of the U.S. during the period.
Natural gas markets have been volatile in recent weeks, changing course rapidly in response to shifting outlooks in short-term weather patterns.

The dollar index was up around 0.3% to 100.51 early Wednesday, not far from the previous session's six-week low of 100.23.
Global financial markets will continue to focus on Trump as he takes the Oath of Office and offers his inaugural address on Friday. Investors will welcome any detail he may give on his promises of tax reform, infrastructure spending and deregulation, as well as insight regarding policies on China and the domestic economy.
Trump has been credited with being a major catalyst behind the market's impressive rally since election day, although he has yet to outline his economic policies in detail.
Meanwhile, Yellen's speech later on Wednesday to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco could offer fresh clues about the timing of the next rate hike.
San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams on Tuesday called for a gradual rise in interest rates over the next few years to keep the economy from overheating and ultimately falling into recession.
Separately, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said on Tuesday the U.S. central bank might hike rates more aggressively if deficit spending under the Trump administration produced a quick economic boost.
The precious metal has been well-supported in recent weeks amid uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve’s pace of interest rate hikes this year.
The Fed had indicated in December that at least three rate increases were in the offing for 2017, according to a forecast of interest rates from members of the central bank, known as the dot-plot.
However, traders remained unconvinced. Instead, markets are pricing in just two rate hikes during the course of this year, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
A delay in raising interest rates would be seen as positive for gold, a non-interest-bearing asset, and negative for the dollar.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for March delivery was up 2.0 cents, or about 0.1%, at $17.16 a troy ounce during morning hours in London.

Silver settled at $17.20, up 2.62%.
Trump had said in an interview with a leading financial daily that the greenback was too strong, as compared to the Chinese currency, the yuan, and that a lower dollar would be quite helpful to manufacturers in the U.S. who sought to export goods made in the U.S. overseas.
Quite often, gold is seen as an alternative when faith in the dollar and other investments wanes. That seems to be the case today.
The remarks on the dollar are also being interpreted in light of Trump's comments on possible protectionist moves, like a tax on imports, to the U.S. from Mexico or China.

The oil firms' and car makers' chiefs said the plan was part of global efforts to keep global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, an ambitious goal agreed by 195 countries in Paris in 2015. 
""In this context, we are convinced that the unique contribution that hydrogen solutions offer needs to be strongly reaffirmed now,"" the participants, including the chiefs of oil firms  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), Patrick Pouyanne and Ben van Beurden, said in a statement.
The declaration was also signed by the CEOs of car makers BMW, Daimler, Honda, Hyundai, Kawasaki and Toyota as well as miner  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) and energy and engineering firms Engie, Linde and  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP). 
Hydrogen does not release any CO2 at the point of use and its technologies and products have progressed significantly, the firms said in a statement. 
They aim to accelerate investment in developing and commercializing the hydrogen sector, currently amounting to just 1.4 billion euros a year - compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars invested annually by the oil sector.
""We need governments to back hydrogen with actions of their own - for example through large scale infrastructure investment schemes,"" the statement quoted the head of Air Liquide Benoit Potier as saying. 
""We are not trying to bring hydrogen only to cars or trains. We are trying to bring a systemic approach. Hydrogen can generate power, produce heat and it is close to the chemical industry. And it is the most abundant element in the universe,"" Potier told a news conference.
The head of oil major Shell Ben van Beurden said that despite starting a hydrogen business 20 years ago, his firm today had only had five hydrogen refueling stations in Germany and three in California.
""You need a coordinated approach to make it work. Hopefully, we can have hundreds (of stations),"" he said.

The head of Total Pouyanne said hydrogen was also the best way to store energy and Total was studying those opportunities.

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2017 01:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Canadian energy firms at bigger risk from cyber, bomb attacks - spy agency","By Ethan Lou
CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada's main spy agency last year warned energy companies about an increasing risk of cyber espionage and attacks on pipelines, oil storage and shipment facilities and power transmission towers using homemade explosives, according to a classified document obtained by Reuters.
The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) warning last May highlights an additional risk for the energy sector, where opposition to pipelines has ramped up in Canada, home to the world's third-largest oil reserves, and the United States.
In the document, which features speaking notes prepared for a CSIS briefing with energy and utilities sector stakeholders, an unidentified official specifies a threat from foreign state-owned firms looking for confidential information about investments or takeovers.
""You should expect your networks to be hit if you are involved in any significant financial interactions with certain foreign states,"" the official said in the document, obtained by Reuters under access-to-information laws.
The hackers would want information on anything from valuations to tax records and client names, the official said in the document. The official said the agency had collected evidence of such espionage in the past. 
The document, parts of which were obscured for security reasons, did not show the foreign states whose companies may be linked to industrial espionage or their purported Canadian victims.
In 2012, CSIS told the government that takeovers by Chinese companies may threaten national security. At the time, China's state-owned CNOOC Ltd had bid for Canadian producer Nexen Inc. 
The document also warned the sector was ""vulnerable to explosives"" and identified potential targets. In the document, the CSIS official referred to ""terrorist attacks"" since 2014 in Canada and abroad, saying even large-scale attacks are ""technically simple.""
Last year, five oil pipelines carrying Canadian crude in the United States were halted in coordinated attacks by environmental protesters, showing the ease with which people with no technical expertise can disrupt the industry. 
Energy companies already use surveillance cameras, helicopters, remote sensors and drones to monitor some 119,000 km (74,000 miles) of pipelines across Canada, carrying 3.4 million barrels of crude a day, and have an agreement to collaborate during an emergency. 
But security experts and energy industry officials have said it is impossible to lower the threat to zero. 
Last week, vandals used on-site equipment to damage a pipeline under construction in Canada's oil heartland of Alberta.
Asked about the document, CSIS spokeswoman Tahera Mufti did not address details about the industry meeting or the briefing official's description of physical threats to Canada's energy infrastructure. 
She said only that the agency's overall threat assessment for the energy sector has remained constant, and that the sector is a target globally for cyber attacks. Detecting such threats is a ""key national security priority,"" she said.
Major energy infrastructure companies in Canada, including TransCanada Corp and Enbridge Inc, declined to say whether they sent representatives to the meeting.
The Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, which includes major pipeline companies but did not attend the meeting, said its members have a ""robust cyber security program"" to prevent espionage.

The Natural Resources Canada federal agency said only that it works with the industry and regional governments to address physical security and referred questions on cyber-intrusion to Public Safety Canada, which did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Natural gas for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rallied nearly 2.7% to a session high of $3.513 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since January 3.
It was last at $3.396 by 10:25AM ET (15:25GMT), down 2.3 cents, or around 0.7%. Markets in the U.S. were closed Monday for a public holiday.
Natural-gas markets have been volatile in recent weeks, changing course rapidly in response to shifting outlooks in short-term weather patterns.
Prices typically rise during the winter as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand. About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 220 and 230 billion cubic feet in the week ended January 13.
That compares with a withdrawal of 151 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 178 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 170 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.160 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.3% lower than levels at this time a year ago and around 0.1% below the five-year average for this time of year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday, supported by a falling U.S. dollar and Saudi Arabia saying it would adhere to OPEC's commitment to cut output.
The dollar fell by 0.6 percent against a basket of currencies on Tuesday after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said that the strong greenback was hurting U.S. competitiveness.
Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were up 76 cents at $56.52 a barrel by 1451 GMT, having risen earlier by more than $1 to a session high of $56.95 a barrel.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up by 82 cents at $53.19 a barrel. The contract also rose more than $1 to a session high of $53.52 a barrel.
""The rise is more or less related to the weaker dollar, which has lifted most commodities today,"" said Carsten Fritsch, commodity analyst at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
Gains were capped by rising U.S. production and scepticism that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as a whole would comply with its commitment to reduce supplies.
Traders said that oil drew some support from top crude exporter Saudi Arabia, which said it would adhere strictly to its commitment to cut output under the agreement between OPEC and other producers, such as Russia.
Under the agreement, OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC producers have pledged to cut oil output by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd), initially for six months, to bring supplies back in line with consumption.
""The market genuinely seems quite happy here (with oil around $55) ... but people are watching with caution as the slightest hint of this OPEC/non-OPEC agreement going wrong is going to drive the market down,"" said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services (FIS) in Dubai.
Despite this, crude futures have fallen by 5 percent since their early January peaks on doubts over producers' willingness to comply fully with the cuts.
Traders are also watching rising U.S. output, which could offset supply cuts elsewhere. 
Further weighing on crude, at least in the short term, have been refinery outages in the Middle East and Asia over the past week, traders said.
Analysts also said that steps to prop up oil prices through a cut in supplies could be self-defeating.

""For each $10 per barrel increase in oil prices, oil demand will decline by 10 basis points. While consensus expects demand-growth of 1.3 million bpd in 2017 (vs 1.4 million bpd in 2016), we see risks to the downside as demand growth in China and India starts to moderate,"" AB Bernstein said.

Meanwhile, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo forecast on Monday that stability would return to oil markets this year while price hawk Venezuela said it hoped its crude basket would rise to $70 in coming months.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day for the next six months.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
However, some traders remain skeptical that the planned cuts will be as substantial as the market currently expects.
While some major oil producers, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have so far showed signs that they are sticking to their pledge to cut back output, others, such as Libya have ramped up production.
OPEC plans to release its monthly oil report on Wednesday, while the International Energy Agency’s monthly report is due the day after, as traders look for further evidence that oil producers are adhering to planned output cuts.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2017 06:28AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Global ship insurers to resume near full coverage for Iran oil - officials,"By Osamu Tsukimori and Keith Wallis
TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Global shipping insurers have devised a way to ensure nearly full coverage for Iranian oil exports from next month after striking a deal to provide cover without involving U.S.-domiciled reinsurers, officials in Tokyo and London said.
Restrictions on U.S. firms handling Iranian goods had greatly limited the number of reinsurers of cargoes, but the new arrangements - which essentially allow re-insurance of ships without the involvement of U.S. firms - should boost the number of eligible shipments. 
That will provide a boon to Iran, which is trying to raise oil exports after most sanctions were lifted last year, though banking restrictions that remain in place that could cap any major rise in exports. 
""There will be no U.S.-domiciled reinsurer participation on the 2017 IG reinsurance program,"" Andrew Bardot, secretary and executive officer at the International Group (IG) of P&I Clubs in London told Reuters on Tuesday. 
The new arrangements take effect on Feb. 20, he and other officials said.
""This will substantially address the potential shortfall in reinsurance recoveries in the event of Iranian-related claims,"" Bardot said in an email.
The sanctions were lifted after a landmark deal in 2015 with world powers that put constraints on Iran's nuclear activities. 
But some prior U.S. sanctions remain in place, which had meant U.S. reinsurers could not participate in covering Iranian cargoes. 
To plug the shortfall by U.S. insurers, the group of the world's top 13 ship insurers created so-called ""fall-back"" insurance last year, under which tankers carrying Iranian oil were insured up to around $830 million per ship.
That was below normal coverage for a tanker and risk-averse shippers refrained from lifting cargoes. However, it still allowed Iran to more than double crude exports from as low as about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) at the height of the sanctions. Iran's exports were as high as 3 million bpd before the sanctions. 
From next month, normal coverage will apply up to $3.08 billion and compensation beyond that up to $7.8 billion for accidents and oil spills would be collected from shipping companies insured by P&I group members. 
OBSTACLES REMAIN
Other obstacles to lifting Iranian oil remain though, including the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has described the nuclear deal as a ""disaster"" and threatened to scrap it, which could mean new oil export sanctions. 
Additionally, owners may still not call on Iran because they could be banned from Saudi Arabian ports on subsequent voyages, a European supertanker broker said. 
Saudi Arabia has banned tankers if they have previously carried Iran crude due to tensions between the countries over the conflict in Yemen, the shipbroker said.
There is a premium of between $4,000 to $12,000 per day for foreign-owned ships hired to transport Iranian crude compared with rates to transport crude from other Middle East countries, a Singapore-based supertanker broker said. That could also limit Iranian liftings. 
Banking restrictions under the remaining U.S. sanctions are also likely to stay in place for some time and constrain Iran's trading activities, said Jonathan Hare, general counsel with Norwegian P&I club Skuld.
""I think the main obstacle for everyone remains the banking system,"" he said.
The government of Japan, one of the biggest buyers of Iranian crude, is working to extend a sovereign insurance scheme it started in 2012 to continue Iranian oil imports in the year starting in April, to cover any shortfalls from the P&I insurance, a senior government official told Reuters.

Iran has complied with a deadline under the 2015 accords to remove nuclear equipment called centrifuges from one of its atomic sites, the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Monday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than 60 percent of Americans would like to see the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's powers preserved or strengthened under incoming President Donald Trump, and the drilling of oil on public lands to hold steady or drop, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Tuesday.
The results could foretell stronger-than-expected public opposition to Trump's plans to boost energy development by slashing environmental regulations, an agenda shared by some of his top Cabinet picks slated for Senate confirmation hearings later this week. Trump takes office on Friday.
Some 39 percent of Americans would like to see the EPA, the nation's top environmental regulator, ""strengthened or expanded,"" while another 22 percent hope for it to ""remain the same,"" according to the poll. Just 19 percent said they would like to see the agency ""weakened or eliminated"" and the rest said they ""don't know."" 
Among Republicans, 47 percent wish for the EPA either to ""remain the same"" or be ""strengthened or expanded,"" while 35 percent want it ""weakened or eliminated"".
The online poll of 9,935 people was conducted Dec. 16 to Jan. 12 and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 1.1 percentage points.
""Trump is a businessman, and that's all he thinks about ... what will make money,"" said Terry Cox, a 61-year-old resident of Tennessee who voted for the New York real estate mogul in November's election. ""But I'm hopeful there's a limit to what he can do when it comes to weakening protections for wildlife and the environment.""
A Trump transition team official declined to comment.
Trump campaigned on a promise to drastically reduce environmental regulations in order to create jobs and pave the way for more oil, gas, and coal development. He has said he would refocus the EPA on its core mission to protect air and water quality.
He also accused the agency of using ""totalitarian tactics"" to enforce its regulations under President Barack Obama, who had made the EPA central to his broader effort to combat global climate change by cutting carbon emissions.
According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, just over 60 percent of Americans think it would be wrong to weaken wildlife protections and air and water regulations to bolster the energy industry, while they were nearly evenly split on whether carbon emissions should be softened to help the industry.
The poll also showed that 39 percent of Americans want to see a decrease in coal mining and oil drilling on U.S. federal lands in the coming years, while 23 percent hope for it to stay the same. Just 22 percent said they wanted to see an increase, and the rest said they do not know. 
The U.S. government holds title to about 500 million acres of land across the country, including national parks and forests, wildlife refuges and tribal territories, overlaying billions of barrels of oil and vast quantities of natural gas, coal, and uranium. Trump has promised to boost industry access to these reserves. 
Trump nominated Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a climate change skeptic who has repeatedly sued the EPA over its regulations, to head the agency. Pruitt is scheduled for Senate hearings on Wednesday, where lawmakers are expected to ask him about his ties to the energy industry.
Trump also nominated U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, an avid outdoorsman and former Navy SEAL commander who advocates for more coal mining on federal lands, to run the Department of the Interior that oversees public lands. Zinke will face Senate questions on Tuesday.

And Trump chose former Texas Governor Rick Perry to head the Department of Energy, a move that would put him in charge of the agency he proposed eliminating during his failed bid for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. Perry will be questioned on Thursday.

Gold for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange touched a session peak of $1,212.50 a troy ounce, a level not seen since November 23.
It was last at $1,210.85 by 3:00AM ET (08:00GMT), up almost $15.00, or 1.2%. Markets in the U.S. were closed Monday for a public holiday.
Britain will not seek a Brexit deal that leaves it ""half in, half out"" of the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May will say on Tuesday, according to her office, in a speech setting out her 12 priorities for upcoming divorce talks with the bloc.
Those priorities will include leaving the European Union's single market and regaining full control of Britain's borders, several newspapers reported, reinforcing investor fears of a 'Hard Brexit'.
May has previously stated she will trigger Article 50, which starts the formal withdrawal process from the European Union, by the end of March, but so far has given few details about what deal she will be seeking.
She is due to set out more detail on her plans on Tuesday in a speech at around 11:45GMT (6:45AM ET) to an audience including foreign diplomats and Britain's own Brexit negotiating team.
Meanwhile, global financial markets will continue to focus on U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump as he takes the Oath of Office and offers his inaugural address on Friday.
Investors will welcome any detail he may give on his promises of tax reform, infrastructure spending and deregulation, as well as insight regarding policies on China and the domestic economy.
President-elect Trump has been credited with being a major catalyst behind the market's impressive rally since election day, although he has yet to outline his economic policies in detail.
Markets were disappointed last week after Trump failed to offer details on his promises to boost fiscal spending and cut taxes at a highly-anticipated news conference.
The precious metal has been well-supported in recent days, climbing for seven sessions in a row, amid uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve’s pace of interest rate hikes this year.
The Fed had indicated in December that at least three rate increases were in the offing for 2017, according to a forecast of interest rates from members of the central bank, known as the dot-plot.
However, traders remained unconvinced. Instead, markets are pricing in just two rate hikes during the course of this year, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
A delay in raising interest rates would be seen as positive for gold, a non-interest-bearing asset, and negative for the dollar.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for March delivery was up 21.2 cents, or nearly 1.3%, at $16.98 a troy ounce during morning hours in London.

The site of the $3.8 billion project in southern North Dakota had been the scene of demonstrations by Native Americans and environmentalists, who say the pipeline would damage sacred lands and any leaks could pollute the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.
But in early December the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied a key easement needed to allow the pipeline to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River.
The protesters, who were taken into custody on Monday for criminal trespassing onto private property, inciting a riot and resisting arrest, were among about 200 people who demonstrated near the fenced-off Dakota Access Pipeline horizontal drill pad, the Morton County Sheriff Department said in a statement. 
The three unidentified people were accused of cutting security wire, removing fencing material and dismantled lights that are used to illuminate a bridge near the confluence of the Cannonball River and the Missouri River, the sheriff said. 
There were reports on social media that police fired tear gas on protesters on Monday. Officials were not immediately available for comment. 
North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, who took office last month in the height of tensions surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline, said last week he believed the line would eventually be built and asked opponents to clean their protest camp before spring floodwaters create a potential ecological disaster.

Law enforcement has made a total of 589 arrests during protest activity since August 10, according to the sheriff.

The head of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was back in Caracas for a second meeting in two months with President Nicolas Maduro whom he lavishly praised for an ""inspirational"" role in the producers' pact to cut output.
""We remain optimistic Mr. President that with the full and timely implementation of this historic decision between us and non-OPEC, in 2017 the situation of our economies will improve tremendously,"" Barkindo said at a news conference with Maduro.
""And stability to the oil market that has eluded us for nearly three years will be restored on a sustainable basis in the interest of producers, consumers and the global economy.""
Under the accord reached in late 2016, OPEC, Russia and other non-members of the producer group will curtail oil output by nearly 1.8 million bpd, initially for six months.
Maduro, who sent officials round the world over the last two years to lobby for output cuts, said he hoped the pact would help raise Venezuela's crude basket to $60 in the first half and $70 later in 2017.
One of the worst-affected nations by the oil price plunge since mid-2014, Venezuela's oil traded at $44.82 last week, versus a 2016 average of $35.15. 

Barkindo added that Venezuela, and its new Oil Minister Nelson Martinez, would play a central role in a new OPEC, non-OPEC ministerial committee charted with monitoring production.

1139,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 16, 2017 06:48PM ET</span>",Venezuela proposes new OPEC deal,"Investing.com - President Nicolas Maduro said yesterday that recession-ravaged Venezuela is sending a proposal to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers to stabilize crude oil prices.
“Venezuela, as of next week, will circulate a letter with a new proposal, a new formula for the stability of real and just prices so that it can be studied and debated by all the governments that have signed this deal,” the president said in a speech, without providing additional details.
Venezuela was a vehement supporter of OPEC’s supply-cut deal, in which OPEC and other non-cartel producers agreed to reduce oil production by a total of almost 1.8 million bpd, of which 1.2 million would come from OPEC and 558,000 from non-OPEC producers, including Russia.
Last week, before the January 1 start date for the implementation of cuts, Venezuela said it would begin reducing output by nearly 100,000 bpd.
Shale oil production is up in the U.S., in the wake of the OPEC deal, and President-elect Trump is planning to open up federal lands to drilling and offshore areas to sea-based exploration and drilling after he takes office later this week.
Energy Secretary Rick Perry is going to lead that effort, as he is a former governor of Texas, and has experience dealing with oil, natural gas and petroleum issues."
1140,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2017 03:27PM ET</span>",Oil up on Saudi commitment to cut; U.S. output seen rising,"By Ethan Lou
CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Oil prices settled up on Monday, as Saudi Arabia's commitments to reducing production offset a report forecasting U.S. output would again rise this year.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to 32.5 million bpd from Jan. 1 in an attempt to clear a global oversupply that has depressed prices for more than two years.
Russia and other key exporters outside OPEC have said they will also cut output.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday the country will adhere strictly to its output reduction commitment, expressing confidence that OPEC's plan to prop up prices would work.
Benchmark Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was up 41 cents a barrel, or 0.7 percent, at $55.86 and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) rose 27 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $52.64 a barrel.
But expectations of rising oil output in the United States as well as the U.S. federal holiday on Monday capped price gains.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said it expects year-on-year U.S. oil production to rise by 235,000 bpd in 2017, taking into account wells that have been drilled and are likely to start producing in the first half of the year.
U.S. oil output is now at 8.95 million bpd, up from less than 8.5 million bpd in June last year and generally at levels in 2014, when overproduction sent the market into a tailspin.
Falih's words were also not entirely positive. While committing to the cuts, he had also said producers are unlikely to extend their agreement to cut oil output beyond six months, especially if global inventories fall to the five-year average.
""We don't think it's necessary given the level of compliance,"" Falih said at an industry event in Abu Dhabi. ""My expectations (are) ... that the rebalancing that started slowly in 2016 will have its full impact by the first half."" 
Investors have doubted that OPEC and its allies can trim output enough to push up prices.
Russian oil and gas condensate production averaged 11.1 million bpd for Jan. 1-15, two energy industry sources said on Monday, down only 100,000 bpd from December. Russia has committed to a 300,000-bpd cut during the first half of 2017.
""Cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC countries have just started and it will take some time for them to filter through,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets in Oslo.

""We do not really expect the oil price to strengthen much more in the first quarter of 2017.""

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will adhere strictly to its commitment to cut output under the global agreement among oil producers, its energy minister said on Monday, expressing confidence that OPEC's plan to prop up prices would work. 
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, speaking at an industry event in Abu Dhabi, also said he was encouraged by signs of commitments by other participants in the deal since it took effect on Jan. 1.
""Many countries are actually going the extra mile and cutting beyond what they've committed... I am confident about the impact... and I am very encouraged about those first two weeks,"" Falih said.
The comments are the latest in a series of assurances from officials that participants will follow through on the agreement intended to help get rid of a glut. Compliance with the deal will be a key influence in early 2017 on oil prices (LCOc1), which at $56 a barrel are about half their level of mid-2014.
Under the accord, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia and other non-members will curtail oil output by nearly 1.8 million bpd, initially for six months.
Last week, Falih said Saudi output had fallen below 10 million bpd, meaning Saudi Arabia had cut production by more than the 486,000 bpd which it agreed to late last year under the producers' agreement.
On Monday, he said: ""We will strictly adhere to our commitment,"" adding that during the six-month agreement, Saudi output would either be at the kingdom's target under the deal or ""as is the case now, slightly below"".
Producers were unlikely to extend the deal beyond six months and would allow market forces to prevail once the supply glut is eradicated. 
""My expectations (are)...that the rebalancing that started slowly in 2016 will have its full impact by the first half,"" he said.
""Once we get close to the 5-year average of global stocks and inventories we will basically let our foot off the brakes and let the market do its thing.""
OPEC complied with up to 80 percent of its last output cut in 2009, according to International Energy Agency data. A committee of OPEC and non-OPEC ministers to monitor the issue is meeting on Sunday.

Natural-gas markets have been volatile in recent weeks, changing course rapidly in response to shifting outlooks in short-term weather patterns.

Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.160 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.3% lower than levels at this time a year ago and around 0.1% below the five-year average for this time of year.

Weekly figures on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Wednesday and Thursday, a day late because of the U.S. holiday on Monday, will be eyed on strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Meanwhile, investors will keep an eye out for monthly reports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Counties and the International Energy Agency to gauge global supply and demand levels.
Last week, oil futures finished lower on Friday, logging their first weekly decline in five weeks amid doubts over the implementation of a planned deal by global crude producers to scale back output.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
However, some traders remain skeptical that the planned cuts will be as substantial as the market currently expects.
While major oil producers, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have so far showed signs that they are sticking to their pledge to cut back output, others, such as Libya have ramped up production.
OPEC plans to release its monthly oil report on January 18 and the IEA’s monthly report is due the day after, but both would come just over two weeks after the output cuts officially began.
As a result, markets will have to wait until the January report in mid-February for further evidence that OPEC members are adhering to planned output cuts.
Meanwhile, market players shrugged off a report showing a downtick in U.S. drilling activity last week.
According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week decreased by 7 to 522. That was the first decline in the oil-rig count in 10 weeks.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A winter storm battered a large swath of the central United States on Sunday with ice and freezing rain, creating dangerous driving conditions that caused at least five traffic-related deaths and leaving thousands without power.
Ice storm warnings and winter weather advisories were in effect for parts of 10 states, stretching from New Mexico to Wisconsin from the storm that has clobbered the region since Friday, according to the National Weather Service. 
Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri were particularly hard hit. The weather service also issued a tornado watch for large parts of Texas and a tornado warning for just west of Waco.
Temperatures will start to move above freezing beginning on Monday for large parts of the region, said Chris Jakub, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Wichita, Kansas.
""When we get our significant freezing rain and icing in the Central Plains, it is usually a two- to three-day event,"" Jakub added. ""This is going to continue through Sunday night and into the morning.""
A quarter to a half inch of ice (0.6 cm to 1.2 cm) was forecast for most of Kansas, the Weather Service said. Ice downed trees and power lines, particularly in northwest Oklahoma, where thousands of people were without power. 
At least three people died in traffic accidents in Missouri due to icy conditions, the Missouri Department of Transportation said. There was one weather-related traffic fatality in Kansas, local media reported, and another in Oklahoma.
The storm led the National Football League to delay the start of a playoff game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Pittsburgh Steelers in Kansas City from noon to 7:20 p.m. on Sunday, when the worst of the bad weather was expected to have passed though the area. 
Missouri transportation authorities on Sunday morning urged motorists to stay off roads in Kansas City. For those who must travel by car, it said: ""Take your time, slow down, and make sure that everyone is buckled-up.""

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Global oil prices will witness ""much more volatility"" in 2017 even though markets may rebalance in the first half of the year if output cuts pledged by producers are implemented, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Sunday.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed on Nov. 30 to cut output by 1.2 million bpd to 32.5 million bpd for the first six months of 2017, in addition to 558,000 bpd of cuts agreed by independent producers such as Russia, Oman and Mexico.
""I would expect that we will see a rebalancing of the markets within the first half of this year,"" said Fatih Birol, executive director of IEA, the Paris-based global energy watchdog.
""But what I want to say (is) that we are entering a period of much more volatility in the market ... the name of the game is volatility,"" he told Reuters Television in Abu Dhabi. 
Prices fell on Friday and ended the week 3 percent lower on lingering doubts over the extent of OPEC cuts, with sentiment worsened by concerns over the economic health of the world's second-largest oil consumer, China, after it reported the steepest falls in overall exports since 2009. [O/R]
Birol said although the OPEC agreement could signal higher oil prices, it would also encourage more production from the United States and elsewhere. Higher prices could also weaken global demand for oil, he added.
""I expect the U.S. shale oil will go back to increasing production this year,"" Birol said.
He added that a recent trend of declining Chinese oil production due to low prices could be reversed if the market strengthened.
Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed crude production rose notably last week, particularly in 48 southern states. Overall production was 8.95 million barrels per day (bpd) last week, the most since April of last year. EIA/S
OPEC and the independent producers are cutting supplies to remove a global glut and prop up prices, which at around $56 a barrel are half their level of mid-2014, hurting the revenue of exporting nations.
Birol said his main concern now was lack of investment in new oil supplies after low prices over the past two years forced the shutdown of many projects across the world.

""This year, if there are no major investments coming we may well see in a few years from now significant supply-demand gap with serious implications on the market.""

This is removing some of the momentum from the market, which had been rallying for the last month.
American oil data is also putting downward pressure on crude, according to analysts. 
What is more, sources at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said that production cuts likely won't go as planned by the oil cartel. ""Compliance won't be 100 percent, it never is,"" the source told reporters.
The official added that a compliance rate of 60% would be good enough to accomplish the alliance's goals. Compliance of 80% would be considered ""positive,"" the OPEC official said. 
The comments come after Saudi Arabia and Kuwait this week disclosed that they have cut more than they had promised, hoping the reductions will help make up for some non-compliance elsewhere.
Saudi output is down below 10 million barrels per day and Saudi officials said it could slip further in February. 
The U.S. is not cooperating with OPEC, and that factor is hurting global prices as well.
Crude stockpiles in the U.S. rose last week by 4.1 million barrels, according to the U.S. government. 
Gasoline stocks also increased. Reports from the U.S. Energy Department's Energy Information Administration (EIA) weekly newsletter showed an increase in output by about 176,000 bpd last week, considered a staggering increase in production by analysts that may offset OPEC production cuts. "

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - OPEC's Secretary-General has confidence in the commitment of oil producers who agreed to an output cut deal last month to ease a global glut that has depressed crude prices and hurt exporting countries' revenues.
Under the accord, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia and other non-members of the producer group will curtail oil output by nearly 1.8 million bpd, initially for six months.
""I remain confident... with the level of commitment and enthusiasm that I have seen among the 24 participating countries whom I am in regular contact with that this historic and landmark decision will be implemented fully,"" Mohammed Barkindo told Reuters in an interview in Abu Dhabi. 
Top exporter Saudi Arabia and Kuwait said on Thursday they had cut production by more than they committed to. And Iraq, OPEC's second-largest producer, said it too had reduced production and exports and it was fully committed to the agreement.
A meeting to monitor compliance will be held in Vienna on Jan. 22. Barkindo said the meeting would decide on what level of compliance would be acceptable or not.
He said it was too early to tell if the agreement would be extended beyond June, but OPEC ministers would decide on that when they meet next on May 25 in Vienna, where they might be joined by non-members.
""They will review.. the level of compliance, the response of the market, the fundamentals, supply, demand, stocks,"" he said. ""Based on the evaluation they will decide what to do.""
Barkindo said OPEC did not have a specific oil price in mind and the exporting group's decision to manage supplies was mainly taken to tackle high inventories which had started to fall.
The price of benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) was around $56 a barrel on Friday, roughly half the level of mid-2014.
""We have no price objective.. our objective has been the high level of stocks that has built up in period 2014, 2015 and up to 2016,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday and were on track to end the week lower on lingering doubts over the extent of OPEC cuts, with sentiment worsened by concerns over the economic health of the world's second-largest oil consumer China after it reported the steepest falls in overall exports since 2009. 
Record Chinese crude imports of 8.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in December helped to buoy prices somewhat, traders said, but they could not hide underlying fears over the overall health of the world's second-biggest economy.
Despite China's oil thirst, overall exports - the country's economic backbone - declined by 7.7 percent last year in what was the second annual decline in a row and the worst since the depths of the global crisis in 2009.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were trading 31 cents lower at $55.70 a barrel by 10:28 a.m. EST and were on track for a weekly loss of 2.5 percent.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (CLc1) crude futures fell by 41 cents to $52.60, set for a weekly drop of 2.6 percent.
Exports of Chinese refined oil products last month rose nearly 25 percent year-on-year to a record 5.4 million tonnes, well above November's previous record of 4.9 million tonnes.
""China right now seems more interested in keeping capital in the country than focusing on growth overall,"" Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago said.
""We have to watch this situation develop because this is one threat to what is an otherwise wildly bullish scenario for oil in the coming year."" 
On the supply side, there was some market support from top crude exporter Saudi Arabia, which said that its output had fallen below 10 million bpd to levels last seen in February 2015 and that it expects to make even deeper cuts next month.
However, hard evidence of export reductions has yet to emerge, two weeks into the month in which the cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers, such as Russia, were supposed to start. Many analysts expect compliance of 50 percent to 80 percent at best.
""As the Saudis hint at even deeper reductions in February, assumptions are rife that its enthusiastic approach to output cuts is an admission that cheating is expected on the part of other producers,"" said Stephen Brennock of oil brokerage PVM. 
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its January outlook that it expects Brent and WTI to average $53 and $52 a barrel respectively in 2017.
Even if OPEC cuts its output as agreed, traders said that rising U.S. shale output and increasing supply from OPEC members Nigeria and Libya, which were exempt from the pact, might offset any reductions.

The market also awaited U.S. drilling rig count data from energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc at 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT), the indicator future U.S. production. [RIG/U]

1160,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2017 10:40AM ET</span>",EPA locks in 2025 fuel efficiency rules,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Gina McCarthy on Friday finalized a determination that the landmark fuel efficiency rules instituted by President Barack Obama should be locked in through 2025, a bid to maintain a key part of his administration's climate legacy.
Major U.S. and foreign automakers have appealed to President-elect Donald Trump, who has been critical of Obama's climate policies, to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleet-wide fuel efficiency by 2025, saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences. 
As part of a 2012 regulation, EPA had to decide by April 2018 whether to modify the 2022-2025 model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet-wide efficiency of more than 50 miles per gallon. In November, the agency moved up the timetable for proposing that automakers can meet the 2025 standards.
McCarthy said in a statement her determination, a legally binding decision to maintain the fuel efficiency rules, rests on an extensive technical record. 
McCarthy said in her determination the rules are ""feasible, practical and appropriate"" and in ""the best interests of the auto industry."" 
She told automakers the EPA could consider adopting new rules ""to provide additional incentives for very clean technologies or flexibilities that could assist manufacturers with longer term planning."" 
In 2011, Obama announced agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon. This, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years. 
In July, EPA said because Americans were buying fewer cars and more SUVs and trucks, it now estimated the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025.
Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade association representing General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) , Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and others, criticized the decision.
""Our fundamental priority remains striking the right balance to continue fuel economy gains and carbon reduction without compromising consumer affordability and vital auto-sector jobs,"" she said.
Automakers hope to work with regulators and California, Bergquist said, ""to see whether we can find a prudent compromise path forward that avoids an unnecessary and counterproductive regulatory collision.""
Environmental groups praised the decision.
Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the standards were working. 
""Automakers have the technologies to continue their progress in a cost-effective way. It will keep us on track to reduce oil use by 2.4 million barrels a day, cut global warming emissions and keep American-made vehicles competitive in a rapidly-changing global market,"" he said.
Legal experts have said it will be more difficult for the Trump administration and Congress to undo the determination than to unwind other regulatory actions issued by the Obama administration during its final months in office.
The 2025 determination is not a new regulation, so the EPA, under Trump, would likely have to go through an extensive process before withdrawing the determination, and could face lawsuits from environmental groups if they took that step.

Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement ""a new administration is no reason to shift progress to reverse.""

1161,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2017 08:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Venezuela's PDVSA sees 2017 oil output stuck near historic lows - document,"By Alexandra Ulmer and Brian Ellsworth
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan state energy company PDVSA projects oil production will remain near 23-year lows in 2017, an internal document shows, suggesting more hardship ahead for the crisis-wrought OPEC member country.
Cash-squeezed PDVSA, which accounts for nearly all of Venezuela's export revenues and is the socialist government's financial motor, saw production tumble by nearly 10 percent in 2016 due to an unraveling economy and low oil prices.
The company's weak finances are causing operational disruptions, and are both affected by and contributing to Venezuela's economic downturn. Three years of recession and soaring prices have pummeled Venezuelans, with many skipping meals and lootings of supermarkets commonplace. Some economists have estimated that gross domestic product contracted by 10 percent or more in 2016.
This year, PDVSA sees production at 2.501 million barrels per day (bpd), an increase of just 5,000 from the 2.496 million bpd for the first 11 months of 2016, according to a nine-year strategic plan presented in December.
That is broadly on par with output levels in 1993, as the struggle to pay providers has led some services companies to halt work and oil suppliers to delay or halt deliveries of fuel and crude.
The 261-page document seen by Reuters gives a rare window into PDVSA, a highly secretive company that seldom publishes detailed business plans. It shows PDVSA expects a shortfall in imported diluents needed for blending with its extra heavy crude output, along with aggressive refinery maintenance plans.
PDVSA did not respond to an email seeking comment on the internal report.
Crude shipments to political ally China, which has lent Venezuela more than $50 billion through a decade-long oil-for-loans program, are slated to increase 55 percent in 2017 from 2016 to reach 550,000 bpd, according to the presentation.
There was no explanation for the jump, but it could signal the end of a grace period that Caracas negotiated with Beijing, which had allowed it to cut shipments in 2016 to 355,000 bpd from 627,000 a year earlier.
Oil shipments to India, however, are expected to fall 15.5 percent to 360,000 bpd. Unlike China, India pays mostly in cash, so a reduction in exports would likely worsen Venezuela's financial asphyxiation.
LOW IMPORTS, LONG MAINTENANCES
PDVSA also projects a sizeable deficit of light crude and naphtha, both of which are crucial to turn the extra heavy oil it produces in the Orinoco Belt - one of the world's largest deposits - into lighter grades for exports.
Venezuela started regular imports of diluents in 2015 because its output of light and medium grades has tumbled, but PDVSA's cash shortage has led to delays and insufficient purchases. Long lines of tankers waiting to discharge routinely form at its ports, according to Thomson Reuters data and industry sources.
PDVSA in 2017 plans to import 125,000 bpd of light crude but will still face a deficit of 217,000 bpd, according to the document. It will also face a shortage of 28,000 bpd of naphtha, a fuel similar to gasoline used to dilute Orinoco oil in order to increase its sale value.
PDVSA would partially offset its diluent deficit in the medium term with maintenance at domestic refineries so they can produce more naphtha. It also plans to restart a refinery in the Caribbean island of Aruba now operated by U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum.
But the company's projects are often delayed, the Aruba refinery is unlikely to be up and running soon, and refineries at home are plagued with frequent outages and blackouts.
The 2017 refinery maintenance schedule described in the document shows PDVSA plans to shut down some crucial domestic units for 90 days - roughly twice the industry standard length for major maintenance.

1163,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 13, 2017 06:33AM ET</span>",Crude prices turn lower on output cut uncertainties,"Investing.com - U.S. oil turned sharply lower on Friday, amid doubts over the extent of the production cuts promised by major crude producers and as downbeat Chinese trade data weighed.
U.S. crude futures for February delivery were down 0.96% at $52.48 a barrel, after hitting a three-day high of $53.50 on Thursday.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, the March Brent contract declined 0.89% to trade at $55.50 a barrel.
Oil prices were boosted on Thursday after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the kingdom reduced output to less than 10 million barrels a day, going beyond its obligations under a deal between OPEC and other producers.
The comments came after Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouq said his country cut output by 133,000 barrels a day to 2.7 million barrels.
The optimism was short-lived however, as traders began to worry on Friday whether or not other oil producers will end up reducing their output levels as much as expected.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day.
If carried out as planned, the deal should reduce global supply by about 2%.
Traders were also cautious after data on Friday showed that China’s trade surplus narrowed to $40.82 billion in December from $44.61 billion the previous month, confounding expectations for a surplus of $46.50 billion.
The data fueled more concerns over the strength of the world’s second largest economy and therefore future oil demand.
Meanwhile, a slight rebound in the U.S. dollar on Friday also dampened demand for crude oil. Oil prices typically weaken when the U.S. currency stregnthens as the dollar-priced commodity becomes more expensive for holders of other currencies.
But the greenback’s gains were capped since U.S. President-elect Donald Trump failed to offer details on his promises to boost fiscal spending and cut taxes at a highly-anticipated news conference on Wednesday.
In addition, St. Louis Federal Reserve bank president James Bullard said on Thursday that the election of Donald Trump has not yet switched the U.S. economy to a new ""regime"" that requires a quick rise in interest rates, which can remain ""fairly low"" at least through 2017.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.33% at 101.13, not far from the previous session’s one-month low of 100.70."

(Reuters) - North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, who took office last month in the height of tensions surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline, said he believed the line would eventually be built and asked opponents to clean their protest camp before spring floodwaters create a potential ecological disaster. 
A centrist Republican with no prior political experience, Burgum was elected in a landslide on a platform of streamlining government and improving relations across the state. Burgum built a successful software business before selling it to  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) in 2001.
Burgum told Reuters that approval of the pipeline appeared to be a foregone conclusion once Donald Trump moved into the White House.
""I expect the world's going to change dramatically on that day relative to finding resolution on this issue,"" Burgum said in an interview. ""I would expect that (Energy Transfer Partners (N:ETP)) will get its easement and it will go through."" 
A coalition of Native American groups, environmentalists, Hollywood stars and veterans of the U.S. armed forces protested the $3.8 billion oil project at a North Dakota camp, which at one point held more than 5,000, though that number has shrunk in size during the winter. 
Opponents contend construction would damage sacred lands and any leaks could pollute the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.
Last month, President Barack Obama denied a key permit needed to complete the pipeline, but Trump has said he will review that decision.
Local law enforcement have voiced concerns that any reversal by the federal government could cause the area to swell again with protesters, straining resources. 
David Archambault, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, has repeatedly asked protesters to leave the area and let the pipeline fight play out in courts.
Burgum said he agrees with Archambault and asked protesters to help clean up the camp before it threatens the environment itself. More than 300 vehicles, along with dozens of temporary dwellings and other detritus, have been abandoned at the campsite, which sits in a flood plain that is likely to be overrun by spring rain and snowmelt.
State officials are concerned that floodwaters could carry that material away.

""The amount of cleanup that needs to take place is enormous,"" Burgum said. ""We've got a potential ecological disaster if this land floods and all the debris flows downstream into tribal lands.""

HAVANA (Reuters) - Dozens of U.S. farm and agri-business groups on Thursday urged President-elect Donald Trump to build upon progress made by the Obama administration in relations with Cuba, calling trade with the former Cold War foe particularly important at a time of a severe downturn in farm incomes.
The agricultural trade groups stated their views in a letter sent to Trump, who is to be inaugurated on Jan. 20.
""As a broad cross-section of rural America, we urge you not to take steps to reverse progress made in normalizing relations with Cuba, but also solicit your support for the agricultural business sector to expand trade with Cuba,"" the letter said.
""It's time to put the 17 million American jobs associated with agriculture ahead of a few hardline politicians in Washington,"" the letter concluded.
Signatories included a wide range of agricultural trade groups, from the American Farm Bureau and American Feed Industry Association to the soy bean, corn, rice, wheat, peas, beans, cattle, poultry lobbies and other associations
The letter was arranged by the Washington-based Engage Cuba Coalition and USA Rice.
Agricultural organizations in states that Trump won, such as Idaho, Alabama and Georgia, were also signatories.
Trump, a Republican, has said he will dismantle the still fragile detente begun by President Barack Obama two years ago unless Cuba gives the United States a better deal, while providing no specifics.
The letter was sent before the White House announced on Thursday that it was ending a policy that granted residency to Cubans who arrived in the United States without visas, the latest bid by Obama to make his Cuba policy irreversible.
Trump is expected to review the Cuba engagement upon taking office and has named Jason Greenblatt, a Trump Organization executive and chief legal counsel, as negotiator for sensitive international issues, including Cuba.
Under an exception to the U.S. trade embargo from the year 2000, Cuba may import agricultural products for cash. The letter calls on Trump to allow normal trade financing and credit so the sector can better compete for the Cuban market.
While the sector has sold billions of dollars in products to Cuba over the years, the letter said sales have steadily declined as the embargo makes it difficult to compete with other suppliers. Cuba imports some $2 billion in food annually.
The signatories cited a deep dip in farm income to bolster their argument that U.S. farmers needed more trade.

""Net farm income is down 46 percent from just three years ago, constituting the largest three-year drop since the start of the Great Depression,"" the letter said.

News of the new accord comes as the price of crude oil today hit $53.12 on intraday trading up, 1.67%. Brent oil also increased 1.85% to $56.11, largely on anticipation of OPEC production cuts this quarter.
The downstream deal in South America, however, has the potential to add to the world's oil production output, and demonstrates that state actors are still willing to subsidize the cost of new drilling, despite the risks.
Argentina’s government this week agreed to extend regulated natural gas prices there at high levels, a public subsidy to attract major oil and gas companies to begin exploration and production in Argentina’s prolific Vaca Muerta shale basin, according to analysts.
Prices for natural gas will be set at $7.50 per million Btu (MMBtu), much higher than market places across the globe. Natural gas prices in the U.S., epicenter of the shale gas revolution, for example, are presently trading for $3.33/MMBtu, or less than half the Argentine price.
Analysts have predicted that Argentina was the most likely place to emulate North America’s shale revolution.
Though global oil and gas companies have invested and drilled wells in locales like China, Mexico and some European countries, a new major source of shale production has not been achieved anywhere outside of North America. Until now.
Argentina holds 27 billion barrels of oil and 802 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in its shale formations, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the U.S. Department of Energy."

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has cut oil output to its lowest in almost two years, its energy minister said on Thursday, as the world's largest oil exporter leads OPEC's drive to eradicate a global glut and prop up prices.
Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said output had fallen below 10 million barrels per day - more than it had promised as part of a global output cut deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers.
Such levels were last seen in February 2015, when Riyadh began to steeply raise production to deal a blow to U.S. shale oil producers, effectively becoming the architect of a prolonged oil price crash.
Falih, speaking at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Forum in Abu Dhabi, said output was ""not significantly below"" 10 million bpd currently and the Kingdom planned to make even deeper cuts in February. 
This means Saudi Arabia has cut oil production by more than the 486,000 bpd it agreed to late last year under a global deal to curb production and stem a fall in oil prices. 
Falih also said he expected the oil market to tighten in two to three years, aided by the agreement of OPEC and non-OPEC producers late last year to curb production.
""We have been moving toward rebalancing the markets for some time,"" Falih said.
""Even better, the pace of rebalancing will be accelerated by recent production agreements within OPEC and outside. I have confidence in these agreements to bring stability to the global markets.""
Falih predicted oil demand would grow by over 1 million barrels a day this year. 
""I am confident that the combination of capping production by 25 countries and growth of demand will continue to balance and prices will respond accordingly,"" he added. 
OPEC and non-OPEC producers last month reached their first deal since 2001 to curtail oil output jointly by nearly 1.8 million bpd for an initial six month period to help stem a fall in oil prices and ease a supply glut.
Falih said it was too early to tell if the deal would be extended but said parties to the deal indicated they were willing to extend if necessary. 
""For us to project six months forward will be unwise now. All I could say is that everybody around the table in the last few weeks has indicated willingness to extend if necessary"".
SHALE OIL NOT A BIG WORRY 
Falih also said the prospect of higher cost shale oil production rising as oil prices firm was not a major cause of concern for the oil market. 
""I wouldn't be worried by shale on its own ... I am sure that could be absorbed by a market that will be approaching 100 million (bpd) in the next few years.""
While Falih said he did not have a specific oil price target, Iraqi oil minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi told reporters at the same event Iraq wanted to see prices of around $65 a barrel.
""We are not in the business of managing prices... we will leave it to the market to determine the price,"" Falih said. ""We wish for it [the market] to be less volatile but the reality today is it is a nervous market.""
Brent crude prices (LCOc1) were up $1 at $56.10 a barrel by 1458 GMT. 
Luaibi said Iraq had slashed its exports by 170,000 bpd and was cutting them further by 40,000 bpd this week. He said Iraq was committed to the success of the production-cut agreement ""even though it should have been exempted"".
OPEC expects global oil inventories to fall by the second quarter of this year in response to the agreement, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said.
Kuwait has cut its oil exports by more than 133,000 bpd mainly to customers in North America and Europe while maintaining full exports to Asia, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Essam Al-Marzouq said.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. declined by 151 billion cubic feet in the week ended January 6, exceeding market expectations for a drop of 144 billion cubic feet.
That compared with a withdrawal of 49 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 168 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 167 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.160 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 10.3% lower than levels at this time a year ago and around 0.1% below the five-year average for this time of year.
Meanwhile, updated weather forecasts for the end of January turned colder, which should boost demand for the heating fuel. Weather models initially predicted mild temperatures throughout most parts of the U.S. during the period.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has left the agriculture secretary as the last department head to be named to his Cabinet, while a meeting with the chief executives of two agribusiness giants gave a hint at a roster of farm issues the incoming president will face. 
Trump met on Wednesday with the leaders of  Monsanto  Co (N:MON) and  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn), who pitched the benefits of their proposed $66 billion merger. While critical of other large tie-ups, Trump has not publicly taken a stance on the Bayer-Monsanto deal.
The secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will not approve or reject the merger but will face the issue of industry consolidation.
 Dow Chemical  Co (N:DOW) has proposed to merge with DuPont (N:DD), and China National Chemical Corp (ChemChina) [CNNCC.UL] is seeking to acquire  Syngenta  AG (S:SYNN). 
Trade, environmental regulation and the 2018 federal farm bill are also expected to be at the top of the farm agenda once Trump takes office Jan. 20, according members of an agricultural advisory committee he formed during the campaign. 
How Trump responds on those issues - and who he picks to lead the USDA - could determine whether he is able to maintain the strong rural support he demonstrated in the Nov. 8 election.
Some committee members told Reuters they have had meetings with Trump and his advisers, and have suggested possible nominees to help define the type of person who should lead the department.
Former Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue is Trump's leading candidate to run the department, a senior Trump transition team official said last week.
Trump has also met with Elsa Murano, undersecretary of agriculture for food safety under President George W. Bush, and Chuck Conner, head of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.
He has also talked with Abel Maldonado, former lieutenant governor of California and co-owner of Runway Vineyards; Tim Huelskamp, former Republican U.S. representative from Kansas; and Sid Miller, Texas agriculture commissioner.
Trump's committee wants someone who is familiar with day-to-day farm life, can open up new markets for trade and will pressure federal regulators to ease environmental restrictions, according to a dozen committee members interviewed by Reuters.
""The sooner we have someone in place (as Agriculture Secretary), the better,"" said Mike Strain, Louisiana’s commissioner of agriculture and forestry, and part of Trump’s agricultural advisory committee.
A.G. Kawamura, a former California agriculture secretary who is on the committee, said discussions within Trump's transition team were ""free and flowing"" about who should head the agency. 
The USDA is made up of 29 agencies and offices that perform jobs ranging from agricultural research to working with foreign governments to facilitate trade.
""Generally, the country knows who the proposed cabinet is going to be before Inauguration Day. But if I've learned anything this past year, it's that you can't make assumptions about what will happen,"" he said. 
John Block, an Illinois corn, soybean and hog producer who served as USDA secretary under President Ronald Reagan, is certain Trump will make the right choice.
“We like to think we’ll see a conclusion soon, so we can look to the future,"" he said. ""But we have plenty of confidence in Trump, and we’re hanging in there.""
One key trait some are looking for: someone to stand up for farmers amid a flurry of merger deals, such as the Bayer-Monsanto tie-up. But even members of Trump's own agricultural advisory committee disagree about the deal's merits.
Bayer CEO Werner Baumann and Monsanto CEO Hugh Grant had a ""productive meeting with President-elect Trump and his team to share their views on the future of the agriculture industry and its need for innovation,"" according to a statement issued by both companies. 
Bill Northey, Iowa’s agriculture secretary and a member of Trump’s agricultural advisory team, said he believed the president-elect was paying attention to the Monsanto-Bayer merger because rural voters supported him in the election. He said it was possible that parts of the deal might be ""beneficial and pieces of it would be detrimental.""

Crude oil for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange added 25 cents, or around 0.5%, to $52.50 a barrel by 3:55AM ET (08:55GMT). U.S. crude prices jumped $1.43, or 2.8%, a day earlier.

It was last down 0.8% at 100.89, pulling further away from last week's 14-year high of 103.82.
Oil prices typically strengthen when the U.S. currency weakens as the dollar-priced commodity becomes cheaper for holders of other currencies.
Gains were held in check after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report Wednesday that crude oil inventories rose by 4.1 million barrels in the week ended January 6. Market analysts' expected a crude-stock gain of 1.2 million barrels.
Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 483.1 million barrels, which the EIA considered to be at the upper limit of the average range for this time of year.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories increased by 5.0 million barrels, compared to expectations for a gain of 1.7 million barrels. For distillate inventories including diesel, the EIA reported a gain of 8.4 million barrels.
Meanwhile, market players continued to look for signs that major oil producers are adhering to planned output cuts.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
However, some traders remain skeptical that the planned cuts will be as substantial as the market currently expects.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's cash-strapped state oil company Pemex requested authorities allow it to lower the tax regime on its top oil field Ku Maloob Zaap (KMZ), but the company said the request was now in the process of being withdrawn.
Pemex had asked the government to place KMZ under an exploration and extraction contract to lower its taxes, sources told Reuters. They also said the request was likely to be denied.
Ku Maloob Zaap, located in the shallow waters of the southern Gulf of Mexico, is the company's top-producing field accounting for 40 percent of Pemex's total crude output.
Pemex expects to produce around 1.9 million barrels of crude per day (bpd) in 2017, down from around 2.1 million bpd in 2016 and well below a peak of 3.4 million in 2004.
Under Mexico's 2013 energy reform, Pemex can change the status of its oil fields to exploration and extraction contracts, often to partner with a private company. In this case the state-run company requested the change with no partner, four sources involved in the process told Reuters. 
Pemex said in a statement on Wednesday the request on KMZ was ""in the process of being withdrawn."" 
The company said it had decided to focus on shifting the status of fields that are profitable before taxes but that are pushed into the red by tax liabilities. 
Such changes need to be approved by the energy ministry after the energy regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Commission (NHC) gives its opinion. 
Later on Wednesday, the NHC issued a negative opinion on the request, saying there were inconsistencies in information provided by Pemex. 

Currently the oil field is operated by Pemex under a pre-reform arrangement known as an assignment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday by the most in over a month, boosted as the U.S. dollar weakened following a news conference by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, and on news that Saudi Arabia had cut exports to Asia.
Oil's gains came despite government data showing a bigger-than-expected weekly build in U.S. crude and fuel inventories.
The U.S. dollar collapsed during Trump's remarks, which disappointed investors who had sent the currency to its highest level in a week ahead of this news conference. 
A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated crude more expensive for users of other currencies.
""The main reason for the oil price rise was that the dollar was down,"" said Phil Davis, managing partner at PSW Investments in Woodland Park, New Jersey.
Brent futures were up $1.76, or 3.3 percent, at $55.40 a barrel by 2:06 p.m. EST (1906 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose $1.73, or 3.4 percent, to $52.55 per barrel.
That put both contracts on track for their biggest daily percentage gains in over a month. On Tuesday, Brent and U.S. crude futures settled at their lowest levels in a month. 
""We expect some bullish OPEC rhetoric to ramp up in an attempt to neutralize the bearish vibes that have emanated from the recent production increases indicated out of Libya, Iran, Iraq and Nigeria,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a note.
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, has told some of its Asian customers that it will reduce their crude supplies slightly in February. 
Still, there is plenty of oil to fill gaps left by OPEC. North American drilling is on the rise, while European and Chinese traders are shipping a record 22 million barrels of crude from the North Sea and Azerbaijan to Asia this month. 
OPEC's No. 2 producer Iraq plans to raise crude exports from its southern port of Basra to an all-time high of 3.641 million bpd in February.
U.S. crude production was projected to rise by 110,000 barrels per day in 2017 to 9 million bpd, according to U.S. Energy Information (EIA) data.
Separately, EIA said Wednesday U.S. crude inventories increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
That topped both the 1.2 million barrel build that analysts forecast in a Reuters poll and the 1.5 million barrel build in data Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group.

1187,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2017 01:20PM ET</span>",Trump taps well of protest with calls for more drilling in national parks,"By Annie Knox and Kim Palmer
(Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump aims to open up federal lands to more energy development, tapping into a long-running and contentious debate over how best to manage America’s remaining wilderness.
The U.S. government holds title to about 500 million acres of land across the country, including national parks and forests, wildlife refuges and tribal territories stretching from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico. They overlay billions of barrels of oil and vast quantities of natural gas, coal, and uranium.
With Trump poised to take office on Jan. 20, energy companies and their lobbyists are eyeing a new gusher of federal drilling and mining leases after a period of stagnation under the administration of Barack Obama. 
Oil output on federal land made up about a fifth of the national total in 2015 - down from more than a third in 2010 - while the number of onshore drilling leases fell about 15 percent, according to federal data.
""This opportunity is unique, maybe once in a lifetime,"" said Jack Gerard, president of the Washington D.C.-based American Petroleum Institute lobby group, referring to prospects for increased access to federal leases.
The hoped-for land run by energy companies, however, could get bogged down by lawsuits and lobbying from environmental groups and some local residents.
""It would only take one serious mistake - one well to go bad - for our town’s water supply to be damaged,"" said Josh Ewing, the leader of a southern Utah conservation group.
Energy firms have their allies in the rural areas, too, who would welcome an economic jolt.
""We can’t maintain our families here because there are no jobs,"" said Bob Turri, a former officer with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in southern Utah, surrounded by millions of acres of pristine federally managed forest. ""That’s the only hope we have left, is what Trump may be able to do for us.""
Trump had campaigned on a promise to open up federal lands to increased development. He accused Obama of ""denying millions of Americans access to the energy wealth sitting under our feet"" by restricting leasing and banning new coal extraction.
In December, Trump nominated U.S. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, who backs coal mining on federal lands, to lead the Interior Department. Officials for Zinke and Trump declined to comment.
Trump has vowed to lift the coal moratorium – imposed in 2016 as part of Obama’s broader plan to combat climate change - within 100 days of taking office.
Separately, a coalition appointed by Trump's team to guide his Native American policy is researching proposals to ease energy development on tribal lands - including the controversial idea of transferring them to private ownership. [nL5N1DZ0OY]
While efforts to boost industry access to public lands would likely trigger lawsuits and protests, it could win broad support in a Congress now firmly in Republican control after November’s election.
Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, said he expected some of Trump’s planned moves to be easy, including reversing Obama's coal ban. 
""Happily, just as it was created with the stroke of a pen, it can be as easily rescinded,"" he said. ""That is our hope and expectation.""
Other efforts to undo Obama’s legacy could be harder.
""AT YOUR PERIL""
In his final weeks in office, Obama designated about 1.6 million acres in Utah and Nevada as national monuments, using the 1906 Antiquities Act that lawyers say could be complicated to reverse. The move was a parting gift to Native American groups and conservationists.[nL1N1EN182]
Obama also banned new drilling in federal waters in parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using a 1950s-era law that environmental groups say would also require a drawn out court challenge to reverse.[nL1N1EF1K7]
Republican lawmakers have promised to fight the moves.
For some, the potential for expanded drilling signals economic revival. Others see more value in the land itself than the resources beneath it.
One of the areas that Obama granted monument status last month is Bears Ears, a pair of iconic flat-top hills soaring out of ponderosa pine forests in Utah.
Jonah Yellowman, a Navajo spiritual advisor for Utah Diné Bikéyah, a group representing five tribes, surveyed the landscape recently as he piloted his SUV down a dirt road. 
""What would happen if we lose this?"" he asked. ""Where are we going to go?""
The area, he said, is central to the Navajo creation story and a symbol of his ancestors’ ability to listen to and heed spiritual guidance. It is also rich in minerals and petroleum, and Yellowman said tribes are bracing for Trump to try to reopen the land to development.
""If that happens, we’re here to stand against it,"" he said.
EOG Resources (N:EOG) - a Texas-based company recently approved to drill near Bears Ears - declined to comment.
Native American protesters and their supporters recently won a major battle against encroaching energy interests in North Dakota, blocking a federal permit for a pipeline after months of protests. [nL1N1EA1WI] Other tribes, however, have pursued energy development as a critical source of income. 
Nearly 2,000 miles east of Bears Ears, in Ohio’s Cuyahoga Valley National Park, a similar debate is playing out.
The 330,000-acre federal park is one of a handful that already allows drilling because it contains areas with privately owned mineral rights, or “split estates”. Many of the park’s visitors are unaware of the industry’s presence.
Gregory Violand, a 65-year-old actor who performs at a playhouse on park grounds – two miles from a gas well surrounded by chain-link fencing - said he supports drilling on federal lands, if done responsibly.
""The property owners are benefiting,"" he said.
Deb Yandala disagreed. As CEO of the CVNP Conservancy advocacy group, she said many people would oppose efforts to expand drilling and mining rights. “Water quality is a huge issue for Cuyahoga Valley,” she said.

Tim McCormack, a nearby resident, said the issue would be divisive. ""There is going to be a profound debate,"" he said. ""You cannot fool with the National Park system. You can at your peril.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Wednesday took a step toward increasing the production of organic foods - which has not kept pace with demand - by launching a program to certify farmland that growers are in the process of switching to organic.
Obtaining certification under the program will allow farmers to sell products raised in accordance with organic guidelines for higher prices than conventionally-grown goods, according to the Organic Trade Association, an industry group. That should help growers cover the extra costs associated with transitioning to organic farming, the group said.
Demand for organic foods has been strong as consumers are increasingly seeking products considered to be more natural and healthy. In 2015, total organic product sales hit a new high of $43.3 billion, up 11 percent from the previous year's record level, according to the Organic Trade Association.
The program will ""facilitate the investment in transitional agriculture through a consistent set of rules, and ultimately support the continued growth of organic agriculture,"" the USDA said in a notice.
Farmers must grow crops for three years without using prohibited substances, such as genetically-modified seeds and synthetic pesticides, in order to be certified as fully organic.
Those who are switching farmland to organic production must follow the same regulations as those who have already been fully certified, the trade group said. So far, however, farmers have not been able to designate their crops as being in transition in an attempt to sell the products for higher prices.
Producers of grains, such as wheat, will benefit most from the new certification program because that is the sector in which demand is most outstripping supply, said Nate Lewis, farm policy director for the trade association. Farmers are also grappling with weak prices for conventional grains because of a global supply glut.
Organic grains have seen heavy demand to feed organically-raised livestock and to make organic breads and cereals for humans.
Farmers will need to prove they have been following the guidelines for organic production for at least a year to be certified as transitioning their land, according to the trade group. Agents accredited by the USDA will verify compliance.

The new program does not provide standards for labeling food grown on farms that are in the process of transitioning to organic. The trade group said it expected to work with the food industry on guidelines for labeling.

1195,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2017 01:50AM ET</span>","As OPEC cuts, traders send European oil volumes to Asia","By Florence Tan and Mark Tay
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - European and Chinese traders are shipping a record 22 million barrels of crude from the North Sea and Azerbaijan to Asia this month, seeking to plug any supply gap left by OPEC production cuts.
Over 11 million barrels of North Sea Forties crude have either been offloaded or are on their way to Asia, adding to a record 11 million barrels of Azeri crude oil from Azerbaijan, Reuters oil trade flows data showed.
The record export volumes come on expectations of tighter Middle East crude supplies due to plans by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production in an attempt to prop up prices.
Seeing an opportunity to sell North Sea oil profitably in arbitrage deals to Asia, seven supertankers chartered by commodity traders Vitol and Mercuria, European oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), and China's refiner Unipec, have either delivered or are expected to soon offload European crude to China and South Korea this month, according to trade sources and Reuters data.
""Asia needs the oil, Europe has it. The OPEC cut has raised prices, and that now makes it profitable to send European oil to Asia,"" said one senior trader with knowledge of the deals on condition of anonymity as he is not allowed to talk to media.
December's OPEC deal, in which the group agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017, pushed up benchmark price Dubai against Brent and West Texas Intermediate, allowing Asia to pull more competitively priced supplies from the Atlantic Basin.
An ongoing Brent contango, a market structure where oil becomes more expensive in future months, also enabled traders to lock in profits for crude on long voyages.
Shipping North Sea Forties crude from its load port Hound Point in Britain to customers in North Asia, including Japan, South Korea and China, takes over six weeks.
BATTLE FOR ASIA
The deals highlight the predicament facing OPEC and other producers that have agreed to cuts, including Russia and Oman.
While cutting supplies may temporarily lift prices, this gives other producers like western oil firms an opportunity to fill the gap and sell oil to Asia, the world's biggest demand region.
""The real market battleground is East of Suez,"" said John Driscoll, director of Singapore-based energy consultancy JTD Energy Services, referring to the Suez Canal through which many tankers ship oil between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
The ships now carrying European oil to Asia have 11 million barrels of Forties crude loaded, beating a previous record of 10 million barrels in December 2015, Thomson Reuters Eikon trade flow data showed.

And more oil is to come. Two more Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) supertankers with 2 million barrels of Forties crude each are due to arrive in North Asia in February, while three VLCCs have been provisionally booked to load oil this month for arrival in Asia in March-April, the data showed.

A former general manager of a Florida-based energy company, Juan Jose Hernandez Comerma, 51, and an owner of several Texas-based energy companies, Charles Quintard Beech, 46, each pleaded guilty in federal court in Houston to conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement.
They were the latest to plead guilty as part of a broader ongoing probe into bribery at PDVSA. Their sentencing is scheduled for July 14, 2017. 
Hernandez was accused of conspiring with two other U.S.-based businessmen, Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas and Roberto Rincon, in a scheme to win contracts from PDVSA. 
Prosecutors said Hernandez, who was a general manager and later a partial owner of one of Shiera's companies, gave travel and entertainment perks to PDVSA officials including Alfonzo Gravina from 2008 to 2012.
Beech also admitted to paying bribes to Gravina and other PDVSA officials in 2011 and 2012 to position his company on panels to win bids for contracts and to help collect payments from PDVSA, the Justice Department said.
""Mr. Beech has accepted his responsibility and is ready to get this matter behind him and move on,"" his attorney, Philip Hilder, said in an email. PDVSA and attorneys for Hernandez did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Tuesday after a sharp sell-off as a fall in the dollar triggered a bout of short-covering, but analysts said the market looked vulnerable to further falls.
Rising oil prices through December encouraged investors to buy large volumes of crude oil futures contracts and many of these ""long"" positions are likely to be unwound unless the market stays strong, analysts and brokers say.
""I see this as a dead cat bounce,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen. ""Oil is unlikely to recover until the longs have been reduced.""
Tamas Varga, analyst at London broker PVM, agreed:
""We are seeing some short covering on the back of a weaker dollar,"" Varga said. ""We might see stronger prices today after yesterday's big fall, but the market should weaken in coming days. I believe we are going lower.""
Oil is priced in dollars, so a weaker dollar tends to encourage buying by consumers holding other currencies.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 10 cents a barrel at $55.04 by 1310 GMT. U.S. light crude oil (CLc1) was up 10 cents at $52.06.
Both crude contracts fell more than $2 a barrel, or around 4 percent, on Monday on doubts that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other key oil producers would cut output as promised to try to reduce a global oversupply.
OPEC members such as Saudi Arabia appear to be reducing production but it is not clear whether other big producers such as Iraq will follow suit.
Iraq said on Tuesday it would raise crude exports from its main Basra port to an all-time high in February.
""The market rallied more on faith than fact, so there is plenty of room for disappointment if producers fail to deliver cuts,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodities strategy at French bank  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), told Reuters Global Oil Forum.

Elsewhere, crude oil for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange added 21 cents, or 0.4%, to $52.17 a barrel. U.S. crude prices sank $2.03, or 3.8%, in the prior session.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
However, some traders remain skeptical that the planned cuts will be as substantial as the market currently expects.
There are also some worries in the market about rising supplies from Iran and Iraq, as well as increased output from Libya and Nigeria, which are both allowed to ramp up production as part of the OPEC deal.
Production increases in the U.S. also remained in focus. According to oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week increased by 4 to 529, the tenth straight weekly rise and a level not seen in more than a year.
Some analysts have warned that the recent rally in prices could be self-defeating, as it encourages U.S. shale producers to drill more, adding to concerns over a global supply glut.
Elsewhere on Nymex, gasoline futures for February ticked up 0.9 cents, or 0.6% to $1.577 a gallon, while February heating oil tacked on 0.5 cents, or 0.3%, to $1.642 a gallon.
Natural gas futures for February delivery rose 5.2 cents, or 1.7%, to $3.155 per million British thermal units, after falling 5% to a seven-week low on Monday, as forecasts of mild January weather replaced predictions of severe cold.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.2% at 101.72 in early trade. The index fell to as low as 101.48, pulling further away from last week's 14-year high of 103.82.
Gold has been well-supported in recent sessions after minutes from the Fed’s December meeting unsettled investors’ expectations about the pace of future interest rate hikes.
A delay in raising interest rates would be seen as positive for gold, a non-interest-bearing asset, and negative for the dollar.
Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.
The U.S. central bank had indicated in December that at least three rate increases were in the offing for 2017, according to a forecast of interest rates from members of the central bank, known as the dot-plot.
However, traders remained unconvinced. Instead, markets are pricing in just two rate hikes during the course of this year, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
Global financial markets will continue to focus on key U.S. reports in the week ahead, with Friday’s retail sales data in the spotlight.

Markets are reassessing views of the incoming Trump White House, analysts said.
The precious metal had slid 12% in price since the election, and it has been anticipated that the president-elect's policies would be inflationary.
But there is some trimming of the early expectations, as investors now are adopting a wait and see attitude to economic growth.
The President-elect is considering changes across a wide variety of government agencies and departments, and policy areas, according to Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee (RNC), and the incoming White House press secretary.
""Business-as-usual in Washington, D.C. is over,"" said Spicer. ""It is always good to get fresh eyes on the challenges facing any large operation.""
For example, there will be significant changes in the U.S. intelligence community, as the first duty of any American president, per the Constitution, is defending America.
""Changes have already begun with President-elect Trump installing key leaders who will put U.S. national security first, and completely remove politics from the equation,"" said Spicer, in an e-mail. "" The President-elect and his policy team are planning a busy first day in office, during which he will get right to work implementing his America First agenda.""
Among other, first day priorities: terminating President Obama’s ""unconstitutional, job-killing, and dangerous"" executive orders, said Spicer.
""The rule of law will be restored, the border will be secured, the economy will be strengthened, our veterans will be cared for, our first responders will be supported, and the American people will be protected,"" he added.
As for the first 100 days in office, President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Pence have already agreed with House Speaker Ryan on the following legislative agenda:
* Regulatory relief.* Reforming the tax code.* Securing the border.* Rebuilding the military.* Infrastructure.
""We must transform America’s crumbling infrastructure into a golden opportunity for accelerated economic growth and productivity gains with a deficit-neutral plan targeting substantial new infrastructure investments,"" said Spicer."

The U.S. Congress has authorized DOE to sell off $375.4 million worth of oil in its recent budget resolution, and the DOE said that such a sale could be held as early January 20.
The price of crude oiltoday was $52.34, down 3.06%.
The price of Brent oilat about 1:30 p.m. today was $55.40, down 2.98%.
The price of natural gas was also down today on intraday trading.
Crude oil settled at $52.03, up 0.13%. Brent oil settled at a two-week low of $54.94 a barrel, down 3.99%. 
Analysts say the government's motivation to sell its crude oil is rather simple: to finance maintenance for the SPR.
The reserves are located in salt caverns in Louisiana and Texas, which were established decades ago in the wake of the Arab Oil Embargo in 1973.
The SPR can hold more than 700 million barrels of oil at one time, and is the largest strategic stockpile in the world.
The SPR holds 90 days’ worth of oil supplies, which could be released in the event of a global outage.
A release from the SPR has only happened a handful of times, including the Persian Gulf War in the 1990s, and Hurricane Katrina and the Arab Spring during the 21st century, experts noted.

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2017 01:20PM ET</span>","Cuba, United States sign oil spill deal before Trump inauguration","By Marc Frank
HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba and the United States agreed on Monday to jointly prevent, contain and clean up oil and other toxic spills in the Gulf of Mexico, as they rush to conclude deals before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.
U.S. Charge d'Affaires Jeffrey DeLaurentis, upon signing the agreement, said it was one of a series of deals to protect the shared marine environment of the two neighboring countries separated by just 90 miles (145 km) of water.
Trump has threatened to scrap a still-fragile detente between the two countries unless Cuba makes further political and economic concessions.
U.S. companies and the outgoing administration of President Barack Obama have announced a flurry of small deals in recent weeks aimed at making it harder for Trump to ditch the detente established by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro in 2014.
The former Cold War foes said last month that they hoped to sign as many as six cooperation accords before Jan. 20, when President Barack Obama leaves office.
The oil spill pact, also signed by Cuban Deputy Transportation Minister Eduardo Rodriguez Davila, calls for the parties to prepare joint disaster plans, test them and train personnel, among other measures.
Cuba and foreign partners drilled four offshore wells in the Gulf of Mexico in 2012, raising concerns that U.S. sanctions meant the United States was not in a position to respond to a spill that could be carried by currents to its coast.
The wells came up dry, but Cuba says it plans to drill again.
“This agreement is especially important for people living in coastal communities along the northern coast of Cuba and southern Florida because it provides a strong measure of protection against future disasters,” Dan Whittle, head of Cuba projects at the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, said.
Obama has used executive orders to improve relations and punch holes in the U.S. trade embargo, which can only be lifted by Congress. The deals and orders can be reversed by Trump.
More than a dozen cooperation accords have been inked to date, ranging from postal services and law enforcement to protecting marine life and fighting drug trafficking.
Negotiations are ongoing over difficult issues such as U.S. nationalization compensation claims, Cuba's demand for embargo reparations, extraditing fugitives and the return of the Guantanamo Naval Base to Cuba.

Last week a deal was struck to export small amounts of charcoal to the United States and in December Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) signed an agreement to place servers on the island to quicken access to its products.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell more than 2 percent on Monday as signs of growing U.S. production outweighed optimism that many other producers, including Russia, were sticking to a deal to cut supplies in a bid to bolster the market.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were down $1.30, or 2.3 percent, at $55.80 a barrel at 1414 GMT (9:14 a.m. ET), after touching a intra-day low of $55.69. U.S. crude futures (CLc1) were trading at $52.73 per barrel, down $1.26, or 2.3 percent, compared with a session low of $52.64.
""We see the optimism surrounding OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts being counterbalanced by fears of higher U.S. crude production as the higher rig count of last Friday still weighs,"" said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.
Last week, U.S. energy companies added oil rigs for a 10th week in a row to 529, Baker Hughes data showed, extending a recovery in activity into an eighth month.
Analysts at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said they expected the U.S. rig count to rise to 850-875 by the end of the year.
This raised concerns that U.S. production is increasing and undermining efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and others to cut output. 
In Iraq, OPEC's second-biggest producer, oil exports from the southern Basra ports reached a record high of 3.51 million barrels per day (bpd) in December, the oil ministry said.
Although Iraq's oil minister added the country would still comply with an agreed output cut of 210,000 bpd from January.
Sources also told Reuters that Iraq's State Oil Marketing Company (SOMO) had given three buyers in Asia and Europe full supply allocations for February. 
Traders also eyed news from OPEC member Kuwait, where bad weather forced the closure of oil exporting ports, state news agency Kuna said.
""Considering the record speculative long (positions), this market needs to be fed price supportive news on a constant basis. Once that fades, profit-taking sets in,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity research at SaxoBank.

According to updated weather forecasting models, above normal temperatures are expected throughout large portions of the southern and eastern U.S. through January 23, dampening demand for the heating fuel.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Natural-gas markets have been volatile in recent weeks, changing course rapidly in response to shifting outlooks in short-term weather patterns.
Prices rallied to two-year highs at the end of December amid weather forecasts that predicted extreme cold would hit most of the country in January. But the arctic blast is now expected to be briefer than many anticipated, with milder temperatures taking hold in mid-January.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 135 and 145 billion cubic feet in the week ended January 6.
That compares with a withdrawal of 49 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 168 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 167 billion cubic feet.

KHUZDAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The dusty desert city of Khuzdar in southwestern Pakistan has no hospital and no commercial flights into its tiny airport, but government officials who visited recently spoke in glowing terms of its future as a hub of commerce.
Pakistan's new army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, was among a flock of dignitaries who descended upon Khuzdar, a city of 400,000, to tout the benefits of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) for the southwestern province of Baluchistan.
How much the $57 billion network of energy projects, roads and a deep-water port linking western China with Pakistan's southwestern coast will benefit ordinary Pakistanis has been debated in recent months, with critics saying Chinese banks and companies will gain most.
Pakistani officials, however, assured students, officials and citizens at a seminar in Khuzdar that CPEC would bring new prosperity to Pakistan's largest, least-populous and poverty-plagued province.
""Baluchistan unfortunately had been neglected in the past, for a host of reasons, but not anymore,"" Bajwa told the gathering at Khuzdar's Baluchistan University of Engineering and Technology.
The head of the army is one of the most powerful positions in Pakistan, where the military not only controls security but also operates a vast business empire and often dictates key areas of foreign policy.
Students in the audience were skeptical about whether CPEC would benefit the province.
Baluchistan, which has rich reserves of natural gas, copper and gold, has long complained that the national government takes far more from the province than it gives back. Ire over this has contributed to a long-running ethnic separatist rebellion.
A study late last year by the Applied Economics Research Centre (AERC) estimated CPEC would create 700,000 jobs in Pakistan and a Chinese newspaper recently placed the number at more than 2 million. But in Khuzdar, questions about how many jobs would come to Baluchistan from CPEC went unanswered.
""I want to know what share Baluchistan will get and what the other provinces will get and on what basis?"" a female student asked during a question and answer session.
WHERE'S THE GAS?
Concerns over how much Baluchistan will benefit were even voiced by a national official, Minister for Ports and Shipping Hasil Khan Bizenjo.
""We just want to make sure that under CPEC the same thing does not happen to us as 1952, when gas was found in Baluchistan and yet in 2017 there is no gas in Khuzdar,"" said Bizenjo, originally from Baluchistan and a speaker at the conference.
Other speakers, however, envisioned Khuzdar as a center of trade and industry.
Baluchistan Chief Minister Sanaullah Zehri said that Khuzdar would be one of 29 Special Economic Zones under CPEC that would ""greatly benefit the people of the city"".
Khuzdar does not connect the provincial capital, Quetta, to the port city of Gwadar, but state representatives at the conference highlighted its significance as the second-largest city in the province and a potential transit point between Quetta and Karachi, Pakistan's biggest city and economic hub.
""We believe that Khuzdar has the ability to attract a great deal of local and foreign investment,"" said Anwar Ul-Haq Kakar, a spokesman for the Baluchistan government.
The Khuzdar university's vice chancellor, Mohammad Amin, said he hoped CPEC could bring investment and jobs, because the city's location four hours' drive from Quetta had made it difficult to attract even faculty at the school.
""No one is coming because there is no infrastructure here as yet,"" Amin said of the university. ""We will offer any PhD who accepts a job here a brand new Toyota Corolla and a 100 per cent pay increase.""

The price of crude oil settled at $53.65, down 0.20% today. 
The price of Brent oil settled at $56.78, a decline of 0.19%. 
Investors purchased futures ahead of the weekend, but the strong U.S. dollar limited price gains, as did overhanging doubts about whether all OPEC producers would cut output in line with an agreement reached Nov. 30. 
Volumes were relatively low today, at the conclusion of the first week of trading of 2017. 
Top crude producer Saudi Arabia and neighbors Abu Dhabi and Kuwait showed signs they were indeed cutting production in performance with an agreement by OPEC and other producers. Russia is not yet complying the the OPEC cut, which it agreed to in December, even though it is not an OPEC member, experts said. 
The Kurds and the Iraqis are not expected to comply, even though Baghdad is a member of OPEC, according to analysts. 
The Iranians are said to have millions of barrels of oil stored on ocean tankers which it is expected to start selling in order to regain market share lost during recent years, according to experts. 
Saudi Aramco is telling its customers that it will reduce production by 3% or 7% this month to put the plans in motion.
In other news impacting global markets, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said that allegations of Russian hacking have, at best, influenced some public opinion, but did not influence actual voting or give President-elect Trump an edge during the election last year. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) agencies briefed Trump today, and also released materials to the media regarding their investigation of the unproven charges.
""There number one goal was to create doubt about our electoral system,"" said Rubio, himself a failed candidate for president last year. ""Having people questioning Hillary Clinton, had she won, would have accomplished that goal too.""

ATLANTA (Reuters) - A storm packing heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain hit the U.S. South on Friday, bringing winter weather to a region unaccustomed to it and leading to traffic snarls and widespread school closures.
As much as 8 inches (20 cm) of snow and 1 inch (3 cm) of sleet was expected to fall on a large swath of the United States from northeast Louisiana to southern Pennsylvania, according to the National Weather Service.
The service issued winter storm warnings stretching from Louisiana, across the South and into the East Coast. Police from Oklahoma and Arkansas reported scores of accidents on roads where a few inches of snow had fallen.
""If you don't have to travel, don't travel,"" said Matthew Grantham, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Alabama. Conditions will worsen after dusk on Friday, he added.
The heaviest snowfall was expected for Friday night into Saturday with southern Virginia and north-central North Carolina being the hardest-hit areas, the service said.
Ahead of the winter storm, Atlanta residents packed into stores to stock up on essentials.
“I shouldn’t have waited to the last minute,” said Showanda Torres, 29, of the East Atlanta Village neighborhood, as she pushed her 3-year-old son in a shopping cart at a grocery store.
""The shelves are getting picked clean,"" she said.
The storm also affected U.S. air travel. As of 2:30 p.m., there were about 370 flight cancellations at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, one of the nation's busiest, according to tracking service FlightAware.com. 
City officials called for staggered departures to avoid Friday evening traffic congestion. Schools were asked to release students at lunchtime.
The move followed a disastrous response to winter weather in January 2014, when thousands of commuters sat in gridlock for hours on frozen highways around Atlanta and many children were stuck at schools.
States of emergency were declared for 79 counties in Georgia and all of Alabama. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson shut state offices for non-essential personnel.
North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper also declared a state of emergency as the storm is expected to bring significant snowfall to his state, particularly in the central region. 
The hazardous weather has forced the postponement of ceremonial inauguration events scheduled this weekend for Cooper, who has already taken office.
""The number one thing is making sure the people of North Carolina are safe,"" Cooper told a news conference on Friday morning. ""You can do that by staying home.""

1229,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2017 09:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Iran capitalizes on OPEC oil cut to sell millions of barrels - sources,"By Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) - Iran has sold more than 13 million barrels of oil that it had long held on tankers at sea, capitalizing on an OPEC output cut deal from which it is exempted to regain market share and court new buyers, according to industry sources and data.
In the past three months, Tehran has sold almost half the oil it had held in floating storage, which had tied up many of its tankers as it struggled to offload stocks in an oversupplied global market.
The amount of Iranian oil held at sea has dropped to 16.4 million barrels, from 29.6 million barrels at the beginning of October, according to Thomson Reuters Oil Flows data. Before that sharp drop, the level had barely changed in 2016; it was 29.7 million barrels at the start of last year, the data showed. 
Unsold oil is now tying up about 12 to 14 Iranian tankers, out of its fleet of about 60 vessels, compared with around 30 in the summer, according to two tanker-tracking sources. 
The oil sold in recent months has gone to buyers in Asia including China, India and South Korea and to European countries including Italy and France, according to the sources and data. It was unclear which companies bought the oil.
Iran is also looking to use the opportunity to push into new markets in Europe, including Baltic and other central and eastern European countries, said separate oil industry sources, though it was not clear if any oil had been sold there. 
The state-run National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) could not be reached for comment. Tanker group NITC, which operates most of the country's fleet, could also not be reached.
Tehran scored a victory when it was exempted from the OPEC deal agreed in November to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels per day for six months, an accord aimed at addressing the global oversupply and bolstering low oil prices. 
The country successfully argued it should not limit its production which was slowly starting to recover after the lifting of international sanctions in January last year.
While the deal did not come into effect until the beginning of 2017, industry sources said Tehran had already been offering aggressive discounts, aiming to coax buyers globally into stocking up for winter in anticipation of the OPEC cut.
Iran lacks enough land storage facilities for its oil and, to enable it to keep pumping crude, has relied on its tanker fleet to park excess stocks until it can find buyers. The tanker-tracking sources said it was unclear how much of the oil stored at sea was condensate, a very light grade of crude.
In another sign of the rising activity, Iran's oil ministry news agency SHANA reported in late December that the number of tankers able to berth at major terminal Kharg Island had reached a record in 2016 of 10 vessels at the same time. 
""Iran got its way at OPEC and the Saudis agreed not to limit their capabilities. Iran will go ahead and look to export whatever they can for winter demand (globally),"" said Mehdi Varzi, a former official at NIOC who is now an independent global industry consultant. 
""This is a commercial policy of trying to get rid of a lot of their crude oil on tankers as holding oil on tankers is very expensive."" 

Many foreign ship insurers have resumed providing cover for Iranian vessels in recent months, which has also given Iran more scope to use its tankers to make deliveries or carry out ship to ship oil transfers rather deploying them for storage.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Friday as output cuts by OPEC members met with lingering concern that other producers could try to shirk their share of planned decreases aimed at curbing global oversupply.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1), the benchmark for international oil prices, were trading at $57.20 per barrel at 1229 GMT (7:29 a.m. ET), up 31 cents from the previous close. 
In the United States, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were at $54.05 a barrel, 29 cents above their last settlement.
The contracts were largely flat on the week after days of choppy trading.
""There's a lot of volatility, or at least changes in direction,"" ABN Amro senior energy economist Hans van Cleef said. ""People think the long-term trend is up, but after a gain of a few dollars, they take profit.""
Production cuts by OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and signs that it plans further trims have helped buoy the market. 
The Kingdom cut oil output in January by at least 486,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.058 million bpd, fully implementing an agreement by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers to curb a global supply glut.
State oil giant Saudi Aramco has started talks with customers globally on possible cuts of 3 percent to 7 percent in February crude loadings.
On Friday, a Kuwaiti oil official said that country had also reduced production in line with the deal, and there are also reports of supply cuts from Abu Dhabi.
Still, doubts remained that all producers would fully implement planned reductions.
""There will be some countries who will cheat...we expect zero compliance from Baghdad... And we definitely do not expect the Kurds to join in, given that they are autonomous from the federal government,"" Energy Aspects said in its 2017 oil market outlook, published this week.
Overall supply from OPEC in December fell only slightly to 34.18 million barrels per day (bpd) from a revised 34.38 million bpd in November, according to a Reuters survey this week based on shipping data and information from industry sources.

But OPEC was not the only factor; analysts pointed to a strong U.S. dollar, which edged back from a 14-year high this week, and gains in U.S. oil product inventories as holding them in a relatively narrow range. [EIA/S][MKTS/GLOB]

U.S. crude was up 35 cents, or 0.65%, at $54.11 at 06:50 ET, while Brent crude gained 39 cents, or 0.69%, to $ 57.28. Reports out Thursday of supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi coming into effect as part of efforts by the OPEC and other producers to curb a global supply glut gave oil prices upside. Also supporting black gold, official EIA data out a day earlier saw crude stockpiles decline by 7.1 million barrels, compared to expectations for a drop of 2.2 million. Still, market participants were cautious on Friday ahead of the U.S. employment report for December. A rate rise may strengthen the U.S. dollar, which could depress oil prices as it would make the greenback-denominated commodity more expensive for holders of other currencies. Investors also looked ahead to the Baker Hughes U.S. rig count data for the latest week. Last week, the oilfield services provider said that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by 2 to 525 in what was the ninth straight weekly rise and a level not seen in almost a year."

Crude oil for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange slipped 2 cents, or 0.04%, to $53.74 a barrel by 3:39AM ET (08:39GMT), after jumping 50 cents, or around 0.9%, a day earlier.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London dropped 4 cents, or 0.07%, to $56.85 a barrel. London-traded Brent prices rallied 43 cents, or 0.8%, on Thursday.
January 1 marked the official start of the deal agreed by OPEC and non-OPEC member countries such as Russia in November last year to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
Thursday's prices rose following reports of supply cuts from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi coming into effect as part of efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers to curb a global supply glut.
However, some traders remain skeptical that the planned cuts will be as substantial as the market currently expects.
Analysts warned that OPEC had a poor track record of complying with promises to reduce supply and that higher prices would inevitably lead to an increase in production from U.S. shale firms.
With this in mind, market players looked ahead to data from Baker Hughes released later on Friday to gauge the increase in U.S. drilling activity.
Last week, the oilfield services provider said that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. increased by 2 to 525 in what was the ninth straight weekly rise and a level not seen in almost a year."
1233,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 06, 2017 12:26AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs sees 84% chance of OPEC deal succeeding,"Investing.com - A new report by the investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) indicates that there is only an 84% chance that the OPEC oil production reduction deal will succeed this year. The deal to reduce oil production by millions of barrels per day, and increase prices, went into effect on Jan. 1, 2017.
The investment bank note, sent by Goldman Sachs oil analyst Damien Courvalin, indicated that the normalizaiton of inventories is the ""key"" to success for low-cost producers.
“That generates backwardation, which removes hedging gains from high-cost producers and helps low-cost producers grow market share,” he observes, in a note to investors, obtained by Investing.com.
According to Goldman Sachs, the moving into a phase of ""backwardation"" could mean that the higher-cost shale might find locking in 2018 production less attractive.
Goldman Sachs has also recently said that OPEC cuts would push the oil market into deficit in the first quarter, which in turn would move the market into backwardation by the summer months.
However, U.S. shale production is also expected to respond to higher oil prices, so there is a ""limited upside"" in crude prices above the high-$50s, Goldman Sachs noted.
The Saudis are said to be leading the way with the oil production cuts, thus far, and others are expected to come online soon."
1234,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2017 11:50PM ET</span>",Charcoal becomes first Cuban export to United States in half a century,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba announced a landmark deal on Thursday to sell charcoal to a U.S. company, the first legal Cuban export to the United States in five decades, as part of the fragile rapprochement between the former Cold War foes.
The sale of 40 tonnes of charcoal derived from the woody plant marabu comes at a time when the two-year U.S.-Cuban detente looks under threat. It is also largely symbolic, given that it is worth around $17,000.
The first delivery is scheduled for Jan. 18, two days before the inauguration as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has threatened to row back on the normalization of U.S.-Cuba relations unless he gets a ""better deal"".
""This is a first contract but we hope to continue our relationship for many years and not just with vegetal charcoal, but other products that we have ready to export like honey and coffee,"" Isabel O’Reilly, the director of state exporter Cubaexport, told Cuba's official media outlet Cubadebate.
While a damaging U.S. trade embargo on Cuba remains in place, outgoing President Barack Obama has facilitated some commercial links with executive orders.
Obama's administration eased restrictions on imports of goods and services from private Cuban entrepreneurs in early 2015. It was unclear, however, how this would work in practice given that individuals cannot independently import and export products or services under Cuban law.
Under the charcoal deal, private cooperatives will deliver the product to a local packager that will sell it on to state-run export firm CubaExpo, which in turn will deal directly with U.S. company Coabana Trading LLC.
Coabana Trading will pay $420 per tonne, above the usual market price of $340 to $380 per tonne for Cuban charcoal, Cubadebate quoted O'Reilly as saying.
Cuba exports up to 80,000 tonnes of charcoal per year to about six different countries and was also seeking to sell it to Great Britain and Germany, Cubadebate said.
Cuba and the Obama administration have been scrambling to deepen and cement their detente, through bilateral agreements and commercial links, since Trump's election in November.
Increased trade with the United States would be welcome news for the beleaguered Cuban economy, which fell into a recession last year in the wake of the political and economic crisis in its strategic ally Venezuela.

Natural gas for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange hit a session low of $3.175 per million British thermal units, a level not seen since November 28.
It was last at $3.192 by 10:35AM ET (15:35GMT), down 7.5 cents, or 2.3%. Futures were at around $3.287 prior to the release of the supply data.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. declined by 49 billion cubic feet in the week ended December 30, below market expectations for a drop of 82 billion cubic feet.
That compared with a withdrawal of 237 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 131 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 107 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.311 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 9.9% lower than levels at this time a year ago and less than 1% below the five-year average for this time of year.
Futures have lost more than 13% so far this week as forecasts of mild weather replaced predictions of severe cold.
According to updated weather forecasting models, above normal temperatures are expected throughout large portions of the southern and eastern U.S. through January 16, dampening demand for the heating fuel.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday after Saudi Arabia started talks with customers about a reduction in crude sales to support a plan by OPEC to reduce global supply.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries promised in November to cut output to help prop up prices.
Under the deal, Saudi Arabia agreed to cut output by 486,000 barrels per day (bpd), or 4.61 percent of its October output of 10.544 million bpd.
""Aramco is approaching all its customers for possible cuts from February and discussing likely (supply) scenarios,"" one source told Reuters. ""Nothing is confirmed yet,"" the source said, adding the scenarios were for cuts of 3-7 percent.
Investors have been suspicious that OPEC may not cut as much as promised, but several sources told Reuters on Thursday the world's biggest oil exporter intended to reduce exports to comply with the OPEC cuts.
Benchmark Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was up 45 cents a barrel at $56.91 by 1225 GMT. U.S. light crude oil (CLc1) was up 40 cents a barrel at $53.66. Both contracts rose by around 2 percent on Wednesday.
""There remains a question mark over whether OPEC, with a long history of non-compliance, will actually follow through (with the cuts). Very few respondents expect full compliance,"" Singapore Exchange (SGX) said on Thursday, citing results from a survey of its participants.
""Three-quarters of those surveyed went for (crude) prices averaging within the current $50-$60 a barrel range (for 2017),"" SGX added.
Analysts at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said even if OPEC reduced production as promised, there was ""only moderate oil spot price upside given the expected supply response to higher oil prices and new production"".
The U.S. bank said it expected Brent prices to peak at $59 a barrel by mid-2017.
In another sign of compliance with the cuts, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has scheduled maintenance at oilfields for March and April, although it was not immediately clear how much exports might fall.
Oil prices also found support from an American Petroleum Institute (API) report showing U.S. crude inventories fell 7.4 million barrels last week.
U.S. government figures on inventories were due to be published at 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT) on Thursday.

1245,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2017 05:43AM ET</span>",China to plow $361 billion into renewable fuel by 2020,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will plow 2.5 trillion yuan ($361 billion) into renewable power generation by 2020, the country's energy agency said on Thursday, as the world's largest energy market continues to shift away from dirty coal power towards cleaner fuels. 
The investment will create over 13 million jobs in the sector, the National Energy Administration (NEA) said in a blueprint document that lays out its plan to develop the nation's energy sector during the five-year 2016 to 2020 period.
The NEA said installed renewable power capacity including wind, hydro, solar and nuclear power will contribute to about half of new electricity generation by 2020.
The agency did not disclose more details on where the funds, which equate to about $72 billion each year, would be spent.
Still, the investment reflects Beijing's continued focus on curbing the use of fossil fuels, which have fostered the country's economic growth over the past decade, as it ramps up its war on pollution.
Last month, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the country's economic planner, said in its own five-year plan, that solar power will receive 1 trillion yuan of spending, as the country seeks to boost capacity by five times. That's equivalent to about 1,000 major solar power plants, according to experts' estimates.
The spending comes as the cost of building large-scale solar plants has dropped by as much as 40 percent since 2010. China became the world's top solar generator last year. 
""The government may exceed these targets because there are more investment opportunities in the sector as costs go down,"" said Steven Han, renewable analyst with securities firm Shenyin Wanguo.
Some 700 billion yuan will go towards wind farms, 500 billion to hydro power with tidal and geothermal getting the rest, the NDRC said.
The NEA's job creation forecast differs from the NDRC's in December that said it expected an additional 3 million jobs, bringing the total in the sector to 13 million by 2020. 
Concerns about the social and economic costs of China's air pollution have increased as the northern parts of the country, including the capital Beijing, have battled a weeks-long bout of hazardous smog.
Illustrating the enormity of the challenge, the NEA repeated on Thursday that renewables will still only account for just 15 percent of overall energy consumption by 2020, equivalent to 580 million tonnes of coal.

More than half of the nation's installed power capacity will still be fueled by coal over the same period.

Overnight, gold prices rose on Wednesday, nearing a four-week high as the U.S. dollar retreated from 14-year highs against basket of major currencies.
Prices of the yellow metal have fallen sharply since Donald Trump was elected president as a soaring U.S. dollar, rising Treasury yields and a record-breaking rally on Wall Street have dampened its appeal.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday shuffled his cabinet by naming a new economy czar to oversee the OPEC country's decaying socialist system and a new oil minister to confront the economic difficulties caused by low oil prices.
The country is suffering from triple-digit inflation, Soviet-style production shortages and increasing street protests as a combination of dysfunctional state controls and low oil prices. Maduro says he is the victim of an ""economic war.""
Economist Ramon Lobo, who has been serving as a legislator for the ruling Socialist Party, will assume the dual roles of finance minister and economy vice president - making him the country's top economic authority. 
""You shall assume, with a firm hand, the oversight of the economy,"" said Maduro during a televised broadcast, describing Lobo as an expert in budget matters.Nelson Martinez, who has led the U.S.-based refiner Citgo, will take on the role of oil minister. Outgoing minister Eulogio Del Pino will remain on as president of state oil company PDVSA.
The oil minister has traditionally served as the representative to OPEC, where Venezuela has for nearly three years been one of the strongest voices for production cuts.
Maduro also named state governor Tarek El Aissami as new vice president, replacing outgoing Aristobulo Isturiz, who had served as an intermediary with the opposition-run legislature.
Cabinet shuffles have been relatively common in Venezuela since the 14-year rule of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, who died of cancer in 2013. Officials tend to come from the inner circle of the ruling Socialist Party, and as such do not tend to be the leaders of broad policy changes. 
Economists say Venezuela's economy will not return to growth until it lifts corruption-riddled exchange controls and dysfunctional price control system and rolls back hundreds of nationalizations that have left many industries unproductive. 
The country last year brought in a new economic team that promised to create a market-based currency exchange platform, but that system never took off and its promoters were soon removed in a cabinet shuffle.

The central bank not published economic statistics such as economy growth and inflation for 2016. In February, it said consumer prices in 2015 rose 181 percent and GDP had contracted by 5.7 percent.

1253,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2017 03:55PM ET</span>",Ex-CEO of Platinum-linked energy company convicted of tax evasion,"By Lawrence Delevingne
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The former chief executive officer of a company linked to troubled hedge fund manager Platinum Partners was convicted of criminal tax fraud on Wednesday, New York's attorney general said in a statement.
Gary Mole, who led Glacial Energy Holdings Inc before it went bankrupt in 2014, pleaded guilty to diverting more than $18.5 million in taxable income from Glacial's New York unit to a mining business in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2006 through 2008.
Mole, a 52-year-old Australian citizen, repaid $335,000 in restitution as a condition of the plea and will likely be forced to leave the country, according to attorney general's office.
Mole did not immediately respond to a request for comment through his attorney. 
""By diverting millions in income, this defendant showed no regard for the integrity of our tax system or for the many New Yorkers who would be left footing the bill,"" Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement describing the ""elaborate"" scheme.
Platinum - whose top executives, including founder Mark Nordlicht, were arrested in December on charges of running a more than $1 billion investment fraud - started lending money to Glacial around 2010 and later took an ownership stake in the reseller of electricity and natural gas.
When Glacial went bankrupt, Platinum helped spin its assets into a new, similar company, Agera Energy LLC. Briarcliff Manor, New York-based Agera has been an investment of the Beechwood group of reinsurance companies, which have close historic links to Platinum. (See the related Reuters Special Report on Platinum from April 2015 here: http://reut.rs/1TRovwx)

Michael Nordlicht, Agera's general counsel and Mark Nordlicht's nephew, said Agera had no connection to Mole and had never met him. Spokesmen for Platinum and Beechwood did not respond to requests for comment. The Platinum executives have pleaded not guilty.

The price of gold ended today at $1162.60, an increase of 0.05%.
The price of silver also settled higher for the day, at $16.45 per ounce, up 0.25%.
Copper, platinum, and palladium also saw increased on Wednesday.
Demand for gold was up as the Chinese New Year approaches, a time when sales of gold traditionally increase, analysts said.
“The gold price could soon be given a boost by purchases in China in the run-up to the Chinese New Year festival, which will be celebrated this year at the end of January,” Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) says in a note to investors. “That said, Chinese gold demand was still unusually subdued in"" recent months.
Another trader noted that Chinese New Year demand is expected to support the metal over the short term, and that price consolidation above the $1,160 level will be required for an even higher price run.
U.S. jobs data, expected this week, is also seen as bolstering the price of gold.
 BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) in a note to investors forecasts an increase of 170,000 jobs in the U.S. last month. That, the bank says, is above the upper end of the Fed’s estimated threshold of job gains needed to keep the employment rate steady, but is possibly inflationary if perceived as boosting wages."

The price of Brent oil settled a bit higher today as well, at $56.38, or an increase of 1.64%.
The price of gasoline and heating oil settled higher today, but the price of natural gas dipped.
Overall, the outlook for oil remains bullish, as OPEC's production cuts are beginning to take effect.
Record U.S. gasoline consumption, and an increase in oil prices at the end of 2016, led to energy commodity prices rising more than any other major commodity group last year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) yesterday said.
The spot energy index in the S&P Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Commodity Index (GSCI) soared by 48% in 2016, the EIA reported.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent account for 69% of the weighting in the S&P GSCI energy index, so the index usually trends along with crude price movements.
Following the 13-year-lows of January and February of 2106, prices had been somewhat stable in the US$40-50 range since last spring.
Prices surged in December when OPEC and non-OPEC producers announced the deal to reduce oil supply starting on 1 January 2017.
Crude prices were also bolstered by improving economic growth in mature and emerging markets, according to the EIA.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices ticked higher on Wednesday on expectations that U.S. crude inventories have dropped and on signs that the world's top oil exporters will stick to agreed output cuts that took effect this week.
Global benchmark Brent crude futures (LCOc1) rose 28 cents to $55.75 a barrel, a 0.5 percent gain by 10:51 a.m. Eastern. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) gained 25 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $52.58 a barrel.
Both benchmarks recovered some losses from the previous day - when the U.S.-dollar (DXY) hit a 14-year peak and knocked oil from 18-month highs - as the greenback dipped on Wednesday, making dollar-denominated fuel purchases in other currencies cheaper. [/USD]
Weekly U.S. industry and government reports are expected to show a 1.7 million-barrel crude draw for last week, analysts polled by Reuters said ahead of the data due late Wednesday and on Thursday. [EIA/S]
""We are expecting a draw,"" said Tariq Zahir, managing member of Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.
Oil companies likely drew down inventories in the final week of the year for tax-related reasons, which could lead prices to spike after inventory data is released.
OPEC member Kuwait also lifted expectations that producers will comply with a deal to reduce oversupply after its state-owned oil producer said on Wednesday it would cut output in the first quarter.
Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in November agreed their first output cut since 2008 in an attempt to stabilize oil prices.
As part of the deal, Kuwait has to reduce output by 131,000 barrels per day.
An OPEC committee meeting to monitor compliance with the agreement is scheduled for Jan. 21-22 in Vienna.
""Prices are likely to remain volatile until there is evidence that quotas are being adhered to,"" analysts at Cenkos Securities wrote. 
Zahir cautioned that increased oil production from OPEC member Libya has come online faster than anticipated and may deter some OPEC members from cutting their own output. 

Also reflecting a tightening market, traders expect top oil exporter Saudi Arabia to raise the official selling price for its crude to Asia in February.

Futures tumbled 39.7 cents, or 10.66%, on Tuesday after updated weather forecasting models pointed to above normal temperatures throughout large portions of the southern and eastern U.S. through January 16, dampening demand for the heating fuel.
About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 72 and 83 billion cubic feet in the week ended December 30.

Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.360 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, almost 11.0% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 2.3% below the five-year average for this time of year.
Natural-gas markets have been volatile in recent weeks, changing course rapidly in response to shifting outlooks in short-term weather patterns.
Prices rallied to two-year highs at the end of December amid weather forecasts that predicted extreme cold would hit most of the country in January. But the arctic blast is now expected to be briefer than many anticipated, with milder temperatures taking hold in mid-January.

Prices of the yellow metal have fallen sharply since Donald Trump was elected president as a soaring U.S. dollar, rising Treasury yields and a record-breaking rally on Wall Street have dampened its appeal.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
Both a strong dollar and higher interest rates are typically bearish for gold, which is denominated in dollars and struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when borrowing costs rise.

Giancarlo has already signaled that he will move the CFTC's agenda beyond implementing Dodd-Frank and has repeatedly criticized the commission's work with its international counterparts. By implementing new rules on derivatives trading first, the United States has given markets in other countries an advantage and created ""regulatory arbitrage,"" he has said.
Massad countered Giancarlo's position in his good-bye statement on Tuesday. 
""We have improved international coordination by harmonizing rules in many areas, strengthening relationships, and working with other regulators on oversight of markets, all of which has reduced inconsistency and the risk of regulatory arbitrage,"" he said.

""And we have taken action to address the new challenges and opportunities in the derivatives markets, particularly cyber threats, clearinghouse resilience, and the increased use of automated trading,"" he also said.

1269,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 03, 2017 12:47PM ET</span>",Carbon emissions drop to lowest level in 25 years,"Investing.com -- Carbon emissions in the U.S. last year declined to their lowest level in a quarter of a century, as a result of mild weather and new turbine technology, according to a new report by the U.S. Department of Energy. 
Carbon emissions for the first six months of 2016 hit an all-time low — as emissions were 2,530 million metric tons, the lowest for the first half of a year since 1991. 
An analysis by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) attributed the drop to mild weather and the shift from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas and renewable energy in U.S. power production.
Warmer winter weather during the first six months of this year kept demand for heating fuels, like heating oil and natural gas, much lower. 
Overall, the winter of 2016 had the fewest heating degree days since 1949. These heating degree days are the number of days when temperatures drop below 65 degrees Fahrenheit.Coal consumption dropped during the first six months of 2016.
The use of renewable energy sources, wind, hydroelectric power and solar energy also increased during the first six months of 2016. 
Most of the increase in renewable power came from wind energy, but wind is increasingly controversial for the number of birds, including bald eagles, and bats,which are killed when flying into the turbines. 
Turbines are propeller-like blades. 
Leading makers of turbine technology include,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), Sulzon Group, Gamesa, United Power, Ming Yang, Nordex, and others, according toleading market analysts. "

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices hit 18-month highs on Tuesday, the first trading day of 2017, buoyed by hopes that a deal between OPEC and other big oil exporters to cut production, which kicked in on Sunday, will drain a global supply glut.
Benchmark Brent crude jumped more than 2 percent to a high of $58.37, up $1.55 a barrel and its highest since July 2015. By 1430 GMT (9:30 a.m. ET), Brent had eased to $58.12, up $1.30.

Oil futures exchanges were closed on Monday for New Year public holidays. 
Jan. 1 marked the official start of a deal agreed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters such as Russia to reduce output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd).
""First signals suggest the OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts are raising hopes that the global oil oversupply will diminish,"" said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) Bank N.V. in Amsterdam.
Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, agreed: 
""Markets will be looking for anecdotal evidence for production cuts,"" he said. ""The most likely scenario is OPEC and non-OPEC member countries will be committed to the deal, especially in early stages.""
Investors will be watching OPEC very closely to see whether the group's members keep their promises to reduce production:
""If 2016 was the year of words, 2017 must be the year of actions,"" said Tamas Varga, senior oil analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
Libya, one of two OPEC countries exempt from the output cuts, has increased its production to 685,000 bpd, from around 600,000 bpd in December, an official at the National Oil Corporation said on Sunday.
Elsewhere, non-OPEC Middle Eastern oil producer Oman told customers last week that it would cut its crude oil term allocation volumes by 5 percent in March.

Non-OPEC Russia's oil production in December remained unchanged at 11.21 million bpd, near a 30-year high, but it was preparing to cut output by 300,000 bpd in the first half of 2017 in its contribution to the accord.

1275,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2017 08:50AM ET</span>",Oil business seen in strong position as Trump tackles tax reform,"By David Morgan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Big Oil could be in a unique position to protect its interests against a Republican proposal to tax imports, given that President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet is studded with oil champions sensitive to the risk of higher gasoline prices. 
Trump's emerging leadership includes  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator.
Trump himself has made no secret of his support for the energy sector. 
And in Congress, both Republicans and Democrats have close industry ties, including House tax panel chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican whose district takes in the northern Houston suburbs.
House Republicans want to adopt a sweeping tax reform that would sharply reduce tax rates for corporations and end the taxation of U.S. corporate overseas profits. 
But a provision known as border adjustability is stirring up controversy. Though intended to boost U.S. manufacturing by exempting export revenues from tax, the provision worries some industries because it would also tax imports.
Because U.S. oil refiners import about half the crude oil they use to make gasoline, diesel and other products, analysts say the change could lead to higher gasoline prices and potentially undermine economic growth.
Integrated oil companies such as Exxon,  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX),  BP  Plc (L:BP), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa) and ConocoPhillips (N:COP) could also be hit, depending on whether they are net importers. 
But the industry's allies would likely move to soften any rough edges, analysts say. 
""I don't see this mix of leadership figures in the House, Senate and the White House, doing something that has the effect of raising gasoline prices,"" said Peter Cohn, an energy analyst with Height Securities, a Washington-based investment firm.
The danger is that a move to protect the oil refiners could open the door to assistance for other industries, including retailers and automakers, which would also face higher costs if no longer able to deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income.
Such a knock-on effect could prevent border adjustability from raising an expected $1 trillion in revenues to help pay for lower tax rates over the next decade. 
""We hope that raising these concerns early in the process will allow members of Congress to consider the issues carefully,"" Chet Thompson, president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group, said in a statement.
Brady said earlier this month that his committee was sensitive to the impact on specific businesses and ""listening very closely to how we can make sure we smooth that out."" 
Moreover, some economists dismiss industry worries about higher import costs, saying the dollar's value would rise in response to such sweeping tax changes and ultimately reduce the cost of imports. Currency markets would adjust to higher oil prices by lowering the dollar value of crude, they predict.
""This argument by the oil industry is, frankly, all wrong,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who now heads the American Action Forum think tank.
""Refiners are going to be basically held harmless. They'll have a lower dollar price of oil. Net cost is the same. And they go about their business. I'm unsympathetic,” he added.
Height Securities' Cohn said Trump and his advisers could look for ways to soften any blow to refiners and their customers: ""Trump doesn't want to have refineries closing on his watch."" 
Oil already benefits from several tax code provisions in place for decades that would be eliminated under the House Republican plan. But they stand to gain more than they will lose.
For instance, an existing tax deduction for domestic production lets oil producers shave down their corporate tax rate to 32 percent from the top headline rate of 35 percent. Under the congressional Republicans' plan, the corporate rate would be cut to 20 percent; under Trump's plan, to 15 percent.
Similarly, companies that now write off intangible drilling costs or get a tax allowance for asset depletion would be able to immediately expense capital investments. 

Then there is a tax credit oil companies claim for fees from foreign countries. Congressional Republicans would eliminate foreign taxes altogether, while Trump would maintain taxation at a substantially lower rate.

Ahead, the Caixin manufacturing PMI for December is expected to show a drop to 50.7 from 50.9 in November. At the weekend, data showed the official China PMI from the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing and the National Bureau of Statistics fell to 51.4 in December, slightly weaker than expectations.
In the week ahead, market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Wednesday and Thursday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer. This week's reports come out one day later than usual.Oil traders will also continue to pay close attention to comments from global oil producers for further evidence that producers will stick to their agreement to cut production next year.
Last year, oil futures finished with modest losses in the final trading session of 2016 on Friday, but scored the biggest annual gain since 2009 in wake of the landmark deal reached by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and several non-OPEC members to reduce their output.
On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for March delivery ticked down 3 cents, or less than 0.1%, to settle at $56.82 a barrel by close of trade Friday, not far from a 17-month high of $57.89 touched on December 12. London-traded Brent futures logged a gain of $1.66, or around 2.9%, on the week. The global benchmark saw an annual rise of 52%, which was its largest yearly rise since 2009.
Oil recovered sharply from its February bottom, when prices traded at a 13-year low of around $26-per-barrel, thanks to an agreement by global oil producers to curb production for the first time in eight years.OPEC members agreed to lower production by a combined 1.2 million barrels per day starting from January 1, their first such deal since 2008.
The pact was followed by an agreement from 11 non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, to reduce their supplies by 558,000 barrels a day.
The deal, if carried out as planned, should reduce global supply by about 2%.
However, some traders remain skeptical that the planned cuts will be as substantial as the market currently expects.There are also some worries in the market about production increases in Libya and Nigeria, which are both allowed to ramp up production as part of the OPEC deal.
Meanwhile, indications of increased drilling activity in the U.S. remained in focus. Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week increased by 2 to 525, the ninth straight weekly rise and a level not seen in almost a year.
Some analysts have warned that the recent rally in prices could be self-defeating, as it encourages U.S. shale producers to drill more, adding to concerns over a global supply glut.
Oil prices will gradually rise towards $60 per barrel by the end of 2017, a Reuters’ poll showed on Thursday, with further upside capped by a strong dollar, a likely recovery in U.S. oil output and possible non-compliance by OPEC with agreed cuts.

1282,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 02, 2017 04:46PM ET</span>",Oil prices doubled during 2016,"Investing.com - Oil prices have nearly doubled since last January and natural gas markets heading towards balance, providing plenty of promise for investors in 2017. 
The price of crude oil closed on Dec. 30 at $53.89, up 0.5 cents per barrel, or 0.9%.
The price of Brent oil today was $56.82, unchanged.
The price of natural gas was down on Friday.
Oil prices headed higher earlier last week, in anticipation of the start of production cuts, this week, but drifted downward on the news from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the U.S. Department of Energy that oil inventories were higher than expected in the U.S. 
Other news influening the mood of the maket late last week: 
-- The Energy Department disclosed another unanticipated drawdown in natural gas supplies, with inventories falling 237 billion cubic feet in the week ending on December 23. That move puts total inventors at 413 Bcf lower than last year’s levels at this time and also 79 Bcf below the five-year average figure. 
-- Petroleo Brasileiro Petrobras SA DRC (NYSE:PBR) increased its planned divestment for the 2017-2018 period to $21 billion, higher than the initial $19.5 billion projection. Brazil is emerging as a country of growing interest to international oil explorers and products. The debt crisis for Petrobras, as well as the economic downturn in the country, is opening up the path to private sector investment by foreign firms.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) (NYSE: RDS.A) is making moves to capitalize on the crisis there, according to analysts. "
1283,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 02, 2017 10:28AM ET</span>",Oil markets set to shift focus to output cut compliance in 2017,"Investing.com – With global oil markets closed on Monday and crude prices having pocketed gains of around 50% during 2016, traders prepared to watch developments surrounding the landmark deal reached by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and several non-OPEC oil producers to reduce their output this year.
Oil futures finished with modest losses in the final trading session of 2016 on Friday, but scored the biggest annual gain since 2009 in the wake of the agreement to tackle the global supply glut and support crude prices. 
OPEC members agreed to lower production by a combined 1.2 million barrels per day starting on Sunday, January 1, their first such deal since 2008.
The pact was followed by an agreement from 11 non-OPEC producers, led by the largest producer outside the cartel Russia, to reduce their supplies by 558,000 barrels a day.
The deal, the first of its kind in 15 years, aimed to reduce global supply by about 2%.
From more than $110 per barrel in 2014, oil prices dropped to its February bottom at a 13-year low of around $26-per-barrel before recovering in later months as oil-producing countries made efforts to limit production.
Brent oil ended 2016 with an annual rise of 52%, while U.S. crude futures pocketed gains of nearly 45%.
Markets skeptical of output cut compliance
However, some traders remain skeptical that the planned cuts will be as substantial as the market currently expects.
Notably, Moscow promised to account for 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of the 558,000 included in the agreement among non-OPEC producers. 
However, Russia also indicated that it planned to reach a reduction of 200,000 barrels by March with the additional 100,000 being cut by June. 
There are also some worries in the market about production increases in Libya and Nigeria, which are both allowed to ramp up production as part of the OPEC deal.
Many analysts have also put into question just how much of the agreement will be carried out. 
Both JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs put their forecast for compliance at 80% and 84%, respectively. 
“We now harbor mounting concerns that cheating will inevitably undermine commitment to the agreement at some point in the second semester,” JP Morgan suggested.
Goldman explained their less-than-100% forecast was “given that compliance to cuts outside of Gulf Cooperation Council producers (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman) has historically been poor.”
On the near-term horizon, investors will likely have to wait for their possible first taste of compliance when the monitoring committee meets in Vienna. 
Though OPEC secretary general Mohammed Barkindo had floated a date of January 13, Kuwaiti oil minister Issam Al-Marzouq confirmed that the first meeting would come later.
""Preparations are under way to hold a meeting for the Kuwait-chaired special commission tasked with monitoring adherence to crude oil cut on January 21-22 in Vienna,"" the minister said last Wednesday, according to a report from the state-run Kuwait News Agency.
“It should become better known in a few weeks, around when Donald Trump takes office, just how much is being cut and how much is smoke-and-mirrors,” Boslego Risk Services founder Robert Boslego said in an analysis. 
“The cuts announced are unlikely to all start this month,” he said, also warning that Russia does not follow through, it would be unlikely that many other non-OPEC voluntary cuts will materialize either.
""You get until January 21 to believe your hoped-for outcomes and then you converge with reality,” ClearView Energy Partners managing director Kevin Book told CNBC, affirming that cheating on the deal was “inevitable”. 
“Historically OPEC always blows past its targets,"" he added.
U.S. shale producers likely to cap upside on oil prices
Meanwhile, indications of increased drilling activity in the U.S. remained in focus. Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. during the previous week increased by 2 to 525, the ninth straight weekly rise and a level not seen in almost a year.
Some analysts have warned that the recent rally in prices could be self-defeating, as it encourages U.S. shale producers to drill more, adding to concerns over a global supply glut.
“As higher prices kick in, shale production would likely quickly ramp up, effectively capping oil prices above $60,"" analysts at Standard & Poor’s explained. Ellen R. Wald, Ph.D., expert on the global energy industry, believes that oil prizes will stabilize in 2017, as OPEC “is once again saying the right things and working towards cooperation to limit production and raise prices.”
“The OPEC production cuts may never be implemented fully and likely will not last for too long, and further hurdles remain to bringing the full range of non-OPEC producers on board, but the movement is now clearly in the direction of combined production limits,” she explained."

1287,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 01, 2017 02:25PM ET</span>",Gold / Silver / Copper futures - weekly outlook: January 2 - 6,"Investing.com - Gold prices slid on Friday as investors took profits at the end of a year which saw bullion prices rise around 9%, snapping three years of declines.
Gold for February delivery settled down 0.53% at $1,152.00 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices were up around 9.8% for the year.
Gold prices soared in the first half of 2016 as the Federal Reserve remained cautious on raising interest rates and prices of the precious metal hit a two-year peak in July as Britain’s vote to exit the European Union spurred a flight to safety.
But gold prices fell almost 8% in November amid rising U.S. bond yields and a rally in stock markets on the back of expectations for ramped up fiscal spending under the incoming Trump administration.
Gold prices tumbled to 10-month lows on December 15 after the Fed hiked interest rates and signaled that it expects to raise rates more quickly than previously anticipated in 2017.
Higher rates boost the dollar by making the currency more attractive to yield-seeking investors.
Both a strong dollar and higher interest rates are typically bearish for gold, which is denominated in dollars and struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when borrowing costs rise.
Elsewhere in precious metals trading, silver was down 1.57% at $15.96 a troy ounce late Friday, but ended the year with gains of around 15%, the biggest annual increase since 2010.
Copper was up 0.76% at $2.5 a pound and ended the year up around 19%.
Palladium ended at $680.32 an ounce and rose more than 29% for the year, making it the best annual performer.

(Reuters) - Oil prices settled slightly lower on Friday, the year's last trading day, but attained their biggest annual gain since 2009, after OPEC and partners agreed to cut output to reduce a supply overhang that has depressed prices for two years. 
A two-rig rise in the oil rig count in the United States, the ninth weekly increase in a row, as reported by oilfield services provider  Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI), added to bearish sentiments. 
But the total count of 525 for the week, the last for the year, was still below last year's level by 11 rigs. 
U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (CLc1) crude futures were down 5 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $53.72 a barrel, while Brent (LCOc1) fell 3 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $56.82.
""Some profit-taking ... very light trading - a lot of people have already done what they needed to do for the year."" said Elaine Levin, president of Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington.
Brent rose 52 percent this year and WTI climbed around 45 percent, the largest annual gains since 2009, when the benchmarks rose 78 percent and 71 percent respectively.
Oil prices have slumped since the summer of 2014 from above $100 a barrel. The price rout, due to an oversupply thanks in part to the U.S. shale oil revolution, was accentuated later that year when Saudi Arabia rejected any deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut output and instead fought for market share. 
But a historic OPEC agreement struck over three months from September that will reduce production from Jan. 1, marked a return to the 13-country group's old objective of defending prices.
Oman told some customers it will reduce term allocations by 5 percent in March, but did not say whether the supply reduction would continue after that.
The rise in prices can be seen as ""proof of international credibility,"" for OPEC and partners, said Igor Yusufov, founder of the Fund Energy investment firm and a former Russian energy minister. 
He said the rise, a ""ponderable New Yew present"" for producers, is propelled by expectations of expectations of oil demand growth.
Analysts at JBC said major forecasters diverge on their specific predictions.

1292,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2016 05:50AM ET</span>","Oil, metals post stellar 2016 gains on output cuts, demand hopes","By Naveen Thukral and Mark Tay
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Crude oil, rubber and metals were set to end 2016 on Friday with strong gains, bouncing back from several years of losses on the back of output cuts and expectations of firmer demand.
Benchmark zinc , steel rebar  and rubber  have all rallied around 60 percent this year, while Brent crude (LCOc1) has climbed more than 50 percent.
Crude oil output cuts announced by OPEC, stronger-than-expected demand in top commodities market China and expectations of higher infrastructure spending in the United States after the victory of Republican candidate Donald Trump all boosted prices.
Looking forward, oil prices should gradually rise towards $60 a barrel by end-2017, a Reuters survey found, but gains will be capped by a strong dollar, more U.S. oil exports and the possibility that some OPEC members won't meet their agreed cuts.
""Accelerating non-OPEC (production) declines and OPEC's decision to cut were key to the price rise in 2016,"" Energy Aspects analyst Nevyn Nah said, while robust demand growth also helped support prices. 
""But the rebalancing process is still in its infancy and speculators want to position for that,"" he added.
Benchmark TOCOM rubber futures were on track for their biggest gain since 2009, mainly driven higher by the rally in crude oil and fund buying.
In the base metals market, copper  remains on course for a gain of about 17 percent - the first annual rise since 2012.
Prices for steel rebar, used in construction, have soared more than 60 percent this year on better-than-expected spending on building and infrastructure and soaring costs for coking coal due to government-enforced coal mine closures.
""I expect the steel price rally to continue in the first half of 2017 when stock pilling will be at a final phase and infrastructure construction programs will start,"" said Zhou Guangyan, steel analyst at Zhongcai Futures.
However, demand was likely to wane in the second half, with inventory at a new peak and the market feeling the effects of real estate regulations and potentially tighter monetary policy in China, he added.
Zinc, which is used in steel production, climbed to a nine-year peak last month with support from a series of mine closures that have tightened ore supply, fuelling a speculative rally.
For precious metals, gold is up more than nine percent this year, snapping three years of losses as the market was lifted by a demand surge during periods of economic and political uncertainty.
However, gold's outlook for 2017 is bearish as the outlook for a rising U.S. dollar and higher interest rates, combined with strong equity markets, will dampen demand for non-interest-paying bullion.
Agricultural markets were some of the worst performers in 2016, with Chicago wheat  poised to post an annual losses of more than 13 percent due to all-time high global production.
Cocoa (CCc1) has given up almost 33 percent in its worst year since 1999 as the prospect of a global surplus kept the market on the defensive.

Palm oil <1FCPOc3> and soybeans  were exceptions though. Palm oil has added almost a quarter to its value after dry weather curbed output while beans are up 17 percent.

Crude oil for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained 22 cents, or around 0.4%, to $53.99 a barrel by 4:14AM ET (8:14GMT), after falling 29 cents, or 0.5%, a day earlier.
Elsewhere, Brent oil for March delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rose 29 cents, or 0.5%, to $57.14 a barrel, after the prior session's loss of 8 cents, or 0.14%.
London-traded Brent futures touched a 17-month high of $57.89 earlier this month, amid optimism over planned output cuts by major global oil producers.
Continued profit-taking in the U.S. dollar on Friday also helped support prices. The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was down 0.18% at 102.48 by 3:44AM ET (9:44GMT), pulling back from a peak of 103.62 reached on December 20.
A weaker dollar boosts crude as it becomes cheaper for traders purchasing with other currencies.
Oil prices are on track for their biggest annual percentage gain since 2009 on the back of an agreement struck between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC countries to cut crude production.
OPEC and other producers led by Russia have announced cutbacks of almost 1.8 million barrels per day in oil output starting from January 1, 2017 in an effort to bolster prices and support the market.
Meanwhile, the members of an OPEC and non-OPEC committee formed to monitor the market may meet on January 21-22, according to Kuwaiti oil minister Essam Al-Marzouq, which may give an early indication of compliance with the deal.
Oil prices will gradually rise towards $60 per barrel by the end of 2017, a Reuters’ poll showed on Thursday, with further upside capped by a strong dollar, a likely recovery in U.S. oil output and possible non-compliance by OPEC with agreed cuts.
Investors were also looking ahead to Baker Hughes' rig count data.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that natural gas storage in the U.S. declined by a whopping 237 billion cubic feet in the week ended December 23, exceeding market expectations for a drop of 222 billion cubic feet.
It was the biggest withdrawal for the week since at least 1994.
That compared with a withdrawal of 209 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 58 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 80 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.360 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, almost 11.0% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 2.3% below the five-year average for this time of year.
The amount of gas in storage fell below the weekly five-year average for the first time since May 2015.
Meanwhile, updated weather forecasting models predicted that portions of the West and northern U.S. will be hit with rain, snow and slightly cool temperatures over the next few days.
Looking ahead, Artic air is expected into the West and then spreading south and east in the first week of January, boosting demand expectations for the heating fuel.
Natural gas prices typically rise during the winter as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand. About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Thursday after a surprise increase in U.S. inventories helped stall an upward trend that has pushed global crude benchmarks to their highest levels since July last year.
U.S. light, sweet crude was down 16 cents at $53.90 by 10:21 a.m. ET (1521 GMT) while North Sea Brent crude was up 12 cents at $56.34 a barrel.
Traded volumes were thin with many investors away for year-end holidays, although the expiry of the front-month February ICE Brent contract on Thursday could generate some activity. U.S. distillate and gasoline futures expire on Friday, which could add to price swings as well, analysts noted.
""The petroleum markets are mixed in light-volume trade amid a general wait for fresh fundamental news that might push prices out of their established ranges,"" Tim Evans, an energy futures specialist at Citi Futures, said in a note. 
Both crude oil benchmarks have made big gains this month since OPEC and other producers agreed to curb production in an attempt to balance an over-supplied fuel market. 
""The market is in good shape although it might fail to make significant advances this year,"" said analyst Tamas Varga at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates. ""If that is the case the uptrend should continue in early January.""
""Either way, the odds are still on higher numbers.""
The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its closely watched weekly inventory data at 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) on Thursday. The data had been postponed for a day due to the federal holiday on Monday.

Analysts polled by Reuters before the report had forecast on average that inventories would decline by 2.1 million barrels. 
But the overall trend appeared to be upwards with oil producers committed to agreed output cuts.

1304,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2016 02:00AM ET</span>",U.S. refiners face severe labor shortage for deferred maintenance,"By Jarrett Renshaw
(Reuters) - After years of running flat out, U.S. Gulf Coast refiners are lining up repairs to plants in 2017 - but facing a severe labor shortage that could delay work, drive up costs and raise accident risks. 
Fuel producers such as Marathon Petroleum Corp (N:MPC) and  Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO) have delayed routine work in the past 24 months amid high margins. Those margins collapsed this year in a global fuel supply glut, providing an incentive for refiners to undertake the shutdowns necessary for maintenance. 
But refiners are now competing for pipe fitters and ironworkers with a host of billion-dollar energy projects, including Cheniere Energy's (A:LNG) liquefied natural gas export terminals and a new petrochemical unit for  Dow Chemical  (N:DOW).
Without undertaking the work they need, refineries run the risk of more unscheduled outages at plants. Plant shutdowns can disrupt fuel supplies and are closely tracked by oil traders because they directly affect demand for crude and supply of fuel.
""Putting off work definitely affects the safety of the refinery,"" said Ed Lee, an independent refinery safety consultant who worked at Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) for three decades. 
Refiners can mitigate the risks - but at a cost, by slowing output or avoiding types of crude that are difficult to process, Less said. 
In recent months, a spate of unexpected outages have hit refineries nationwide, taking hundreds of thousands of barrels off the market and boosting gasoline prices and margins. 
U.S. refiners are expected to spend $1.26 billion on planned maintenance next year, up 38 percent from this year and the highest level since at least 2010, according to Industrial Information Resources (IIR), which tracks labor supply for refiners and other industrial companies.
Many will struggle to execute those plans, said Anthony Salemme, a vice president at IIR.
""Refiners are going to have trouble finding even the lowest skilled workers, such as scaffold builders, and you can't do work at a refinery without a scaffold,"" Salemme said. ""That's going to complicate scheduling and even extend outages.""
FEW WORKERS, MANY PROJECTS
IIR estimates that the coastal region from Brownsville, Texas to New Orleans - the largest U.S. refining region - will be short roughly 37,400 craftsman needed to complete all of the planned capital projects in 2017.
""We are definitely feeling the labor shortages in skilled craft labor,"" said Paul Tooze, construction manager for the oil, gas and chemicals business at Bechtel, one of the world's largest industrial contractors.
Tooze said the company spends a lot of time and money to attract and retain employees, but still has to bring in workers from other regions to complete projects. That typically requires $100-per-day travel allowances that drive up project costs.
Bechtel employs between 40 percent and 70 percent workers requiring daily allowances on their Gulf Coast projects, Tooze said.
The shortage will be most acute in Lake Charles, Louisiana, the home to several refineries and petrochemical plants. There, South African energy firm Sasol (J:SOLJ) is investing billions on a chemical project, and the call on labor for the plant is one of the reasons the area will be short more than 18,000 workers in 2017, according to IIR.
Sasol raised its cost estimate on the project in August by 25 percent to $11 billion, in part due to rising labor costs.
 Chevron  Phillips – the joint venture between Chevron (N:CVX) and Phillips 66 (N:PSX) – is spending $6 billion on building a petrochemical units in Baytown and Old Ocean in Texas. Labor costs would drive the projects' costs up 10 percent from previous expectations, Phillips 66 President Tim Taylor said in an earnings call earlier this month.
Fluor (N:FLR), one of the world's largest industrial contractors, took a $154 million charge on the plant in November due to cost overruns, including labor. 
Earlier this year, Fluor opened a skilled craft training center in the Gulf Coast, stating that while the firm could not train its way out of the shortage, it hope to alleviate the problem.
COMPETITION FROM MANUFACTURERS
Refiners are also competing for workers with a broader range of power companies, pharmaceutical firms and industrial manufacturers nationwide, which are also preparing for a spike in maintenance projects in 2017, according to IIR.
In the southwest region that includes Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas, IIR counted 952 planned projects among the various groups it tracks, the most since at least 2010 and a 24 percent increase from this year.
A recent survey conducted by the Associated General Contractors of America found that 74 percent of Texas contractors are having trouble filling hourly craft worker positions, and a majority of them believed they would continue to struggle over the next year. 
More than 60 percent of the respondents said they bumped up salaries to attract more skilled craft workers. 

""These shortages have the potential to undermine broader economic growth by forcing contractors to slow scheduled work or choose not to bid on projects, thereby inflating the cost of construction,"" said Stephen Sandherr, head of the Associated General Contractors.

1306,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2016 08:05PM ET</span>",U.S. shale companies to boost spending as banks loosen purse strings,"By Swetha Gopinath
(Reuters) - U.S. shale drillers are set to ramp up spending on exploration and production next year as recovering oil prices prompt banks to extend credit lines for the first time in two years.
The credit increase is small, but with major oil producers worldwide aiming to hold down production in 2017, U.S.-based shale drillers are looking to boost market share to take advantage of higher prices, and greater availability of capital will make that easier.
North America-focused oil and gas producers are expected to increase capital investments by 30 percent in 2017, according to analysts at Raymond James.
A number of shale producers including  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co (N:PXD),  Diamondback Energy Inc  (O:FANG) and RSP Permian Inc (N:RSPP) have forecast bigger budgets and increased output for next year. 
Every six months, oil and gas producers negotiate credit with banks based on the value of reserves in the ground. Through the latest round of talks in the fall, 34 companies had their available credit lines raised an average of about 5 percent, or more than $1.3 billion, according to data compiled by Reuters.
The combined bank credit for the companies stood at $30.3 billion, compared with $28.9 billion at the end of spring 2016.
The industry's available credit had been cut by 40 percent over the past three reviews as it contended with a two-year price rout.
""The 'animal spirits,' seem to be coming back to the exploration and production market, albeit slowly,"" said Reorg Research analyst Kyle Owusu, referring to the human emotion that drives confidence. 
Of the 34 companies, 12 saw increases of 5 to 90 percent, while 10 companies had their borrowing bases cut in the latest round, and 12 companies' credit limits were left unchanged. 
In addition to the increased borrowing base, lenders have extended maturities on loans.
Oil prices have risen by more than 45 percent this year, increasing the value of oil and gas reserves against which loans are decided. And a number of companies have seen their eligible proved reserves rise, in part due to acquisitions.
Overall U.S. crude oil production is forecast to fall to 8.8 million barrels per day in 2017 from 8.9 million bpd this year, according to the U.S. Energy Department. But shale output could increase from 200,000 to 500,000 bpd in the coming year, analysts said.
Shale companies generally use revolving credit to finance day-to-day operations. But with tight credit over the past two years, they have relied on asset sales and stock issuance to fund routine operations, leaving less money for exploration and production.
With borrowing bases raised, companies do not have to turn to capital markets to finance routine operations.
They are expanding reserves with acreage purchases, particularly in prolific fields such as the Permian Basin in Texas. That in turn helps them negotiate higher borrowing bases with their lenders.
 Rice Energy  Inc's (N:RICE) borrowing base was increased to $1.45 billion from $1 billion last week after the company added to its reserves through the $2.7 billion purchase of Vantage Energy Inc (N:VEI). 
With expanded credit lines, companies can fund acquisitions and new exploration. Diamondback's borrowing base rose to $1 billion from $700 billion. Its Viper Energy Partners LP (O:VNOM) unit had its credit limit boosted to $275 million from $175 million. 
""I think we (will) continue to use that borrowing base as a way to fund acquisitions,"" Kaes Van't Hof, a Diamondback executive, said on a November earnings call.
Some companies are going another route, selling more shares. Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc (O:CRZO) kept its current credit line at $600 million and sold $225 million in stock in October to fund more land purchases.
Other companies are struggling to make up for so-called borrowing base ""deficiencies,"" which arise when their outstanding loans exceed its borrowing base.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats on the U.S. Senate's environment panel on Wednesday asked President-elect Donald Trump's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency to disclose his ties to the energy industry ahead of his confirmation hearing early next year.
The six senators sent a letter to Scott Pruitt, who as Oklahoma Attorney General led several lawsuits against the Obama administration's EPA to block its environmental rules. They asked him to list his connections to energy companies, to weigh whether these will influence his ability to run the agency. 
""What that conduct says about your ability to lead EPA in a manner that is not beholden to special or secret interests is a subject that we expect will receive a full airing during your confirmation hearing,"" the senators wrote in the letter.
The senators raised concerns about a 2014 New York Times report, which found that Pruitt's policy positions as Oklahoma's top attorney reflected his close ties to  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN).
For his part, Pruitt told The Oklahoman newspaper that Devon Energy was a constituent he represents and the company made people aware of regulatory overreach on fracking.
The senators also noted Pruitt's involvement with the Rule of Law Defense Fund, which they said supports initiatives by the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, who have opposed the EPA's climate change regulations.
They asked Pruitt to submit details about his connections and contributions to the fund, his communications with the fund and a ""list of all federal and state legislation or regulations the Fund has taken a position on.""
""The confirmation process, starting with your responses to Committee questions before your hearing, is an opportunity for you to dispel the notion that the advocacy you have undertaken on environmental issues as Attorney General of Oklahoma has been directed by and for the benefit of the energy industry,"" the senators wrote.
The senators who sent the letter are Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse, former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Oregon's Jeff Merkley, New Jersey's Cory Booker, Massachusetts' Ed Markey and Maryland's Ben Cardin.
Rule of Law Defense Fund spokesman Jordan Russell accused the Democratic senators of launching ""politically motivated attacks"" against his organization, which takes positions on issues from healthcare to federalism. He said donor confidentiality has been upheld by the Supreme Court.

“It is unfortunate that certain Democrat Senators appear willing to trample First Amendment rights in order to score cheap political points,"" he said.

Natural gas for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange dipped 3.5 cents, or 0.93%, to $3.739 per million British thermal units by 9:40AM ET (14:40GMT).
Prices rallied by around 20.0 cents, or 6%, over the past two trading sessions amid colder forecasts for January.
Trading volumes are expected to remain light this week due to the holiday period as many investors already closed books before the end of the year, reducing liquidity in the market, which could exaggerate market moves.
Market participants awaited weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 220 and 233 billion cubic feet in the week ended December 23.
If correct, that would be the biggest draw for the week since at least 1994.
That compares with a withdrawal of 209 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 58 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 80 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.597 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 5.9% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 2.1% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts forecast the amount of gas in storage would fall below weekly five-year averages by year-end for the first time since May 2015.
Meanwhile, updated weather forecasting models predicted that portions of the West and northern U.S. will be hit with rain, snow and slightly cool temperatures over the next few days.
Looking ahead, Artic air is expected into the West and then spreading south and east in the first week of January, boosting demand expectations for the heating fuel.
Natural gas prices typically rise during the winter as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand. About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.

Trading is expected to remain thin this week ahead of the New Year holiday. 
The market is taking a wait-and-see approach to the official start of the landmark deal reached by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and several non-OPEC members to reduce their output. The deal is set to kick in from Jan. 1. 
OPEC and non-OPEC producers are expected to lower production by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd), with Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, agreeing to bear the lion's share of the cuts.
Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi said on Wednesday his country, which has seen fast production growth in the past two years, would cut supply by 200,000-210,000 bpd from January.
Luaibi said on a visit to fellow OPEC member Kuwait that he saw oil prices rising to $60 per barrel as the cuts would help ease the global glut of the past three years, according to Kuwait News Agency (KUNA).
""There are mixed expectations of the cuts, trading is thin so the first two weeks of January would be critical to watch,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at Sydney's CMC Markets. 
""If there's any misstep or any indication of disagreement to (the deal), we would see crude prices dropping,"" he said. 
Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh also said on Tuesday he expected OPEC to abide by the deal. ""While competing, we do have engagement,"" Iranian news agency Shana quoted him as saying.
OPEC member Venezuela also said it will cut 95,000 bpd of oil production in the new year.

Russian oil producer Gazprom Neft (MM:SIBN) said it planned to boost oil output by 4.5 percent to 5 percent next year, less than it had intended before Russia, one of the non-OPEC member countries, joined a deal to cut supply.

Natural gas prices surged to more than $3.70 per million Btu (MMBtu) in recent weeks, and also increased the share price of leading drillers, companies which had lost the confidence of investors.
Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK), one of the nation's largest natural gas producers, has seen its per share price climb by more than 300% this year, and up by more than a third in just the past few months.
As gas prices continue to rise, analysts say, so will the company's share price.
Natural gas drillers are adding new rigs to their gas fields, analysts said. 
These drilling companies are expanding at a number of gas formations, including the Marcellus and Utica Shales sites in Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as the Haynesville Shale site in Louisiana. The gas rig count is now up to 129, up more than 30% in recent weeks. 
Most interestingly, analysts said, coal production may also increase in the short-term, in early 2017, if natural gas suppliers are not able to meet market demand. 
The market developments mirror the industrial policy prescriptions of President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has called for increased natural gas production as a way to reduce overall energy costs for U.S. consumers and reduce harmful emissions. 
Cheap natural gas is the primary reason for the decline of the U.S. coal industry, but Trump wants to bolster the industry's prospects by promoting ""clean coal"" technology, as he said on the campaign trail this past year. 
Clean coal is a broad term that includes processes or techniques that mitigate emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases that arise from the use of coal, mainly for electrical power generation. This includes carbon capture technology which isolates emissions, and stores them underground. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), the investment bank, has reported that an investment in clean coal technology of $15 billion, globally, would be transformative for the industry and the environment. "

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela said on Tuesday it will cut 95,000 barrels per day of oil production in the New Year in fulfillment of a producers' deal to reduce global output and strengthen prices. 
Jan. 1 marks the start of the pact by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and several non-OPEC producers to lower production by almost 1.8 million bpd.
""Without prejudicing its international contractual obligations, from Jan. 1 2017, (state oil company) PDVSA and/or its subsidiaries will implement a reduction in the volumes of its main crude sale contracts, all in conformity with existing terms and conditions,"" the Energy Ministry said.
Venezuela, a price hawk within OPEC and one of the nations worst affected by a fall in crude revenue since mid-2014, currently produces just over 2.4 million barrels of crude and condensates per day, according to ministry data.
Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino said the output deal should lead to a re-balancing of inventories, after which he forecast Brent crude would settle at a price range of around $60-$70 a barrel and Venezuela's crude basket between $45-$55 a barrel. 
Venezuela's basket trades at a discount to other benchmarks because of its higher content of heavy oil.
President Nicolas Maduro has said he will soon embark on a tour of oil-producing nations to support the OPEC deal. 
""I am proposing a new system, a new formula to fix markets and oil prices to enable stability, harmony, continuity,"" he said on Monday, without giving further details of his itinerary or planned proposal to fellow producers.
""I aspire to at least 10 years of stability with realistic, fair prices of oil, and I am going to achieve it.""

In a statement, the finance ministry said the widely used Magna gasoline brand will rise 14.2 percent and will sell at an average price of 15.99 pesos (78 cents) per liter at retail, while Premium fuel will go up 20.1 percent to an average of 17.79 pesos per liter.
Diesel will rise 16.5 percent, with an average price of 17.05 pesos per liter.
The ministry's price ceilings will be in effect through Feb. 3. After that, the maximum price will be set bi-weekly, until Feb. 18, when it will be set daily.
""It's an important change,"" Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said in a local radio interview. ""It's a change that will allow prices to reflect costs, and avoid artificial distortions.""
Analysts said the liberalization program was likely to have an impact on inflation, which has already passed the central bank's 3 percent target due to a sharp peso depreciation. 
""This is a positive in the long term, but even so, in the very short term, clearly these (price) rises ... will result in inflationary pressures for consumers throughout 2017, and we'll see a deceleration of internal demand,"" said Alejandro Cervantes, an economist at bank Banorte. 
Earlier this month, the energy regulatory commission said a staggered fuel price liberalization will begin at the end of March and extend through the rest of 2017.
The move will phase out government-set gasoline prices, a practice that has prevailed in Mexico for decades, and replace them with market prices.
The change is one of the most tangible parts of a landmark energy reform program in Mexico, which in 2013 ended the 75-year monopoly of state oil company Pemex over nearly all facets of the sector, from crude production to retail fuel sales.
In April, Mexico allowed private companies to import fuels for the first time, nine months ahead of what the energy reform program originally stipulated.
The reforms also paved the way for private companies to establish their own non-Pemex branded gas stations for the first time since the 1930s. That began earlier this year.

Gasoline prices in Mexico are higher than in the United States, where market prices prevail, and Pemex loses about $3 billion a year importing gasoline into Mexico, according to Nomura analyst Benito Berber.

It was last at $3.740 by 9:15AM ET (14:15GMT), up 6.2 cents, or 1.7%.
The natural gas market was closed on Monday due to the Christmas holiday.
Futures rallied after updated weather forecasting models predicted that portions of the West and northern U.S. will be hit with rain, snow and slightly cool temperatures over the next few days.
Looking ahead, Artic air is expected into the West and then spreading south and east in the first week of January, boosting demand expectations for the heating fuel.
Natural gas prices typically rise during the winter as colder weather sparks indoor-heating demand. About half of U.S. homes use natural gas for heating.
Meanwhile, market participants looked ahead to weekly storage data due on Thursday, which is expected to show a draw in a range between 220 and 233 billion cubic feet in the week ended December 23. If correct, that would be the biggest draw for the week since at least 1994.
That compares with a withdrawal of 209 billion cubic feet in the preceding week, 58 billion a year earlier and a five-year average drop of 80 billion cubic feet.
Total natural gas in storage currently stands at 3.597 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 5.9% lower than levels at this time a year ago and 2.1% above the five-year average for this time of year.
Analysts forecast the amount of gas in storage would fall below weekly five-year averages by year-end for the first time since May 2015.

Crimea has no land border with Russia, and Moscow has struggled to meet its energy needs, which were previously met by Ukraine. 
Putin, who watched the launch of the pipeline via a video link, said: ""It is another very important solution for the long-term development of Crimea.""

Moscow is also building a road and rail bridge to the peninsula and this year completed an electricity link. Crimea had suffered sporadic blackouts after unidentified individuals blew up power cables from Ukraine in November last year.

Gold for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose by as much as 1.6% to a session peak of $1,151.70 a troy ounce, a level not seen since December 14.
It was last at $1,144.15 by 7:15AM ET (12:15GMT), up $10.55, or 0.93%. Prices of the yellow metal sank to an 11-month low of $1,124.30 earlier in December.
The precious metals market was closed on Monday due to the Christmas holiday.
Trading volumes are expected to remain light due to the holiday period as many traders already closed books before the end of the year, reducing liquidity in the market and increasing the volatility.
Gold futures are on a seven-week losing streak, the longest down stretch in more than 12 years.
Prices of the yellow metal have fallen sharply since Donald Trump was elected president as a soaring U.S. dollar, rising Treasury yields and a record-breaking rally on Wall Street have damped its appeal.
Market analysts warned that the outlook for gold remains cloudy in the near-term, given expectations for higher U.S. interest rates in the months ahead.
The Fed hiked interest rates for the first time in a year earlier this month and projected three more increases in 2017.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
Both a strong dollar and higher interest rates are typically bearish for gold, which is denominated in dollars and struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when borrowing costs rise.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for March delivery jumped 26.8 cents, or 1.7%, to $16.02 a troy ounce during morning hours in New York, rebounding from last week's eight-month low of $15.67.
Meanwhile, platinum rallied 1.5% to $908.25 and palladium added 1.2% to $662.62 an ounce.

1327,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2016 06:20AM ET</span>",Global diamond business roiled as cash crunch hits Indian stone cutting,"By Rajendra Jadhav and Susan Taylor
SURAT, India/TORONTO (Reuters) - The global diamond industry is facing disruption that could stretch through the first few months of next year, including Valentine's Day in February, as a result of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's radical move to abolish most of the nation's cash overnight.
In the western Indian city of Surat craftsmen usually spend 10-12 hours a day in small mills or grimy sheds cutting and polishing 80 percent of the world's diamonds but the business is based on cash and the demonetization of the high-value banknotes from Nov. 8 has prevented many from operating. Thousands of diamond brokers in the area's narrow lanes are also doing little business.
The lack of cash is not the only problem for an industry that employs 1 million people in India, most of them in this city. Modi's shock treatment is intended to make it much more difficult for those laundering ill-gotten gains or evading taxes, and that means diamond buyers are demanding proof of tax payments that are often not available, the traders said.
Top diamond miners, such as Anglo American-owned (L:AAL) De Beers and smaller Canadian producers such as Stornoway Diamond (TO:SWY) and Dominion Diamond (TO:DDC) are seeing weaker demand and prices for cheaper stones used in lower-priced jewelry.
The picture for retailers and consumers of diamonds is less clear. The cash crunch has also badly hurt consumer demand for diamond jewelry in India, the world's third-biggest market. 
That means there are more of the cheaper finished stones to export, helping to create a temporary glut and lower prices at wholesaler and store level. However, that may not last if the cutters and polishers of India can't get back to work soon.
But the luxury buyer doesn't have to worry. Much of the higher-value jewelry business, with the highest grade one-carat stones usually costing more than $14,500, is protected because cutting and polishing is also done in Israel, Belgium and by bigger Indian companies that rely on bank transactions.
""The knock-on effect of Indian demonetizations has meant a reduction in the prices of lower quality diamonds,"" said Tobias Kormind, managing director of 77 Diamonds, an online jewelry retailer based in London. ""As a result, we've seen an increase in demand for those kinds of diamonds as our clients have snapped up these favorable deals.""
In India, jewelry demand typically climbs in the winter months' wedding season. But this year sales are plunging as nearly two-thirds of jewelry is usually purchased with cash, which is in short-supply.
Ishu Datwani, owner of Mumbai-based Anmol Jewellers, says his sales are down nearly 70 percent since the government scrapped the high-value notes.
The demand is unlikely to revive any time soon as India struggles to dispense enough new notes, industry officials say. 
""During the cash crunch, diamonds are one of the last things people want to buy. At least for the next six months demand will remain weak,"" says Praveenshankar Pandya, head of India's Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC).
The crisis hit at a time when there were plenty of stones in the retail pipeline or being processed. India's rough diamond imports between April and November jumped 30.5 percent, while exports of cut and polished diamonds during the period rose 12.2 percent, GJEPC data shows.
Diamond processors bought rough diamonds aggressively, expecting a jump in exports and rising Indian demand, but now they are struggling, said trader Dharmesh Navadiya.
In trading hubs like Hong Kong, many retailers are stuck holding diamonds they bought three years back at higher prices expecting robust demand from China that didn't materialize.
""There has been no supply crunch as the market is already flooded, especially the low carat diamond,"" said Jonathan Rotbart, a distributor of gems in Hong Kong.
""SHOCK TO THE MARKET""
""The market is frozen. We don't have cash to buy diamonds,"" said Kalpesh Savaliya, a trader for 25 years who was sitting cross-legged on a mattress behind a low wooden desk in Surat.
As small operators close, India's rough diamond imports could decline by up to 25 percent between December and March, said Mehul Choksi, chairman of  Gitanjali Gems  (NS:GTGM), India's biggest diamond jeweller.
Miners are already feeling the pain with some lower-quality stones being discounted by more than 25 percent from prices before demonetization, said Panmure Gordon analyst Kieron Hodgson, in a recent note to clients.
In its final 2016 tender, De Beers said sales were affected by a slowdown in lower-value rough stones, a trend Hodgson expects to see repeated for at least the next three months.
Dominion Diamond, with stakes in two Canadian mines, expects its sales in its fourth quarter ending Jan. 31 will be hurt by the Indian cash crisis, and sees weaker demand for small stones extending to its fiscal first quarter. Demonetization was a ""shock to the market,"" said Chief Executive Brendan Bell.
Stornoway, which this year finished building Quebec's first diamond mine, withdrew smaller, lower-quality stones from its first-ever tender in November due to poor demand and prices. 
But  Mountain Province Diamonds  (TO:MPV), which owns 49 percent of Canada's newest diamond mine, Gahcho Kue, indicated it isn't overly worried. ""Small diamonds are roughly 80 percent of your production and 20 percent of your revenue – and the demand for the large diamonds remains robust,"" said CEO Patrick Evans.

""The diamond market is fine. Average prices are up 7 to 9 percent this year, but small diamonds are down about 50 percent.""

The revival of the Libyan oil sector began earlier this year, after a disastrous four years of civil war and terrorist attacks following the fall of dictator Muammar Gaddafi.
Analysts indicate General Khalifa Haftar’s emergence as a power in Libya has seen the petrostate remake its role in international oil politics by grabbing an exemption to the production freeze orchestrated by OPEC last month.
The latest forecasts place national production at 900,000 barrels per day in Libya during the next couple of months.
That's a more than 30% increase on the 600,000-barrel rate the country is currently pumping.
Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) has been fighting off small-scale revolts.
The U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) governs the western half of Libya, from Tripoli.
Under the influence of the new administration, the faction of the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) that oversees major pipelines fed by the Al-Feel field has lift a two-year blockade on the transmission of oil.
This could add more than 400,000 barrels per day to Libya’s oil production, and according to Khalid Shakshak, the head of the Libyan Oil Audit Bureau.
Reopening that particular pipeline would resolve 70% of Libya’s economic problems, he said in an interview with the trade press.

In its medium-term coal market study for 2016, IEA demonstrates that global coal demand growth has slipped after more than a decade of 4% annual growth.
Demand this year is expected to be below 2013 levels, as consumption contracted for the first time in 2015 and reduced demand in the U.S. and China was not made up by increased growth in other markets.
China reported a coal use decline in all consuming sectors, including, but not limited to electricity, steel and cement-making.
Coal generation dropped due to a stagnant 0.5% electricity demand growth powered by the country’s energy diversification policy.
That policy expanded growth in hydro, nuclear, wind, solar, and natural gas power generation throughout the middle kingdom.
Coal consumption in the U.S. dropped due to low natural gas prices and coal plant retirements pushed by the Mercury Air Toxics Standards (MATS), the Obama administration's interpretation of federal air quality law.
During this past year, U.S. coal consumption declined 15%, the largest annual decline in recorded industry history.
Coal was an issue in the recent presidential election, with Donald Trump, now the president-elect, promising to help renew the coal industry's fortunes."

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2016 09:50AM ET</span>",Chinese firms face competition to maintain role in developing Iranian oilfields,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran plans to ask international oil companies to bid for the second phase of development of its Yadavaran and North Azadegan oilfields, a senior official said on Saturday.
That means Chinese firms China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) [CNPET.UL] and Sinopec (HK:0386), which have played a leading role in developing the fields until now, will have to compete with other firms if they want to maintain that position.
""CNPC would like to extend its North Azadegan contract, but we have announced that ...they should take part in the bidding for a new contract,"" Gholamreza Manouchehri, deputy head of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.
""The Chinese have finally accepted this proposal,"" Manouchehri said.
He gave no details on the timing of the tender.
President Hassan Rouhani officially launched the first phases of the Yadavaran and North Azadegan fields as well as the North Yaran field in November, as the country ramps up its production after the lifting of sanctions.
Yadavaran will have a production of up to 115,000 bpd in its first phase and North Azadegan's output is 75,000 bpd, the Iranian oil ministry's news agency SHANA said.
The Chinese firms helped Iran develop the fields after Japanese and European companies pulled out of the country due to sanctions over Iran's nuclear program.
Iran said in December 2007 that Sinopec would invest around $2 billion to develop the huge Yadavaran oil field.
CNPC signed a deal with Iran in January 2009 to develop the North Azadegan oilfield, a project also worth $2 billion in its first phase.
In April 2014, however, Iranian news agency SHANA reported that Iran had terminated CNPC's contract to develop the Azadegan field after the Chinese energy giant ignored repeated appeals to work on it.
While the Chinese companies took part in the first phase of development of the fields, there had been ""some criticism of their performance,"" IRNA said on Saturday, without elaborating.
""There have also been talks with Sinopec regarding the Yadavaran field for which an international tender is set to be held,"" Manouchehri said, according to the IRNA report.
Yadavaran has reserves of 31 billion barrels of light and heavy crude oil while North Azadegan has 5.7 billion barrels of crude reserves.
Separately, the head of a regional state oil firm in central Iran said 20 tenders would be held to develop new gas and oil fields and boost production at existing ones, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported.

Salbali Karimi, chief executive of the Iranian Central Oil Fields Company, said the projects would require $2 billion in investment to boost crude output by 100,000 barrels per day.

1334,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2016 05:30AM ET</span>",Russia's Rosneft says has flexibility on oil output levels,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Rosneft's (MM:ROSN) plans for next year allow it to be flexible with production volumes, Russia's top oil producer said on Saturday, after Moscow clinched a deal with OPEC to cut production to bolster weak oil prices.
State-controlled Rosneft, which accounts for over 40 percent of Russian oil production, said its board has looked into plans for 2017-2018. 
""The plan is formed on the basis of actual long-term development program and takes into account changes in Russia's fiscal law and a possibility of carrying out a maneuver with the production volumes in order to boost sales efficiency in the first half 2017,"" the company said in a statement.
It did not mention the OPEC agreement and a spokesman declined to elaborate on the statement.
OPEC and non-OPEC producers, including Russia, reached their first deal on Dec. 10 since 2001 to curtail oil output and ease a global glut after more than two years of low prices.
Russia, in line with the OPEC deal, will cut its oil output by 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) by the end of the first quarter. The decline will amount to 300,000 bpd thereafter from the level of 11.247 million bpd reached last October.
Rosneft's Chief Executive Igor Sechin, a powerful ally of President Vladimir Putin, has been a staunch opponent of OPEC, saying that the group has lost its sway over global oil markets as shale oil production in the United States has risen dramatically over the past few years.
In October, Sechin said Rosneft would not cap oil production as part of a possible agreement with OPEC.
Following the Vienna deal, Russia's energy minister said on Dec. 14 he had reached a framework agreement with oil companies on how to implement an output cut, but the producers said there were still details to be worked out.

There are doubts that Russian oil companies, with their own interests and plans, will be able to hammer out a joint strategy to cut the country's production, which has reached a post-Soviet high.

The market was not very active today, as the Christmas holiday weekend sent many home early from work.
Traders continue to worry that OPEC will not be able to keep producers in line and force a production cut next year.
The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in war-torn Iraq appears poised to ignore the OPEC agreement last month to slash oil production and is planning to increase output in the coming weeks, according to industry sources.
Since the U.S. pullout of most troops from Iraq, Baghdad has no control over the regional Kurdistan government. The government is not sovereign, and is not recognized by the international community as such, and so it was not given a seat at the Nov. 30 meeting of the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries in Vienna, and so could not make its objections known widely at the time of the production cutting accord.
Keeping oil production high, or even increasing it, is high on the agenda of Kurdish leaders in Iraq.
Reducing output would force the cash-strapped regional authority to further delay paying its Peshmerga soldiers, who have been ISIS’ most formidable regional foes on the battlefield.
Per the OPEC deal, Iraq agreed to reduce crude output by 210,000 barrels a day from October levels.
But Kurdistan controls about 600,000 barrels a day of oil production, nearly 12% of Iraq’s oil output.
Due to the schism between the KRG and Baghdad, Iraq’s central government has absolutely no power to order the KRG to reduce production.
Companies, like the Kar Group, operating in Kurdistan indicate that they are planning to boost oil production early next year by 40,000 barrels a day.

The lower taxes are part of a policy to curb gold smuggling, experts said, noting the black market for gold there has grown since taxes were increased earlier this year.
Analysts reckon the price of gold may be bolstered if this policy is implemented.

1337,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 23, 2016 12:54PM ET</span>","Kurds ignoring OPEC production cuts, need cash to fight ISIS ","Investing.com - The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in war-torn Iraq appears poised to ignore the OPEC agreement last month to slash oil production and is planning to increase output in the coming weeks, according to industry sources.
Since the U.S. pullout of most troops from Iraq, Baghdad has no control over the regional Kurdistan government. The government is not sovereign, and is not recognized by the international community as such, and so it was not given a seat at the Nov. 30 meeting of the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries in Vienna, and so could not make its objections known widely at the time of the production cutting accord.
Keeping oil production high, or even increasing it, is high on the agenda of Kurdish leaders in Iraq.
Reducing output would force the cash-strapped regional authority to further delay paying its Peshmerga soldiers, who have been ISIS’ most formidable regional foes on the battlefield.
Per the OPEC deal, Iraq agreed to reduce crude output by 210,000 barrels a day from October levels.
But Kurdistan controls about 600,000 barrels a day of oil production, nearly 12% of Iraq’s oil output.
Due to the schism between the KRG and Baghdad, Iraq’s central government has absolutely no power to order the KRG to reduce production.
Companies, like the Kar Group, operating in Kurdistan indicate that they are planning to boost oil production early next year by 40,000 barrels a day."

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil slipped below $55 a barrel on Friday as a stronger U.S. dollar weighed on commodities and as higher Libyan output threatened to counter some of the supply cuts planned by OPEC and other producers.
Crude is still trading around its highest since mid-2015, supported by a deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-members to lower output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day from Jan. 1.
Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 34 cents at $54.71 a barrel as of 1057 GMT, after rising 1.1 percent on Thursday. It reached $57.89, the highest since July 2015, on Dec. 12. U.S. crude (CLc1) fell 37 cents to $52.58.
""There's some profit-taking after the last session's gains. Oil prices are also weaker due to the stronger dollar,"" said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance in Sydney.
Also weighing on oil was a surprise increase in U.S. crude stocks reported on Wednesday in the government's weekly supply report - and the prospect of sales beginning in January of crude from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).
""Crude failed to maintain gains this week following the unexpected build in U.S. crude stockpiles, which revived the oversupply concerns,"" said Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst with FXTM.
""With some anxieties still lingering over the compliance side of the unexpected cut agreement, oil could end up extremely volatile with losses expected if production fails to decline.""
While major OPEC producers including Saudi Arabia and Iraq have told customers that supply will be cut in line with the OPEC deal, Libya and Nigeria are exempt because conflict has already curbed their output.
Libya's National Oil Corp hopes to add 270,000 bpd to national production over the next three months after announcing on Tuesday the reopening of pipelines leading from two major fields, Sharara and El Feel. 
Nonetheless, efforts to restore Libyan output since the North African country's 2011 uprising have been repeatedly stymied and political splits still present a risk to the plan.
The volume of extra oil reaching the market from the SPR could be sizeable. Consultancy Poten & Partners said on Thursday the reserve could be drawn down by some 190 million barrels between 2017 and 2025 if all planned sales went ahead. 
The dollar index (DXY) steadied on Friday not far below a 14-year peak of 103.65 reached earlier this week.

Brent futures (LCOc1) for February delivery rose by 75 cents to $55.21, or 1.3 percent, per barrel by 10:52 am ET (1552 GMT), having finished 89 cents lower on Wednesday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) rose 62 cents to $53.11 a barrel.

Trading overall was quiet as desks wind down for the holidays. The front-month crude futures has seen volume of about 225,000 contracts as of 10:52 a.m. ET, less than half of the total daily average over the last 200 days, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Thursday's gains were curbed by an unexpected rise in U.S. crude inventories last week and moves by Libya to boost output over the next few months. 
New orders for U.S.-made capital goods rose more than expected in November amid strong demand for machinery and primary metals, suggesting some of the oil-related drag on manufacturing was starting to fade.
U.S. data also showed the economy grew faster than previously estimated in the third quarter, notching its quickest pace in two years.
Optimism that OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers would stick to a deal to cut output by almost 1.8 million bpd from Jan. 1 helped support prices, which have added to gains since the deal was agreed on Dec 10.
""The announcements coming from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Iraq, and Russia are all encouraging signs that they will abide by the cut and hopefully other countries will follow suit,"" OPEC member Kuwait's oil minister Essam Abdul Mohsen Al-Marzouq told reporters.
Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, said he was also upbeat about upcoming cuts: ""It is a safe assumption particularly in the early stages that OPEC and non-OPEC producers will abide by the agreement to curb output.""
On the downside for oil prices, U.S. crude stocks posted a surprise build last week, climbing by 2.3 million barrels compared with an expected decline of 2.5 million barrels, government data showed on Wednesday.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2016 04:49AM ET</span>",U.S. refiners cash in on Mexico's record fuel imports,"By Devika Krishna Kumar and Marianna Parraga
NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. Gulf Coast refiners are cashing in on rising fuel demand from Mexico, shipping record volumes to a southern neighbor that has failed to expand its refining network to supply a fast-growing economy.
The fuel trade could top a million barrels per day (bpd) at times in 2017 as Mexico becomes increasingly dependent on the United States for strategic energy supplies and providing business worth more than $15 billion a year to refiners such as Valero (N:VLO), Marathon Petroleum (N:MPC) and Citgo Petroleum.
The rise in Mexico's fuel imports reflects an economy that, after expanding for 27 quarters in a row even amid a public austerity plan, has been unable to increase its refining output to satisfy the consistent growth of its energy demand. 
It has led to rapid reversal in energy trade between the two countries. In 2016, crude exporter Mexico will be a net oil importer from the United States for the first time as shipments of refined fuel heading south outnumber shipments of crude to the north, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).
Just ten years ago, the United States' net oil imports from Mexico stood at 1.45 million bpd.
Profit margins for the exports are strong for U.S. Gulf Coast refiners, said a source at a refiner involved in the trade.
""You're getting very good values if you're a Gulf coast supplier,"" he said. ""Freight has been dirt cheap too - so it doesn't cost that much to move the barrels either.""
Mexico constitutes a bright spot in what has otherwise been a dark year the U.S. refining industry with profits at a five-year low in 2016.
""Mexico's appetite for U.S. gasoline and distillates has played a significant part in sustaining Gulf Coast refining margins,"" said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research at Morningstar.
The exports also help to ease a supply glut in the U.S. market, said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) equity analyst Paul Cheng. That boosts profit margins industry-wide, even for refiners that are not directly involved in the trade, he added.
Other than state-run Pemex, among the top exporters of U.S. gasoline and distillates to Mexico to date in 2016 are Citgo Petroleum,  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) and Marathon, according to partial data based on shipping data from Thomson Reuters. A full breakdown combining marine, road, rail and pipeline exports by company is not publicly available.
That data shows Citgo [PDVSAC.UL], owned by Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA, has exported nearly 57,000 bpd of fuels to Mexico, while Marathon has shipped about 43,000 bpd. Last year,  Valero Energy  (N:VLO) was the top exporter with nearly 62,000 bpd.
Based on the price for benchmark U.S. gasoline (RBc1) trading at over $65 a barrel, that volume of Citgo's exports are worth around $1.4 billion and Marathon's around $1 billion.
    [Link to graphic on Mexico's energy imports from the U.S.: http://tmsnrt.rs/2g3gvsl]
Despite the rising volume of exports to Mexico, publicly traded U.S. Gulf refiners are valued below their peers. Marathon is trading at 14.67 times its expected earnings, while Valero is at 12.51. That compared to an industry median of 16.10 in oil and gas refining. 
Valero did not respond to requests for comment on this story. Marathon said they would not go into detail about its exports, and Exxon Mobil also declined to comment. 
RISING CONSUMPTION
The shortfall between demand and supply in Mexico has been exacerbated by the government slashing the budget for oil giant Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex).
Pemex faces a further cut of around $5.36 billion in 2017, which hurts its ability to improve refinery output. Refineries in Mexico are running at about 60 percent of their 1.576 million bpd of capacity, according to the company's data. That leaves the onus on Pemex to import more to cover demand.
For decades, imports were a burden on state coffers, as Mexico made a loss on fuel sales at the pump while they were heavily subsidized rate.
Mexico's fuel demand is around 2.04 million bpd and the government expects growth of 2-3 percent per year in coming years.
The country is the world's fourth-largest consumer of gasoline. Car sales through September increased 18 percent on the year, to a record of 1.12 million units, pointing to continued strong demand growth. 
""We continue to see very good demand for gasoline into Mexico and South America... we see good growth in that region,"" Gary Simmons, a senior executive at Valero, said on a conference call.
In September, Mexico's imports of U.S. fuel surged to a monthly record of about 960,000 bpd, according to the EIA. The average for the year-to-date is around 820,000 bpd.
Most of the exports are seaborne, but rail firms have also benefited with a sharp rise in volumes shipped over the border on trains, according to the Association of American Railroads.
Mexico's government opened the industry to private capital in 2013 to reverse a protracted slide in oil output, refining and reserves. Pemex still buys most of the imports from the U.S. Gulf refiners, but private imports are expected to grow in 2017 with further liberalization and improved cross-border infrastructure.
""We are expecting Mexico's imports from the U.S. to increase to an average of 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017... imports would surpass 1 million bpd at times in 2017 if private imports become significant after price liberalization,"" said Robert Campbell, head of oil products research at Energy Aspects.
TRADE CONCERN
President-elect Donald Trump's plans to rewrite the terms of trade between the two countries have made importers and exporters nervous that a deterioration in bilateral relations or changes in taxes and tariffs could disrupt the flow. 
""Even a minimum change in taxes could mess up gasoline exports to Mexico,"" a source working at a terminal and pipeline operator doing business with Pemex said. ""Everybody is worried, but nobody says it.""  
More difficult trade could force Mexico to look for other supply sources such as Europe, but it is difficult for European refiners to export fuel at a price competitive with their rivals in the United States due to shipping costs.
Some of the top-ranking members of Trump's cabinet are from the energy industry, adding even more clout to one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington which will push hard to prevent Trump doing anything that would hurt the trade.

""Whatever restrictions might be placed on trade and immigrant flows between Mexico and the U.S. during the Trump Administration, U.S. energy producers will be anxious to protect growing hydrocarbon exports to our southern neighbor,"" said Fielden.

The market closed at a record on Tuesday, and the new highs for equities are lessening the appetite for the precious metal, which is viewed as a safe haven.
The commodity has fallen 3.2% thus far this month, hemmed in by a climbing dollar and newly raised interest rates.
Advances for the greenback makes the metal more expensive for other currency owners. Rising yields make it slightly more attractive to invest in assets that pay interest, which gold cannot.
The dollar on Wednesday also lost footing against many of the other major currencies. The ICE Dollar Index, fell 0.3% to 102.97. The index measures the strength of the dollar against a mixed basket of six currencies.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2016 03:40PM ET</span>","Trump win ignites hope for stalled Alaska copper, gold mine","By Nicole Mordant
VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A small Canadian miner is confident Donald Trump's U.S. presidential win will let it proceed with an application for a copper and gold mine in Alaska that has been stalled almost three years by environmental regulators aiming to protect the world's biggest sockeye salmon fishery.
Ronald Thiessen, chief executive officer and president of Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd, said he expected the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to announce in the first quarter of 2017 that it will let the application process proceed for the controversial project. He said the company has held discussions with Trump's transition team, including Myron Ebell, who heads the EPA transition.
Shares in Northern Dynasty, which owns the massive Pebble deposit in southwest Alaska's Bristol Bay region, have more than doubled since the U.S. election on Nov. 8. The shares surged 23 percent on Nov. 9 alone. 
In February 2014, the EPA took the unusual action of blocking a mine before the project owner applied for a development permit. The company has estimated that removing that pre-emptive veto could happen three to four months after an EPA announcement. This would allow Northern Dynasty to seek a deep-pocketed partner and resume permitting the project, one of the world's biggest undeveloped copper and gold deposits.
Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Trump's staff did not respond to email requests for comment.
According to the EPA, the Bristol Bay watershed supports the world's largest fishery of sockeye salmon. Environmental groups oppose the mine, as do many native residents who rely on the fish as a subsistence food. Many commercial fishermen and sport fishermen are also opposed.
Last year, U.S. President Barack Obama used a trip to the area to try to cement his environmental legacy. Overturning the EPA veto would be a potent symbol of Trump making good on his promise to remove regulations stopping the expansion of drilling and mining. ""It is one of the most stunning projects in the world but there has been this giant bull's-eye on our back. Nobody wants to get into this fight with the government,"" Thiessen said in an interview. Northern Dynasty launched legal action against the EPA in May 2014. This October, the two sides agreed to mediation to try to end their dispute. Northern Dynasty wants a partner to replace  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc, which spent more than $500 million on the project before pulling out in 2013 as gold and copper prices fell. Two months after the EPA's 2014 veto, another global miner  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO), at the time Northern Dynasty's biggest investor, said it would give its 19.1 percent stake to charity. With prospects reviving for the project and big, long-life gold and copper deposits increasingly hard to find, ""any large gold or copper mining company is going to be looking at the Pebble project,"" said Chris Mancini, research analyst at Gabelli Funds, which owns shares in Northern Dynasty. Copper miners such as U.S.-based Freeport-McMoRan and Canada's Teck Resources might take a look at the project, independent mining analyst John Tumazos said. Freeport and Teck declined to comment. 

A rally in copper prices since late October has also helped make the project more valuable. Yet opponents remain determined to stop Pebble, and Alaska governor Bill Walker has said he is skeptical of the project.""If Northern Dynasty is excited about Trump taking office, I don't know what their crystal ball is showing them,"" said Kimberly Williams, director of Nunamta Aulukestai, a non-profit group of tribal governments and village corporations in the Bristol Bay area. ""The people in our area are still overwhelming opposed to this project.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose on Wednesday, driven by expectations for a decline in U.S. crude inventories and bringing price gains for December to 10 percent, which would be the strongest performance in the final month of the year in six years.
Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) were up 32 cents on the day at $55.67 a barrel by 1217 GMT, while U.S. crude futures (CLc1) rose 30 cents to $53.60 a barrel.
Brent's rally is its largest so far for any December since 2010, thanks to an unprecedented wave of investor buying ahead of an anticipated drop in supply from some of the world's top exporters next year.
""Oil seems determined to end the year on a high note. Pre-holiday thinned trading and a fresh 14-year high for the dollar index failed to dampen bullish spirits,"" PVM Oil Associates analyst Stephen Brennock said in a note.
Hourly volume in the front-month contract was around 2,300 lots on Wednesday, compared with an average of 2,400 for hourly volume in the second half of December, according to trading data from the InterContinental Exchange.
An expected drop in U.S. crude stocks helped underpin the market during Asian trading, but analysts said the effect may be short-lived.

Gold for February delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up $1.75, or 0.15%, to $1,135.35 a troy ounce by 4:10AM ET (09:10GMT), after falling $9.10, or 0.8%, in the prior session.
Prices of the yellow metal sank to $1,124.30 last week, a level not seen since February 2.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was little changed at 103.21 in early trade. The index climbed to 103.62 on Tuesday, the strongest level since December 2002.
Since the U.S. election in early November, the dollar index has risen nearly 6% thanks to bets of higher U.S. growth and a faster pace of interest rate increases under incoming president Donald Trump.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Market analysts warned that the outlook for gold remains cloudy in the near-term, given expectations for higher U.S. interest rates in the months ahead.
The Fed hiked interest rates for the first time in a year last week and projected three more increases in 2017.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2016 06:00PM ET</span>","Obama bans new oil, gas drilling off Alaska, part of Atlantic coast","By Valerie Volcovici and Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Tuesday banned new oil and gas drilling in federal waters in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, in a push to leave his stamp on the environment before Republican Donald Trump takes office next month.
Obama used a 1950s-era law called the Outer Continental Shelf Act that allows presidents to limit areas from mineral leasing and drilling. Environmental groups said that meant Trump's incoming administration would have to go court if it sought to reverse the move.
The ban affects 115 million acres (46.5 million hectares) of federal waters off Alaska in the Chukchi Sea and most of the Beaufort Sea and 3.8 million acres (1.5 million hectares) in the Atlantic from New England to Chesapeake Bay. 
Trump, who succeeds Obama on Jan. 20, has said he would expand offshore oil and gas drilling. A recent memo from his energy transition team said his policy could increase production in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, as well as the mid- and south Atlantic.
A Trump representative did not immediately comment on the announcement.
Even if Trump tries to fight the move, few energy companies have expressed a desire to drill anytime soon off the coasts thanks to abundant cheap shale oil in North Dakota and Texas. 
Exploratory drilling in the Arctic is expensive and risky. Shell (LON:RDSa) Oil ended its quest to explore in harsh Arctic waters in 2015, after a vessel it was using suffered a gash and environmentalists uncovered a law that limited its drilling.
The American Petroleum Institute oil industry group disagreed about the permanence of the ban and said Trump could likely use a presidential memorandum to lift it.
""We are hopeful the incoming administration will reverse this decision as the nation continues to need a robust strategy for developing offshore and onshore energy,” said Erik Milito, API's upstream director. 
JOINT ACTION WITH CANADA
The White House and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau jointly announced their move to launch ""actions ensuring a strong, sustainable and viable Arctic economy and ecosystem."" 
Obama said in a statement that the joint actions ""reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region’s harsh conditions is limited.""
Canada will designate all Arctic Canadian waters as indefinitely off limits to future offshore Arctic oil and gas licensing, to be reviewed every five years through a climate and marine science-based life-cycle assessment.
The law under which Obama is acting enables a president to withdraw certain areas from leasing or drilling ""for any public purpose,"" such as to limit the impacts of climate change, according to a legal briefing by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Earth Justice.
Under that law, a president is not authorized to ""undo"" a previous withdrawal, making it more difficult for Trump to target without a lawsuit. 
""No president has ever tried to undo a permanent withdrawal of an ocean area from leasing eligibility,"" said Niel Lawrence, Alaska director and attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
The provision has been used by six presidents from both parties over the past 65 years, including to withdraw as much as several hundred million acres at a time, he said. 
'SMART BUSINESS DECISION'
In 2015, just 0.1 percent of U.S. federal offshore crude production came from the Arctic. At current oil prices, significant production in the Arctic will not occur, according to a Department of Interior analysis.
There is currently no crude oil production in the Canadian Arctic. A number of companies including  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Imperial Oil hold exploration licenses, but all three have put their drilling plans on hold, partly because of weak global oil prices.
On the U.S. Atlantic coast, local groups have opposed offshore drilling and would fight the Trump administration's attempts to open it up.
""The people of the Atlantic coast have refused to allow their way of life to be compromised,"" said Jacqueline Savitz, senior vice president of Florida-based ocean conservancy group Oceana.

She said the Obama administration move to protect the Atlantic coast was a “smart business decision” since it would protect the lucrative tourism and fishing industries of East Coast communities.

The dollar was trading near 14-year highs after Federal Reserve Bank Chairwoman Janet Yellen reiterated that she expects a quicker pace of U.S. interest rate increases next year than had been expected by investors.

Analysts said the strengthening U.S. and global economy, as well as the rising dollar, and rising equity and bond markets, were conspiring to bringing down the value of gold.
Also dragging down the price of gold is the spectre of weaker physical demand in India, where retail demand has declined due to the government's move to eliminate high-value currency notes.
The release of India's government budget early next year will be a factor to watch as an indicator in the coming direction of gold, analysts said. Questions remain as to whether India will continue its present policy on gold.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday on forecasts of a steep draw in U.S. crude oil stocks that could indicate a global oversupply is starting to shrink.
Benchmark Brent crude oil futures (LCOc1) were trading up 54 cents at $55.46 a barrel at 1124 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures (CLc1) were up 23 cents at $52.35 per barrel.
Analysts polled by Reuters expected weekly U.S. crude oil inventories to show a draw of 2.4 million barrels in the week ending Dec. 16. [EIA/S]
Stocks fell more than expected in data published last week, lifting expectations for another large fall in this week's data.
A landmark deal to cut global supply among OPEC and non-OPEC producers struck earlier this month has lifted oil prices to 17-month highs.
Russian energy minister Alexander Novak told Russian newspaper Vedomosti that Russia may extend a production cut beyond the first half of the year if needed.
""We are in a wait-and-see mood after OPEC-newsflow caused much volatility,"" said Frank Klumpp, oil analyst at Stuttgart-based Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg. ""The new balance seems to be between $53 and $57 a barrel on Brent for the next weeks.""
Asia is seen posting its biggest net refining capacity additions in three years in 2017, further boosting demand for crude in the world's biggest and fastest growing oil consuming region.
The increase amounts to about an additional 1.5 percent of refining capacity on top of Asia's total installed capacity of nearly 29 million bpd.

Still, traders see no outright supply shortage for Asian refineries, as OPEC is shielding most of its Asian customers from the planned cuts.

Retiring President Obama today assented to new administrative rules that will tamp down on the coal industry, and Republicans promised to overturn the edicts as early as next month.
The new rule, which will cost coal companies $81 million a year to comply with, according to the Interior Department, is designed to keep streams safe from pollution discharge from coal production.
The so-called Stream Protection Rule will go into effect 30 days after its official release and publication in the Federal Register, the government guidebook of national regulations.
House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), an ally of President-elect Trump, today promised an immediate repeal when the new president is sworn in a month hence.
“The Obama administration is fighting its war on coal to the bitter end,"" said Ryan, in a statement, a copy of which was obtained by Investing.com. ""This one rule could have crushing consequences for coal miners, their families and many communities. If we are going to get America back on track, job-crushing regulations like this must stop.""
Even frustrated Democrats joined Ryan in opposing the bill.
“While we all must carefully review this 1,648 page final rule, I want to reiterate that the proposed rule was very alarming in its scope and potential impacts. I believe that the manner in which this rule making was executed was flawed and lacked transparency, and I will pursue legislation to ensure it does not harm our coal mining communities and economies,” said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), in a statement obtained by Investing.com.
Under the Congressional Review Act, enacted when Newt Gingrich was speaker 20 years ago, Congress can reverse regulations proposed within the previous 60 legislative days. That means any regulations put forth since June 13 by President Obama could be reversed with a simple majority vote.
President-elect Trump did not comment on the new Obama rulemaking, but has vowed to support reduced rules for coal producing states, like West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which powered him to victory last month.
Shares of American coal producers, including Consol Energy Inc., Natural Resource Partners LP, and Cloud Peak Energy were down on Monday.

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2016 12:00PM ET</span>",ECB's Weidmann: oil price could stabilize at elevated levels,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Oil prices could stabilize at an elevated level and rising inflation will automatically make European Central Bank policy looser, much like in the case of a rate cut, Governing Council member Jens Weidmann said on Monday.
Weidmann, a long-time critic of the ECB's ultra easy policies, also said that the housing market may already be overheating in several euro zone countries, even as governments have failed to make the best use of ultra low borrowing costs, spending much of the windfall.
Oil prices (LCOc1), on their best run in years, are up nearly 50 percent this year and a production cut agreed by major producers recently could keep the rally going, reviving inflation after it undershot the ECB's target of 2 percent for close to 4 years. 
""Monetary policy becomes looser automatically over the coming months, even without central bank action: when inflation rises as forecast in our projections, the real interest rate declines,"" Weidmann, the head of Germany's Bundesbank said in Brussels. ""The effects are similar to a central bank rate cut.""
Rising oil prices could present the ECB with a new challenge: although higher energy costs will boost inflation, a relief for the bank that still feared deflation just a few months ago, they could also cut into the bloc's still fragile growth, thwarting the recovery.
The ECB earlier this month extended it asset buys until the end of 2017, promising an extended market presence to keep borrowing costs low as growth is still fragile and elections in the bloc's biggest economies keep uncertainty high.
""I fear that the danger of fiscal policy becoming too comfortable with the current low-interest-rate environment increases with the time these favorable financing conditions exist,"" Weidmann said.
""It is key that concerns over financial market volatility or the sustainability of public finances do not lead to a postponement of an exit from the ultra-loose monetary policy,"" he added.

Although super low rates have not yet created real estate bubbles across the euro area, some property markets are at risk of overheating, Weidmann said, noting that Finland, Ireland and the Netherlands have already taken measures to limit the risk of bubbles.

1378,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2016 11:20AM ET</span>",Incoming Ghana government gives cocoa sector chance of fresh start,"By Matthew Mpoke Bigg
ACCRA (Reuters) - Ghana's incoming government could give the country's $2 billion cocoa industry a boost if it installs a more transparent executive at industry regulator Cocobod and implements reforms, industry sources said.
The New Patriotic Party (NPP) said its priority is to push annual cocoa output in the world's second-biggest producer above 1 million tonnes when it takes power in January under President-elect Nana Akufo-Addo using a series of fresh measures.
A big issue is the role of Cocobod chief executive. Industry officials said CEO Stephen Opuni's position is vulnerable because he publicly supported President John Mahama who lost the Dec. 7 election.
Traders and buyers credit the regulator for maintaining the premium quality of Ghana's cocoa and increasing the guaranteed minimum price paid to farmers to 70 percent of net free-on-board but they say greater access to Cocobod is crucial.
""For the last two years, it has been very closed and very difficult to meet with Cocobod,"" one senior Ghana cocoa operative said in a comment echoed by several others.
Cocobod plays a unique role both regulating the sector and exporting beans through its Cocoa Marketing Company as well as distributing fertilizer, pesticides and seedlings.
Few were willing to speak openly for fear of antagonizing Cocobod and some said that in itself reduced accountability. Buyers said they were unwilling to challenge the regulator for fear of damaging business relationships.
""Nobody dares to stand up to Cocobod,"" said one buyer, who declined to be named.
Cocobod CEO Opuni did not respond to requests for comment.
Ghana accounts for up to 25 percent of global cocoa supply and the industry also contributes around 7 percent of GDP as well as up to one quarter of the country's export earnings.
The NPP has established a transition team but is yet to name a finance minister, one of whose statutory roles is to oversee Cocobod.
Its manifesto outlines policies including re-activating mass spraying, replanting farms with high yield trees, improving local processing and compensating farmers for diseased trees.
The party will ""ensure that farmers receive increased producer prices plus bonuses high enough to encourage them to produce more cocoa for export (and) ensure that the value that farmers receive for their produce is not diluted by depreciation of the cedi against the dollar"".
FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY
Industry sources calculate Cocobod controls around half a billion dollars in funds per year, and must therefore increase its financial transparency and move towards depoliticising its dealings with farmers.
Several farmers said supporters of the outgoing National Democratic Party government gained better access to seedlings and inputs in the run-up to the vote than supporters of the opposition. Cocobod denied this.
At the same time, the regulator's promise of free fertilizers, pesticides, spraying and seedlings had discouraged private sector participation and made farmers unhealthily dependent on free products rather than buying on the market.
""It's not an effective system. It's expensive and in the end not all farmers have access to these kinds of products. Because of the free elements the farmer has no opportunity to buy if he would have wanted to,"" one senior market source said.
Others said it would be better if Cocobod's role was reconfigured to focus solely on regulation, opening space for the private sector.
Ghana's cocoa production peaked in the 2010/11 season at more than 1 million tonnes, dipped to under 750,000 tonnes in 2014/15 season before rebounding slightly last season.
One senior cocoa analyst said current production was running around 10,000 tonnes higher than the same point in the previous season. It would fall back in January and February but the mid-crop was expected to be strong, the analyst said.
However, the country needs to improve productivity per hectare. A step towards this is to map the size of each farm and count the number of farmers to get a more precise figure than the 800,000 that is often mentioned.

""We are looking forward to seeing all the things they (the NPP) have been promising,"" Nana Johnson Mensah, a chief farmer of Western region south, told Reuters.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday in anticipation of tighter crude supply going into 2017 following the decision by OPEC and other producers to cut output to prop up prices.
Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were trading at $55.41 per barrel at 0756 GMT, up 20 cents from their last close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were up 31 cents at $52.21 a barrel.
Traders said the higher prices in front-month crude futures were due to expectations of a tighter market.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers led by Russia have announced cutbacks of almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in oil production from January 2017 in an effort to bolster prices to reduce rampant global overproduction which has seen output outstrip consumption for over two years.
""With investors now expecting a relatively high level of compliance with the production cut agreements, prices should be well supported,"" ANZ bank said on Monday.
""Saudi Arabia has stated its willingness to cut production below 10 million bpd if needed (down from around 10.5 million bpd currently), which should limit risk to the deal,"" U.S. bank  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said on Monday, adding that some of the non-compliance risk to the deal to cut output in 2017 came from Iraq, which increased its January loadings versus December.
JBC Energy said that ""the U.S.-dollar easing off mid-week
highs contributed to bullish (oil) sentiment.""
The dollar has lost 0.9 percent against a basket of other leading currencies since hitting 2002 highs last week.
Swings in the dollar can affect oil demand as they influence fuel prices for any country using its own currency domestically.
Despite this, there were factors that weighed on markets, preventing prices - which remain relatively low - from rising more.
In the United States, which did not participate in the production cut deal, drilling for new oil has increased for seven straight weeks.
Drillers added 12 oil rigs in the week to Dec. 16, bringing the total to 510, the highest since January, though still below 541 rigs a year ago, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.
""Since its trough on May 27, 2016, producers have added 194 oil rigs (+61 percent) in the U.S.,"" U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.

As a result, U.S. oil production is edging up, rising from below 8.5 million bpd in July to almost 8.8 million bpd by mid-December.

The wind turbine, supplied by U.S. company  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) will provide power to Saudi Aramco’s bulk plant in Turaif, in northwest Saudi Arabia.
""The first electricity is expected to be supplied to the Saudi Aramco bulk plant once commissioning of the wind turbine is completed in January 2017,"" Aramco said in a statement.
The kingdom, the world's largest oil exporter, produces very little renewable energy, representing less than 1 percent of the total produced.
But it plans to generate 9.5 gigawatts of electricity from renewable energy as part of a reform plan known as Vision 2030.
The plan, a package of economic and social policies is designed to free the kingdom from dependence on oil exports.
Saudi Aramco's CEO told Reuters in May, Aramco was looking to play a major role in achieving that target.
""Renewables is on our radar ... and we are looking forward to play a major role in renewables in the near future,"" he said at the time.
Aramco said in the statement on Sunday Saudi Arabia's wind resource was ""exceptional"" based on a measurement program it started in 2012.
The new wind turbine will generate 2.75 megawatts of power at its peak, enough to power around 250 Saudi households, the company said.
It will also reduce the burning of diesel for power generation by 18,600 barrels of oil equivalent per year (boepd).

The commodity has fallen an annualized 3% and 7% over the past three and five years, respectively. Since hitting an apex at around $1,900 an ounce in September 2011, gold bottomed at $1,050 an ounce in December 2015 and is now in a sustained uptrend. The intraday price of $1136.50 per troy ounce was up $7.70, or 0.68%.
Gold settled at 1136.80, up $7, or 0.62%. Silver and platinum also settled higher on Friday. 
Inflationary policies, by the governments of China and the U.S., will encourage speculation, resulting in increased cash flow into electronic traded funds (ETFs) related to gold, according to analysts.
President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to cut taxes is expected to add trillions of dollars to the country's debt burden.
The U.S. federal debt is still expected to increase from 77% of U.S. GDP at year-end 2016 to 86%, or about $23 trillion, over the next decade, driven by spending on health care for seniors and children and the indigent and retirement.
Analysts also said that jewlery demand from India and China should regain momentum next year.
According to the World Gold Council, global jewelry demand, which makes up half of annual gold demand, was down 21% year-over-year in the third quarter.
This year’s decline of the Chinese and Indian jewelry markets was caused by complex confluence of events that will not repeat themselves in 2017, including the unexpected loss of Chinese consumer confidence, gold import curbs designed to restrict capital flight, a tax hike on Indian gold imports earlier this year, and a cash crisis in India.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose on Friday, edging closer to new 17-month highs as producers showed signs of adhering to a global deal to reduce output.
Brent crude futures were trading at $54.55 per barrel at 1225 GMT, up 53 cents on the previous day's close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 33 cents at $51.23 per barrel.
""The market has faith in the OPEC deal and should trade higher in the near future,"" said Tamas Varga, lead oil analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has agreed to reduce output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1, its first such deal since 2008. Russia and other non-OPEC producers plan to cut about half as much.
Those deals, clinched over the past two weeks, have boosted expectations in the market that a two-year supply overhang will clear soon and prices remain near highs last seen in July 2015.
Russia said on Friday that all of the country's oil companies, including top producer Rosneft, had agreed to reduce output.
Other oil producers, including Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, have notified customers that they will cut from January.
The prospect of lower production led U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to raise its WTI price forecast to $57.5 per barrel from $55 per barrel previously for the second quarter of 2017.
For Brent, Goldman expects prices between $55 and $60 per barrel after the first half of 2017.
However, there are doubts about the willingness of other OPEC members to comply.
Iraq, OPEC's second-biggest producer after Saudi Arabia, has signed new deals that will increase its sales to Asian customers such as China and India despite its commitment to reduce output by 210,000 bpd.
Libya, which is allowed to ramp up production as part of the OPEC deal, is close to increasing output crimped by unrest after a group of oil guards said they had reopened a long-blockaded pipeline linking some of the country's biggest oilfields.

Libya's National Oil Corp has said it hopes to raise production to 900,000 bpd in the near future, and to 1.1 million bpd next year.

SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - Iraq is selling more crude oil to its biggest customer, China's Unipec, people familiar with the matter say, digging a deeper foothold in the global supply market just before production cuts agreed with OPEC and other producers are scheduled to kick in.
With new deals with Indian and U.S. refiners also coming on stream, the expanded contract with the trading arm of Asia's largest refiner Sinopec <600028.SS> means Baghdad will have to reduce supply to other clients to honor its commitment to cut output by 210,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 2017.
Three people with knowledge of the matter said the Unipec contract was signed just before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Iraq is a member, agreed with other producers led by Russia to cut output by as much as 1.8 million bpd in an effort to reduce a global fuel supply overhang and prop up prices.
Speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak to media, the people said Iraq's Oil Marketing Company (SOMO) has boosted Basra crude forward export sales to Unipec by 3 percent to a total of 40 million-60 million barrels each quarter - 435,000-652,000 bpd - for 2017.
""If Iraq increases its sales to China while others have to cut back or just hold their volumes steady, Iraq will inevitably gain market share in what is arguably the most important oil market,"" said a trader who specializes in sending crude to China but is not allowed to speak publicly.
Iraq is OPEC's second-biggest producer behind Saudi Arabia and now ranks third among crude suppliers to China - after Russia and Saudi Arabia - having recorded a 15 percent year-on-year jump to about 723,000 bpd between January and October. [O/CHINA1]
As part of the expanded Chinese deal, one of the people said, Unipec is expected to load 2 million barrels of Basra Heavy crude every quarter.
""Basra is now an established grade with stable quality and reliable supplies,"" said another trader, who buys Iraqi crude but isn't authorized to speak to the media.
Unipec said it doesn't comment on specific deals. 
SOMO will also supply Basra Heavy crude under new term contracts to  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and Indian refiner Essar Oil  for 2017, according to a person close to the matter and a preliminary January loading schedule for the oil.
The contracts contribute to an expected jump in Basra exports to 3.53 million bpd in January 2017, the highest volume since June, the loading schedule showed.
SOMO did not reply to an e-mail from Reuters seeking comment. Exxon and Chevron said they don't comment on operational matters, and Essar declined to comment.
In India, crude imports from Iraq rose 24 percent in the first 10 months this year to 784,000 bpd, making Iraq the second-largest crude supplier after Saudi Arabia.

Iraqi crude exports to the United States have more than doubled in the first nine months of 2016 from the same period a year ago to nearly 350,000 bpd as Venezuelan supplies declined, data from the Energy Information Administration showed.

PARIS (Reuters) - A surge in production and cut-price deals from supermarkets are bringing caviar to the mass market. 
But that doesn't bother Petrossian, one of the world's oldest and largest caviar specialists, which sells the delicacy from its oak-walled boutique near the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
""The more people eat caviar the better,"" says moustachioed owner Armen Petrossian, son of the brand's Armenian founder.
""Then they can tell the difference between high-quality and lower quality caviar,"" he adds, amid a steady stream of phone calls from customers placing orders ahead of Christmas. 
Petrossian's 30-gram tin of Chinese caviar costs 54 euros ($57) and its Bulgarian Beluga ""Special Réserve"" 384 euros. 
Last week, German discount supermarket Lidl offloaded thousands of 15-gram tins of Italian caviar for just 9.99 euros apiece. 
Petrossian says prices of caviar, or sturgeon eggs, have halved over the past five years due to a jump in production.
Once dominated by the Soviet Union and Iran, sturgeon farming has spread to countries from Switzerland to Vietnam, and the United States to the United Arab Emirates. 
World output, just over 100 tonnes around five years ago, is now more than 250 and is set to reach 500 by 2020, says Philippe Chauvin, head of the Comptoir du Caviar chain, citing data from the International Caviar Importers' Association.
But that is bringing challenges. 
""Many investors have plowed money into this business thinking it was the goose with the golden eggs but in fact, profitability is not the same as it was five years ago,"" says Laurent Dulau, chief executive of Sturia, France’s leading caviar producer. 
Market experts predict consolidation among producers, which now total more than 100 against a handful two decades ago - with the big fish eating the little fish to preserve margins.

“We expect that the potential ramp up in Libya and a stronger dollar will likely limit the near-term upside to prices and our December West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price forecast remains $50 a barrel,” these analysts said in a note to clients.
In the recent agreement among major oil producers to cut production starting in January, Libya was one of the countries excluded from the need to reduce output.
On the agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers including Russia, Goldman expressed optimism that the parties involved would comply with the agreement.
“There will be little evidence of production cuts until mid- to late January which we believe will be the next catalyst for the next large move in prices,” they said, placing an estimate for WTI of $55 a barrel.
Meanwhile, Goldman also raised the forecast on West Texas to $57.5 a barrel in the second quarter of 2017, from the prior $55, as well as moving the estimate on Brent up to $59, from the previous $56.5.
“Beyond the first semester, we expect that the global market will remain balanced, with Brent prices between $55 and $60.”

On the New York Mercantile Exchange crude oil for January delivery rose 0.43% to $51.12 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent was last quoted at $54.02 a barrel on London's Intercontinental Exchange. On Friday in Asia, the data calendar is light on energy-focused indicators.
The market is also keyed on U.S. rig count data from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes. Last week, data showed the U.S. rig count up 27 rigs from last week to 624, with oil rigs up 21 to 498, gas rigs up 6 to 125.
Among other non-OPEC members, Oman told customers it plans 45,000 bpd in output cuts. The cuts will largely fall on customers in ASia and Europe, though not evenly, While Saudi Arabia has told U.S. and European customers it will reduce oil deliveries from January with details to follow.
The world's second largest crude importer China is also in focus on the demand side for policy actions after the National Development and Reform Commission said this week it would raise gasoline prices by CNY435 ($62.72) per metric ton and diesel prices by CNY420 per metric ton effective from Dec. 15 in response to higher crude oil prices recently. At the same time, a tax on purchases of small cars will be raised next year to 7.5% from 5%, after being cut by half in October last year to spur sales.

1405,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 15, 2016 05:56PM ET</span>",Gold price slump continues,"Investing.com - The price of gold slid once again on Thursday, continuing a slump, and posting the lowest settlement price in 10 months. 
Gold settled at $1130.30, down 2.87, or 33.39. 
The price of sliver, platinum, copper and palldium also settled lower for the day. 
Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Shares (HK:2840), are down about 10% from mid-November. Holdings fell again yesterday by 6.8 tonnes.
A global sell-off in ETFs is the result of lack of investor interest in the gold markets. The weak physical markets in China and India are taking away price momentum from the currency. 
Indian demand, meantime, has suffered from a liquidity crisis in recent weeks after officials suspended the use of some bank notes.
Chinese traders, moreover, say the government there has limited imports there.
Some traders were arguing earlier this week that the commodity was merely going through a slump that mirrored historical patterns and would recover in price by early next year, at the latest. "
1406,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 15, 2016 04:46PM ET</span>",Price of Brent oil settles higher on Thursday,"Investing.com - Oil prices were mixed on Thursday, as traders debated the impact of Federal Reserve rate cuts on the U.S. economy, and wondered whether Russian oil production cuts would work as planned.
The price of Brent oil was up slightly, settling at $54.16, an increase of 26 cents per barrel, or 0.48%.
The price of West Texas crude oil was down a bit, settling at $51.03, a decrease of 0.02%.
Yesterday, the Fed raised interest rates 0.25%, effective immediately, and announced that rates would rise three times again next year. The move is designed to dampen inflation, which is incipient in the U.S., due to an economy that is finally expanding after a decade of being in the doldrums.
Over the weekend, the Russian government agreed to join the production cut started by OPEC nations.
But late yesterday, Russia's economic ministers started speaking about the impact that move will have on the economy there. This helped influence the mood of today's oil markets.

Vladimir Putin is said to want to purchase 2,500 new tanks, the T-14 models, known as the ""Armatas."" But the government lacks the funds for the defense outlay. So the Russians are agreeing to a production cut in oil, to drive up prices, and thus profits, which it can use for defense spending. The goal is to “divide up the additional resources,” Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said yesterday.
The Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina, however, called for a “healthy conservatism” in economic forecasting and worried that crude prices represent a “serious risk” for the economy.
The risk stems from President-elect Donald Trump's promise to unleash domestic oil production in the U.S., which would drive prices down globally.
The economy of Russia, the world’s biggest energy exporter is now at risk of stagnation, as the nation is running the widest budget deficit in half a decade, and the Finance Ministry needs to be cautious on spending, Nabiullina said."

(Reuters) - The United States on Thursday launched a challenge to China's use of tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) for rice, wheat and corn at the World Trade Organization, charging that Beijing's administration of the program breached its WTO commitments and hurt U.S. farm exports.
The USTR said global prices for the three commodities were lower than China's domestic prices, yet the country did not maximize its use of TRQs, which offer lower duties on a certain volume of imported grains every year. The USTR said that limited market access for shipments from the United States, the world's largest grain exporter, and other countries.
The TRQs for the three commodities were worth more than $7 billion in 2015, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. China would have imported up to $3.5 billion more of the crops last year if the quotas had been fully used, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said on Thursday.
""The United States will aggressively pursue this challenge on behalf of American rice, wheat, and corn farmers,"" U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said in a statement.
It was the second challenge to China's agricultural policies by the U.S. Trade Representative since September and the latest in a series of trade disputes between the world's largest economies.
China on Monday launched a complaint at the WTO against the United States and Europe after they failed to treat China as a market economy and ease their calculations of anti-dumping duties on Chinese goods. 
The United States in September charged that China's domestic grain price supports exceeded agreed upon limits when Beijing joined the WTO in 2001. The USTR has since requested that the WTO launch a dispute settlement panel to investigate the matter.
Industry groups said Thursday's action would benefit all global grain exporters that have struggled recently with low prices and historically large supplies.
""This troublesome administration of China's wheat TRQ is restraining export opportunities for U.S. wheat farmers and farmers from Canada, Australia and other wheat exporting countries to the detriment of Chinese consumers,"" said Alan Tracy, president of the trade promoting group U.S. Wheat Associates.
China is second largest importer of U.S. agricultural products behind Canada, with $20.3 billion in purchases last year, according to USDA data. 

Thursday's action was the 15th trade enforcement challenge against China by the Obama administration at the WTO since 2009.

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2016 12:20PM ET</span>",Climate scientists adjust as Trump builds team of oil allies,"By Peter Henderson
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Climate scientists worried that President-elect Donald Trump will slash their budgets and sideline their research are entering survival mode, trimming the words ""climate change"" from study proposals, emphasizing business applications of their work, and safeguarding data that shows global warming is real.
The early reactions, gathered by Reuters in more than a dozen interviews, may foretell a broader shift in the U.S. climate science community, which had enjoyed solid political and financial support under President Barack Obama but could be isolated under a new administration skeptical of climate change and committed to expanding oil drilling and coal mining.
""I think it is maybe really necessary to refocus what you are doing and how you are labeling it,"" said Andreas Prein, a scientist at the federally funded National Center for Atmospheric Research, who previously had changed the term ""climate change"" in a project for the oil industry and expects such linguistic twists to proliferate. 
Trump has questioned whether climate change exists and has raised the possibility of withdrawing U.S. support for a global accord to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which an overwhelming majority of scientists believe is driving sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms. 
Trump is also preparing to nominate cabinet members with close oil industry ties, including  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary.
A member of the transition team further raised concerns among scientists this month by sending a questionnaire to the Department of Energy seeking the names of researchers there who worked on climate change issues, a move Trump’s team later disavowed.
Federal funding for climate change research, technology and international assistance hit $11.6 billion in 2014, from $2.4 billion in 1993, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. While Trump has not explicitly said he would cut such funding, one of his advisers told The Guardian newspaper last month that climate research at NASA would be eliminated. 
A Trump transition team official did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
""DATAREFUGE""
Prein at National Center for Atmospheric Research said he had replaced the politically charged term ""climate change"" with ""global change"" in a project he submitted for the oil industry.
He said that regardless of how it is labeled, interest in climate research would likely endure given the importance of extreme weather forecasting to a broad array of industries, like insurance and energy. However, he was concerned the longer-term work crucial to understanding the scope of global warming could lose critical support.
Climate scientist Ben Sanderson, also at NCAR, told Reuters he is applying to renew funding for assessing uncertainty in climate change. ""Now the proposal would have to be defensible without referring to climate change explicitly, so to talk about weather risks in general,"" he said.
Tracey Holloway, an air quality scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said she believed simple word changes sometimes could help scientists avoid trouble. Using the term ""weather"" instead of ""climate change,"" for example, could work for studies that deal with a short-term time scale, she said.
But Eric Holthaus, a meteorologist who writes for online magazine Slate, has taken efforts to protect scientists and their work a step further. 
He spearhead an effort, with the support of the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Toronto, to let scientists move their data onto publicly available non-government servers. The project, called ""DataRefuge,"" is intended to eliminate the chances of political interference with the data, he said.
The signals from the Trump transition team on climate change have also put members of Obama's outgoing administration on edge. Current Interior Secretary Sally Jewell told scientists at a conference in San Francisco this week they must confront climate change deniers and speak up if Trump tries to sideline them.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said in a press briefing he believed the concerns of the scientific community about Trump were ""legitimate."" 
""If the incoming administration determines that they want to base their policy on something other than science, it looks like they’re going to get at least four years to try that out and we'll have an opportunity to see how it works,"" he said.

Other scientists were dealing with the stress of a new administration using humor. University of South Florida glaciologist Jason Gulley said his team had a list of joke projects for science under Trump. ""How could we weaponize glaciers?” he asked, and what is the best real estate currently hidden under Greenland ice sheets.

1409,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2016 10:30AM ET</span>",U.S. wind power enjoys a rebirth as solar's obstacles mount,"By Nichola Groom
(Reuters) - A year after Congress extended generous tax credits for renewable energy projects, the U.S. wind industry is thriving.
Solar power companies, meanwhile, are hunkering down for a rough 2017.
The tax credit renewal has boosted the long-term outlooks for both industries. But in the short term, the subsidies are far more attractive for wind power, which has spurred utilities to launch wind projects while they scale back or delay solar installations.
Advances in wind turbine technology are also opening up new locations for development and driving a wave of spending to upgrade existing projects.
In the last few weeks, power companies with large renewable holdings - including  Southern Co  (N:SO),  NextEra Energy Inc  (N:NEE) and  Xcel Energy  Inc (N:XEL) - have announced plans to invest billions of dollars in wind.
""We're making a pivot now away from solar,"" Southern Chief Executive Tom Fanning told a meeting with Wall Street analysts in October.
The wind industry tax credit is largest for projects that break ground in 2016 and will decrease each year after that before expiring at the end of 2019. Solar’s tax credit, by contrast, doesn't start to decline until 2020, giving developers an incentive to focus on wind projects first.
The most popular wind power tax credit, which lasts for ten years, is worth 2.3 cents for every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced. After this year, however, the credit's value will drop by 20 percent each year for projects that start construction from 2017 through 2019.
The tax credit used most by solar developers is worth 30 percent of the value of the project and must be claimed entirely in the first year.
WINDS OF CHANGE
Competition from wind power is hitting solar companies that are already reeling from a global glut of panels. Prices have dropped 30 percent since the first half of 2016.
SunPower Corp (O:SPWR) and First Solar (O:FSLR) have both announced deep cost cuts and forecast a challenging market in 2017. Stocks in both companies have fallen to their lowest levels in nearly four years, with SunPower shares down 76 percent for the year and First Solar shares down 51 percent.
The number of new U.S. solar installations is expected to fall by 4 percent in 2017 - after rising 88 percent this year, according to GTM Research. A sharp decline in utility projects is expected to offset growth in residential and commercial systems. It would be the first annual decline in the industry's history, based on additions tracked back to 2000, GTM Research said.
As developers have scaled back solar plans, wind projects under construction are approaching record levels, and new power contracts for wind facilities are up 39 percent so far this year, according to the American Wind Energy Association.
Xcel Energy this year announced a major strategy to boost wind energy, with its Chief Executive Ben Fowke saying the cost of projects is lower now than it will be for at least a decade.
“This was the time to take advantage of wind,” he said. ""While it's on sale, let's get it.""
Xcel plans to spend $3.5 billion on renewables, mostly wind, over the next five years, more than double what it spent over the previous 10 years.
Fowke said he expects his company will focus on solar again in coming years, noting that some of its coal plants are scheduled to be retired after the wind credit becomes less attractive but before the solar tax credit is scaled back.
“Solar, just like wind, will continue to improve in cost,” he said. “The best time to bring on a lot of large scale solar will be towards the end of this decade.”
TURBINE TECHNOLOGY
Recent advances in turbine efficiency are also driving wind power development. Until recently, projects only made sense in the windiest areas.
""Now, wind projects can be built in areas of medium and lower wind speeds,"" said Navigant Research analyst Jesse Broehl.
Some wind farm owners plan to use the federal tax credit to replace older turbines, a practice known as repowering.
NextEra Energy, for instance, said in October that it will spend at least $2 billion to $2.5 billion on repowering projects over the next four years. The company also plans to develop up to 3.8 GW of wind projects over the next two years, compared with up to 1.3 GW of solar.
Those announcements and others should benefit turbine providers  General Electric  Co (N:GE),  Vestas Wind  Systems A/S (CO:VWS) and  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), which account for more than three quarters of the U.S. turbine market. In the third quarter, GE said it received $404 million in orders to repower U.S. wind turbines.

""Solar had its run of driving down cost,"" said Ed Zaelke, chair of the project finance practice at law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. ""Now wind is coming on strong with improvements in technology.""

1410,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 15, 2016 10:12AM ET</span>",Oil prices lower as dollar surges after Fed rate hike,"Investing.com - Oil prices fell on Thursday, adding to the previous session’s losses on the back of a broadly stronger U.S. dollar after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time in a year.
U.S. crude was trading at $50.28 a barrel at 10:09 ET, down 0.76 cents or 1.41% from its last close.
Global benchmark Brent futures were at $53.38 a barrel, down 52 cents or 0.96%.
The dollar surged to 14-year highs, after the Fed hiked interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday.
The rate hike was largely priced in by markets, but the dollar strengthened after the U.S. central bank predicted it would raise interest rates three times in 2017, up from the two hikes predicted in September.
A stronger dollar is bearish for crude, which is priced in the U.S. currency and becomes more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Oil prices had risen earlier in the day amid hopes that the global market will rebalance in 2017 as a result of planned output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC members.
Producers from outside OPEC agreed last week to cut output by 558,000 bpd from January 1, on top of a cut of 1.2 million bpd cut announced by OPEC on November 30.
The total reduction represents almost 2% of global oil output.
Prices had also received some support from a decline in U.S. crude stockpiles.
Crude oil inventories fell by 2.56 million barrels last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday.
That was compared to forecasts for a drawdown of 1.58 million barrels.
Stockpiles of gasoline and distillates also surprised to the downside, with gasoline stockpiles increasing by just 0.49 million barrels and distillates falling by 0.76 million barrels.

1412,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2016 06:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Cost of pump-at-will oil policy spurred Saudi OPEC U-turn,"By Rania El Gamal and Dmitry Zhdannikov
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has long said it could produce as much as 12 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil if needed, but that pump-at-will claim - which would require huge capital spending to access spare capacity - has never been tested. 
Sources say the kingdom may have stretched its current limits by extracting a record of around 10.7 million bpd this year, which could be one reason why Riyadh pushed so hard for a global deal to cut production.
Riyadh, the world's top oil exporter, felt the burn of cheap oil this year when crude was trading below $50 a barrel, as the reality of its costly war in Yemen and the task of shaking up its economy to create thousands of jobs began to sink in.
With tight resources, Saudi Arabia found itself weighing the prospect of investing billions of dollars to raise oil output further if it wanted to gain more market share under a strategy adopted in 2014.
Instead, cutting production amid a global glut and low prices to take the pressure off its oilfields, secure better reservoir management and save itself unnecessary expenses, seemed the perfect deal.
""You invest in raising your production when prices are high, not when they are low,"" a Saudi-based industry source said.
""Choices are tougher now. The question is, would the Saudi government with its tight budget put huge investment in raising production or put it somewhere else where it's needed more?""
Oil rose as much as 6.5 percent on Monday to an 18-month high after OPEC and some of its rivals reached their first deal since 2001 to reduce output jointly. On Thursday, oil (LCOc1) was trading above $54 a barrel.
Under the deal, Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, will from January cut output to around 10 million bpd - well below the 12 million bpd that the state has affirmed it can produce.
Saudi-based industry sources and market insiders say the kingdom cannot sustain historically high output for long. State oil giant Saudi Aramco has never tested 12 million bpd and would find it hard to keep the needed investments flowing with current low oil prices, they said.
Aramco, responding to a Reuters request for comment, said only that the company does not comment on current production levels. 
One source familiar with Aramco production management said the firm's capacity stood at 11.4 million bpd and it was still working to boost that figure to 12 million by 2018.
""Twelve million bpd has been planned since 2008-2010 and every annual budget worked towards that goal,"" the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
To achieve that goal, the company has annual operating expenses (opex) of $20 billion and capital expenditure (capex) at around $40 billion, the source said. ""When the 12 million bpd plan is achieved by 2018, the overall capex will fall to $20 billion,"" he added.
Aramco does not disclose its opex or capex figures.
SHIFT IN THINKING
In a note to clients in May, U.S. consultancy PIRA estimated Saudi Arabia's instantly available capacity at that time at 10.5 million bpd, after tracing expansion plans since 2008 and calculating an annual decline rate of 4 percent.
""Saudi Arabia could produce more but it would likely come at the expense of optimal reservoir practices. They could certainly bring on new fields but this is a lengthy process (years) and expensive as well,"" PIRA wrote.
""So far the kingdom is not adding any significant new producing capacity based on project announcements and rig activity but rather replacing the aforementioned 4 to 6 percent annual decline rate."" 
Saudi oil officials have said they can produce up to 12 million or even 12.5 million bpd if needed, particularly in the event of a sudden, global supply disruption.
Some say it is not a question of whether Saudi can do it, it is a matter of how soon.
Former oil minister Ali al-Naimi had said that to reach 12 million, Saudi Aramco would need 90 days to move rigs from exploration work to drill new wells and raise production.
Saudi Arabia has been working for most of this year towards boosting prices, rather than leaving that job to market forces, a shift from the strategy it had championed since November 2014. 
The pain of cheap oil was enough to bring other producers to the negotiating table, but industry sources said the kingdom was also keen to seal a deal as it plans to offload a stake in Aramco by 2018.
Riyadh's finances have been under pressure. With a big budget deficit last year, the kingdom was forced to seek new sources of income, including taxes and other fees and to cut spending.
The government is trying to boost non-oil revenue and modernize the economy through an ambitious reform plan called ""Vision 2030"", championed by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, of which the centerpiece is the Aramco stake sale. 

But ironically, before cutting dependence on oil, the kingdom needs revenues from crude sales to conduct its reforms.

Gold was trading at $1,132.05 a troy ounce by 10:40 GMT, down 2.63% at the weakest level since February 2.
Wednesday’s rate was largely priced in by markets, but the dollar surged after the U.S. central bank predicted it would raise interest rates three times in 2017, up from the two hikes predicted in September.
“Our decision to raise rates should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress the economy has made” and that it is expected to make, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.62% at 102.66, the most since January 2003.
Higher rates typically boost the dollar by making dollar assets more attractive to yield-seeking investors.
Both a strong dollar and higher interest rates are typically bearish for gold, which is denominated in dollars and struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when borrowing costs rise.
Gold prices have slumped more than 17% from highs hit mid-year, as expectations of higher rates, a stronger dollar and fading political uncertainty after the U.S. election weighed on the precious metal.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices stabilized on Thursday as a tighter market looms in 2017 due to planned output cuts led by OPEC and Russia, after sharp declines earlier following Wednesday's U.S. interest rate increase that drove investors out of commodities.
International Brent crude oil futures were trading at $53.93 a barrel at 0649 GMT, up 3 cents from their last close.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $50.96 per barrel, down 8 cents from their last settlement.
ANZ bank said on Thursday that oil markets would move into a substantial deficit in the first quarter of 2017 if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers led by Russia go through with their announced cuts of almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in output.
""This will likely push oil prices well above $60 per barrel early next year,"" it said.
Although traders said it remained unclear whether OPEC and other producers will follow through with their announced cuts, a tighter market will also be the result of years of falling investment into new production, as operators slashed costs in order to survive the low price environment.
""2017 will be the third year investments go down, with 3 percent (declines). You need to go back to the 80s to see three consecutive years of investment cuts,"" said Audun Martinsen, Vice President for Oilfield Service Research at Rystad Energy.

Thursday's more stable prices came after sharp declines late on Wednesday, when crude fell over 3 percent due to a strong dollar.
The greenback rose to close to 14-year highs against a basket of other currencies as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates for the first time in a year.
""The Federal Reserve hike ... saw bond yields rise, dealing a blow to commodities in general,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore.

A stronger dollar, in which oil is traded, can hit crude demand as it makes fuel purchases more expensive for countries using other currencies at home.

(Reuters) - Wind farms will be granted 30-year U.S. government permits that could allow for thousands of accidental eagle deaths due to collisions with company turbines, towers and electrical wires, U.S. wildlife managers said on Wednesday. 
The newly finalized rule, to go into effect on Jan. 15, extends the current five-year term for permits that allow for the accidental deaths of bald and golden eagles. The bald eagle is the national emblem of the United States. 
The permits, which are meant for any activity that could disturb or kill eagles but will mostly apply to wind farms, are required under federal law. 
Wind energy companies had sought the change from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, arguing they needed the longer permits to provide more stability to investors in the growing renewable power industry.
In 2013, the agency approved a similar plan extending ""eagle-take"" permits to 30 years, but a U.S. judge overturned it last year. The judge agreed with conservation groups that the agency had failed to properly assess the impact on federally protected eagle populations. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service has said the growth in many sectors of the U.S. energy industry coincides with a rising number of bald eagles as well as an apparent decline in golden eagles.
The agency concluded that the population of roughly 40,000 golden eagles in the United States could withstand the loss of about 2,000 birds annually. Bald eagles, estimated at more than 140,000, could sustain as many as 4,200 fatalities a year without endangering the species, it found.  
The number of eagles killed each year at wind facilities is not precisely known, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. An estimated 545 golden eagles are thought to perish annually from collisions with obstacles ranging from turbines to vehicles, the agency said.
The American Wind Energy Association said it hoped the new rule would provide “a workable permitting framework that gives the private sector necessary clarity” while maintaining healthy eagle populations.
Conservationists have said the longer permits threaten decades of protection that have saved the bald eagle from extinction.
The revised permit requires companies to hire a third party to collect data on eagle deaths rather than consultants hired by permit holders, a change hailed by Defenders of Wildlife, a backer of the measure. 
However Michael Hutchins of the American Bird Conservancy said he wants more details on actions Fish and Wildlife would take if permit holders exceed the number of eagles they are legally allowed to kill.
Companies that exceed allowable limits could face fines or legal action, but that is not specified enough, Hutchins said.
The National Audubon Society was also disappointed. ""As an organization we think a 30-year term is unreasonable, especially when we’re still learning about the impacts of wind and other technology on wildlife,"" said Sarah Greenberger, vice president for conservation.

""It becomes that much more critical to work together because we feel strongly we should be making a transition to renewable energy,"" she said. ""There’s a way to do that in a way that’s beneficial for our planet.""

1420,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 14, 2016 04:23PM ET</span>",Gold price dips on Fed interest rate decision,"Investing.com - The price of gold settled lower on Wednesday, at $1143.90, as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates.
The price of the commodity was down 1.54% at 3:54 p.m. Eastern today. By the end of the day, the precious metal had declined by $19.79, or 1.70%.
Gold is seen as a hedge against inflation historically.
Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, announced today that the central bank was raising interest rates by 0.25%, and that it planned three additional rate hikes next year. The second part of that announcement was unexpected, and took the market by surprise.
Yellen described the move as a ""very modest adjustment.""
But Wall Street didn't seem to see it that way, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring and then retreating on the news and the price of gold dropping to $1144.10 per troy ounce, losing nearly $15 per ounce, on trading today.
Yellen said by providing guidance that the Fed was planning three interest rate increases next year, she was trying to incorporate that kind of thinking into the attitudes of market traders, so they would not act with surprise, and roil markets, when the monetary policy events occur as planned next year.
Like other federal agencies, Yellen confirmed the Federal Reserve has been in touch with President-elect Trump's transition team.
A Trump landing team member yesterday exclusively told Investing.com that his team, and others, had this week wrapped up their research on the situation in the cabinet agencies, and were submitting the assessments to Trump and Vice President-elect Pence.
“We share the objective that the whole government has to work constructively to ensure a smooth transition,” said Yellen.
Yellen also said she believes the government should not entirely deconstruct the post-recession regulatory state, including, presumably, the controversial Dodd-Frank financial legislation which has impacted public companies the hardest.
“I feel that we lived through a devastating financial crisis that took a huge toll on our economy and most members of Congress and the public came away from that experience thinking it was important to take a set of steps that would result in a safer and stronger financial system,"" Yellen concluded.

The price of crude oil settled at $50.88 per barrel, a decline of 16 cents, or 0.31%. The price of Brent oil also declined on today's news, to $53.89, or 0.02%.
Right after the Fed's announcement, both West Texas crude oil and Brent oil were already down significantly.
During her press conference this afternoon, Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, said, in remarks which appeared to sway the market, there was “considerable uncertainty” about possible policy changes and the potential economic effects of those changes as President-elect Donald Trump and new Republican Congress prepare to take office.
Those changes will be factored into the Fed’s decisions and outlook starting next month.
“We’re operating under a cloud of uncertainty at the moment,” Yellen said.
Financial-market moves since the election – increasing stock prices and higher long-term interest rates, as well as a stronger dollar and higher oil prices – point to the fact that investors expect expansionary fiscal policies.
“But market participants are uncertain, too,” she said.
The Fed chair would not respond to questions about the market rally since the presidential election. ""I really don’t want to comment on the level of stock prices,"" she said.
But Yellen said the markets did seem consistent with other economic indicators, indicating that there was no irrational expectations bubble at this time on Wall Street.

LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC on Wednesday signaled a growing oil supply surplus next year unless members implement their deal to curb output from record levels and outside producers also deliver on cutback pledges made at the weekend.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 33.87 million barrels per day (bpd) last month, according to figures OPEC collects from secondary sources, up 150,000 bpd from October, OPEC said in a monthly report.
OPEC's own figures show the group's output has continued to rise, adding to a global glut, ahead of the January start of its first supply cut agreement since 2008. This could raise questions about its ability to comply fully with the deal.
But OPEC was hopeful that supply curbs pledged by Russia and other non-members at the weekend, in addition to its own reductions, will tackle the surplus and support prices, which at $55 a barrel (LCOc1) are still half the level of mid-2014.
The non-OPEC cuts should help to ""accelerate the reduction of global inventories and bring forward the rebalancing of the oil market to the second half of 2017,"" OPEC said in the report.
To speed it up, OPEC last month finalised a plan to cut output by about 1.20 million bpd from Jan. 1 to 32.50 million bpd. On Saturday, non-member countries pledged curbs of around 560,000 bpd in the first such move since 2001.
The report is the latest to show output hitting new peaks. The November OPEC production figure is the highest since at least 2008, according to a Reuters review of past OPEC reports. 
OPEC's figures show more than two-thirds of November's extra barrels came from Libya and Nigeria, both of which are exempt from cutting output because their production has been curbed by conflict. Total output is 1.37 million bpd above the new target.
In the report, OPEC raised its forecast of non-OPEC supply slightly in 2017 to 300,000 bpd, although it said the forecast was under review following Saturday's meeting.
With the demand for OPEC crude in 2017 expected to average 32.63 million bpd, the report indicates there will be an average surplus of 1.24 million bpd if OPEC keeps output steady. Last month's report pointed to a 950,000 bpd surplus.

OPEC did not give a detailed forecast of the outlook if all parties cut supply as promised. The International Energy Agency said on Tuesday the market could show a shortfall of 600,000 bpd early next year in this scenario.

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2016 07:32AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Maersk, DONG oil and gas merger talks stall over price - sources","By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Ron Bousso
COPENHAGEN/LONDON (Reuters) - Talks between shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) and DONG Energy (CO:DENERG) to merge their oil and gas business have stalled after the two Danish firms could not agree on a price, industry and banking sources said on Wednesday.
The breakdown in talks aimed at creating a joint company worth more than $10 billion may open the door for other bids for DONG's operations, which it is spinning off as it moves away from fossil fuels to focus on offshore wind, the sources said.
Maersk entered talks with DONG in November after announcing plans to merge or spin off its energy assets as part of a major restructuring to shift the company's focus to its transport and logistics businesses.
The development will be a blow for Maersk, which said on Tuesday it may consider selling assets or cutting dividends as it seeks to retain its credit rating, which is at risk. 
In June, Maersk announced it had lost a major oil production contract in Qatar, adding to capital pressures. 
Several private equity funds, including EIG Global Energy Partners, have shown interest in DONG, according to banking sources.
Maersk, DONG and EIG were not immediately available to comment.
This was the second merger attempt of the two businesses in recent years, the sources said. 
Bringing together the two Danish companies' oil and gas divisions was seen by many in the industry as a natural fit, creating a company focused on the UK and Norwegian North Sea. 
But they were unable to agree on the valuation of their assets and the terms of the merger, several sources close to the talks said.
The negotiations were unlikely to resume ""any time soon"", according to one source.
Maersk's Baa1 credit rating was put under review for a downgrade by Moody's in September. Last month, Standard & Poor's lowered the company's credit rating to BBB from BBB+ with a negative outlook.
Maersk said separately this week its planned acquisition of German shipping company Hamburg Süd will replace some 60 percent of revenue lost when the group spins off its energy division.
Nevertheless,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a note this week that all of Maersk's energy units remained under pressure due to sluggish markets and finding ways to cut costs.
Deal making in the North Sea has slowed in the past few years partly as a result of a global oil price slump and a sharp rise in the number of assets offered for sale in the aging basin. Companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), ConocoPhillips (N:COP) and French utility Engie (PA:ENGIE) are seeking to sell their North Sea operations.
DONG produced 89,000 barrels of oil and gas per day in 2016, down from 115,000 barrels daily last year. Its main producing assets include the Ormen Lange, Syd Arne and Laggan-Tormore fields.

Maersk Oil produced an average of 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the first nine months of 2016. It suffered a major setback when Qatar chose not to extend its 25-year license to operate the giant Al Shaheen field and award it from 2017 to  Total  (PA:TOTF).

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday following a reported rise in U.S. crude inventories and an estimate that OPEC may have produced more crude in November than previously thought, potentially undermining a planned output cut. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were down 69 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $52.29 a barrel at 0809 GMT.
International Brent crude futures were down 60 cents, or 1.08 percent, at $55.12 per barrel.
Traders said the price falls followed a report of surprise increases in U.S. crude inventories.
Markets were also focused on an anticipated U.S. interest rate hike that would likely boost the dollar, making dollar-traded fuel imports more expensive for countries using other currencies at home.
""Momentum continues to wane in oil markets with both Brent and WTI slightly lower overnight, following higher than expected API inventory numbers in the United States ... (which) showed an unexpectedly large increase of 4.7 million barrels,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA brokerage in Singapore.
""We expect Asia trading to have a slightly negative bias as traders trim longs into the Federal Reserves' main event this evening,"" he added, referring to the U.S. central bank's expected decision later on Wednesday to hike interest rates.
Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at foreign exchange and futures brokerage AxiTrader said that ""traders pretty much have a Fed increase of 25 basis points locked and loaded.""
Oil traders said prices were further depressed by a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) which said it believes that producer club OPEC pumped about 34.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in November, 500,000 bpd above OPEC's official estimate, which was already a record. 
If true, that would undermine the effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers like Russia to cut almost 1.8 million bpd of production in a bid to end two years of oversupply and cheap oil. 
The agency said global oil supply rose to a record 98.2 million bpd in November, with OPEC's production offsetting declines elsewhere.
This stands against expectations of 96.95 million bpd of global oil demand for the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Despite this, the IEA said that due to firm demand increases, oil markets could show a shortfall of 600,000 bpd early next year if producers stick to their reduction plans.

Also potentially bullish for crude and fuel demand was a report that China will extend a tax cut on small-engine vehicles to 2017, rather than allowing it to expire at year's end as planned.

The IEA said Russia, which joined in the production curb effort, and China would lead increased global demand for crude oil, raising its forecast for 2017 by 110,000 bpd to 1.3 million bpd. The increased demand if realized would jibe with a move by OPEC at the end of November to cut its output by 1.3 million bpd in the first half of 2017, and key non-OPEC producers agreed last weekend to add another 558,000 bpd in cuts.
However, compliance in sticking to the curbs are key, according to analysts, with doubts in the market that OPEC members will adhere.

""We are going to respect the professional and scientific integrity and independence of our employees at our labs and across our department,"" he added. ""We will be forthcoming with all publicly available information with the transition team. We will not be providing any individual names to the transition team.""
He added that the request ""left many in our workforce unsettled.""
Andrew Rosenberg, an official at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the Energy Department ""made the right choice in refusing this absurd and dangerous request. Federal agencies need the best available science to respond to the growing risk of climate change.""
Reuters reported late Monday that former Texas Governor Rick Perry is expected to be named by Trump to run the Energy Department. The agency employs more than 90,000 people working on nuclear weapons maintenance and research labs, nuclear energy, advanced renewable energy, batteries and climate science.
The memo sought a list of all department employees or contractors who have attended any meetings on the social cost of carbon, a measurement that federal agencies use to weigh the costs and benefits of new energy and environmental regulations. It also asked for all publications written by employees at the department's 17 national laboratories for the past three years.
Trump transition officials declined to comment on the memo.
""This feels like the first draft of an eventual political enemies list,"" a Department of Energy employee, who asked not to be identified because he feared a reprisal by the Trump transition team, had told Reuters.
Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman, said in a news briefing on Tuesday that the queries ""could have been an attempt to target civil servants,"" including ""scientists and lawyers and other experts who are critical to the success of the federal government's ability to make policy."" 
By design, their work transcends the term of any one president, Earnest said. 
Trump, a Republican, said during his election campaign that climate change was a hoax perpetrated by China to damage U.S. manufacturing. He said he would rip up last year's landmark global climate deal struck in Paris that was signed by President Barack Obama.
Since winning the Nov. 8 election, however, Trump has said he will keep an ""open mind"" about the Paris deal. He also met with former Vice President Al Gore, a strong advocate for action on climate change. 

After that meeting, he picked Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a climate change skeptic, to head the Environmental Protection Agency.

The price of Brent oil, meantime, settled down 11 cents from yesterday's price at $55.72. The percentage point decrease was approximately 0.10%.
Oil futures were supported by a powerful demand from Asia.
Production cuts were promised by Kuwait, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.
The closing price was a 17-month high for West Texas oil.
Some analysts said that many investors were taking profits today based on recent market gains. The gains were driven by production cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC countries. The countries are cutting oil production by a combined 1.8 million barrels per day.
According to these analysts, the market, overall, will still be influenced by the oil production cuts.
Many investors and analysts are skeptical that all oil producing parties will adhere to the planned cuts.
One signal that producers are acting on their plans to cut output, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company told investors it is reducing Murban and Upper Zakum crude supplies by 5% and Das crude exports by 3%.
Kuwait's Petroleum Corporation (KPC) also on Tuesday briefed investors of a coming cut in its contractual crude oil supplies for January of 2017."

A leading gold analyst said this fall's overall decline is the price of the precious metal is similar to the scenario that played out last year. Back then, gold fell 18%, and then surged 24%.
The significant price decline happed before the Fed meeting where interest rates were increased last year, and then the price recovered and gained ground after that.
Analysts said the commodity will, based on this historic pattern, likely rally during the next five months. The increase could be by as much as 16%.
The rise in prices will continue until the Chinese New Year, which coincides with the commercial peak of production for gold. China is now the world's leading consumer of gold, the world's fourth most liquid asset.
Inflation will also be a factor for gold. Analysts believe markets are ""underestimating inflation"" by 30 to 50 basis points. Thus, the mathematical probability of a rally is extremely high, as the consensus is that inflation is going to be higher next year, analysts said.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2016 12:40PM ET</span>","After Alaska flop, Shell's search for oil moves closer to home","By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - In the waters off Malaysia, Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) is finding gas quickly and cheaply to replenish depleting fields where only a few years ago geologists had lost hope of discovering any new reserves.
The Anglo-Dutch group is combining the latest technology with the wisdom of industry veterans to unlock new oil and gas deposits where it already operates, usually within 20 km (12 miles) of existing platforms.
The result has been a string of finds which, while modest in size, can generate cash rapidly to suit an era of drastically reduced exploration budgets across the energy industry.
After a costly flop in Alaska, Shell has turned away from giant ""frontier"" projects, focusing instead on exploring closer to home, such as in Malaysia where it has been producing oil for more than a century. Many of its rivals are following suit.
""With new data, new seismic and new brain power you can find extraordinary amount of hydrocarbons for the future,"" Ceri Powell, Shell's head of exploration, told Reuters.
Analysts say the industry will still need large discoveries in areas where the risk of failure is greater, but the cheaper and easier approach is paying dividends in the short term. 
State-of-the-art technology such as 3-dimensional seismic imaging enabled Shell to unlock new prospects that quickly led to a string of discoveries, transforming the region off the Malaysian state of Sarawak into one of its most prolific basins.
Breaking with decades of traditional drilling techniques which used rudimentary technology, Shell combined the use of sonar waves with satellite images and super computers to pinpoint oil and gas deposits beneath layers of salt in rock.
This has proved so effective that Shell moved from holding only one exploration license in shallow waters off Malaysia in 2013 to nine now, searching at greater depths and further offshore than ever.
Today, it is exploring 27,000 square km (10,500 square miles) off Sarawak for oil and gas. It has made 16 discoveries in the last 28 months that unlocked one billion barrels of oil equivalent. Shell and other oil companies, including state-run Petronas (KL:PETR), now plan to map geologically the entire Malaysian coast.
Shell, like many of its peers including  BP  (L:BP) and  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM), have been forced into such strategies as the chances of finding new and huge reservoirs in hitherto unexplored frontier areas has diminished.
Per Magnus Nysveen, head of analysis at Oslo-based consultancy Rystad Energy, said the average distance of exploration wells to the closest fields fell from 113 km (70 miles) in 2015 to just 29 km in 2016 and is set to drop further next year.
Hugely expensive and risky frontier projects are often falling from favor due to the sharp decline in global oil prices since mid-2014 - which has made energy firms slash their exploration budgets - and the new supplies from cheaper sources ranging from U.S. shale deposits to the Malaysian discoveries.
Last year, Shell angered investors when it wrote down $7 billion after failing to find any oil or gas in the pristine Chukchi sea off Alaska's northwest coast. This followed years of complex work and a rig accident that drew heavy criticism from environmental activists.
The rate of successful exploration has dropped sharply in the last decade, with the proportion of projects finding any oil or gas down from around 40 percent to about 30 percent, according Andrew Latham, vice president of exploration at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Fewer than half of the finds go into commercial production.
Across the industry, exploration budgets have sunk to $40 billion in 2016 from $95 billion two years earlier. Shell's spending dropped to less than $2 billion from around $5 billion.
""In the last two years, intense focus on new seismic and relooking at the basins that we have in our portfolio already is really paying dividends,"" said Powell, a geologist who joined Shell in 1990 and became head of exploration three years ago.
She is now applying the techniques used in Malaysia to other hubs such as Brunei and Egypt, where seismic imaging, advanced rigs and super computers are giving them a new lease of life.
Falling costs in some areas are also helping to stretch the tight exploration budgets. The cost of hiring vessels for seismic surveys has dropped around 60 percent from late 2013 to around $140,000 per day, according to Shell, which is using this to expand and accelerate its seismic plans into 2017 and 2018. 
DOGMAS
It's not only technology that has helped to turn around the fortunes of the exploration business. Several times a year Powell brings industry veterans, some of them retired, together with the new generation of geologists.
The idea is to combine the experience and instincts of the old-school explorers with the younger generation's technological know-how to come up with ideas on where to find new reserves and how to unlock them.
""You put them all in one room and they look at the dogmas. They think about the wells they would have drilled in 1972 but didn't and why, and it has been astonishing."" In Oman, where Shell has been exploring for 60 years, this exercise helped to identify six new geological prospects in a week, she said.
These brainstorming sessions have only one rule: to concentrate minds, no computers are allowed.
But while drilling closer to home is attractive in the short term, it comes at the expense of huge discoveries such as Exxon's Liza field in Guyana and Eni's (MI:ENI) Zohr in Egypt. These are crucial for replacing a natural decline of oil and gas reserves that in some reservoirs can reach 10 percent a year.
""Lead times are shorter and the value per oil equivalent is higher, but the cons are that discoveries are smaller. In general we would expect the largest discoveries to be coming from new plays and new frontiers, as has happened in recent years,"" said Latham.
Wood Mackenzie expects global exploration activity to accelerate in 2017 as oil prices recover.
RAPID CASH
While the Alaskan project failed, Shell added huge resources in Brazil, Australia, Egypt and southeast Asia to its reserves by buying BG Group in February for $54 billion. 
This means it can now allocate around 80 percent of its exploration budget to areas up to only 20 km from existing platforms. In some cases, such as in Brunei, an exploration well can be completed and linked to production within days. 
""Those will not necessarily be giant discoveries but (will be) very efficient and very rapid to get to production, and therefore to cash,"" Powell said. In the past six years exploration has added 6.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent to Shell's reserves, which reached 11.75 billion at the end of 2015, while the time from exploration to production has come down significantly, she added.
Other oil majors have adopted similar strategies. BP has begun drilling hundreds of meters below a reservoir produced by the Ravenspurn ST2 platform in the southern North Sea, searching for a new gas resource that could transform a basin first exploited 50 years ago and extend the life of infrastructure.
For Shell, the success of the new strategy and the Alaskan failure mean it will not return to frontier areas in the near future, but Powell still sees opportunities for big discoveries in the likes of west Africa, Namibia, South Africa, Uruguay, eastern Canada.

Global benchmark Brent futures were at $55.45 a barrel, down 24 cents or 0.43%.
Prices retreated from the highs hit on Monday as traders took profits after the strong gains, but the market remained broadly supported by the deal to cut output.
Over the weekend, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers on reached their first deal since 2001 on coordinated production cuts.
Producers from outside OPEC agreed to cut output by 558,000 barrels per day from January 1, the largest ever output cut by non-OPEC nations.
Russia pledged to undertake the bulk of the cuts, reducing production by 300,000 bpd.
This was on top of a cut of 1.2 million bpd cut announced by OPEC on November 30.
The output cuts will come into effect on January 1 and the oil producers will reconvene in six months to assess the deal.
The total reduction represents almost 2% of global oil output.
Global oil inventories could start to draw in the first half of 2017 if OPEC and non-OPEC producers follow through on an agreement to cut output, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday.
The agency’s monthly oil market report also said global oil demand will rise more strongly than expected this year and next year.
It lifted its forecast for global oil demand growth this year by 120,000 bpd to 1.4 million bpd and its forecast for 2017 by 110,000 bpd to 1.3 million bpd.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices were stable on Tuesday, supported by strong demand in Asia and a supply cut by Abu Dhabi as part of production curbs organized by OPEC and other exporters.
But traders said the market was being pressured by investors closing financial positions that profited from strong gains the day before.
International Brent (LCOc1) and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (CLc1) both flirted with negative territory in early European trading. By 0945 GMT, Brent was up 26 cents at $55.95, while WTI was up 12 cents $52.95. 
Traders said there was significant profit-taking after oil shot to mid-2015 highs earlier this week after the Middle East-led Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other exporters led by Russia reached a deal to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to reduce oversupply.
But they added that oil markets were still broadly supported by the deal to crimp output.
""The market is putting a lot of importance on the commentaries coming out of OPEC and non-OPEC (and) the market is giving OPEC the benefit of the doubt that cuts will be implemented and achieved,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at Sydney's CMC Markets.
However, he added that prices would ""turn negative very quickly if the market feels compliance won't happen"".
""The plan was designed on Nov. 30. The foundation was laid down on Dec. 10. The construction will start on Jan. 1. The following 3-6 months will provide us with an answer as to whether the foundation is strong enough to hold the building or will it collapse like a house of cards,"" PVM analysts said in a report. 
In a sign that producers are acting on their plans to cut output, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) told customers it would reduce Murban and Upper Zakum crude supplies by 5 percent and Das crude exports by 3 percent.
Kuwait's Petroleum Corporation (KPC) did similar, notifying its customers of a cut in their contractual crude oil supplies for January.
Meanwhile, China's November crude output fell 9 percent on a year earlier to 3.915 million bpd , data showed on Tuesday, but recovered from October's 3.78 million bpd, which was the lowest in more than seven years.
That came as China's refinery throughput hit a daily record in November of 11.14 million bpd, up 3.4 percent year-on-year.
""Declines in Chinese ... crude oil output and expansion of its strategic crude reserves underpin our view for China's crude oil imports to strengthen over the coming quarters,"" said BMI Research.

This deal followed OPEC's Nov. 30 pact to cut output by 1.2 million bpd for six months from Jan.1. Saudi Arabia will cut around 486,000 bpd to reduce the supply glut that has dispirited markets for years.
Crude futures have rallied sharply, with U.S. oil futures gaining 23% since the middle of last month as optimism that an agreement would be reached started to increase.
Some observers believe the market may be irrationally exuberant, given the expectation that various producers would not comply with the cuts, as promised.
At mid-day, in the U.S., the price of crude oil was $53.07, an increase of 3.05%, a significant percentage point increase in the price of the commodity since settlement on Friday.
Additionally, at mid-day, the price of Brent Oil was $55.84, an increase of 2.38% over Friday's settlement price.
Today's price is about 50% higher than at this time last year, signaling the biggest year-on-year rise on any single day for more than five years.
If prices move higher than $60 per barrel, Emmanuel Kachikwu, the Nigerian oil minister, said shuttered shale production facilities in the U.S. might come online quickly to compete with oil."
1452,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 12, 2016 10:47AM ET</span>",Oil prices hit 17-month highs on output cut deal,"Investing.com - Oil prices surged on Monday, hitting the highest levels since July 2015 after major oil producers reached a deal over the weekend to cut output in a bid to rebalance the oversupplied global market.
U.S. crude was trading at $54.01 a barrel at 10.39 ET, up $1.92 or 3.75% from its last close, after rising as high as $54.48 earlier.
Global benchmark Brent futures were at $56.27 a barrel, up $1.93 or 3.55%, off an intra-day high of $57.25.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers, including Russia, on Saturday reached their first deal since 2001 on coordinated production cuts to rein in oversupply and drive prices higher.
Producers from outside OPEC agreed to cut output by 558,000 barrels per day, short of the initial target of 600,000 bpd, but still the largest ever output cut by non-OPEC nations. Of that, Russia will cut 300,000 bpd.
The agreement came after OPEC late last month announced plans to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day from January 1.
Oil prices received an additional boost after top OPEC exporter Saudi Arabia indicated that it may be prepared to make deeper cuts than the 486,000-barrel cut it had originally pledged in the November 30 meeting.
Oil prices have climbed above $50 a barrel since OPEC agreed on its first production cut since 2008 aimed at propping up prices after a two year slump.
Oil production has been outstripping consumption by between one to two million barrels per day since late 2014.
But doubts have emerged over how effective the cuts will be at rebalancing the market with some analysts skeptical on the ability of major producers to adhere to output limits.
Some analysts have also warned that the cuts are likely to cause other producers, particularly U.S. shale drillers, to quickly ramp up output as prices rise."

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose by as much as 6.5 percent on Monday to an 18-month high after OPEC and some of its rivals reached their first deal since 2001 to jointly reduce output to try to tackle global oversupply and boost prices.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were up $1.97 at $56.30 per barrel by 1401 GMT, having hit a session peak of $57.89, the highest since July 2015.
The price is 50 percent higher than at this time last year, marking the largest year-on-year rise on any given day since September 2011.
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) were up $1.97 at $53.47 a barrel.
""OPEC have taken a very important step towards stopping the relentless build up in global stock levels and speeding up the rebalancing process, as long as compliance is strong, Libya and Nigeria fail to rebound and U.S. producers take time to respond,"" PVM Oil Associates strategist David Hufton said.
However, ""as things stand today, no cuts have been made and production is in fact still rising ... from a fundamental point of view, it is difficult to justify the front-end price surge other than that is where the liquidity is and where speculative players, moving in herds, always prefer to place their bets.""
After nearly a year of wrangling, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on Nov. 30 to cut output by 1.2 million bpd for six months from Jan. 1, with top exporter Saudi Arabia cutting around 486,000 bpd to curb the oversupply that has dogged markets for two years.
On Saturday, producers from outside OPEC, led by Russia, agreed to reduce output by 558,000 bpd, short of the target of 600,000 bpd but still the largest contribution by non-OPEC ever.
But for the deal to be effective, all parties must stick to their word, analysts said.
""We believe that the observation of the OPEC-11 and non-OPEC 11 production cuts is required to sustainably support... oil prices to our 1H17 WTI price forecast of $55 a barrel,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.
""This forecast reflects an effective 1.0 million barrels per day (bpd) cut vs. the 1.6 million bpd announced cut and greater compliance to the announced cuts is therefore an upside risk to our forecasts.""
Goldman Sachs forecast full compliance would be worth an extra $6 per barrel to its price forecast.
Higher prices raise the chances of other producers increasing output.

""There are too many moving parts for OPEC’s new policy to be sustainable in the long term. The strategy is bound to overshoot, in our view, leading to lower prices in the second half of next year,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note on Monday.

1455,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2016 08:00AM ET</span>","Iraq to abide by OPEC cut, expects output growth in future","By Rania El Gamal
VIENNA (Reuters) - Iraq is committed to cutting its production to comply with a global pact to support prices, the country's oil minister said, adding he was nevertheless confident OPEC's No. 2 producer has the potential to boost its output in coming years.
Iraq is reviewing several options to implement the reduction, including cuts from Kirkuk oilfield, southern fields being developed by oil majors or other state-run areas, Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said in an interview.
""The cuts will aim at the figures we agreed with OPEC definitely, but (for) the areas of the cuts there are many options on the table,"" Luaibi told Reuters on Saturday.
Last month, OPEC agreed to cut output by 1.2 million bpd from January 2017. Baghdad, which has called to be exempted from OPEC restrictions as it needs the income to fight Islamic State, would reduce its output by around 200,000 barrels per day to 4.351 million bpd.
Luaibi said his ministry was in discussions with foreign companies operating Iraq's giant southern fields to implement some cuts during scheduled maintenance.
""Some IOCs will have maintenance requirements in some limited places in some fields... so this is a good opportunity to do them,"" he said.
Iraq's production in December will be slightly higher than November's, Luaibi said.
""I can assure you that our production, I am talking with confidence, has reached the level of 4.8 million bpd.""
Iraq has accepted a lower production reference level as part of the OPEC deal that estimated its output at 4.561 million bpd. 
Luaibi said Baghdad has agreed to a lower level estimate because ""We want OPEC to unite, so the oil price and the global market balance and improve.""
""But at the back of our minds, we are confident that this was not (the) real production level, however, we hope this would be compensated with the improvement of the prices,"" he said.
BUILDING CAPACITY
Iraq has signed deals with majors such as  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM),  BP  (LON:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) to develop its fields. Production has almost doubled to around 4.7 million bpd this year, from 2.4 million bpd at the start of the decade.
But the growth has lagged the initial forecasts of production at 9 million bpd by 2018, rivaling Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter and OPEC's biggest producer. 
Held back by red tape, infrastructure constraints and difficult contract terms, Iraq is now targeting a more modest 5.5 million to 6 million bpd by 2020.
Oil companies operate in the southern oilfields under service contracts, whereby they are paid a fixed dollar fee for additional volumes produced. Iraq has been in talks with the companies to link the fees they receive to crude prices.
Luaibi said some companies are asking for revisions in some clauses of the contracts and his ministry was working with a consultancy in Finland over the revised contracts. 
""We will see something new happening in 2017 that would please the IOCs and safeguard our interests,"" he said.
Luaibi, who became oil minister earlier this year and has served previously as director general of South Oil Company which produces most of the nation's oil, has made boosting Iraq's production a priority. 
He said Iraq's target was to boost its output potential to 6 million by 2020. ""I think the 9 million bpd will be sort of appropriate after 2030,"" he said. 
To help Iraq reach that target, it needs water injection to enhance oil recovery, and a crucial multi-billion-dollar water project that has been delayed for years is now being revived with a capacity of 5 million bpd of water.

""We put it on a fast-track,"" Luaibi said, adding there will be a tender ""within this month, if not, then next month.""

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2016 05:13AM ET</span>","Oil output cut deal aimed at inventories, not just raising prices: Goldman Sachs","(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said the formal agreement by non-OPEC oil producers this weekend in Vienna to help curb output was reached with a goal of ""normalization"" of inventories and not necessarily just at raising oil prices. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had previously agreed to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), and on Saturday, 11 non-OPEC producers agreed to join the effort and reduce output by 558,000 bpd. 
The cut was short of an initial target of 600,000 bpd but still the first OPEC/non-OPEC output deal since 2001 and the largest contribution by non-OPEC producers ever. 
""Despite the smaller-than-preannounced cut, the agreement is nonetheless noteworthy as it lifts the uncertainty on the potential participation of non-OPEC producers to the OPEC cut,"" the bank said in a note on Sunday. 
The agreement was followed by comments from top exporter Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid Al-Falih saying that the kingdom may be willing to cut output to below 10 million bpd. 
The world's top oil exporter told OPEC it pumped a record 10.72 million bpd last month, an OPEC source said, up from 10.625 million bpd in October. 
Goldman said an announced production cut from Russia was likely to remain short of the 300,000 bpd promised, noting that Russia's participation was important.
Goldman said implementation of the coordinated OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts was required to support spot oil prices at its H1 2017 price forecast of $55/bbl for West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1). [O/R] 
A better-than-expected compliance would initially lead to higher prices, ""with full compliance worth an additional $6/bbl to our price forecast,"" it said.
The bank warned, however, that as WTI prices neared $55 a barrel, that producers, especially in the United States, might begin to raise their output. 

""Ultimately, this remains a short duration cut in our view, targeting excess inventories and not high oil prices,"" Goldman said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rick Perry, who proposed eliminating the U.S. Energy Department during his unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, has emerged as a leading candidate to head the agency under President-elect Donald Trump, a transition official said on Sunday.
Democratic U.S. Senators Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia also are in the running for the job as Trump continues to fill key positions in his administration ahead of taking office on Jan. 20, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Perry served as governor of Texas, a leading oil-producing state, from 2000 when he succeeded President George W. Bush until 2015. In his two unsuccessful presidential runs, he touted his record of job creation in the second-most-populous state.
Perry's proposal to scrap the Energy Department caused what has become known as his ""oops"" moment during a November 2011 debate when he could not remember the departments he wanted to eliminate.
""It's three agencies of government when I get there that are gone: commerce, education and the um, what's the third one there? Let's see,"" Perry said.
His debate adversaries tried to prod his memory, but Perry ultimately gave up, saying, ""I can't. The third one, I can't. Sorry. Oops."" It was the Energy Department, which is responsible for U.S. energy policy and oversees the nation's nuclear weapons program.
Perry also ran for the 2016 presidential nomination against Trump but dropped out in September 2015 after gaining little traction. Perry initially was a fierce critic of Trump but later endorsed Trump and called him ""the people's choice.""
In July 2015, Perry said: ""Let no one be mistaken: Donald Trump's candidacy is a cancer on conservatism, and it must be clearly diagnosed, excised and discarded.""
If Perry gets the job, it would be further indication that the incoming Trump administration may be friendly toward the fossil fuel industry.
Trump is set to pick U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a climate-change skeptic and an advocate for expanded oil and gas development, to head the Interior Department.
Trump's pick for the Environmental Protection Agency is Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, an ardent opponent of President Barack Obama's measures to curb climate change who has sued the EPA to block in a bid to undo a key regulation to curb greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from coal-fired power plants.

And Trump is expected to name Rex Tillerson, chief executive of oil giant  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), as secretary of state.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia pumped record-high amounts of oil in November, amid talks over a global deal to cut production, defying market expectations of lower output on slower domestic demand and refinery maintenance.
The world's top oil exporter told the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries it pumped 10.72 million barrels per day last month, an OPEC source said, up from 10.625 million bpd in October.
In July, the kingdom's production was 10.67 million bpd, the previous high.
Iraq said its November output was 4.8 million bpd, up from 4.776 million bpd in October, another OPEC source said, as oil exports reached a record high of 4.051 million bpd.
Gulf OPEC member Kuwait reported output at 2.9 million bpd in November, lower than its 3 million bpd in October, while the United Arab Emirates kept its output virtually steady at 3.195 million bpd, according to official figures reported to OPEC.
Saudi Arabia has pledged to reduce its output to 10.058 million bpd as part of an OPEC deal reached on Nov. 30 to lower the group's production to 32.5 million bpd. 
The rise in November means Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, will have a bigger task in complying with a plan to cut supply starting in 2017 - its first production-reduction deal since 2008.
Saudi crude exports have been high in recent months, reaching 7.812 million bpd in September, while output has stayed at elevated levels despite the usual seasonal decline in winter when domestic consumption of crude burning for power is less. 
A Reuters survey estimated Saudi production in November at 10.45 million bpd due to reduced crude use in power plants for air-conditioning, and lower refining.
A Platts OPEC survey in November estimated Saudi oil production at 10.52 million bpd.
OPEC and non-OPEC producers on Saturday reached their first deal since 2001 to curtail oil output jointly and ease a global glut after more than two years of low prices.
With the deal finally signed after almost a year of arguing within OPEC, the market's focus will now switch to compliance.
OPEC has a long history of cheating on output quotas. The fact that Nigeria and Libya were exempt from the deal due to production-denting civil strife will further pressure OPEC leader Saudi Arabia to shoulder the bulk of supply reductions.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the kingdom may be willing to cut to below 10.058 million bpd next year.

Global benchmark Brent futures were at $54.36 a barrel, up 47 cents or 0.87% on London’s ICE Futures Exchange.
Oil prices have climbed above $50 a barrel since OPEC agreed on its first production cut since 2008, aimed at reining in massive oversupply that has seen prices more than halve since mid-2014.

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2016 12:57PM ET</span>","OPEC, non-OPEC agree first global oil pact since 2001","By Vladimir Soldatkin, Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler
VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC and non-OPEC producers on Saturday reached their first deal since 2001 to curtail oil output jointly and ease a global glut after more than two years of low prices that overstretched many budgets and spurred unrest in some countries. 
With the deal finally signed after almost a year of arguing within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and mistrust in the willingness of non-OPEC Russia to play ball, the market's focus will now switch to compliance with the agreement.
OPEC has a long history of cheating on output quotas. The fact that Nigeria and Libya were exempt from the deal due to production-denting civil strife will further pressure OPEC leader Saudi Arabia to shoulder the bulk of supply reductions.
Russia, which 15 years ago failed to deliver on promises to cut in tandem with OPEC, is expected to perform real output reductions this time. But analysts question whether many other non-OPEC producers are attempting to present a natural decline in output as their contribution to the deal.
""This agreement cements and prepares us for long-term cooperation,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters after the meeting, calling the deal ""historic"".
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told the same news conference: ""Today's deal will speed up the oil market stabilization, reduce volatility, attract new investments.""
Last week, OPEC agreed to slash output by 1.2 million barrels per day from Jan. 1, with top exporter Saudi Arabia cutting as much as 486,000 bpd. 
On Saturday, producers from outside the 13-country group agreed to reduce output by 558,000 bpd, short of the initial target of 600,000 bpd, but still the largest contribution by non-OPEC ever. Of that, Russia will cut 300,000 bpd.
""They are all enjoying higher prices and compliance tends to be good in the early stages. But then as prices continue to rise, compliance will erode,"" said veteran OPEC watcher and founder of Pira Energy consultancy Gary Ross. 
Amrita Sen from consultancy Energy Aspects said: ""Compared to two months ago when the prospects of a deal were fading rapidly, this is a huge turnaround. Skeptics will argue about compliance but the symbolism in itself cannot be understated."" 
Ross added that OPEC would target an oil price of $60 per barrel as anything above that could encourage rival production.
TWO YEARS OF PAIN
Oil prices have more than halved in the past two years after Saudi Arabia raised output steeply in an attempt to drive higher-cost producers such as U.S. shale firms out of the market.
The plunge in oil to below $50 per barrel - and sometimes even below $30 - from as high as $115 in mid-2014 has helped reduce growth in U.S. shale output.
But it also hit the revenues of oil-dependent economies including Saudi Arabia and Russia, prompting the two largest exporters of crude to start their first oil cooperation talks in 15 years.
Apart from Russia, the talks on Saturday were attended by or had comments or commitments sent from non-OPEC members Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bolivia, Brunei, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Sudan and South Sudan.
Novak said OPEC and the non-OPEC countries at the meeting were responsible for 55 percent of global output. Their joint reduction of around 1.8 million bpd would account to about 2 percent of global oil supply.
Many non-OPEC countries such as Mexico and Azerbaijan face a natural drop in oil production and some analysts expressed doubts those declines should be counted as cuts.
Industry sources said Oman and Kazakhstan had yet to inform their foreign partners on joint oilfields about possible output cuts. Kazakhstan said on Saturday it would try to reduce output by 20,000 bpd next year.

""While a lot of the countries are formalizing natural declines, cuts by Russia, Kazakhstan and Oman are real. Russia and Kazakhstan were between them expected to add 400,000 bpd to production next year,"" Sen of Energy Aspects said.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Russia and Saudi Arabia said they expect OPEC and non-OPEC producers to reach an agreement on Saturday to curtail oil output and prop up prices in the first such joint move since 2001.
""We have a deal already. We are just putting the final touches. Everything is good!"" Khalid al-Falih, energy minister of OPEC's de facto leader and top oil exporter Saudi Arabia, told reporters.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, speaking as he joined a breakfast with OPEC and non-OPEC ministers in Vienna, said: ""I don't see such risks (of a deal failing)."" 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries began a meeting with producers from outside the group at 0930 GMT, hoping non-OPEC will commit to cutting 600,000 barrels per day after its own members agreed a reduction of 1.2 million bpd last week.
Oil prices have more than halved in the past two years after Saudi Arabia raised output steeply in an attempt to drive higher-cost producers such as U.S. shale firms out of the market.

But it also hit the revenues of oil-dependent economies including Saudi Arabia and Russia, prompting the two largest exporters of crude to start their first oil cooperation talks in 15 years.
OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo said he expected 12 non-OPEC countries to sign a declaration with the organisation and fully contribute to cuts of 600,000 bpd or more.
""This is a very historic meeting ... This will boost the global economy and will help some OECD countries to reach their inflation targets,"" Barkindo told reporters, referring to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which groups most of the world's richest economies.
OPEC sources said non-OPEC Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Oman, Mexico, Russia, Sudan, South Sudan, Bahrain and Malaysia would attend the meeting. Bolivia may also attend and Barkindo said Brunei had sent its commitments but would not be present.
Many non-OPEC countries such as Mexico and Azerbaijan face a natural drop in oil production and several OPEC ministers going into the breakfast said the discussions would focus on whether those declines should be counted as contributions.
Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi said non-OPEC contributions should be enough to help stabilise the market.
His Iranian counterpart, Bijan Zanganeh, said non-OPEC would start cutting on Jan. 1 although exact figures had yet to be agreed.
On Friday, Saudi Arabia told its U.S. and European customers it would reduce oil deliveries from January, signalling it had already started implementing cuts. 
OPEC producers Iraq, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have also told buyers of their crude about planned reductions.
From the non-OPEC camp, so far only top global oil producer Russia and Oman have pledged cuts, with OPEC member Venezuela saying Mexico would also contribute as much as 150,000 bpd. 

In contrast, Kazakhstan plans to boost output in 2017 as it launches the long-delayed Kashagan project.

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2016 12:10AM ET</span>",U.S. slated to sell $375 million of emergency reserve oil this winter,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government is slated to sell $375 million worth of crude oil from the country's emergency reserve this winter after Congress passed a temporary spending bill on Friday that contained a measure authorizing the sale.
President Barack Obama's administration has pushed Congress to approve an up to $2 billion plan for a revamp of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a string of heavily guarded underground salt caverns along the Gulf of Mexico filled with crude. The stash currently holds about 695 million barrels of oil.
A Department of Energy spokeswoman said authorization in the spending bill ""will allow the Department to take necessary steps to increase the integrity and extend the life"" of the reserve. 
Congress passed the original funding for the reserve after the 1973 to 1974 Arab oil embargo to protect the country from global supply disruptions that have the potential to spike domestic fuel prices and damage the U.S. economy. 
Many of the reserve's steel tanks and pumps are now rusting after decades of being whipped by storms and exposed to salt air. A plan submitted to Congress by the Energy Department in September said ""this equipment today is near, at, or beyond the end of its design life.""
In addition, the U.S. oil boom of the last decade has reversed the direction of many pipelines away from the reserve, making it more difficult to get oil to market in a hurry. 
The $375 million sale, or nearly 7.3 million barrels of oil in today's price, is just the first planned installment. For each of the next three fiscal years Congress would have to approve the annual sales to reach the up to $2 billion revamp plan. It remains to be seen whether President-elect Donald Trump would urge Congress for the annual authorizations in the coming years.

This sale, which could take place seven to nine weeks after the temporary spending bill is enacted, would pay for the design of the revamp of the SPR and other pre-construction costs. Further sales would pay for construction of new equipment and new marine terminals to allow the reserve greater capacity to ship oil by vessels.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) on Friday said it would lower investors' hurdle to redeeming two popular exchange-traded notes, used to bet on the price of oil, after it delisted the products in a surprise move this week.
VelocityShares 3x Long Crude Oil ETN became the largest product of its kind delisted from U.S. exchanges after Thursday trading. VelocityShares 3x Inverse Crude Oil ETN was also delisted.
The move comes as the bank's earlier decision not to offer a new option for investors to redeem the oil-trading notes raised the prospect that some investors who failed to find buyers would not be able to trade the notes for what they are worth - or at all.
Investors who managed to sell the notes in an ""over-the-counter"" netherworld on Friday, after the delisting, did so at discounts to their estimated value that in some cases exceeded 10 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed.
Nearly 3.4 million notes changed hands Friday.
Credit Suisse AG , in a statement, said investors can now use an early redemption option if they have 500 of the notes, down from the 25,000 previously required. The company declined to comment further.
Investors with fewer than 500 of the notes will still ostensibly have to find a buyer elsewhere. The notes are not set to officially expire until 2032.
The ETNs promise to magnify or deliver the opposite of oil price gains, allowing investors to book huge profits when oil prices rise or fall but also creating the potential for massive losses.
Despite their complexity, the notes are widely used by individual retail investors.
Not withstanding the delisting, there were $745 million of the notes still circulating on Thursday, when they were pulled off the exchange.
Investors hold $22 billion of U.S. ETNs, which constitute a pledge by an issuer. Payouts are based on the performance of the underlying asset, but the notes do not ""hold"" those assets, unlike ETFs, to which they are often compared.

VelocityShares, a service provider for the notes and unit of Janus Capital Group Inc, said late Thursday it was launching two new ETNs as an alternative to the existing product. The new notes are backed by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). VelocityShares declined to comment further.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are paying a price for not finding buyers for popular exchange-traded notes (ETN), used to bet on oil prices, that delisted from U.S. exchanges this week.
Credit Suisse's VelocityShares 3x Long Crude Oil ETN (UWTI) became the largest product of its kind delisted from U.S. exchanges after trading Thursday. VelocityShares 3x Inverse Crude Oil ETN also delisted.
The notes promise to magnify or deliver the opposite of oil price gains, allowing investors to book huge profits when oil prices rise or fall but also creating the potential for massive losses. Despite their complexity, the notes are widely used by individual retail investors.
But  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) delisted the notes without offering a new redemption option for investors who retained them, raising the prospect that investors who did not sell the notes could be stuck in the products, which do not officially expire until 2032, Reuters reported this week.
""It's ultimately buyer beware,"" said ETF.com Chief Executive Officer Dave Nadig, who sold 10 UWTI notes Friday. ""Investors end up in this weird information gap.""
Now, the products, which have an outstanding value of $745 million, live on in a netherworld of over-the-counter trading.
Some investors appear to be paying a steep price to exit, with some UWTI notes selling for more than 10 percent of a discount to the note's estimated intraday value, according to Thomson Reuters data. Three million notes changed hands Friday.
Unless Credit Suisse offers a new redemption option, investors need at least 25,000 ETNs to get their cash back from the issuer.
The speculators buying the notes are taking a risk that they will not get enough shares to redeem, but the trades show they could turn a profit if the trade works out, Nadig said. 
Credit Suisse declined to comment. VelocityShares, a Janus Capital Group Inc unit that provides services for the notes, could not immediately be reached for comment.
Credit Suisse said in a Nov. 16 statement it would delist the ETN to better align its products with ""its broader strategic growth plans.""

A combination of market factors is reconfiguring the U.S. grain and farm supply industries and commodity prices.
According to a new report from CoBank, continued low commodity prices, increased foreign competition and the strong U.S. dollar will increase stress on American crop and animal supply chains.
This will increase industry consolidation, which shall launch the next phase in the growth of the agricultural industry.
Prices across the crops sector shall remain low as a result of a this oversupply in  corn, and  soybeans and wheat.
Whilst low commodity prices are also propelling consumption and overall global demand.
Strong production will outpace demand during the next three years, unless there is an extreme weather event in a major agricultural producing country.
""The U.S. grain and farm supply industries have reached another historic inflection point that will be good news for some and bad news for others,"" said Tanner Ehmke, CoBank senior economist and author of a new report on industry trends for the next two years. ""The co-ops that thrive through this cycle will be those that offer innovative products and services to their farmer customers, are earnest and unrelenting in controlling costs, are properly aligned in the industry chain, and focused on risk management. These co-ops ultimately end up well positioned as the industry realigns.""
The increased competitiveness of foreign producers – countries like Argentina, Brazil and Russia – have expanded production to take advantage of the export opportunities created by their weaker currencies.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said on Friday he doubted whether Donald Trump could undo much of the current administration's record on the environment because so many green policies have firmly taken hold.
Trump, who will take over as president on Jan. 20, has said he does not believe in global warming and will name a climate change skeptic, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, to head the Environmental Protection Agency.
The Republican is expected to nominate another climate change skeptic, U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, to head the Interior Department, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday.
Democratic President Barack Obama has made the fight against global warming a priority, and Biden said businesses now realized his policies made sense economically.
""There is a constituency that crosses party lines. Regardless of whether the next administration is as aggressive as we have been - and I'm not suggesting they intend to - there is no way to turn back this tide that has begun to roll,"" the vice president told a Canadian environmental summit.
The Obama administration has lifted vehicle fuel standards, invested heavily in renewable energy, pushed to curb methane gas emissions and adopted a Clean Power Plan that requires states to cut carbon output.
Biden said that in some parts of the United States it was now cheaper to use solar or wind power rather than rely on power stations fueled by coal or gas.
Company executives were starting to price in carbon emissions reduction while motorists enjoyed not having to refuel their vehicles as often, he said.
""Reality has a way of intruding,"" he said. ""Whatever uncertainly exists around the near-term policy choices of the next president, I am absolutely confident the United States will continue making progress on this path to a low-carbon future."" 
""And that's because many of the trends I've mentioned have taken hold and are no longer dependent on government initiatives. They are market-driven, they are common sense.""
Trump has vowed that within his first 100 days in office he will rescind the Clean Power Plan, eliminate ""unwarranted restrictions"" on hydraulic fracturing oil-drilling technology, cut ""outdated"" regulations, and pull the country out of a global pact to curb warming of the planet.
Biden said, ""One of the things the president and I are proudest of accomplishing over the last eight years is debunking the myth that America can't grow our economy and bring down emissions at the same time."".

Among those in the audience for Biden's remarks was Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is also taking an aggressive stance on climate change.

SINGAPORE/TOKYO/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has told its U.S. and European customers it will reduce oil deliveries from January as Russia signaled that a commitment from non-OPEC producers to join OPEC's output limits still faced challenges. 
Saudi Arabia told the customers about lower supplies in line with the output reduction agreed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last week, according to a Gulf oil industry source familiar with Saudi oil policy.
""We told our customers of the allocations and the compliance with allocations (for the cuts) for Saudi Arabia is 100 percent,"" the source said. 
He said cuts to Asian refiners would be lower than those to Europe, the United States and to major oil companies. 
""We are cutting more in the U.S. because the inventories ... are very high,"" the source said.
OPEC will meet non-OPEC producing countries in Vienna on Dec. 10, hoping non-OPEC will commit to cutting 600,000 barrels per day after its own members agreed to cut 1.2 million bpd last week.
OPEC sources said nine non-OPEC countries were set to join the meeting: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Oman, Mexico, Russia, Sudan, South Sudan, Bahrain and Malaysia.
So far only Russia and Oman have pledged cuts, with one OPEC source saying Mexico could also contribute. In contrast, Kazakhstan plans to boost output in 2017 as it launches the long-delayed Kashagan project.
Russia is expected to shoulder half of the non-OPEC cut, but on Friday Moscow signaled there were snags that needed to be addressed before a deal could be reached. 
""Russia sees risks ahead of the deal if questions are not resolved,"" a Russian government source told Reuters.
""One hundred percent compliance is critical for the deal ... It's essential for non-OPEC to have a responsible approach towards the deal,"" the source said, adding there was also concern about rising OPEC supplies.
NO CUTS FOR ASIA
Sources at eight refiners in Asia told Reuters they had been notified by state oil giant Saudi Aramco that in January it was set to supply full crude amounts. 
Of those eight, three refiners said they would load extra volumes they had requested. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
""It's quite telling as there are not only no supply cuts, but they have given extra volumes,"" one of the sources said, indicating that the move underscored that producers were eager to maintain market share in Asia.
Some of the extra volumes were committed before the OPEC meeting on Nov. 30, when output cuts were agreed.
""It seems that Saudis do not trust Mr. Sechin after his mockings back in 2008/2009 as he repeatedly promised and disappointed them on cuts,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Eugen Weinberg told the Reuters Global Oil Forum, referring to Igor Sechin, the CEO of top Russian oil producer Rosneft. (MM:ROSN)
""I see the Saudi strategy for January deliveries to Asia as a confirmation of this distrust.""
Sechin has long been a harsh critic of cooperation with OPEC. 

However, Sechin has kept a low profile recently and this week agreed to sell a stake in Rosneft to a consortium of commodities trader  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) and Qatar - a key ally of Saudi Arabia in OPEC.

Russia has committed to reduce its output by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 in an effort to boost oil prices. Other non-OPEC countries are being urged to cut by a similar amount in total. 
OPEC, which produces a third of global oil, pledged on Nov. 30 to reduce output by around 1.2 million bpd from January 2017.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher for a second consecutive session on Friday on hopes that non-OPEC producers meeting in Vienna would agree to cut output to bolster the group's own agreement to limit production.
Still, both benchmarks remained roughly 2 percent below the highs reached just after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced plans to cut production late last month, and were on track to close the week with small losses. 
On Saturday, oil ministers from OPEC countries will meet non-OPEC producers in Vienna to seek help in curbing a global glut. 
Brent crude for February delivery (LCOc1) was up 25 cents at $54.14 a barrel by 1034 GMT, after rising 1.7 percent on Thursday. The contract hit its highest since July 2015 at $55.33 on Monday.
U.S. crude for January delivery (CLc1) was up 40 cents at $51.24 a barrel. 
Russia has said it would cut 300,000 barrels per day, meaning other non-OPEC producers combined would need to pledge the same amount to lower output by the 600,000 bpd OPEC wants - half the reduction OPEC is making.
Azerbaijan has said it will come to the Austrian capital with proposals for its own reduction. Kazakhstan may offer to freeze output at last month's level, Kazakh Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev said.
Still, questions remained over such output plans. 
""The market wants to find an excuse to move higher and is therefore inclined to believe,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analyst Eugen Weinberg told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. ""It's questionable whether those beliefs are sustainable."" 
Weinberg said ""so many questions remain"" on the implementation of non-OPEC cuts that the plan could fall to pieces. 
""Since the oil sector in Russia is only partly state-owned the companies will need to get compensated for any production freeze/cuts,"" he said, adding: ""Talking to the Russian companies, there is no indication or intention to cut as well.""
OPEC last week agreed to slash production by 1.2 million bpd in the first half of 2017. 
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on Thursday he had agreed with Iran to call for a summit of heads of state from OPEC and non-OPEC countries in the first quarter of next year to decide on strategy for the oil market.
Saudi Arabia and Iraq plan to supply full contracted volumes of crude to Asia in January, despite the cut commitments.

1480,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 09, 2016 03:04AM ET</span>",Gold prices slip lower as dollar remains supported,"Investing.com - Gold prices slipped lower on Friday, as the U.S. dollar remained supported after the European Central Bank’s most recent policy decision and as investors turned their focus to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting next week.
On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold futures for February delivery were down 0.18% at $1,170.35.
The February contract ended Thursday’s session 0.43% lower at $1,172.40 an ounce.
Futures were likely to find support at $1,157.00, the low from December 5 and a 10-month low and resistance at $1,186.70, the high from December 5.
The U.S. dollar strengthened broadly after the ECB said at its monthly policy meeting on Thursday that it would extend its asset purchase program for an additional nine months.
Beyond the program’s scheduled end in March 2017, the central bank said net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of €60 billion until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary.
In addition, the ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record-low of zero, in line with forecasts.
Meanwhile, the dollar also found support after the U.S. Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell by 10,000 to 258,000 in the week ending December 2, in line with expectations.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Sentiment on the greenback remained somewhat fragile however ahead of the Fed’s policy meeting next week, despite sustained expectations for a rate hike.
Elsewhere in metals trading, silver futures for March delivery slid 0.37% to $17.032 a troy ounce, while copper futures for March delivery gained 0.72% to $2.645 a pound.

Russia has pledged to “gradually” reduce production by 300,000 bpd next year. But doubts have emerged over how effective the cuts will be at rebalancing the market and reducing massive oversupply that has pressured prices lower for more than two years.
Oil production has been outstripping consumption by between one to two million barrels per day since late 2014. While OPEC’s agreement boosted oil prices to 16-month highs this week, some remain skeptical on the ability of major producers to adhere to output limits.
OPEC and Russia have reported that output hit record highs since the deal was announced, adding to fears that the global supply overhang could persist well into 2017.
Some analysts have also warned that the cuts are likely to cause other producers, particularly U.S. shale drillers, to quickly ramp up output as prices rise.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rebounded from the week's lows and hovered above $50 a barrel on Thursday as market watchers focused on an upcoming weekend meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC producers that may result in an agreement to cut crude output further.
Brent and U.S. oil prices gained support early from a slightly weaker dollar, but the U.S. currency turned positive as the euro fell on the European Central Bank's decision to extend but reduce its bond-buying program.
Oil producers will meet in Vienna on Saturday to see whether those outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will cut production to help ease a global supply glut that has pressured prices for more than two years.
In the late morning, Brent flipped into negative territory while U.S. prices pared gains briefly after reports that Russia sees a risk that the meeting could be moved due to questions that have come up. A Russian energy ministry spokeswoman, however, said the meeting would continue as planned. 
OPEC has agreed to slash production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017, a deal that bolstered crude futures despite doubts over whether the amount was enough and whether the cuts would be effectively implemented.
Brent was up 35 cents, or 0.66 percent, to $53.35 a barrel by 11:36 a.m. EDT (1636 GMT). U.S. light, sweet crude was up 40 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $50.17 a barrel. 
Both benchmarks have fallen more than $2 a barrel from highs reached Monday when investors bought heavily in the wake of the OPEC deal.
Given the rally to $50 a barrel, non-OPEC members may not be persuaded to cut output, said Tim Evans, energy futures specialist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). 
""Further effective cooperation between oil producers seems unlikely in our view, as OPEC and Russia have already agreed on policy, reducing the leverage they have with other countries in our view,"" he said in a note. 

Non-OPEC Russia has signaled it was ready to cut production by 300,000 bpd and on Thursday Azerbaijan said it would come to Vienna armed with proposals for its own reduction.

1487,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2016 11:43AM ET</span>",Only five non-OPEC producers so far attending talks to widen output cut,"By Alex Lawler and Rania El Gamal
LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Only five of 14 non-OPEC oil producers have agreed so far to meet the group on Saturday for talks aimed at widening a deal to reduce output, casting doubt on whether OPEC will secure the full cuts it is seeking, two OPEC sources said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which finalised its first oil output cut in eight years last month to prop up prices, is to hold talks with non-member countries in Vienna in the hope that they will also limit supply.
The last time non-OPEC countries joined the organization in cutting output, in late 2001 as prices dropped in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, non-members promised cuts of 462,000 barrels per day, not quite the 500,000 bpd OPEC then sought.
Currently, Russia has said it will cut 300,000 bpd, meaning other non-OPEC producers combined will need to pledge the same amount to lower output by the 600,000 bpd OPEC wants - half the reduction OPEC is making.
Some OPEC sources familiar with discussions were reasonably sure the outside producers would deliver enough commitments.
""I think they will,"" said one. ""It should not be that difficult.""
Other OPEC sources were skeptical a pledge for the full amount would be made this time. Among the 14 non-OPEC countries invited to attend Saturday's meeting, only Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Oman, Mexico and Russia have accepted.
""It's not clear,"" a second source said. ""Wait until Saturday.""
A third OPEC source said cut pledges amounting to 500,000 bpd were more likely.
Besides Russia, only Oman has publicly stated it is willing to cut production. In public comments, Azerbaijan has indicated it will lower supply, while Kazakhstan has said it is undecided.
OPEC President Mohammed al-Sada, speaking at the Nov. 30 news conference after OPEC finalised its output reduction, was confident that non-OPEC would deliver the 600,000 bpd.
Saturday's meeting at OPEC's Vienna headquarters will start at 10:00 a.m. local time (0900 GMT) and be chaired jointly by Sada and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, according to a draft copy of the agenda seen by Reuters.

OPEC will still implement its cut of 1.2 million bpd even if Russia becomes the only non-member to contribute, OPEC member Nigeria said on Wednesday.

(Reuters) - OPEC's landmark oil-production deal may prove effective in running down global inventories, but analysts hold little hope for much of a rise in prices, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
If all members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries honor the deal reached in Vienna on Nov. 30 to cut output, any ensuing price gain and drop in inventories could be quickly reversed by rising non-OPEC production.
""In the medium term, we can expect tighter market balances but for a substantial price recovery to take place, significant demand growth will be required to draw down high inventories of crude and products,"" said Shakil Begg, head of Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts.
The 29 analysts and economists polled by Reuters forecast Brent crude futures will average $44.69 a barrel in 2016 and $57.01 in 2017, against $44.78 and $57.08 for the same periods in the previous survey about a month ago.
Brent has averaged about $44.50 per barrel so far this year.
""This is a short-duration cut, targeting excess inventories and not high oil prices, which would instead unleash a sharp production response both in the U.S. and in the rest of the world,"" U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note.
As part of its first oil output cuts since 2008, OPEC agreed to reduce production by about 1.2 million barrels per day beginning in January. It hopes non-OPEC countries will contribute a further 600,000 bpd of cuts.
The group will meet non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, in Vienna this weekend and seek their contribution to erode a global supply glut that could run into a third year in 2017. Russia has said it will reduce output by around 300,000 bpd. 
A majority of analysts said the OPEC deal would have to extend beyond the six-month period currently agreed, for global oil rebalancing to occur in the second half of 2017.
""Curtailments from OPEC are required throughout 2017 to rebalance the market as U.S. shale supplies are expected to hit the market in 2017,"" said Rahul Prithiani, director at CRISIL Research.
The poll forecast U.S. light crude will average $43.46 a barrel in 2016 and $55.23 in 2017. WTI has averaged about $43 so far in 2016.
Of the 28 respondents who participated in the current as well as the previous survey, 16 kept their forecasts unchanged.

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2016 01:10AM ET</span>","Eyeing upswing, more U.S. oilfield service firms restructure","By Tom Hals and Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - After two years of hunkering down, struggling U.S. oilfield service providers are preparing for an expected oil-price recovery in an unexpected way: filing for bankruptcy.
Companies that drill wells, haul water and provide other services to energy exploration firms have been waiting out a slump in oil prices by idling machinery, laying off workers and extending deadlines for repaying debts.
Now they are turning to Chapter 11 creditor protection to shed debt and raise cash so they can spend and invest again. 
Without bankruptcy, many of small and medium-sized service companies risk missing out on any upturn that could follow President-elect Donald Trump's pro-drilling agenda or OPEC's plan to cut oil production for the first time in eight years, restructuring advisors said.
""You've got some zombie companies out there,"" said Jay Krasoff, a managing director with Chiron Financial in Houston. ""You have to give counterparties confidence you'll be in business to do their work. That's what's going on.""
Through the end of October, about 70 mostly private energy service companies have filed for Chapter 11 this year, up from 39 in all of 2015, according to Haynes & Boone, a law firm that specializes in energy restructuring.
As the pace of filings accelerates, the size of companies restructuring in bankruptcy is also increasing. 
In June through October, nine companies with at least $100 million in debt filed for Chapter 11, with a total of $9 billion in liabilities, according to Haynes & Boone. That exceeded the total for the prior 18 months, which came to $8.2 billion in debt from seven filings with at least $100 million in debt.
In all, energy services companies have restructured about $18.7 billion in bankruptcy. By comparison, the 20 companies in the Dow Jones U.S. Oil Equipment & Services Index (DJUSOI) have a combined $82.6 billion in debt, according to Thomson Reuters data. (Graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2ftVbQ2) 
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
The biggest oilfield service providers - such as  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) and  Schlumberger Ltd  (SLB.UL) - have the scale to ride out the production glut, despite losing more than 40 percent of their revenue since oil prices peaked in mid-2014.
In a recovery, they can also respond more quickly than smaller companies that spent the past two years hibernating through the downturn, according to restructuring advisers.
Hoping the energy sector has turned a corner, major U.S. producers such as Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX),  Pioneer Natural Resources  Co (N:PXD) and ConocoPhillips (N:COP) are preparing to add rigs. 
A bankruptcy filing allows a service company to restructure under a court-supervised process in as little as two months. Creditors generally take ownership of the companies in return for forgiving debt, and shareholders generally lose all or nearly all of their investment.
""From a competitive advantage a lot of the service companies had to do that,"" said Steven Person, the chief executive officer of exploration company American Standard Energy.
Person has served as an officer and director of energy service companies, including until 2004 at  Basic Energy Services Inc  (N:BAS), which completes oil and gas wells and transports and disposes of fluids.
Basic Energy filed for Chapter 11 in October with a plan backed by its creditors to convert $825 million in debt to equity and raise more than $100 million in cash. Its confirmation trial is on Friday. 
David Johnston, a managing director of AlixPartners, has been advising Basic Energy and said in court papers the company opted to file for bankruptcy in part because competitors were. 
""Several of Basic's competitors have delevered their own balance sheets through Chapter 11 processes, thus forcing even solvent companies to explore similar options to remain competitive,"" he said.
Two of Basic's main competitors,  Key Energy Services Inc  (PK:KEGXQ) and C&J Energy Services Inc (PK:CJESQ), filed for bankruptcy in recent months. Key won court approval on Tuesday to cut $1 billion of debt to $250 million and exit bankruptcy and C&J's confirmation trial is set for Dec. 16.
 Seventy Seven Energy Inc  (PK:SVNT), which provides drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, services, filed for Chapter 11 in June. By early August, the company had cut its debt by $1.1 billion and exited bankruptcy under the control of its creditors.
The company said in its recent quarterly results that it had doubled its rig count in the past six months.
About half of some 32 oilfield service companies still trading actively in major stock exchanges are distressed, including five or six that are severely distressed and likely to restructure, said Kim Brady, a partner and restructuring adviser at financial consultancy Solic Capital.
Restructuring advisers said the stigma previously associated with Chapter 11, which tended to hit companies with serious problems, has vanished, opening the door to more bankruptcy filings.

""Now it's almost in vogue to be going through Chapter 11,"" said Jerrit Coward, former CEO of fracking services provider US Shale Solutions LLC who is now advising energy investors.

Gold prices are still down, now by 15%, from earlier highs this year.
Investors have now withdrawn gold from Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) for 18 consecutive days.
Silver gained on Wednesday.
The belief that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates soon is also a factor weighing on the minds of investors in gold and silver.
The Fed is planning to raise interest rates, it is widely held, because after a decade of stagnation, the U.S. economy is finally generating stronger growth. The fed's Janet Yellen is said to want to contain inflation with a pre-emptory interest rate increase that will keep wages and prices in line.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will meet with other oil producers to coordinate further output cuts this coming weekend.
OPEC’s agreement just one week ago today to slash production temporarily propelled oil prices to a one-year high.
Experts worry that oil producing countries may adopt a beggar-thy-neighbor strategy and increase production to boost their own share of the market.
Another factor weighing on the minds of investors was the nomination by President-elect Donald Trump of a hardline candidate to head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Oklahoma state Attorney General Scott Pruitt, the nominee, is a critic of global warming extremism, and the belief that mankind alone is responsible for variations in the global climate since the industrial revolution.
Pruitt has made a name for himself in conservative Republican circles by fighting President Obama's environmental policies, including the White House's controversial move to cut power plant emissions of carbon.
Trump has promised to ""roll back"" Obama's most restrictive regulations on oil, including his recent work stoppage of an oil pipeline in North Dakota that was about 1500 feet from completion.
A source tells Investing.com that so-called protestors at the pipleline this weekend were known by locals to be employees of a major rail carrier which will lose business if the oil is transported by pipeline, rather than rail.

1501,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2016 02:08PM ET</span>","OPEC, U.S. begin 'cat and mouse' oil game as producers pounce on hedges","By Amanda Cooper and Catherine Ngai
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As far as one of the world’s biggest commodities traders, Glencore’s chief Ivan Glasenberg, is concerned, the oil market will be at the mercy of ""a cat and mouse game"" between OPEC and its U.S. shale rivals in the coming year.
A 16 percent price rally over the past week has delivered U.S. frackers a golden opportunity to hedge - or sell forward - their production for 2017 and beyond, to shore up their coffers against possible future price falls.
Prices for prompt Brent and WTI benchmark futures contracts have hit their highest in nearly a year and a half, but this rush by the shale industry to hedge has capped the rally in prices of oil for delivery further in the future.
This will probably mean no life-support for the higher-cost producers, at least as further-out prices remain below $60 per barrel, and OPEC knows this.
""It's going to be a cat and mouse game between OPEC and shale oil in America,"" Glasenberg said this week.
""OPEC members will say, 'if you (raise output), we are going to ramp up production and push oil back down to $35' ... I hope shale in America will be responsible and realize what's happened and allow the higher oil price to be sustained,"" he said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on Nov. 30 to its first production cut since 2008, whereby it will reduce output by around 1.2 million barrels per day to 32.5 million bpd from January for six months.
Crucially, Russia agreed to cut output by up to 300,000 bpd in the first half of 2017, its first joint action with OPEC since 2001, and another 300,000 bpd in cuts are to be borne by other non-OPEC producing nations.
    
NO FREE LUNCH FOR SHALE
The collapse in the premium of longer-dated oil futures contracts in both the Brent (LCOc1) and U.S. crude futures markets (CLc1) shows how investors and producers alike are taking OPEC at its word.
The U.S. futures curve <0#CL:> has inverted so prices for delivery of oil in December 2017 are now above those for delivery a year later, reflecting the wall of producer selling that has materialized since OPEC made its announcement. 
“Producers have returned very actively in the market for hedging last week after the OPEC decision,” said one source with a bank active in the forward-selling market.
Brandon Elliott, executive vice president of corporate development and strategy for U.S. shale producer Northern Oil & Gas, said his company had added to its hedges.
""In some core Bakken areas, it’s economical to drill in the $45-$55 WTI price,"" he said, referring to the North American Bakken shale formation. 
""I would expect that as we lock in some of the low $50s, activity picks up a bit."" 
Higher prices for oil for prompt delivery compared to those for delivery in the future will guarantee OPEC countries higher cash-flow income now, rather than further down the line, when they ramp production back up again.    
""OPEC knows this dynamic. As such they have been quite clever by only pledging a cut lasting six months to begin with. This tightens up the front end of the market,"" SEB commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop said.
""OPEC would prefer though not to lift forward prices further out on the curve. They don’t want to offer shale oil producers a free lunch with the possibility of a guaranteed, high profitability for new projects through a high forward price.""
Giving U.S. oil producers an incentive to drill more aggressively is the last thing OPEC members want, particularly since the group's decision in November 2014 to let prices fall was precisely to squeeze out higher-cost shale rivals.

Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio del Pino said on Wednesday OPEC is aiming for an oil price that is not ""too high or too low,"" around $60-70 a barrel, while his Nigerian counterpart Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu said he would like to see a price of $60 by December 2017.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian companies support Energy Ministry proposals to cap oil output as part of a global deal, a ministry spokeswoman said on Wednesday as Moscow prepares to finalize the agreement with OPEC and other producer nations this weekend. 
The chiefs of Lukoil (MM:LKOH), Gazprom Neft (MM:SIBN), Tatneft, Novatek (MM:NVTK) and Surgutneftegaz met Energy Minister Alexander Novak for around an hour. Novak plans to visit Vienna on Dec. 10 following OPEC's output decision last week. 
Rosneft (MM:ROSN), Russia's top oil producer, was represented by vice-president Andrei Shishkin, recently appointed head of Bashneft. CEO Igor Sechin, Russia's most powerful oilman and critic of cooperation with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, was absent. 
""All companies have supported our proposals for an oil production cap,"" Olga Golant, spokeswoman for Novak, told reporters after the meeting. She added that Novak would comment on details in Vienna. 
Russia, whose oil output hit a post-Soviet high in November at 11.21 million barrels per day, has committed to cut 300,000 bpd during the first half of next year. Other non-OPEC nations are expected to match Moscow's cut in total. 
Vladimir Bogdanov, head of Russia's third-largest oil producer, Surgut, said a production cut had been discussed at the meeting with Novak. 
Vagit Alekperov, chief executive of No.2 oil producer Lukoil, said no decision had been taken yet on how to reduce production. He added that the ministry had not issued recommendations on quotas for the cut. 
Last week, Novak said all Russian companies would join the cut in equal percentages, but did not elaborate. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, the second- and third-largest producers among ex-Soviet countries after Russia, plan to attend the Vienna talks. 
On Wednesday, Kazakhstan officially relaunched its giant offshore Kashagan field, which is expected to produce 8.9 million tonnes of oil in 2017 (about 192,000 bpd).

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Wednesday as investors waited to see if OPEC and Russia would deliver promised production cuts designed to end a supply overhang that has weighed on the market for more than two years.
North Sea Brent crude oil (LCOc1) was up 10 cents a barrel at $54.03 by 0950 GMT. U.S. light crude (CLc1) was up 15 cents at $51.08 a barrel.
Oil prices surged as much as 19 percent after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia announced last week that they would cut production next year in an effort to prop up markets.
But doubts have emerged over whether the planned cuts will be big enough to rebalance the market. 
Since the deal was announced, both OPEC and Russia have reported record production and output elsewhere is also resilient.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday it expected domestic crude oil production for 2016 and 2017 to fall by less than previously expected.
""Investors are torn between hopes that producers will cut enough production to balance supply and demand, and fears that they won't,"" said Tamas Varga, senior analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.
OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers meet this weekend in Vienna to agree details of the output cut, which targets an overall reduction of around 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd).
OPEC member Nigeria, exempt from the cuts, said on Wednesday it hoped to boost its oil production to 2.1 million bpd in January, up from 1.9 million bpd now. 
""We will see whether belief in the (OPEC production) deal will hold,"" said Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Frankfurt. ""There is a big discrepancy right now between expectations, perception and reality.""

Oil production has been outpacing consumption by 1 to 2 million barrels per day since late 2014.

""The average annual oil price will be higher in 2017 than in 2016, with Brent at $55 per barrel for the year,"" BMI Research said. The average 2016 Brent price has so far been $44.47 per barrel.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil major  BP  (L:BP) is shipping almost three million barrels of U.S. crude to customers across Asia, pioneering a lengthy and complex operation likely to become more popular after OPEC last week announced deep production cuts.
BP's efforts, involving one of the world's longest sea routes, seven tankers and a series of ship-to-ship transfers, underscore a desire among oil traders to develop new routes to sell swelling supplies of cheap U.S. shale oil to Asia, the world's biggest consumer region.
While exports of U.S. crude have been allowed since a 40-year ban was lifted a year ago, the distance, cost and complexity of shipping to Asia has so far kept the flow to a trickle.
Now, using its global shipping and trading network, BP was able to grapple with U.S. port limitations and the need to transfer oil between ships off Malaysia to split cargoes for customers across Asia, according to trade sources and shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon.
""Keeping regional price differentials, different tanker rates, and the forward price curve in mind while considering the delivery needs and schedules of your counterparties is not something many oil trading firms can do,"" said a shipping source in Singapore, who had knowledge of the operations.
""BP is one of perhaps half a dozen firms capable of doing so,"" he added, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to publicly discuss operations.
BP declined to comment.

Incentives to bring U.S. crude into Asia have risen after the Middle East-led producer club of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia agreed to cut output, encouraging refiners across the region to seek alternatives to offset potential supply shortfalls.
""OPEC is putting U.S. shale oil to the test... (and) we will truly see what it can deliver,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB. He predicted 2017 would be a ""shale oil party"" with a surge in U.S. exports after the OPEC production cuts.
The operation to send the oil, worth around $150 million, to Asia-Pacific buyers lasted four months and involved BP traders in the United States and Singapore, while colleagues from London were responsible for ship chartering, the sources said and data showed.
BP took advantage of arbitrage between cheaper U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (CLc1) crude and the global benchmark Brent (LCOc1).
The deal was aided by cheap tanker rates and a price/time curve, where future oil deliveries are more expensive than those for immediate discharge, making sourcing oil from as far away as North America profitable.
FROM GOLA TO MALAYSIA
BP's operations to Asia kicked off in mid-September, when it chartered the large Suezmax-class tanker Felicity to load crude from the smaller Aframax-class vessel Eagle Stavanger in the Galveston Offshore Lightering Area (GOLA) off Texas.
Days later, also at GOLA, BP transferred oil from three Aframax-class tankers to the C. Excellency, a Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC).
The transfers were necessary as American ports cannot load oil on the biggest tankers.
A VLCC can carry 2 million barrels of oil, enough to meet two days' worth of Britain's consumption, while a Suezmax and an Aframax can load 1 million barrels and 800,000 barrels, respectively.
Too big for the Panama Canal, the Felicity and C. Excellency sailed around South Africa to the Linggi International Transhipment Hub in Malaysia where their cargoes were split up again for delivery across Asia-Pacific.
In late October, the Felicity transferred part of its oil to the smaller Aframax Taurus Sun, which then delivered 300,000 barrels of WTI Midland crude to Thailand, according to shipping data.
The C. Excellency received the rest of the Felicity's cargo in Malaysia, then transferred oil to Aframax-class British Gannet in November.
On Wednesday, shipping data shows that the British Gannet docked at BP's Kwinana refinery in Perth, Australia to make its final delivery. The cargo will have traveled more than 16,000 nautical miles (30,000 km) from GOLA.
Meanwhile, C. Excellency received some fuel from another super-tanker, the Gener8 Andriotis, and this week headed to Sriracha in Thailand to deliver 300,000 barrels of WTI, shipping data showed. Sources involved with the shipment said some of that oil would likely proceed to Japan.
While BP's operation stands out size and complexity, more long-haul trades are likely.

""As Middle East producers and Russia are due to cut their output, large crude buyers (in Asia)... will likely import an incremental amount from longer-haul sources,"" said Erik Nikolai Stavseth from Norway's Arctic Securities.

1515,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2016 09:37PM ET</span>",Energy Transfer keeps up legal pressure after pipeline defeat,"By Mica Rosenberg and Ernest Scheyder
WASHINGTON/CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - The company building the Dakota Access Pipeline turned to a federal judge late on Monday for a permit to finish the job after the federal government ruled against the controversial pipeline.
The pipeline, which is being built by Energy Transfer Partners, has been the subject of protests from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and climate activists for months, due to its proximity to the tribe's reservation. 
On Sunday, the federal government turned down ETP's request for an easement that will allow it to tunnel under the Missouri River, adjacent to the Standing Rock reservation. The tribe and others hailed the victory, even though they expected the fight with the company would continue. 
In a legal filing on Monday, ETP asked a judge to grant the permit, saying that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in its decision, responded to ""political pressure and an escalating campaign of violence and disorder waged by protesters"" against the project. 
Last month, ETP said that delays have already cost it $450 million, while it anticipates further monthly delays of about $83 million. The company did comment on the filing.
""This seems like a distraction to me from the real issues. The Army Corps knows whether or not it has granted an easement across federal property. The Army Corps has wide discretion in this issue,"" said Jan Hasselman, a lawyer with Earthjustice, which is representing the Standing Rock Sioux.
Protests have gathered momentum this year in both the United States and Canada, as climate activists have united with Native tribes to form a powerful coalition against pipeline development. Canada's natural resources minister was forced to apologize on Tuesday for remarks interpreted as favoring law enforcement violence against protesters.
This came after several clashes between police and activists in North Dakota, most recently a confrontation with several hundred protesters where police responded by spraying people with water and tear gas amid freezing temperatures. 
That galvanized hundreds of veterans to flock to the Dakota Access protests, where they met tribal leaders to protest over the weekend, just before the Army Corps' decision. 
The chief of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, Dave Archambault, asked protesters on Monday to go home, saying they should go home to spend winter with their families. 
That became impossible late on Monday, as conditions turned harsh at the Oceti Sakowin camp in North Dakota, when a blizzard rolled in and raged throughout Tuesday, forcing activists to hunker down in communal tents and cars. 
A state travel warning was issued on Monday, imploring people in southern North Dakota, including the area around Cannon Ball and the capital of Bismarck, to avoid travel. Snow has accumulated rapidly, with wind gusts in the area exceeding 50 miles per hour (80 kmh), according to the National Weather Service, causing drifts and blocking roads. 
Linda Black Elk, 42, a leader of the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council, said Tuesday there had been two cases of hypothermia in camp. She said volunteers walked around the camp through the evening visiting tipis and yurts to check on people. 

Morton County, in a release, said it had set up shelters at several locations, where a number of protesters attempting to leave the camp had ended up due to difficult driving conditions. Blockades on Highway 1806, just north of camp, were still in place as of late Monday, as the blizzard approached.

1521,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2016 03:20PM ET</span>",Junk energy companies rush to primary market,"By Davide Scigliuzzo
NEW YORK (IFR) - Junk-rated energy companies are rushing to the US bond market at the fastest pace in nearly two years, looking to refinance debt following a sharp rally in spreads over the past week.
Permian Basin independent producer Parsley Energy and natural gas giant Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) are pricing deals Tuesday, and follow a bond from Cheniere Energy a day earlier which was increased to US$1.5bn from US$1bn on the back of strong demand.
At least two others - Rowan Companies and Matador Resources - are also marketing deals to the buyside.
""They are definitely capitalizing on the market right now,"" Matt Kennedy, a senior portfolio manager at Angel Oak Capital Advisors, told IFR.
The companies - from across the oil and gas sector including drilling and transportation - are selling new debt amid renewed interest from investors in the wake of OPEC's agreement at the end of last month to cut production.
Since that announcement on November 30, junk-rated energy bond spreads have tightened by 71bp to 483bp over Treasuries as of the close Monday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) data. That marks the lowest level since October 2014.
US crude prices were dropped by almost 2% to US$50.43 a barrel on Tuesday, on skepticism the cartel would be able to reduce production. They were however still higher than before the OPEC announcement when prices were at US$45.23.
""As prices move up and US shale production rebounds it remains to be seen how sustainable prices are and how OPEC will respond,"" Kennedy said.
DEAL BONANZA
In all, the five energy borrowers coming to market this week could sell US$3.4bn of junk-rated bonds. That would make it the highest weekly volume for the sector since March 2015, according to an IFR analysis of data from  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
Rated Triple C by Moody's and S&P, natural gas producer Chesapeake Energy announced price talk of 8.25% area on a US$750m eight-year non-call three senior note.
That was tighter than mid-8% whispers, though the deal will price with an original issue discount of 1.5 points.
The deal - the first primary issue from the company in about two-and-half years, excluding exchange offers - will use proceeds to finance a tender on up to US$1.2bn of existing debt maturing from 2017 to 2023.
The deal is the latest in a series of liability management transactions and asset sales undertaken by debt-laden Chesapeake over the past year to increase its financial flexibility.
E&P company Parsley Energy and offshore drilling contractor Rowan Companies are also expected to tap the market on Tuesday with a US$600m eight-year non-call three and a US$400m 8.5-year bullet deal, respectively.
Parsley has set price talk of 5.5% area on its trade, while Rowan is eyeing a yield in the 7.5%-7.75% range.
Matador Resources, another independent E&P company, also plans to raise US$150m on Tuesday through a tap of its existing 2023s.
Cheniere Energy gave the market a big boost Monday, pricing a US$1.5bn 8.25-year bond sale for its Corpus Christi subsidiary to repay existing term loans.
The senior secured deal was upsized from US$1bn and priced at a final yield of 5.875%, tight to price talk of 6% area.

U.S. crude oil was trading at $50.58 a barrel at 10:51 ET, down $1.24 or 2.36% from its last close. It hit an intra-day peak of $52.42 on Monday, the highest since July 2015.

Oil prices rallied around 15% over the last week after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut output in a bid to reduce massive oversupply that has pressured prices lower since 2014.
The deal will see the producer cartel cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day and will take effect from January 2017.
The agreement also included coordinated action with non-OPEC members, including Russia, who are expected to decrease production by 600,000 barrels a day.
The impact of the output cut will be reassessed after six months with an option to extend the accord for an additional six months.
Investors were beginning to turn their attention towards a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC members in Vienna on December 10 to finalize the details of the agreement.
Russia has said it will cut production by 300,000 bpd, but said it would do so at November levels.
On Friday Russia reported that its daily oil production averaged 11.21 million bpd in November, the highest in nearly 30 years.
Data on Tuesday indicated that OPEC’s oil output hit another record high in November, rising to 34.19 million bpd from 33.82 million bpd in October.
The increase in output ahead of the planned production cut triggered fears that the global supply overhang could persist well into 2017.
Analysts have warned that the cuts are likely to cause other producers, especially U.S. shale drillers, to increase output.
Analysts are also skeptical over how the agreement will be enforced, as OPEC has no authority to make its members comply with quotas."

1524,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2016 09:20AM ET</span>","Glencore raises money for Kurdish oil deal, likely short of target: sources","By Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) -  Glencore  (L:GLEN) will likely fall short of its target of raising $550 million to pre-finance the purchase of Kurdish oil, with investors exercising caution despite the offer of a 12 percent bond yield, industry sources told Reuters.
Two sources familiar with the plans said that commodities giant Glencore will price the bond at 12 percent on Tuesday, having received investor commitments for between $200 million and $400 million. Glencore would have to cover the rest itself, though there is no obligation to hit the full $550 million.
European traders contending with a protracted oil industry downturn have targeted Kurdish oil since the government of the autonomous Kurdish region in Erbil began selling independently from Baghdad. 
The oil has been relatively cheap because of potential supply disruptions and the opposition of Iraq's central government to independent Kurdish oil sales, though Baghdad has softened its tone on Erbil in recent months. 
Reuters was first to report Glencore's plans to raise the debt last month. 
Rivals such as Vitol, Petraco and Trafigura have lent Erbil about $2 billion in total, to be repaid in oil. The traders have borrowed from banks and lent it to Erbil at their own risk. 
Glencore also loaned $300 million to Erbil this year, with the money repaid by way of one mid-sized oil cargo a month, worth about $25 million.
The new bond should allow Glencore to split the risks by selling debt notes to a small number of investors and hedge funds who specialize in high-risk, high-yield investments and emerging markets.
Technically, the money would be raised by a special-purpose vehicle and the debt will be non-recourse, meaning that Glencore will not be liable should problems occur.
Glencore has told investors it expects to enter a new five-year agreement with the government of Kurdistan to buy its crude, with deliveries rising from one cargo in January, to two in February-March, four in April and six from May onwards.
Six cargoes a month would represent a quarter of overall exports from Kurdistan. Industry sources have said that Kurdistan has yet to finalize its export plans for 2017.
Glencore declined to comment.

Kurdistan exports its oil via the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. Flows have been running at more than 600,000 barrels per day since September after being occasionally disrupted in 2015 and at the start of this year by militant attacks in Turkey and Kurdistan.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plchas joined the list of top banks to exit energy trading, an exodus that analysts say raises concern among oil producers that falling liquidity means they cannot use derivatives for their basic function: to hedge risk by locking in future prices.
Wall Street firms have scaled back in commodity markets since the 2008 financial crisis from owning physical assets or taking positions in the market in the face of regulatory scrutiny. The banks were big players in the market for derivatives years into the future.
The departure of Barclays exacerbates the scarcity of counterparties for trade when producers are trying to hedge their production for 2018 and beyond, potentially raising the cost to lock in that output.
That increase could force cash-strapped producers to forgo protection altogether, putting them at risk if the market takes another leg down.
Some producers seek to lock in future profits and fund expansion through selling as much as 80 percent of production years into the future.
""It's one less bank willing to make a trade in the market, which reduces liquidity overall. That's one less source of credit and one less counterparty,"" said John Saucer, vice president of research and analysis at Mobius Risk Group. 
On Thursday, Barclays said it would close its energy business within the 'Macro' trading division, according to an internal memo obtained by Reuters, a move to better maintain resources. They follow a string of other big banks who, with profits hampered by toughening financial regulations, have chosen to exit.
Executives and traders within the industry said that Barclays' move was not surprising as it had been scaling down in recent years. But it represents the departure of another former top-five player from the energy space. Other big players who have already exited the market include RBS (LON:RBS) Sempra in 2010 and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) three years ago. 
Merchant traders such as Vitol Group, Mercuria Energy Group and  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc sought to fill the vacuum left by the investment banks. 
But the merchant traders have preferred to trade around their own physical positions, which are often linked to derivatives contracts with nearby expirations.
""Merchant books are physically oriented. They don't offer the same type of liquidity that the banks do,"" Saucer added. ""When they're there, it's patchy and specific. It's ancillary to the other stuff they're doing.""    
That means merchant traders have little incentive to trade years into the future, and so have failed to plug the gap left by the big banks. Merchants also have tighter credit availability than banks, so are less willing to tie up capital in long-distant futures trade.
Barclays has been reducing its footprint for a while, having announced a retreat from precious metals in January. Two sources familiar with the matter said that Barclays' business with oil producers seemed to be reducing in size over the years, it retained a decent refinery business.
The memo noted that the Macro's energy business accounted for less than two percent of overall revenue for the markets business at the British lender.
Still, those with a stronger financial position and a larger presence, including heavy hitters like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) & Co[GSGSC.UL] or JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), remain in the market and can absorb additional hedging needs. If one of the current larger players dropped out, that would be much more concerning because it would greatly increase the price to hedge, traders said.
One point of uncertainty, they added, was what Barclays was going to do with its trade book. Analysts pointed out that Barclays could unwind hedges that it already conducted with market participants. The other option would be to sell the hedge book, thereby passing on any risk to another player. That could be prime opportunity for banks or merchants wanting to grow.

""We think of this in relationship terms and if there was a specific reason to trade with Barclays. Sadly, increasingly, there wasn't,"" said Steve Sinos, vice president of Mercatus Energy Advisors, which works with energy producers and consumers. ""They were competitive, but weren't providing anything outstanding. And, they didn't have a lot of lending with our clients.""

On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange gold fell 0.07% to $1,175.65 a troy ounce. Elsewhere in metals trading, silver for March delivery on the Comex rose 0.08% to $16.913 a troy ounce, while copper for March delivery fell 0.45% to $2.682 a pound.
Overnight, gold prices fell more than 1% on Monday as strength in equity markets hit safe haven demand for the precious metal and as expectations for a U.S. rate hike this month continued to weigh.
Gold initially gained after Italian voters rejected a referendum on constitutional changes backed by the government, prompting Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to step down and sending the euro to 20-month lows.
But European stock markets and the single currency rebounded as the referendum outcome had been largely priced in by markets.
Investors were also reassured after the European Central Bank said last week that it was prepared to temporarily step up purchases of Italian government bonds should the referendum results drive up borrowing costs.
Stronger risk appetite curbs the appeal of traditional safe-haven assets, such as gold.
A report from the Institute of Supply Management on Monday showed that gauge of non-manufacturing activity hit a one-year high in November, adding to optimism over the economic outlook.
The precious metal fell almost 8% in November on the back of expectations that increased U.S. fiscal spending under a Trump administration will spur economic growth and inflation, which would ultimately lead to an era of higher interest rates.
Expectations of tighter monetary policy tend to weigh on gold, which struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when borrowing costs rise. Overnight, New York Fed President William Dudley said on Monday it was too soon for the Fed to judge whether its plan for gradual interest rate hikes needed adjusting under a Trump administration.

Immediately after the Obama administration stopped the progress of a prominent midwestern oil pipeline, by refusing to issue a new permit for the rest of the route, a spokesman for Trump's transition team said the incoming administration supports completing the project.
“With regard to the Dakota Access Pipeline, that’s something that we support construction of and we’ll review the full situation when we’re in the White House and make the appropriate determination at that time,” said Jason Miller, a spokesman for the president-elect, in New York City, at Trump Tower.
Out-of-state environmental activists broke out into public cheers during a rally after the U.S. Department of the Army, staffed by President Obama's progressive team, said the department wouldn’t grant an easement required by Dallas-based  Energy Transfer Partners LP  (NYSE:ETP) to proceed through the Missouri River reservoir, the final 1,100-foot link yet to be built in the nearly 1,200-mile pipeline.
The Army statement said that alternate routes would be considered and a complete environmental study of the project should be conducted.
The statement Monday by the Trump transition team, however, demonstrated that decision would not hold any power after the new administration takes over in the coming weeks. The new oil pipeline is expected to generate 500,000 new barrels of oil per day.
Trump last week intervened in a threatened move overseas of a unit of United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX). and in the weeks before that prevented  Ford Motor Co  . (NYSE:F) from shuttering a plant in Kentucky and moving 1,000 jobs to Mexico. The move caused hackles at the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, by zealous free market intellectuals, but generated approval from the ""average Joe"" workers whose blue collar jobs were saved by the policy pronouncement.
The moves signal an industrial policy somewhat reminiscent of the Reagan era or the JFK era, when the U.S. goverment preached free trade, within American borders, and took an overall deregulatory approach. But was somewhat protectionist against foreign encroachments on U.S. markets which were not reciprocated by trading partners, and which harmed the ""little guy,"" the American working man. Obama's policies have been viewed by market analysts as highly regulatory at home, especially of ""green energy"" issues and the energy industry in general, but laissez faire, free market with respect to foreign moves by publicly traded manufacturing corporations based in the U.S. Obama had told a worker last summer, whose job at UTC was being eliminated, that he should ""get retrained in the clean power industry."""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude rose above $55 a barrel to hit a 16-month high on Monday as rising prospects of a tightening market after last week's OPEC landmark deal to cut production has given speculators impetus to increase bets on higher prices.
Monday's gains take the rally since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' agreement was struck on Wednesday to 19 percent for Brent and 16 percent for U.S. crude. Last week's 12.2 percent increase was the largest one-week rise since February 2011.

After OPEC agreed to curb production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from January, eyes have now turned to a meeting this weekend between OPEC and non-OPEC producers to expand the deal.
Non-OPEC producers are expected to agree to add an output cut of 600,000 bpd in Vienna on Dec. 10.
""We remain skeptical that non-OPEC producers will line up to pledge their own reductions when OPEC’s announcement last week already largely took responsibility for rebalancing the market,"" said Tim Evans, energy futures specialist with  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""In our view, the rally in prices represents an economic call for more production, not more cuts.""
Transneft, Russia's pipeline monopoly, suggested on Monday a cut to oil output could begin in March.

Iran, which was granted an output rise as part of the OPEC deal as it recovers production curbed by sanctions, will also attend the meeting, SHANA news agency said.

A communications briefing from Trump's transition team said despite media reports that Trump owns a stake in Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the pipeline, Trump's support of the pipeline ""has nothing to do with his personal investments and everything to do with promoting policies that benefit all Americans."" 
""Those making such a claim are only attempting to distract from the fact that President-elect Trump has put forth serious policy proposals he plans to set in motion on Day One,"" said the daily briefing note sent to campaign supporters and congressional staff.
Activists have spent months protesting plans to route the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, saying the project poses a threat to water resources and sacred Native American sites.
On Thursday, U.S. military veterans were arriving at a camp to join thousands of activists braving snow and freezing temperatures to protest the pipeline.
Republican Trump has been a vocal supporter of another high-profile pipeline project, Transcanada's Keystone XL, which Democratic President Barack Obama denied a permit for last year.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2016 11:29AM ET</span>","Ahead of deal to cut, OPEC oil output hits record high: Reuters survey","By Alex Lawler
LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC's oil output set another record high in November ahead of a deal to cut production, a Reuters survey found on Monday, helped by higher Iraqi exports and extra barrels from two nations exempted from cutting supply - Nigeria and Libya.
The latest rise in supply means the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will have a bigger task in complying with a plan to cut supply starting in 2017 - its first production-reduction deal since 2008.
Supply from OPEC increased to 34.19 million barrels per day (bpd) in November from 33.82 million bpd in October, according to the survey based on shipping data and information from industry sources.
Brent crude (LCOc1) rose above $55 a barrel on Monday, trading at a 16-month high, on prospects of a tighter market next year following OPEC's deal. Prices are still half their level of mid-2014.
""OPEC's decision to cut production has removed a lot of downside risk for 2017,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, even though ""some cheating is a natural habit among OPEC's members"".
Based on the November survey, OPEC is pumping 1.69 million bpd above the 32.50 million bpd production target that it agreed last week to adopt from January 2017, following an outline agreement reached in September.
Supply has risen since OPEC in 2014 dropped its historic role of fixing output to prop up prices as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran pumped more. Production also climbed due to the return of Indonesia in 2015 and Gabon in July as members.
November's supply from OPEC excluding Gabon and Indonesia, at 33.23 million bpd, is the highest in Reuters survey records starting in 1997. At last week's meeting, Indonesia suspended its membership again.
In November, Angola provided the largest supply boost as planned maintenance on the Dalia crude stream ended.
Output also climbed in Iraq due to record exports, lifting supply to 4.62 million bpd in November according to the survey. Iran, which was allowed to raise output under the OPEC deal as sanctions had crimped its supply, pumped 40,000 bpd more.
Indonesian output rose by 10,000 bpd. 
Libya and Nigeria, both of which are exempt from the supply cut due to the impact on their output from conflict, boosted production in November.
Among countries with lower output, the biggest drop came from top exporter Saudi Arabia due to reduced crude use in power plants for air-conditioning, and lower refiner processing, sources in the survey estimated.

The Reuters survey is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data, and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

The deal will see the producer cartel cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day from January 2017 in a bid to reduce massive global oversupply that has pressured oil prices lower since mid-2014.
The 14-member group is responsible for a third of global oil production, or 33.6 million bpd.
The agreement also included coordinated action with non-OPEC members, who are expected to decrease production by 600,000 barrels a day.
Russia has said it will cut production by 300,000 barrels a day, but said it would do so at November levels.
On Friday Russia reported that its daily oil production averaged 11.21 million bpd in November, the highest in nearly 30 years.
OPEC is expected to hold a meeting with non-OPEC members in Vienna on December 10 to finalize the details of the oil output cut agreement.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries expects oil demand in 2017 to be as robust as this year, the group's secretary general told an energy conference on Monday, though recently agreed production cuts could raise prices for buyers.
Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo, briefing reporters on the sidelines of India's Petrotech energy conference, said Asia would have a big role to play in the demand growth and that there was plenty of room for OPEC and non-OPEC countries to grow in the global oil market.
OPEC last week agreed its first oil output cuts since 2008, looking to reduce production by around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) beginning in January to try to reduce global oversupply and prop up prices. It hopes non-OPEC countries will contribute another 600,000 bpd to the cut. 
Barkindo said OPEC has invited non-OPEC countries Russia, Colombia, Congo, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Oman, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Bolivia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain and Brunei to a meeting on Dec. 10 to discuss their contribution.
""We want the inventory level to be at a past 5 year average, not more and not less than that,"" he said.
Oil prices have risen since the production agreement, with benchmark Brent crude oil futures soaring on Monday to its highest since July 6, 2015 to $55.20 a barrel. [O/R]
This has worried big buyers like India, which imports more than 80 percent of its crude oil and has benefited from two years of soft prices. Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told the conference oil producing countries ""must match security of supply with security of demand"" when deciding prices.
""We are expecting growth next year as robust as this year, in the region of around 1.2 million bpd,"" Barkindo said. ""May be it can go higher, you never know. If it goes higher then producer countries have a right to produce higher in order to meet the demand from countries like India.""
He said oil consumers wanted stability in the market to ensure that future supply was guaranteed. He also said that OPEC members were investing heavily to ensure supplies could meet global oil demand, which is likely to continue to rise steadily.
""Alone in India, oil demand is projected to rise to more than 10 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2040, from 4.1 million barrels per day now,"" Barkindo said. 

Overall, OPEC estimates that world oil demand will rise by 17 million bpd to around 110 million bpd by 2040.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A long-awaited auction of Mexico's untapped deep water oil fields on Monday has been fueled by a nearly $3 billion boom in geological data mapping almost inaccessible deposits to open up what the industry sees as the world's ""last great proven frontier.""
The data rush of the past two years by many top geophysical companies has sparked some of the biggest imaging projects ever for technology also used to hunt for the ruins of ancient civilizations and explain the fate of the dinosaurs. 
""What they're doing is literally rewriting the geological model of the Gulf of Mexico,"" Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of the national hydrocarbons commission (CNH), Mexico's oil regulator, said ahead of Monday's deep water auctions where the likes of  Chevron  (N:CVX) and  BP  (L:BP) are expected to participate.
Aside from more than $2 billion invested since 2015, the companies have already raked in data sales of $520 million, Zepeda said.
The data bonanza has been an early success of a 2013 energy reform that ended the 75-year old monopoly of Mexican state oil company Pemex in a bid to reverse a 1.2 million barrel per day (bpd) slide in crude production over the past dozen years.
Crude output on the U.S. side of the Gulf of Mexico is forecast to hit a record 1.79 million bpd next year. Mexico has yet to sell a single deep water barrel.
The auction of a total of 11 projects could attract investment in the tens of billions of dollars over the lifetime of the contracts, although the first new streams of oil output, expected from Pemex's deep water Trion project, is not expected until 2022 at the earliest.

The latest geological surveys come from shooting electronic and sound waves deep into the sea floor, which bounce back and are collected by sensors. The data is then processed and re-processed by some of the world's most powerful supercomputers.
They yield detailed models of rock layers dating back millions of years that help oil majors avoid dry wells, a vital step at a time of depressed crude prices given that a single deep water well in the Gulf can cost $200 million.
""The competition has been fierce,"" said Karim Lassel, country manager for French geophysical firm CGG, which obtained five seismic permits from the CNH over the past couple years.
CGG has been mapping Mexican rock formations for 30 years, mostly as a Pemex contractor, having acquired all of the company's data for its Perdido Fold Belt acreage, where five potentially lucrative projects are up for grabs on Monday.
""I think the deep water Mexico opportunity is one of the greatest opportunities at the moment globally,"" said Lassel.
SALT AND DINOSAURS
In the past two years, fleets of boats pulling miles-long floating cables dotted with sensors have crisscrossed Mexico's Gulf waters numerous times, teasing out secrets far below.
One survey by U.S. oil services firm Schlumberger covered an area nearly the size of Ireland in just one year with its largest-ever 3D wide-azimuth mapping project.
It explored the Salina, or salt, basin in the Gulf's southern waters, where six blocks are up for auction.
Salt structures are especially promising for oil explorers because they often seal off oil deposits.
Another survey, by Norway's TGS, recently finished the largest-ever 2D survey done at one time, an 18-month project that mapped all of Mexico's Gulf waters using five ships pulling 7-mile-long (12 km) sensor-studded cables.
""Geology does not stop at the border,"" said TGS executive Will Ashby.
The TGS survey can be merged with well-known deep water trends on the U.S. side of the Gulf, a first for the industry.
The same type of data-gathering has also been applied for a less commercial end: confirming the asteroid strike 65 million years ago just off Mexico's Yucatan peninsula that killed off the dinosaurs and most life on earth. 
The first evidence of the 110-mile (176-km) wide crater the asteroid left behind was produced in the 1970s when Pemex engineers extracted drill cores from an unusual circular structure they found in rock dating back to the final dinosaur era.
Since then, nearby discoveries in shallow waters have been the mainstay of Pemex's crude production, contributing nearly 80 percent of the company's 2.1 million bpd of current output.
While oil companies continue to rely on better data to make increasingly expensive decisions, there is still no guarantee a well will produce.

""No matter how far technology has reached,"" said the CNH's Zepeda, ""you cannot be sure what is down there until you drill.""

CANNON BALL, N.D./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said on Sunday it turned down a permit for a controversial pipeline project running through North Dakota, in a victory for Native Americans and climate activists who have protested against the project for months.
A celebration erupted at the main protest camp in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, where the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and others have been protesting against the 1,172-mile (1,885-km) Dakota Access Pipeline.
It may prove to be a short-lived victory, however, because Republican President-elect Donald Trump has said he supports the project. Trump takes over from Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20 and policy experts believe he could reverse the decision if he wanted to. 
The line, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, had been complete except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. 
That stretch required an easement from federal authorities. The Obama administration delayed a decision on the permit twice in an effort to consult further with the tribe.
""The Army will not grant an easement to cross Lake Oahe at the proposed location based on the current record,"" a statement from the U.S. Army said.
Jo-Ellen Darcy, the Army's Assistant Secretary for Civil Works, said in a statement the decision was based on a need to explore alternate routes for the pipeline, although it remained unclear what those alternatives would be.
Energy Transfer Partners and its partner Sunoco Logistics blasted the decision in a statement, calling it the ""latest in a series of overt and transparent political actions"" by the Obama administration. They said they were committed to seeing the project completed without rerouting the line.
Protesters have said the $3.8 billion project could contaminate the water supply and damage sacred tribal lands. 
""I hope they follow through here with this. They haven't been following the law all along. So we'll see - but this is a victory today for our people and our water,"" said Native American Gerad Kipp, 44, an irrigation engineer from Missoula, Montana.
Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II thanked activists for their support in the protest effort. 
""The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and all of Indian Country will be forever grateful to the Obama Administration for this historic decision,"" he said in a statement.
""We want to thank everyone who played a role in advocating for this cause. We thank the tribal youth who initiated this movement,"" he said. 
Protest organizers had for months argued that crossing the Missouri River adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation presented a danger to their water source.
Protests grew over the months, with hundreds of veterans flocking to the camp in recent days to stand against what they said were aggressive law enforcement tactics.
Activists at the camp were seen hugging each other and letting out Native American war cries on Sunday, but many remained wary, knowing that Trump has voiced support for the line. 
""It's not a 100 percent victory. But I think the people who've been here for almost eight months have earned the right to be excited today,"" said Eryn Wise, 26, an organizer with International Indigenous Youth Council.
'FAILS TO RESOLVE ISSUE'
North Dakota Congressman Kevin Cramer and Senator John Hoeven, both Republicans who favor the line, blasted the decision, saying it ""violates the rule of law and fails to resolve the issue."" Cramer, an adviser to Trump under consideration for a Cabinet post, said the president-elect would ""restore law and order."" 
Trump has yet to react to Sunday's decision. 
""He [Trump] could approve the pipeline within a matter of hours of taking office,"" said Brigham McCown, the former head of the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration under George W. Bush. ""He can simply reinstate the previous decision or by executive order say that it’s part of national critical infrastructure and approve a permit.""
Still, the pipeline route's opponents said they hoped the line would be rerouted.
""We're hopeful that when the Trump administration takes office it will look at all of the priorities it has and that putting at risk the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux isn't on their list,"" said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club.
Any alternative route would still likely need to cross the Missouri River, probably upstream of Lake Oahe and closer to the state capital of Bismarck. Many pipelines travel under U.S. waterways already, and pipe is considered a safer way to transport crude oil than rail.
North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, acknowledged that the next steps remain unclear, saying in a statement Sunday the pipeline ""still remains in limbo.""
Pipeline proponents are looking to different policies from the incoming Trump administration, particularly after the Obama administration's denial of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have come from Canada through Nebraska. A number of states and municipalities have made it more difficult to build pipelines in recent years. 

""With the federal environmental assessment finding the current route will have the least impact on the environment, we're looking forward to getting past this administration's politicization of Dakota Access and future decisions made on the merits of this project,"" said John Stoody, a spokesman for the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, in Washington.

U.S. crude oil was trading at $52.23 a barrel at 09:39 GMT, a level not seen since July 2015, up 62 cents or 1.26% from its last close.
Global benchmark Brent futures rose 73 cents or 1.34% to $55.19 a barrel, also the highest level since July 2015.
U.S. crude rallied 14% last week, the largest weekly percentage gain since early 2011 and Brent rose nearly 15% for the week after OPEC agreed on its first production cut since 2008.
The deal will see the producer cartel cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day from January 2017 in a bid to reduce massive global oversupply that has pressured oil prices lower since mid-2014.
The 14-member group is responsible for a third of global oil production, or 33.6 million bpd.
The agreement also included coordinated action with non-OPEC members, who are expected to decrease production by 600,000 barrels a day.
Russia has said it will cut production by 300,000 barrels a day, but said it would do so at November levels.
On Friday Russia reported that its daily oil production averaged 11.21 million bpd in November, the highest in nearly 30 years.
OPEC is expected to hold a meeting with non-OPEC members in Vienna on Friday to finalize the details of its oil output cut agreement.
But analysts have warned that the cuts are likely to cause other producers, especially U.S. shale drillers, to increase output.
A report from energy services firm Baker Hughes on Friday showed that the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil climbed by three to bring the total count to 477 last week, the most since January as oil prices rose."

1554,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2016 06:34PM ET</span>","Netanyahu to discuss 'bad' Iran deal with Trump, Kerry stresses settlements","By Jeffrey Heller and Arshad Mohammed
JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he would discuss with Donald Trump the West's ""bad"" nuclear deal with Iran after the U.S. president-elect enters the White House.
Speaking separately to a conference in Washington, Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry clashed over the Iran deal and Israel's settlement construction on the occupied West Bank, which Kerry depicted as an obstacle to peace.
During the U.S. election campaign, Trump, a Republican, called last year's nuclear pact a ""disaster"" and ""the worst deal ever negotiated"". He has also said it would be hard to overturn an agreement enshrined in a U.N. resolution.
""Israel is committed to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. That has not changed and will not change. As far as President-elect Trump, I look forward to speaking to him about what to do about this bad deal,"" Netanyahu told the Saban Forum, a conference on the Middle East, in Washington, via satellite from Jerusalem. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.
Netanyahu has been a harsh critic of the nuclear deal, a legacy foreign policy achievement for Democratic President Barack Obama. But he had largely refrained from attacking the pact in recent months as Israeli and U.S. negotiators finalised a 10-year, $38 billion military aid package for Israel.
Before the nuclear agreement, Netanyahu, a conservative, strained relations with the White House by addressing the U.S. Congress in 2015 and cautioning against agreeing to the pact.
The Obama administration promoted the deal as a way to suspend Tehran's suspected drive to develop atomic weapons. In return, Obama agreed to lift most sanctions against Iran. Tehran denies ever having considered developing nuclear arms. 
Under the deal, Iran committed to reducing the number of its centrifuges by two-thirds, capping its level of uranium enrichment well below the level needed for bomb-grade material, reducing its enriched uranium stockpile from around 10,000 kg to 300 kg for 15 years, and submitting to international inspections to verify its compliance.
""The problem isn't so much that Iran will break the deal, but that Iran will keep it because it just can walk in within a decade, and even less ... to industrial-scale enrichment of uranium to make the core of an arsenal of nuclear weapons,"" Netanyahu told the forum.
'NO, NO, NO AND NO'
Appearing later in person, Kerry defended the deal, arguing its monitoring provisions provided the ability to detect any significant uptick in Iran's nuclear programs, ""in which case every option that we have today is available to us then.""
Kerry pushed Israel to rein in construction of Jewish settlements on West Bank land it occupied in a 1967 war that the Palestinians want for a state. He also bluntly rejected the idea advanced by some Israelis that Israel might make a separate peace with Arab nations that share its concerns about Iran.
""No, no, no and no,"" Kerry said. ""There will be no advance and separate peace with the Arab world without the Palestinian process and Palestinian peace.""
On settlements, Kerry said: ""There’s a basic choice that has to be made by Israelis ... and that is, are there going to be continued settlements ... or is there going to be separation and the creation of two states?""

The central issues to be resolved in the conflict include borders between Israel and a future Palestinian state, the future of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which most nations regard as illegal, the fate of Palestinian refugees and the status of Jerusalem.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Europe's trade negotiator blamed China on Sunday for scuppering a global environmental trade deal by submitting impossible late demands at World Trade Organization talks aimed at scrapping import tariffs on exports worth more than $1 trillion.
""China came in with their list, bringing in totally new elements of perspective, which was very late in the process,"" European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told Reuters.
The change of U.S. president also puts a big question mark over the future prospects for a deal. 
European resistance to Chinese bicycle imports has also been a stumbling block, although Malmstrom said bicycles had become totemic for China and nobody else, and the agreement went far wider, adding that the EU had ""quite cheap bicycles already"".
Malmstrom was co-chair of the talks, which aimed to cut costs for environmentally beneficial goods by removing trade tariffs applied to them, with U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, who declined to comment as he left.
""Had that (China's list) come earlier we could have worked on this. But now this made it impossible to find an agreement, we were too far away from each other,"" Malmstrom said.
China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement that China had made great efforts to show the flexibility needed to effectively solve the participants' core concerns, but the meeting failed due to ""differences on key issues"".
U.S. Ambassador to the WTO Michael Punke told reporters: “The United States worked hard to find a creative path to a successful EGA agreement. Unfortunately not all participants were ready to contribute to success.” 
WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said it was disappointing that talks had not succeeded but many delegations were strongly committed to getting a deal and hoped for success in 2017.
Malmstrom said she had no idea what U.S. President-elect Donald Trump thought about environmental matters, but she hoped the United States would be ""on board"". Any deal would need the backing of countries responsible for about 90 percent of the trade in the products, so a U.S. absence would kill the talks. 
But the participants, who include Canada, Japan, Israel, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand, have not yet decided which products should be part of the hoped-for Environmental Goods Agreement.

The discussion included products for clean and renewable energy, energy efficiency, controlling air pollution, managing waste, treating waste water, monitoring the quality of the environment, and combating noise pollution, the WTO said.

CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - In the back reaches of the Dakota Access Pipeline protest camp, U.S. military veterans, armed with saws, hammers and other tools, are quietly building barracks, an infirmary and a mess hall.
Despite the bitter cold and an evacuation order from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the veterans hope to erect enough space to house at least several hundred peers making their way into the Oceti Sakowin Camp here in Cannon Ball.
Veterans interviewed by Reuters gave a plethora of motives for traveling here. Some felt it was their patriotic duty to defend protesters, especially since Native Americans have historically had an active presence in the U.S. military.
For others, coming here offers a sense of purpose they have lacked since returning to civilian society. For all, the camaraderie with those who have also shared military service was important.
""Our commitment has not expired because we took off the uniform,"" said Charles Vondal, 51, an Army veteran and Native American from Turtle Mountain, N.D. ""We understand what it means to put our lives on the line.""
The response last month to a call for 2,000 veterans to act as a barrier between activists and law enforcement was much swifter than expected - with organizers having to stop accepting volunteers.
The veterans arriving say their presence will make it less likely that police will resort again to aggressive tactics, after water cannons and tear gas were used on a group of protesters in sub-freezing temperatures two weeks ago.
More than 500 activists have been arrested over the last several months.
“I felt it was our duty to come and stand in front of the guns and the mace and the water and the threat that they pose to these people,"" said Anthony Murtha, 29, from Detroit, who served in the U.S. Navy from 2009 to 2013.
Local law enforcement said the specter of having thousands of military-trained veterans in the area was of concern, but they were not expecting any melees.
""If (veterans) come to this area and they want to protest peacefully, if that's what they want to do and have their voice heard, then there's absolutely no issues with that,"" Kyle Kirchmeier, sheriff for Morton County, North Dakota, where the pipeline is routed, said in an interview Saturday.
Some veterans groups are unhappy with those coming to support the protesters, saying they are standing up for illegal behavior. They also note that many law enforcement officers are veterans. North Dakota's state veterans coordinating council, in a letter last week, asked the veterans who want to stand with the protesters not to come.
""We don't want to see veterans facing down veterans,"" said Lonnie Wangen, commissioner of North Dakota's Department of Veterans Affairs.
But veterans at the camp say pictures and video of water hoses used against Native Americans spoke to their concern of heavy-handed tactics used by law enforcement.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has yet to grant a permit for Energy Transfer Partners to drill under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that is part of the Missouri River.
This one-mile stretch represents the last unfinished portion of the line in North Dakota, which will stretch as far as Illinois.
Native Americans serve at a high rate in the armed forces, according to data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. A 2012 report showed more than 150,000 veterans of Native American descent. U.S. Defense Department data as of 2014 put Alaskan/Native American service members at more than 24,000.
""It's symbolic for people who stood up for this nation’s freedom to stand up for the first inhabitants of this nation,"" said Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, on Saturday.
Veterans Stand With Standing Rock, which organized this weekend's rally and other events, has warned veterans they could experience flashbacks to combat experience.
“We’re under constant surveillance with helicopters and planes flying over. There is a military boundary with barbed wire,” said Angie Spencer, 34, a clinical psychologist from Seattle who has worked with veterans.
The surroundings, she said, mean counselors are vigilant for signs of post-traumatic stress disorder.
On Friday, the rally organizers met with law enforcement on the Backwater Bridge, the site of two of the most heated confrontations between police and protesters in the last several weeks. They said they were there to protest peacefully.
The chances that the pipeline will be stopped at this point seem slim. President-elect Donald Trump last week voiced support for the project, which has been delayed twice since September by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Opposing the pipeline, standing with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, was an opportunity to again find a personal mission, some said.
“You kind of lose your purpose when you’re out (of the military),"" said John Nelson, 25, from San Diego, who spent seven years in the Navy. ""I think that’s why it’s so easy for so many veterans to jump on board.""

CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - In North Dakota, winter is most definitely coming. 
That does not deter Dakota Access Pipeline protesters, many of whom say they know a blizzard earlier this week was but a taste of what is to come, as temperatures are expected to fall toward 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18°C).
Rather than retreat amidst the cold and an order from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to vacate by Monday, the Oceti Sakowin camp, the epicenter of pipeline opposition, is growing in size - and quickly winterizing in expectation of harsher weather.
Dozens of insulated tipis have popped up in recent weeks, adding to those that have dotted these barren plains since last summer. Yurts, a round tent popular in the cold tundra of East Asia, have started appearing. Portable toilets are being swapped out for heated, composting commodes. Ice cleats, which strap onto boots to give stability on ice, are now in demand. 
Taylor Orpin, 23, quit her job to move to the camp last month. She spends her days collating donated coats by size and gender in a tent near the camp's main fire circle.
""I'm very aware of what true cold is going to feel like,"" said Orpin, a native of Winnipeg, Manitoba. ""Here, people are able to come in and just take whatever they need to stay warm.""
Thousands of people, led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, are protesting the pipeline, which would carry crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico. 
The route is adjacent to the Standing Rock reservation, and the tribe and climate activists say the line risks contamination of the tribe's water source and its construction has damaged, and would further damage, sacred sites.
While clothing, food and money have been pouring in from all over the world, the camp's website requests more donations of wood, blankets, winter sleeping bags and propane to help weather the winter.
A division of labor keeps many active, with campers volunteering in the four kitchens, shoveling snow, building tents and doing myriad other tasks.
The multitudes at the camp defy the predictions of state and local officials, many of whom said out-of-state protesters would flee south like migrating birds. Children can be seen sliding playfully down nearby hills while senior citizens gossip over fire pits.
""It's a scare tactic, saying it's too cold to be here,"" said Gemma Akins, 36, a Reiki healer - a form of stress reduction - from Colorado. 
North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple issued an evacuation order for the camp earlier this week, citing the weather. That followed the Army Corps' earlier decree to vacate the camp, which is on federal land, by Monday. The state is not going to enforce that order, and voluntary compliance doesn't look likely. 
""I have zero experience with the cold,"" said Jess Weiner, 29, of Los Angeles, who arrived Thursday. ""But I love the adrenaline of being here."" 
DONATIONS AND SKILLS 
It's not clear how much money has been raised to build and sustain the camp since it was founded last spring, but estimates stand in the millions of dollars. The protests started attracting more attention in the late summer, particularly after clashes between activists and private security hired by Energy Transfer Partners (N:ETP), which is building the line.
The Obama Administration has twice delayed approval for ETP to tunnel the pipeline under the Missouri River. This one-mile stretch is the last unfinished spot on the line in North Dakota. 
The Three Affiliated Tribes of the MHA Nation, another large American Indian tribe in North Dakota, earlier this fall funded portable toilets, food and garbage removal. Even though they have earned billions from the extraction of oil and gas from their lands, the MHA have supported the Standing Rock protest. 
U.S. postal locations in nearby Bismarck and Fort Yates have been engulfed with donated packages. Three UPS (N:UPS) delivery locations in Bismarck have processed more than 5,000 packages in recent weeks. A UPS spokesman said the number well exceeds what is usual for the area.
Financial support, including more than $500,000 alone for a veterans rally this weekend at the camp, have been pouring in through GoFundMe and other crowdfunding websites. 
Beyond donations, Hollywood actors like Shailene Woodley and Susan Sarandon have visited North Dakota, though they are not currently at the camp.
Some campers bring technical skills. Joshua Tree, 42, has helped install solar panels and wind turbines to power a white, dome-like structure that dwarfs everything else here. The dome, which organizers say can hold 380 people, is where most meetings and press events are held. 
""We wanted to help the best way we can. And that's setting up solar power and wind power,"" said Tree.
As the group tries to ward off the cold, challenges loom. One family had to be hospitalized on Thursday due to carbon monoxide poisoning after attempting to heat a tent using propane without proper ventilation. That feeds concern from law enforcement that protesters don't respect the weather. 
""These are people who don't yet understand what cold is,"" Wayne Stenehjem, North Dakota's attorney general, told Reuters.
Signs posted around the camp note there are 18 different communal sleeping areas that are warmer than personal tents.

""We cannot stress how cold it's going to get,"" the posting reads. ""Don't be in a small tent or your car and think you'll be OK. Let's all look after each other.""

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2016 04:41AM ET</span>",U.S. veterans to meet with tribe elders in pipeline protest,"By Ernest Scheyder and Terray Sylvester
CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - U.S. military veterans will meet with tribal leaders on Saturday as they continue to entrench themselves in a North Dakota camp where thousands of activists are protesting a multibillion-dollar pipeline project near a Native American reservation. 
Veterans Stand for Standing Rock members will meet with Standing Rock Sioux elders to determine how the potentially 3,500 veterans arriving over the weekend can aide protesters who have spent months demonstrating against plans to route the Dakota Access Pipeline beneath a lake near the tribe's reservation. 
The group of veterans are also expected over the weekend to complete building a barracks and mess hall near where they constructed a headquarters at the Oceti Sakowin camp about 5 miles (8 km) north of the small town of Cannon Ball. 
The Native Americans and protesters say the $3.8 billion pipeline threatens water resources and sacred sites.
Wesley Clark Jr, a writer whose father is retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark, met with law enforcement on Friday to tell them that 3,500 veterans may join the protest and the demonstrations would be carried out peacefully, protest leaders said.
Tribal leaders asked the veterans, who aim to form a wall in front of police to protect the protesters, to avoid confrontation with authorities and not get arrested. 
There have been violent confrontations near the route of the pipeline with state and local law enforcement, who used tear gas, rubber bullets and water hoses on the protesters, even in freezing weather. 
""I felt it was our duty and very personally more of a call of duty than I ever felt in the service to come and stand in front of the guns and the mace and the water and the threat that they pose to these people,"" said Anthony Murtha, 29, a Navy veteran from Detroit, at the Oceti Sakowin camp. 
Some 564 people have been arrested, the Morton County Sheriff's Department said.
The number of protesters in recent weeks has topped 1,000. State officials on Monday ordered them to leave the snowy camp, which is on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land, citing harsh weather, but on Wednesday they said they would not enforce the order.
Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier spoke by phone on Friday with U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, but assistance for law enforcement and a timeline for a resolution to the situation were not offered, the sheriff's office said. 
Lynch said in a statement that the U.S. Department of Justice has been in communication with all sides in an effort to reduce tensions and foster dialogue. 
State officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters, and Dalrymple said his evacuation order stemmed mainly from concerns about dangerously cold conditions as the temperature in Cannon Ball is expected to fall to 4 degrees Fahrenheit (-16 Celsius) next week. 
The 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline project, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, is mostly complete, except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River.

Protesters, who refer to themselves as ""water protectors"", have been gearing up for the winter while they await the Army Corps decision on whether to allow Energy Transfer to tunnel under the river. The Army Corps has twice delayed that decision.

Two OPEC sources earlier said the meeting was due to take place in the Russian capital Moscow, but later said that plan had changed.
OPEC agreed this week to reduce output by around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) beginning in January in a bid to reduce global oversupply and prop up prices.

It hopes non-OPEC countries will contribute another 600,000 bpd to the cut. Russia has said it will reduce output by around 300,000 bpd.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2016 04:05PM ET</span>",Hedge funds trim bullish bets on U.S. crude ahead of OPEC deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge funds and money managers scaled back their bullish bets on U.S. crude oil in the days ahead of a landmark deal by the world's top crude exporters to cut production and rein in a global glut, data showed on Friday.
The speculator group cut its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 2,418 contracts to 189,677 during in the week to Nov. 29, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said. That cut was the first in three weeks.
Gross long positions in NYMEX crude oil futures and options fell by 16,337 contracts to 335,219 lots. 
However, some traders also unwound their short positions, data showed. Gross short positions, representing bearish bets, fell by 17,099 to 146,133 lots. 
During the period, U.S. crude oil prices fell nearly 1 percent as the chances that members of The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would resolve differences and agree to an output cut on Nov. 30 appeared bleak.
The group had said in September it would limit output in an effort to boost prices, which plunged to 12-year lows earlier this year due to massive oversupply. 
In the days leading up to the deal, several squabbles were reported as Iraq, Libya and Nigeria called for exemptions. Iran, with whom top exporter Saudi Arabia has had disagreements with in the past, was also seen as a hurdle in a potential deal being struck.
However, OPEC agreed on Wednesday to its first oil output cuts since 2008 after Saudi Arabia accepted ""a big hit"" on its production and dropped its demand on arch-rival Iran to slash output, pushing up crude prices by about 10 percent.
After the deal was announced, non-OPEC member Russia said it would cut its oil output from November-December levels, Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters on Thursday.
Domestically, crude stockpiles in the U.S. fell unexpectedly in the week to Nov. 25 as imports dropped.
During that week, crude inventories fell 884,000 barrels, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 636,000 barrels. [EIA/S]
Data on Friday also showed U.S. energy companies extended their recovery in oil drilling into a seventh month this week as they follow through on plans to add rigs. [RIG/U]
On Friday, U.S. crude rose about 1 percent and rallied to notch its biggest weekly gain since 2011. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled at $51.68 per barrel, up 62 cents, or 1.2 percent. [O/R]
Among refined products, speculators raised their bullish bets in gasoline to a two-week high, with a combined futures and options net long position of 22,086 contracts in the week to Nov. 29.

The group also boosted its net long position on ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) to a three-week high. Speculators held a net long position of 9,337 ULSD futures and options contracts.

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2016 03:21PM ET</span>",Oil rallies to best week in years after OPEC output deal,"By Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rallied for their best week in at least five years on Friday, steadying above $51 a barrel, following OPEC's decision to cut crude output to rein in a global glut that has weighed on prices for more than two years.
After the deal was announced on Wednesday, the market focused on the implementation and impact of OPEC's first output cuts since 2008, to be joined by Russia and possibly other non-OPEC producers.
Crude prices were pressured by data showing oil output in Russia rose in November to a post-Soviet high and Moscow's plan to use its record November oil production as its baseline when it cuts output.
With cuts being implemented next year only against end-2016 levels, analysts said there was still a possibility that oversupply, which has halved oil prices since 2014, remains a factor next year.
""Global, and especially U.S., crude oil inventories are currently at extremely high levels after two years of massive oversupply,""  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) analysts said.
""While the OPEC agreement is very significant and will result in some moderate global stockdraws next year, it is likely to take more than one year for crude inventory levels to return to more normal levels.""
Front-month Brent crude futures (LCOc1) ended the session up at $54.46 a barrel, up 52 cents, 0.96 percent. The contract rose more than 15 percent for the week, its biggest gain since early 2009.
U.S. crude (CLc1) settled at $51.68 per barrel, up 62 cents or 1.21 percent and notched its biggest weekly gain since early 2011, with a rise of 12 percent. 
Oil drew support from a weak dollar, which slipped against a basket of currencies (DXY). Still, traders said profit-taking ahead of the weekend limited crude's price gains.
""The petroleum markets have settled into quieter mixed flows as the waves created by Wednesday's OPEC announcement gradually dissipate, with some light profit taking emerging in crude oil,"" said Tim Evans, energy futures specialist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
""A weaker U.S. dollar is typically supportive for commodity prices and may have helped steady crude oil from the lows in today's trade.""
Prices rose to session highs after the White House said it expects U.S. President Barack Obama to sign U.S. legislation extending sanctions against Iran for 10 years into law. 
Iran is also seen as a wild card in the execution of the OPEC deal. 
U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is examining proposals for new non-nuclear sanctions on Iran, the Financial Times reported on Friday. 
Iran had threatened on Friday to retaliate against the U.S. Senate's vote to extend the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) for 10 years, saying it violated last year's deal with six major powers that curbed its nuclear program. 
The sanctions were first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Iran's energy industry and deter its pursuit of nuclear weapons.

Meanwhile, U.S. energy companies extended their recovery in oil drilling into a seventh month this week, data from energy services firm  Baker Hughes  Inc (N:BHI) showed on Friday. [RIG/U]

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2016 03:11PM ET</span>",U.S. military veterans backing North Dakota pipeline protests,"By Ernest Scheyder and Terray Sylvester
CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - U.S. military veterans plan to build a barracks on Friday at a protest camp in North Dakota to support thousands of activists who have squared off against authorities in frigid conditions to oppose a multibillion-dollar pipeline project near the Standing Rock Native American reservation.
Veterans volunteering to be human shields have been arriving at the Oceti Sakowin camp near the small town of Cannon Ball, where they will work with protesters who have spent months demonstrating against plans to route the Dakota Access Pipeline beneath a lake near the Sioux reservation, organizers said.
The Native Americans and protesters say the $3.8 billion pipeline threatens water resources and sacred sites.
Some of the more than 2,100 veterans who signed up on the Veterans Stand for Standing Rock group's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page are at the camp, with hundreds more expected during the weekend. Tribal leaders asked the veterans, who aim to form a wall in front of police to protect the protesters, to avoid confrontation with authorities and not get arrested.
The plan is for veterans to gather in Eagle Butte, a few hours away, and then travel by bus to the main protest camp, organizers said, adding that a big procession is planned for Monday.
Protesters began setting up tents, tepees and other structures in April and the numbers swelled in August at the main camp. 
Joshua Tree, 42, from Los Angeles, who has been visiting the camp for weeks at a time since September, said he felt pulled to the protest.
""Destiny called me here,"" he said at the main camp. ""We're committed. This cause has created momentum.""
'GO HOME' 
Those voices have been heard by companies linked to the pipeline as well, including banks that have been targeted by protesters for their financing of the pipeline. 
 Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) said in a Thursday letter it would meet with Standing Rock elders before Jan. 1 ""to discuss their concerns related to Wells Fargo's investment"" in the project. 
There have been violent confrontations near the route of the pipeline with state and local law enforcement, who used tear gas, rubber bullets and water hoses on the protesters, even in freezing weather.
The number of protesters in recent weeks has topped 1,000. State officials on Monday ordered them to leave the snowy camp, which is on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land, citing harsh weather, but on Wednesday they said they would not enforce the order.
""There is an element there of people protesting who are frightening,"" North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said on Thursday. ""It's time for them to go home."" 
U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday he supported the completion of the pipeline and his transition team also said he supported peaceful protests. 
Members of the North Dakota Veterans Coordinating Council denounced the involvement of veterans in a protest that has damaged property and asked them not to take part. 
North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple said on Wednesday it was ""probably not feasible"" to reroute the pipeline but he would try to rebuild a relationship with Standing Rock Sioux leaders. 
On Friday, Morton County Commission Chairman Cody Schulz said his office has been working in conjunction with the governor's office to meet with tribal leaders soon.
FREEZING COLD 
Morton County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Maxine Herr said 564 people have been arrested since the start of demonstrations. 
State officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters, and Dalrymple said his evacuation order stemmed mainly from concerns about dangerously cold temperatures. Engineers interviewed by Reuters also said such weather made some aspects of pipeline construction more difficult.
The temperature in Cannon Ball is expected to fall to 4 degrees Fahrenheit (-16 Celsius) by the middle of next week, according to Weather.com forecasts.
The 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline project, owned by Texas-based  Energy Transfer Partners LP  (N:ETP), is mostly complete, except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. 
Protesters, who refer to themselves as ""water protectors,"" have been gearing up for the winter while they await the Army Corps decision on whether to allow Energy Transfer to tunnel under the river. The Army Corps has twice delayed that decision.
The pipeline operator said in a legal filing in late November that delays following the projected Jan. 1 startup would cost about $84 million a month.

Trump is due to meet on Friday with Democratic U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who, according to a source familiar with the matter, is under consideration for a Cabinet position in the Trump administration.

Oil prices fluctuated throughout the session, two days after energy policy ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) settled on a new production cutting pact at a meeting in Austria. Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, was down by about 1% to $53.45 in London trading.
Overall, Brent Oiland Crude Oil pries were up signficantly during the day, more than 12% since Wednesday’s deal, Later, prices climbed.
Oil analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase and other industry analysts on Wall Street say the OPEC cuts, if they are actually undertaken, a questionable proposition to many observers, might hold prices between $55 and $60 a barrel—a level OPEC members have said they are seeking.
There was word on the street that some of the less affluent oil producing nations, like Venezuala, and even Angola, in South America and Africa, respectively, may break with the oil production pact.
The U.S. is expected to move forward with expansive plans for oil and gas production. At an event in Cincinnati, Ohio, last night, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump reiterated campaign promises that his new administration will clear regulatory hurdles for oil, gas, natural gas and shale producers, come Jan. 20, 2017, his inauguration day in Washington D.C.

Economists had expected 180,000 new jobs and a jobless rate of 4.9% in November. There are still some 90 million Americans who are not in the U.S. workforce, however, due to structural changes over the last decade in the U.S. economy. President-elect Donald Trump has said that he believed, during the campaign this summer and fall, that unemployment in the U.S. was actually closer to 25% if those who are dispirited and no longer looking for a job, not retirees, were included in the unemployment figures. Backing up this line of analytical thinking is a figure from the unemployment report of this month that indicates more than 400,000 Americans dropped out of the labor force last month.
Earnings for private sector, non-government employees, also, surprisingly, declined last month in the U.S.

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2016 11:20AM ET</span>",Iran says U.S. extension of sanctions act violates nuclear deal,"By Parisa Hafezi
ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran threatened on Friday to retaliate against a U.S. Senate vote to extend the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) for 10 years, saying it violated last year's deal with six major powers that curbed its nuclear program. 
The ISA was first adopted in 1996 to punish investments in Iran's energy industry and deter its alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons. The extension was passed unanimously on Thursday.
U.S. officials said the ISA's renewal would not infringe on the nuclear agreement, under which Iran agreed to limit its sensitive atomic activity in return for the lifting of international financial sanctions that harmed its oil-based economy.
But senior Iranian officials took odds with that view. Iran's nuclear energy chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, who played a central role in reaching the nuclear deal, described the extension as a ""clear violation"" if implemented. 
""We are closely monitoring developments,"" state TV quoted Salehi as saying. ""If they implement the ISA, Iran will take action accordingly.""
The diplomatic thaw in swing between Washington and Tehran over the past two years looks in jeopardy with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump taking office next month. He said during his election campaign that he would scrap the nuclear agreement. 
Iran's most powerful authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had already warned in November that an extension of U.S. sanction would be viewed in Tehran as a violation of the nuclear accord. 
""Iran has shown its commitment to its international agreements, but we are also prepared for any possible scenario. We are ready to firmly protect the nation's rights under any circumstances,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said in comments reported by state news agency IRNA. 
RETALIATION
The U.S. Senate vote was a blow to pragmatist Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who engineered the diplomatic opening to the West that led to the nuclear deal, and may embolden his hardline rivals ahead of presidential election next year. 
Khamenei and his hardline loyalists, drawn from among Shi'ite Muslim clerics and Revolutionary Guards, have criticized the deal and blamed Rouhani for its failure to deliver swift improvements in living standards since the lifting of international sanctions in January. 
It was not immediately clear what form any eventual retaliation for the U.S. Senate vote might take. 
Lawmaker Akbar Ranjbarzadeh said Iran's parliament would convene on Sunday to discuss a bill obliging the government to ""immediately halt implementation of the nuclear deal"" if Obama approves the ISA, the Students News Agency ISNA reported. 
Another lawmaker quoted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency said Iran's parliament planned to discuss a bill that would prevent the government purchasing ""American products"". 
Such a bill could endanger deals such as U.S. planemaker Boeing's (N:BA) tentative accord to sell passenger jets to Iran, upgrading a fleet long deteriorating due to sanctions. 
The White House had not pushed for an extension of the sanctions act, but had not raised serious objections. Some congressional aides said they expected President Barack Obama to sign the extension.
The ISA had been due to expire on Dec. 31. Lawmakers said the extension would make it easier for sanctions to be reimposed if Iran violated the nuclear settlement.
Influential Friday prayer leaders, appointed by Khamenei, strongly denounced the ISA extension and called on the government to take action, according to IRNA.
Trump described Iran in campaign speeches as the world's biggest state sponsor of terrorism and dismissed the nuclear accord as ""one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated.""

(Reuters) - A Nebraska nonprofit on Friday said it will propose that Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) sell its investments in oil refiner Phillips 66 (N:PSX) and other companies involved in fossil fuels over 12 years.
The Nebraska Peace Foundation, which focuses on anti-war, civil rights and environmental issues, said it submitted a formal proposal for Berkshire shareholders to consider at the Omaha-based conglomerate's annual meeting next May 6.
Berkshire did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the proposal, which was reported earlier by the Associated Press.
The nonprofit would face an uphill battle absent support from Buffett, who commands nearly one-third of Berkshire's voting power.
In April, shareholders including Buffett defeated its proposal that Berkshire report on the risks that climate change posed for its insurance businesses.
Buffett called that proposal unnecessary, and only 11 percent of the votes cast favored it.
The nonprofit said its fossil fuels proposal reflects the need to reduce greenhouse gases and shift toward renewable energy, without endangering Berkshire's near-term profitability.
It said the proposal would not cover businesses that Berkshire owns outright, including several utilities and the chemical company Lubrizol.
Instead, it would cover investments such as Berkshire's nearly $7 billion stake in Phillips 66, and its recently sold stake in Canada's  Suncor Energy  Inc (TO:SU).
Buffett owns about 18 percent of Berkshire. Forbes magazine on Friday estimated his net worth at $71.7 billion.
The Suncor sale ""reinforces our faith about what Warren Buffett can do about this,"" Tim Rinne, state coordinator for Nebraskans for Peace, with which the foundation is affiliated, said in an interview.
""He's a huge philanthropist, he's an international icon and he's extraordinarily smart,"" Rinne said. ""That puts him in an ideal position to make a statement for the entire world about addressing the perils of climate change.""

Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses including Geico auto insurer, Dairy Queen ice cream and Fruit of the Loom underwear.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2016 09:35AM ET</span>","Ahead of promised cut, Russia's oil output hits record high","By Katya Golubkova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia plans to use its November oil production, which was its highest in almost 30 years, as its baseline when it cuts output under this week's deal with OPEC, Deputy Energy Minister Kirill Molodtsov said on Friday.
Russia has promised to gradually cut output by up to 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017 as part of a deal with other producers aimed at supporting oil prices. 
Its daily oil production rose to an average of 11.21 million bpd in November, Russia's highest since the Soviet era, energy ministry data showed on Friday.
That was 500,000 bpd higher than in August, the month before Russia and OPEC reached a preliminary agreement in Algiers to cap production.
Under this week's follow-up agreement, the first between OPEC and Russia since 2001, specific cuts for individual states were set, with almost all OPEC members agreeing to cut from October levels.
But Russia will use its November-December output levels, Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters on Thursday. November's production rose only slightly from October, by just 10,000 bpd, ministry data showed. 
""The peak of daily production for November was 11.231 million barrels,"" Deputy Energy Minister Molodtsov told a conference in Moscow. 
""All our agreements will clearly be formed around this figure,"" he said. According to his presentation, Russian production could grow to 11.3 million bpd in December. 
NEW FIELDS
Lukoil and Surgutneftegas raised output in November while production slipped at fields operated by Rosneft, Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) Neft and their joint venture Slavneft, preliminary data showed.  
""The most important thing is that we had growth plans for another 200,000 bpd (in Russia in total) above the current level, so practically, 0.5 million bpd will not reach the market,"" Lukoil vice-president Leonid Fedun told reporters.
Rosneft, Gazprom Neft and Lukoil have all launched new fields this year and increased drilling, despite low oil prices. 
Novak has said that all companies will join the cut. Details should be finalised close to the end of the next week for a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC nations, which may happen in Moscow on Dec. 10. 
Fedun said that cuts from Russia are likely only from the second quarter of the next year because it needs time to lower output - technically challenging due to severe weather. 
""There are low-marginal wells which will be stopped during this agreement,"" Fedun said when asked how Lukoil is going to contribute. 
""A year is enough for the market to rebalance... The balance will be reached - and (we) could restart again.""

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2016 06:32AM ET</span>","As winter nears, Dakota Access faces frigid weather and costly delays","By Liz Hampton and Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) - Delays to the Dakota Access Pipeline have added millions of dollars to Energy Transfer Partners' construction tab - but even if the line is approved, the freezing temperatures will bring their own challenges to finishing the drilling process.
Frigid weather makes some aspects of pipeline construction more difficult, though not impossible, engineers and experts interviewed by Reuters said this week. 
While the majority of the construction on the 1,100-mile (1,770 km) line is complete, work on a one-mile segment in North Dakota was halted in September following protests from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and others, who said it could desecrate sacred lands and contaminate drinking water. That stretch would be expected to take 90 to 120 days to finish, ETP has said.
Construction equipment used to bore under rivers can break through any layer of frost, said Eric Hansen, the director of environmental services at Westwood Professional Services, a surveying and engineering firm in the U.S. upper Midwest.
At issue, however, is the fluid construction companies use to lubricate the drill head. That drilling fluid, which circulates to clear out debris and keep parts lubricated, freezes at air temperatures between 10 and 20 degrees Fahrenheit (-12 to -7 Celsius).
To avoid this, pipeline crews will keep equipment running nonstop, which allows them to avoid warming up equipment that's been turned off in cold weather, said an engineer who has done work in North Dakota but declined to be named. 
The median temperature in Morton County, North Dakota, near the pipeline route is 13 degrees F between December and February, according to the National Weather Service. The NWS is forecasting a 60 percent chance that temperatures will be lower than that median for the next three months. 
Hansen added that the high winds in North Dakota and heavy snow accumulation can also slow operations. The temperature in Cannon Ball, North Dakota was 30 degrees F on Thursday. 
As the U.S. government weighs whether to grant Energy Transfer the easement, the pipeline operator said in a legal filing in late November that delays following the projected Jan. 1 start-up would cost about $84 million a month. 
Energy Transfer Partners this week said it still expected to complete the pipeline in the first quarter of next year, even after the U.S. government in November further delayed a decision on whether to grant the company an easement needed to drill under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that is part of the Missouri River.
Even if boring started at the beginning of 2017, the 90 to 120-day time frame for completion could mean additional costs of between $252 million and $336 million. 
The company has moved equipment to begin drilling under Lake Oahe as soon as it receives the easement. The pipeline was originally slated to begin transporting oil out of the Bakken shale to the U.S. Midwest by the end of this year. 
The segment of the Dakota Access that needs completion will burrow under the ground before Lake Oahe, and then cut about 100 feet below the bottom of the river, according to environmental assessment documents from the Army Corps of Engineers and Dakota Access company. 
Pipeline companies accustomed to working in freezing temperatures have ways to combat the elements, such as using heated shacks at the site to protect welders, said John Stoody, vice president of government and public relations at the Association of Oil Pipelines, an industry group.
Capital-intensive pipeline projects are underpinned by firm commitments from shippers, meaning an exodus of shippers due to delays could erode the economic viability of the line. 
""Loss of shippers to the project could effectively result in project cancellation,"" the company said in a court filing. 

Energy Transfer cannot access the remaining $1.4 billion of its credit facility without all necessary approvals for the line, the company said on its quarterly earnings call.

The dollar had strengthened broadly on Wednesday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached an agreement on an oil output cut aimed at tackling global oversupply and shoring up prices.
Expectations for higher oil prices added to U.S. inflation expectations, which have already been boosted by prospects for increased fiscal spending under the Trump administration.
The dollar also found support after the Institute for Supply Management said on Thursday that its manufacturing activity index rose to 53.2 last month from October’s reading of 51.9. Analysts had forecast a smaller increase to 52.2.
On a less positive note, the U.S. Department of Labor said initial jobless claims increased by 17,000 to 268,000 last week, confounding expectations for a 2,000 rise to 253,000.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.

The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing activity index rose to 53.2 last month from October’s reading of 51.9. Analysts had forecast a smaller increase to 52.2.
The report came after the U.S. Department of Labor said that initial jobless claims in the week ending November 26 increased by 17,000 to 268,000 from the previous week’s total of 251,000. Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by just 2,000 to 253,000 last week.
The data made the case that the Federal Reserve will take a more aggressive approach on monetary policy this month. The Fed has been loathe to raise interest rates, during the Obama administration, because of tepid economic performance during the ""recovery"" from the Great Recession of 2007. U.S.

1576,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2016 09:06PM ET</span>",U.S. veterans arrive at pipeline protest camp in North Dakota,"By Terray Sylvester and Alicia Underlee Nelson
CANNON BALL/WEST FARGO, N.D. (Reuters) - U.S. military veterans were arriving on Thursday at a camp to join thousands of activists braving snow and freezing temperatures to protest a pipeline project near a Native American reservation in North Dakota.
However, other veterans in the state took exception to the efforts of the group organizing veterans to act as human shields for the protesters, saying the nature of the protests reflected poorly on the participants. 
Protesters have spent months rallying against plans to route the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, saying it poses a threat to water resources and sacred Native American sites.
State officials on Monday ordered activists to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp, located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, citing harsh weather conditions. Officials said on Wednesday however that they will not actively enforce the order. 
Matthew Crane, a 32-year-old Navy veteran who arrived three days ago, said the veterans joining the protest were ""standing on the shoulders of Martin Luther King Jr and Gandhi"" with the their plans to shield protesters.
""I bought a one-way ticket,"" he told Reuters as he worked to build a wooden shelter at the main camp. ""Hopefully we can shut this down before Christmas.""
U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said for the first time that he supports the completion of the pipeline.
Trump's transition team also said Trump supported peaceful protests.
""We respect all Americans’ first amendment right to peacefully protest, and we hope that local and federal officials continue to give support to local law enforcement so they are able to continue to protect these protesters,"" said the Trump transition team's daily note sent to campaign supporters and congressional staff.
Meanwhile in West Fargo, North Dakota, several members of the North Dakota Veterans Coordinating Council, which represents five veterans organizations in the state, held a news conference to decry the involvement of veterans in a protest that has damaged property and asked veterans not to participate in the demonstration. 
""We agree that it is our constitutional right to assemble and to peacefully protest,"" council President Russ Stabler told reporters at the West Fargo VFW Post 7564 building. ""However, protests over the last 100-plus days in North Dakota have been less than peaceful. 
""Participating in this kind of assembly even as a peaceful bystander or participant will only mar the image of the North Dakota veterans and the veterans of our nation,"" he added as he stood surrounded by about a dozen veterans from the region.
North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple on Wednesday told reporters it was ""probably not feasible"" to reroute the pipeline, but he would try to rebuild a relationship with Standing Rock Sioux leaders.
Dalrymple said state officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters and his evacuation order was mainly due to concerns about inclement weather endangering people. Frigid weather makes some aspects of pipeline construction more difficult, engineers interviewed by Reuters said.
The Standing Rock Sioux, in a statement on Wednesday, said that because ""the Governor of North Dakota and Sheriff of Morton County are relative newcomers"" to the land, ""it is understandable they would be concerned about severe winter weather.""
They said the camp has adequate shelter to handle the cold weather, adding that the Great Sioux Nation has survived ""in this region for millennia without the concerns of state or county governments."" 
The temperature in Cannon Ball is expected to fall to 6 degrees Fahrenheit (-14 Celsius) by the middle of next week, according to Weather.com forecasts.
Veterans Stand for Standing Rock, a contingent of more than 2,000 U.S. military veterans, intends to reach North Dakota by this weekend and form a human wall in front of police, protest organizers said on a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
The 1,172-mile (1,885 km) pipeline project, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, is mostly complete, except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. 
Protesters, who refer to themselves as “water protectors,” have been gearing up for the winter while they await the Army Corps decision on whether to allow Energy Transfer Partners to tunnel under the river. That decision has been delayed twice by the Army Corps.

On Wednesday, the North Dakota Emergency Commission approved another $7 million to provide support for law enforcement who deployed to deal with protesters. The commission previously approved an additional $10 million in funds to cover the escalating costs of the protests.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday said for the first time that he supports the completion of a pipeline project near a North Dakota Indian reservation, which has been the subject of months of protests by tribes and environmentalists. 
A communications briefing from Trump's transition team said despite media reports that Trump owns a stake in Energy Transfer Partners (N:ETP), the company building the pipeline, Trump's support of the pipeline ""has nothing to do with his personal investments and everything to do with promoting policies that benefit all Americans.""

""Today, Mr. Trump expressed his support for the Dakota Access Pipeline, which has met or exceeded all environmental standards set forth by four states and the Army Corps of Engineers,"" Hoeven said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed a 10-year extension of sanctions against Iran on Thursday, sending the measure to the White House for President Barack Obama to sign into law and delaying any potentially tougher actions until next year.
The measure passed by 99-0. It passed the House of Representatives nearly unanimously in November, and congressional aides said they expected Obama would sign it.
The ISA will expire on Dec. 31 if not renewed. The White House had not pushed for an extension, but had not raised serious objections.
Members of Congress and administration officials said the renewal of the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) would not violate the nuclear agreement with Iran reached last year.
""While we do not think that an extension of ISA is necessary, we do not believe that a clean extension would be a violation of the JCPOA (Iran deal),"" a senior administration official said.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said recently the extension would breach the agreement and threatened retaliation.
Democrats who backed the accord said they did not believe the ISA extension violated the pact because it continued a sanctions regime that was already in place. They said they had not heard such objections from U.S. partners.
""I have not heard strident objections from our key allies in the JCPOA,"" Democratic Senator Chris Coons told reporters.
The agreement was signed by the United States, Britain, Russia, France, China, Germany and Iran.
Congress' action did not address the fate of the nuclear pact, which was opposed by every Republican in the Senate and House. Lawmakers said it would make it easier for sanctions to be quickly reimposed if Iran violated the deal.
Republican U.S. President-elect Donald Trump railed against the pact as he campaigned for the White House. Many other members of his party, which also controls Congress, have called for the new administration to tear up the agreement.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said the renewal ensures Trump can reimpose sanctions Obama lifted under the deal, in which Iran curbed its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.
""Extending the Iran Sanctions Act ... ensures President-elect Trump and his administration have the tools necessary to push back against the regime’s hostile actions,"" Corker said in a statement.
Trump becomes president on Jan. 20. Corker has been mentioned as a possible Trump secretary of state.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices surged 4 percent on Thursday, with Brent crude at its highest in about 16 months, extending gains after OPEC and Russia agreed to restrict output to reduce the global supply glut more quickly.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on Wednesday to its first oil output reduction since 2008 after the group's leading producer Saudi Arabia accepted ""a big hit"" and dropped a demand that arch-rival Iran also slash output. 
The deal also included OPEC's first coordinated action in 15 years with non-member Russia. Azerbaijan said it was also willing to discuss cuts.
Doubts about the historic deal were widespread in the market.
""It remains to be seen how well they stick to the plan, but if OPEC hadn't come to an agreement the probability is that oil prices would have fallen to $40 a barrel, perhaps even lower,"" said Simon Flowers, chief analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
""Brent was trading at about $50 a barrel after the announcement, and we expect it to trade at an average of $55-$60 per barrel in 2017."" 
Benchmark Brent futures settled 4.1 percent or $2.10 higher at $53.94. Earlier in the session, prices jumped as much as 5.2 percent to $54.53 a barrel, the highest level since July 27, 2015. 
U.S. crude ended the session at $51.06, up $1.62 or 3.3 percent on the day. Its session high was $51.80 a barrel, 13 cents below its 2016 high.
Brent crude's premium to U.S crude widened to the biggest in about ten weeks. 
U.S. refined products also rose along with crude - ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) futures soared as much as 5.5 percent to its highest in more than a year while gasoline futures jumped as much as 6 percent.
The OPEC deal triggered frenzied trading, with Brent futures hitting record trading volumes for February and March, when the supply cuts should start to be visible in the market.
The Intercontinental Exchange Inc said ICE Brent crude futures hit a daily volume record of 1.96 million contracts on Wednesday while the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) said open interest in WTI futures rose to a record 2.1 million contracts on the day of the OPEC agreement. [nASC09LHZ]
Even after Thursday's steep rise, oil prices remained about half their mid-2014 levels, when prices began to collapse to the lowest in a generation.
OPEC produces a third of global oil, or around 33.6 million barrel per day, and the deal aims to reduce output by 1.2 million bpd from January 2017, similar to January 2016 levels.
""It's clearly too soon to know what beyond the short-term market gain will be the consequences of this mini-renaissance of OPEC - for other producers and for the group itself,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said. 
Others noted that the cuts could leave the field open for other producers, especially U.S. shale drillers.
""We do not believe that oil prices can sustainably remain above $55 per barrel, with global production responding first and foremost in the U.S.,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.
The head of the International Energy Agency Fatih Birol warned of greater volatility after the OPEC deal.
""Unlike in the past OPEC decisions, if prices move to around $60, a substantial amount of oil in United states is ready to come to the markets,"" Birol said.
OPEC will hold talks with non-OPEC producers on Dec. 9. The group will also have its next meeting on May 25 to monitor the deal, which it said it could extend for six months.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2016 02:09PM ET</span>","Exclusive: How Putin, Khamenei and Saudi prince got OPEC deal done","By Rania El Gamal, Parisa Hafezi and Dmitry Zhdannikov
VIENNA (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin played a crucial role in helping OPEC rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia set aside differences to forge the cartel's first deal with non-OPEC Russia in 15 years. 
Interventions ahead of Wednesday's OPEC meeting came at key moments from Putin, Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani, OPEC and non-OPEC sources said.
Putin’s role as intermediary between Riyadh and Tehran was pivotal, testament to the rising influence of Russia in the Middle East since its military intervention in the Syrian civil war just over a year ago. 
It started when Putin met Saudi Prince Mohammed in September on the sidelines of a G20 gathering in China.
The two agreed to cooperate to help world oil markets clear a glut that had more than halved oil prices since 2014, pummeling Russian and Saudi government revenues. Oil prices are up 10 pct this week topping $53 a barrel.
The financial pain made a deal possible despite the huge political differences between Russia and Saudi over the civil war in Syria.
""Putin wants the deal. Full stop. Russian companies will have to cut production,"" said a Russian energy source briefed on the discussions.
In September, OPEC agreed in principle at a meeting in Algiers to reduce output for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis.
But the individual country commitments required to finalize a deal at Wednesday's Vienna meeting still required much diplomacy.
Recent OPEC meetings have failed because of arguments between de facto leader Saudi Arabia and third-largest producer Iran. Tehran has long argued OPEC should not prevent it restoring output lost during years of Western sanctions.
Proxy wars in Syria and Yemen have exacerbated decades of tensions between the Saudi Sunni kingdom and the Iranian Shi'ite Islamic republic. 
BRINKMANSHIP
Heading into the meeting, the signs were not good. Oil markets went into reverse. Saudi Prince Mohammed had repeatedly demanded Iran participate in supply cuts. Saudi and Iranian OPEC negotiators had argued in circles in the run-up to the meeting.
And, then, just a few days beforehand, Riyadh appeared back away from a deal, threatening to boost production if Iran failed to contribute cuts.
But Putin established that the Saudis would shoulder the lion's share of cuts, as long as Riyadh wasn't seen to be making too large a concession to Iran. A deal was possible if Iran didn't celebrate victory over the Saudis.
A phone call between Putin and Iranian President Rouhani smoothed the way. After the call, Rouhani and oil minister Bijan Zanganeh went to their supreme leader for approval, a source close to the Ayatollah said.
""During the meeting, the leader Khamenei underlined the importance of sticking to Iran's red line, which was not yielding to political pressures and not to accept any cut in Vienna,"" the source said.
""Zanganeh thoroughly explained his strategy ... and got the leader's approval. Also it was agreed that political lobbying was important, especially with Mr. Putin, and again the Leader approved it,"" said the source.
On Wednesday, the Saudis agreed to cut production heavily, taking ""a big hit"" in the words of energy minister Khalid al-Falih - while Iran was allowed to slightly boost output.
Iran's Zanganeh kept a low profile during the meeting, OPEC delegates said. Zanganeh had already agreed the deal the night before, with Algeria helping mediate, and he was careful not to make a fuss about it. 
After the meeting, the usually combative Zanganeh avoided any comment that might be read as claiming victory over Riyadh.
""We were firm,"" he told state television. ""The call between Rouhani and Putin played a major role ... After the call, Russia backed the cut.""
IRAQ LAST-MINUTE HITCH
But OPEC would not be OPEC without a last-minute quarrel threatening to derail the deal. Iraq became a problem. 
As ministerial talks got underway, OPEC's second-largest producer insisted it could not afford to cut output, given the cost of its war against Islamic State.
But, facing pressure from the rest of OPEC to contribute a cut, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi picked up the phone in front of his peers to call his prime minister, Haider al-Abadi.

""Abadi said: 'Get the deal done'. And that was it,"" one OPEC source said.

U.S. crude oil was up $1.29 or 2.61% to $50.72 a barrel at 10.00 ET, a level not seen since October 25.
Global benchmark Brent futures were at $53.26 a barrel, climbing $1.45 or 2.82% to the highest since October 10.
Brent settled at $50.47 on Wednesday, up $4.09 or 8.8%, after hitting an intra-day high of $50.49. U.S. crude ended at $49.44, up $4.21 or 9.3%.
OPEC agreed on its first production cut since 2008 on Wednesday, aimed at reducing a global supply overhang that has seen prices more than halve since mid-2014.
The 14-member cartel is responsible for a third of global oil production, or 33.6 million barrels per day. The deal will see output cut by 1.2 million bpd from January 2017.
Saudi Arabia undertook the largest cut, slashing output by 486,000 bpd and dropping its demand that Iran cut its output, in a deal that was seen as a victory for Tehran.
The group said it would reassess the effectiveness of the deal after six months.
The agreement also included coordinated action with non-OPEC members, who are expected to decrease production by 600,000 barrels a day. 
On Thursday, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak said it will cut its oil output from November-December levels.
Novak said on Wednesday that Russia was prepared to reduce production by up to 300,000 bpd as a part of its agreement with OPEC.
But analysts said that the cuts are likely to cause other producers, especially U.S. shale drillers, to increase output.
Analysts are also doubtful over how the agreement will be enforced, as OPEC has no authority to make its members comply."
1586,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 01, 2016 09:26AM ET</span>",Oil extends surge after OPEC deal,"Investing.com - Oil Thursday extended gains of over 9% Wednesday when OPEC agreed to an output cut for the first time since 2008.U.S. crude was up 76 cents, or 1.54%, at $50.20 at 08:15 ET, while Brent crude added 1.76% to $52.75.OPEC agreed to cut output by 1.2 million barrels a day to 32.5 million barrels after Iran sealed a deal to hold its production at pre-sanctions levels.The cartel has invited non-OPEC producers to join the accord with cuts of around 600,000 barrels a day.Russia has indicated its willingness to assume about half of that burden.The future for oil prices now depends on compliance with the agreed cuts, which take affect from the start of next year.If producers toe the line on the curbs some observers see a potential move toward $60 a barrel.However, other players expect North American shale activity to pick up if U.S. crude hits $55 a barrel.That would offset the potential inroads the OPEC cut makes in the global supply glut.The number of rigs operating in the U.S. has increased of late as production costs fall"
1587,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2016 09:04AM ET</span>",Oil price rally likely short-lived as OPEC deal not enough to reduce glut,"(Reuters) - The oil price rally sparked by an OPEC-Russia deal to cut output is likely to be short-lived, say traders in Asia, because the agreement may only draw more supplies from storage tanks and more crude shipments from the United States. 
And even without increased supplies from elsewhere, if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia do reduce production by 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) as pledged, the cuts would not be deep enough to shrink a glut that began to build in mid-2014, traders said. 
""The cut by OPEC will be largely offset by increases in U.S. production where the rig count has already increased,"" said India Oil Corp's Director of Finance A K Sharma. 
""So surplus (oil) will stay in the market. If there is any impact, it will be short term."" 
Higher oil prices and lower production costs are encouraging U.S. shale operators to increase output, while Kazakhstan started production at the Kashagan field in October. [O/R] 
Traders said the extent of the impact of the output deal will also depend on how it affects exports from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members. 
Cuts in export supply from producers could come from changes in operational tolerance, a contractual clause that allows either the buyer or seller to increase or reduce volumes by up to 10 percent, trade sources said. 
The OPEC deal ""will provide some price momentum but it cannot be compared with the cut seen back in 2008,"" a Singapore-based trader said, referring to the last OPEC production cut at 4.2 million bpd. 
Production cuts early in the year are also a normal response to a low-demand season in February and March when Asian refiners typically shut for maintenance, he said.
Stronger prompt prices have also narrowed oil contango market structures, potentially prompting the release of oil from storage that could add to supplies, traders said. 
Oil is more expensive in future months in a contango market, encouraging traders to store the commodity, but supplies are backed out when spreads start to weaken. 
Strength in Middle East crude benchmark Dubai may also further narrow its price gap against Brent, leading Asia refiners to buy more oil from the Atlantic Basin and the Americas, traders said. 
IMPACT ON OIL DEMAND, MARGINS 
Asian refiners are more concerned about the impact of higher oil prices on demand and profitability rather than the OPEC supply cuts as most have other crude sources to turn to. 
China's independent refiners - also known as teapots - usually take more crude from South America and West Africa, for example. 
The OPEC cuts will come mostly from Saudi Arabia and its Middle Eastern allies United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, from whom teapots barely import, so the impact will be minimal, said Zhang Liucheng, vice president of Dongming Petrochemical Group, the country's largest independent refiner. 
As for any broad increase in oil prices, ""whether it would affect teapots' crude demand, we'll need to watch out for domestic demand for refined fuel, which has not been great as even gasoline demand is growing less fast,"" Zhang said. 
A spokesman at South Korea's second-largest refiner GS Caltex [GSCAL.UL] said: ""What's more important to us is the product crack spread rather than the rising crude oil price ... We have to watch how the OPEC decision will affect oil demand.""

Gold was trading at $1,169.65 a troy ounce by 10:19 GMT after falling as low as $1,163.5 earlier in the session, the lowest level since February 5.
The precious metal almost 8% in November, the largest monthly decline in three years on a rally in the dollar and Treasury yields and on expectations that the Federal Reserve is on course to hike interest rates this month.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was at 101.33, off Wednesday’s highs of 101.88 and below the almost 14-year high of 102.12 reached last Thursday.
Gold is priced in dollars and becomes less attractive to holders of other currencies when the dollar rises.
The dollar surged on Wednesday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached an agreement on an oil output cut aimed at reining in global oversupply and shoring up prices.
Expectations for higher oil prices added to U.S. inflation expectations, which have already been boosted by prospects for increased fiscal spending under the Trump administration.
Demand for the dollar was also boosted after upbeat U.S. economic reports lent further credence to the view that the Fed will raise rates in this month.
Investors were looking ahead to U.S. data on manufacturing later in the day and Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for November.
According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, 97.8% of traders expect the Fed to raise interest rates at its December meeting.
Higher rates typically support the dollar by making the currency more attractive to yield-seeking investors.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
Elsewhere in metals trading, silver futures were at $16.37 a troy ounce, while copper futures traded at $2.626 a pound.

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2016 04:59AM ET</span>","After OPEC deal, oil expected to rally - for the moment","By Devika Krishna Kumar and Jessica Resnick-Ault
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil's blistering rally of up to 10 percent to $50 a barrel on Wednesday should continue into next week, analysts and fund managers said, after the world's top producers announced a historic deal to rein in output. 
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached its first deal to cut oil output since 2008 - signaling its return to managing supply in world markets. 
The path ahead for the oil market, however, is expected to be volatile, as those who positioned for a rally unwind their trades to book profits. The possibility that OPEC will be unable to meet its commitment to cut production could also undermine prices as well. 
That makes the long-term path for oil more uncertain, as few expect the commodity to reach $60 a barrel soon.
""You're going to get a few days of fluctuations,"" Paul Mumford, fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management said.
""Nothing goes up in straight lines and people do like to take profits when big moves like this occur.""
Oil prices soared to their highest in over a month on the news of the deal, with global benchmark Brent crude futures (LCOc1) plowing through the $50 a barrel, clinching their biggest daily percentage gains since February. [O/R]
Speculators piled into crude oil options and futures in the days ahead of the OPEC meeting. Volumes in call options that allow the holder to buy January crude futures at $60 per barrel  soared to a record a day ahead of the meeting.
As these positions are unwound, oil prices could see some selling, market participants said. 
From a technical perspective, for Brent crude (LCOc1) to show a bullish trend, prices must rally above $53.70, while U.S. crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures (CLc1) would need to surpass $49.85, analysts said.
Brent ended Wednesday's session at $50.47, up $4.09 or 8.8 percent, after hitting an intraday high of $50.49. WTI settled at $49.44, up $4.21, or 9.3 percent with a session high of $49.90,
""I think prices will continue to rally and we could see it move up to that $51.20 and maybe even the $53.60 a barrel level,"" Dean Rogers, senior analyst at Kase & Co, said.
""The reality is if prices are above $50, people are going to turn wells back on, they're going to start drilling and so the market could, as reality sets back in over the next few weeks, settle back into that $10 range we've been in since summer."" 
U.S. shale producers are poised to benefit the most - if their production increases, it could offset OPEC's efforts.
""We anticipate oil prices will likely remain rangebound between $50 and $60 per barrel over the next few years,"" said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital, which has $15 billion in energy assets.
Brent's recent high in October was $53.70, and movement above that point would signal that a further rally is possible, said Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at forex.com.

WTI could rally to as much as $59 a barrel over the next few weeks after surpassing $49.85 a barrel, said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst at ICAP (LON:IAP). That $49.85 a barrel level represents the Fibonnaci 78.62 retracement of last decline from October to November, Zimmerman said. The market may first pull back, as traders adjust their positions, he said.

1593,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2016 02:40AM ET</span>","Net oil importer Indonesia leaves producer club OPEC, again","By Fergus Jensen and Wilda Asmarini
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has suspended its membership of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), less than a year after rejoining the cartel, as the net oil importer said it could not agree to the group's production cuts.
The decision came as the cartel agreed its first oil output cut since 2008 in a bid to tackle overcapacity and prop up prices.
The suspension could be a setback for Indonesia, OPEC's only East Asian member, which had hoped to benefit from being closer to OPEC countries when it reactivated its membership at the start of the year.
OPEC had proposed Indonesia cut oil production by about 37,000 barrels per day (bpd), or about 5 percent of its output, which would dent the already slipping oil rent in Southeast Asia's largest economy.
Indonesia's Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Ignasius Jonan, who attended the Vienna meeting, said the only reduction Indonesia could accept was a cut of 5,000 bpd, which had been approved in the country's 2017 budget.
""There are still big government revenue needs in the 2017 budget,"" Jonan said, adding that as a net oil importer a cut to production would not benefit Indonesia, particularly at a time when oil prices were expected to go up.
The temporary suspension was in the best interest of all OPEC members, the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry said in a statement.
It was not clear whether Indonesia was asked to suspend its membership or if it left voluntarily. Qatar, the current OPEC president, said on Wednesday that Indonesia had been suspended.
For Saudi Arabia - which took the lion's share of cuts - a key criteria for the deal was collective action by OPEC beyond those countries, Iran, Libya and Nigeria, which were given an exemption, said Jason Gammel of U.S. investment bank Jefferies.
    ""Indonesia was the only member to not participate and their OPEC membership was 'frozen'; otherwise the group demonstrated more cohesiveness than at any point since at least the 1.5 million barrels per day cut in 2008,"" he said.
Indonesia is seen as a somewhat odd member of OPEC and has had a patchy membership history.
After first joining in 1962, it left in 2009 as dwindling production meant it had become a net importer of crude oil, which is against OPEC's statute for full membership.
Since rejoining, Indonesia has made several deals on crude imports, overseas upstream investments and refining partnerships, including with OPEC bigwigs Iran and Saudi Arabia.
Indonesia's crude oil output peaked at around 1.7 million barrels per day in the mid-1990s. But with few significant oil discoveries in Western Indonesia in the past 10 years, production has fallen to roughly half that as old fields have matured and died.

The industry is a vital part of the Indonesian economy, but its contribution to state revenue has dropped from around 25 percent in 2006 to an expected 3.4 percent this year, according to data compiled by consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers(PwC).

Overnight, oil prices surged nearly 9%, climbing after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to slash production.
OPEC ministers said the production pact had been several months in the making. ""Over the past two months, this committee has done some excellent work. The meetings it has undertaken have been extremely constructive, providing us all with a better appreciation and understanding of the various viewpoints among OPEC and non-OPEC producers,"" said Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada, Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry and President of the OPEC Conference.
""The last time we met as a conference was in Algiers on September 28. This historic occasion, with OPEC Member Countries unified in approving the already mentioned ‘Algiers Accord’, saw an agreement on a new OPEC production target range. The focus was on accelerating the drawdown of the stock overhang and bringing the market rebalancing forward.
The energy minister said that the production cutting agreement will stabilize global oil prices. Oil prices have fluctuated at a rate during the last two months that makes OPEC leaders uncomfortable. ""It is vital that stock levels start to fall, as the decision taken in Algiers recognized. As we have seen in previous cycles, once this overhang starts falling on a regular basis then prices start to rise and more stability will return to the market,"" Bin Saleh commented.
Oil production ""remains a growth business,"" he added, ""with oil demand in OPEC’s 2016 World Oil Outlook reaching over 109 million barrels of oil a day by 2040, a healthy increase of over 16 million barrels a day.""
This growth will require ""significant investments in the upstream, midstream and downstream,"" he concluded. ""Overall, estimated oil-related investment requirements are close to $10 trillion in the period to 2040.""
Investors in the U.S. speculated that the oil production slowdown overseas could be good for business in the U.S. Under incoming President Donald Trump, oil exploration is expected to be allowed off the coast of Virginia and off the coast of Florida. Artic and Antarctic exploration, banned by current President Obama, could also be allowed by the Trump White House, and expanded U.S. production is something advocated by former Gov.

VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC has agreed its first oil output cuts since 2008 after Saudi Arabia accepted ""a big hit"" on its production and dropped its demand on arch-rival Iran to slash output, pushing up crude prices by around 10 percent.
Fast-growing producer Iraq also agreed to curtail its booming output, while non-OPEC Russia will join output cuts for the first time in 15 years to help the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries prop up oil prices.
""OPEC has proved to the skeptics that it is not dead. The move will speed up market rebalancing and erosion of the global oil glut,"" said OPEC watcher Amrita Sen from consultancy Energy Aspects.
The cut did not come without a casualty, however. Indonesia, the producer group's only East Asian member, said it would suspend its membership after rejoining only this year as it was not willing to comply with the output cuts sought.
Following news of the deal, the price for Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, surged to settle up nearly 9 percent. They eased slightly in early Asian trading on concerns that other producers, especially U.S. shale drillers, could fill any gap.
The agreement came despite huge political hurdles. Iran and Russia are effectively fighting two proxy wars against Saudi Arabia, in Yemen and Syria, and many skeptics had said the countries would struggle to find a compromise.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said ahead of the meeting that the kingdom was prepared to accept ""a big hit"" on production to get a deal done.
""I think it is a good day for the oil markets, it is a good day for the industry and ... it should be a good day for the global economy. I think it will be a boost to global economic growth,"" he told reporters after the decision.
SOME CAUTION ON CUTS
Some observers were more cautious.
""This is an agreement to cap production levels, not export levels,"" British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said in a note. ""The outcome is consistent with ... what OPEC production levels were expected to be in 2017, irrespective of the deal reached.""
Despite Wednesday's price surge, oil prices are still only at levels last seen in September and October, when plans for a cut were first announced, and are at less than half their levels of mid-2014, when the glut started.
OPEC produces a third of global oil, or around 33.6 million barrels per day, and under the Wednesday deal it would reduce output by around 1.2 million bpd from January 2017.
That would take its output to January 2016 levels, when prices fell to over 10 year lows.
Saudi Arabia will take the lion's share of cuts by reducing output by almost 0.5 million bpd to 10.06 million bpd. Its Gulf OPEC allies - the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar - would cut by a total 0.3 million bpd.
Iraq, which had insisted on higher output quotas to fund its fight against Islamic State militants, unexpectedly agreed to reduce production - by 0.2 million bpd.
Iran was allowed to boost production slightly from its October level - a victory for Tehran, which has long argued it needs to regain market share lost under Western sanctions.
WILL OPEC COMPLY?
Falih had long insisted OPEC would limit output only if non-OPEC producers contributed.
OPEC president Qatar said non-OPEC producers had agreed to reduce output by a further 0.6 million bpd, of which Russia would contribute some 0.3 million.
Russia had previously resisted participating and instead pushed production to new records in recent months.
""Russia will gradually cut output in the first half of 2017 by up to 300,000 barrels per day, on a tight schedule as technical capabilities allow,"" Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said from Moscow.
Novak, who spoke an hour after OPEC announced its deal, did not say from which output levels Russia would cut.
Non-OPEC Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have said they might also cut.
""With the deal agreed to in principle and country level quotas established, focus will now shift to implementation,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note to clients.
OPEC will hold talks with non-OPEC producers on Dec. 9. The organization will also have its next meeting on May 25 to monitor the deal and could extend it for six months, Qatar said.
INDONESIA SUSPENDS MEMBERSHIP
Indonesia, the cartel's only Asian member, said it would suspend its membership as it wasn't willing to cut its production as agreed by OPEC.
""The meeting... requested for Indonesia to cut around 5 percent of its production or around 37,000 barrels per day... As a net oil importing country, a cut to production capacity would not benefit Indonesia,"" the country's Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry said in a statement.
Indonesia has a patchy OPEC membership history. After first joining in 1962, it left in 2009 as dwindling production meant that Southeast Asia's most populous country had become a net importer of crude oil, which is against OPEC's statute for full membership.

Despite this, it re-joined OPEC in early 2016. Indonesia's suspension will not affect OPEC's overall reduction as its share of cuts will be redistributed among other members.

CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - More than 2,000 U.S. military veterans plan to form a human shield to protect protesters of a pipeline project near a Native American reservation in North Dakota, organizers said, just ahead of a federal deadline for activists to leave the camp they have been occupying.
It comes as North Dakota law enforcement backed away from a previous plan to cut off supplies to the camp – an idea quickly abandoned after an outcry and with law enforcement’s treatment of Dakota Access Pipeline protesters increasingly under the microscope.
The protesters have spent months rallying against plans to route the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, saying it poses a threat to water resources and sacred Native American sites.
Protesters include various Native American tribes as well as environmentalists and even actors including Shailene Woodley.
State officials issued an order on Monday for activists to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp, located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, citing harsh weather conditions. 
The state's latest decision not to stop cars entering the protest site indicated local officials will not actively enforce Monday's emergency order to evacuate the camp issued by Governor Jack Dalrymple.
Dalrymple warned on Wednesday that it was ""probably not feasible"" to reroute the pipeline, but said he had requested a meeting with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Council to rebuild a relationship. 
""We need to begin now to talk about how we are going to return to a peaceful relationship,” he said on a conference call.
The 1,172-mile (1,885 km) pipeline project, owned by Texas-based  Energy Transfer Partners LP  (N:ETP), is mostly complete, except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. 
Veterans Stand for Standing Rock, a contingent of more than 2,000 U.S. military veterans, intends to go to North Dakota by this weekend and form a human wall in front of police, protest organizers said on a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. Organizers could not immediately be reached for comment. 
""I figured this was more important than anything else I could be doing,” Guy Dull Knife, 69, a Vietnam War Army veteran, told Reuters at the main camp.
Dull Knife, a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe from the Pine Ridge Reservation of South Dakota, said he has been camping at the protest site for months.
Morton County Sheriff's Office spokesman Rob Keller said in an email his agency was aware of the veterans' plans, but would not comment further on how law enforcement will deal with demonstrators.
Former U.S. Marine Michael A. Wood Jr is leading the effort along with Wesley Clark Jr, a writer whose father is retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark.
U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat from Hawaii and a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, has said on Twitter she will join the protesters on Sunday. 
The Army Corps, citing safety concerns, has ordered the evacuation of the primary protest camp by Dec. 5, but said it would not forcibly remove people from the land.
Local law enforcement said on Tuesday they planned a blockade of the camp, but local and state officials later retreated, saying they would only check vehicles for certain prohibited supplies like propane, and possibly issue fines. 
Dalrymple on Wednesday said state officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters and there had been no plans to block food or other supplies from the camp. ""That would be a huge mistake from a humanitarian standpoint,"" he said on the conference call.
He also warned protesters that while emergency responders will try to reach anyone in need, that would be contingent on weather conditions.

Protesters, who refer to themselves as “water protectors,” have been gearing up for the winter while they await the Army Corps decision on whether to allow Energy Transfer Partners to tunnel under the river. That decision has been delayed twice by the Army Corps.

The price of Brent Oil and West Texas Crude Oil both increased on Wednesday, with U.S. crude futures settling at 49.98 and Brent futures settling at 50.45.
OPEC ministers said the production pact had been several months in the making. ""Over the past two months, this committee has done some excellent work. The meetings it has undertaken have been extremely constructive, providing us all with a better appreciation and understanding of the various viewpoints among OPEC and non-OPEC producers,"" said Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada, Qatar's Minister of Energy and Industry and President of the OPEC Conference, in remarks earlier today. ""The last time we met as a conference was in Algiers on September 28. This historic occasion, with OPEC Member Countries unified in approving the already mentioned ‘Algiers Accord’, saw an agreement on a new OPEC production target range. The focus was on accelerating the drawdown of the stock overhang and bringing the market rebalancing forward.
The energy minister said that the production cutting agreement will stabilize global oil prices. Oil prices have fluctuated at a rate during the last two months that makes OPEC leaders uncomfortable. ""It is vital that stock levels start to fall, as the decision taken in Algiers recognized. As we have seen in previous cycles, once this overhang starts falling on a regular basis then prices start to rise and more stability will return to the market,"" Bin Saleh commented.
Oil production ""remains a growth business,"" he added, ""with oil demand in OPEC’s 2016 World Oil Outlook reaching over 109 million barrels of oil a day by 2040, a healthy increase of over 16 million barrels a day.""
This growth will require ""significant investments in the upstream, midstream and downstream,"" he concluded. ""Overall, estimated oil-related investment requirements are close to $10 trillion in the period to 2040.""
Investors in the U.S. speculated that the oil production slowdown overseas could be good for business in the U.S. Under incoming President Donald Trump, oil exploration is expected to be allowed off the coast of Virginia and off the coast of Florida. Artic and Antarctic exploration, banned by current President Obama, could also be allowed by the Trump White House, and expanded U.S. production is something advocated by former Gov. Rick Perry (R-Texas), who is being touted for Energy Secretary. Oil field equipment stocks from Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) and others could also benefit from the trend, analysts said."

The price for the commodity was down on intraday trading by 1.1% at $1,175.40 an ounce on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.The price ended the day at 1174.80, or 1.34% down. That was a change of 16.00.
Investors reckon the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at a meeting next month, and the odds of a rate increase is now at 94%, according to Fed fund futures tracked by the CME. Since gold doesn't bear interest, it works hard to compete when interest rates climb. Thus, the price of gold is expected to remain weak in the coming month.
What is more, investors are also looking ahead to the Italian referendum this weekend, when the country will head to the polls to vote on a Constitutional reform. A “no” vote could be a sign of further political uncertainty and increase prices.
Meanwhile, gold demand in India, one of the globe's biggest buyers of the metal, is declining, with gold traders saying imports could fall to just a combined 60-70 tons over the next two months, noted Commmerzbank AG in a note to investors."

1601,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 30, 2016 12:27PM ET</span>",OPEC members reach deal to cap oil output at 32.5 million bpd,"Investing.com - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries reached an agreement on a deal to curb oil output following crunch talks in Vienna on Wednesday.
OPEC agreed to cap output at 32.5 million barrels per day, a cut of 1.2 million barrels a day.
In September, the producer cartel reached a preliminary agreement to cut production to between 32.5 million and 33 million barrels per day from current levels of 33.6 million barrels per day.
But rubber stamping a deal on the first OPEC supply cut since 2008 proved problematic during weeks of often strained negotiations, amid disagreements over which producers should cut and by how much.
The output deal will come into effect on January 1, 2017. The accord will last for six months, but can be extended and a decision will be made on May 25, 2017 when it is planned to review the agreement.
The 14-member cartel, which is responsible for a third of global oil production, is reining in output in a bid to reduce a global supply glut that has seen prices more than halve since mid-2014.
Confidence in non-OPEC participation in output reduction
The organization said the agreement was subject to Russia and other non-OPEC countries contributing a cut of another 0.6 million barrels per day.
In the press conference, OPEC president Mohammed bin Saleh al Sada said Russia has indicated that it will cut output by 300,000 barrels per day and that he was confident that the 600,000 total would be reached based on previous pledges by non-OPEC members.
Al Sada indicated that a meeting was scheduled in Doha for December 9 with non-OPEC producers to get the finalized rubber stamps, explaining that as those members did not belong to the cartel, OPEC could not personally make the agreement official. He insisted that he was confident of their agreement with the deal.
Member-agreed quota cuts
In response to a question, Al Sada further confirmed that Saudi Arabia had undertaken the largest cut, specifically 486,000 barrels per day.
According to the table showing the agreed cuts, that left Saudi Arabia's daily production at 10.058 million barrels per day (mpbd).
Furthermore it was agreed to Iran allow production to increase by 90,000 barrels to pre-sanction levels of 3.797 million barrels per day in a deal that was seen as a victory for Tehran.
Libya and Nigeria were also exempted from output cuts as their production has been hit by sanctions and attacks on oil installations.
In the second largest reduction in output, Iraq agreed to cut production by 210,000 barrels per day.
It was followed by the United Arab Emirates’ 139,000 barrel per day cut.
Among the rest of the members in decreasing order, Kuwait agreed on a 131,000 barrel reduction, Venezuela on 95,000, Angola by 87,000, Algeria by 50,000, Qatar by 30,000, Ecuador by 26,000, and Gabon by 9,000.
Of note, Indonesia voluntarily suspended its membership in the cartel. Al Sada explained that the country was a net exporter and that the other members had taken on the task of cutting to reach the 32.5 million target.
As of 12:15PM ET (17:15GMT), U.S. crude oil was trading at $49.07 a barrel following the announcement, up $3.83 or 8.47% from its last close, near the intraday high of $49.33.

(Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell unexpectedly last week, while distillate inventories rose sharply, the Energy Information Administration's data showed on Wednesday.
Crude inventories  fell 884,000 barrels in the week to Nov. 25, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 636,000 barrels. 
That came despite a notable increase in stocks at the key Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures, where inventories  rose by 2.4 million barrels, EIA said. 
Crude stocks fell sharply on the U.S. East Coast - the biggest weekly draw since May 2004 - to 14 million barrels, their lowest level since July 2015. 
""Crude inventories have yielded a modest surprise draw in this week's report, led by a big drop in crude inventories on the East coast amid lower imports - even though refinery runs also dropped off,"" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. 
U.S. crude imports  fell last week by 35,000 barrels per day while refinery crude runs  slipped by 114,000 bpd as utilization rates  fell by 1 percentage point, EIA data showed. 
Oil prices were barely changed, as the weekly data was overshadowed by OPEC's decision to limit oil output for the first time in eight years. 
U.S. crude oil futures (CLc1) were already sharply higher on the day, and last traded up $3.30 a barrel to $48.53 a barrel, a 7.2 percent increase. Brent crude (LCOc1) rose 7.9 percent, or $3.64 a barrel, to $50.02 a barrel. 
""The report is fairly neutral; mildly bullish crude, modestly bearish for the products,"" Smith said. 
Distillate stockpiles , which include diesel and heating oil, rose 5 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.3 million-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. Heating oil usage is anticipated to pick up in the next few months as winter sets in across the United States.
Gasoline stocks  rose 2.1 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.2 million-barrel gain.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly report that crude oil inventories dropped by 0.844 million barrels last week. Market analysts' expected a crude-stock increase of 0.636 million barrels, while the American Petroleum Institute late Wednesday reported a supply draw of 0.717 million barrels.
Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the key delivery point for Nymex crude, jumped by 2.419 million barrels last week, the EIA said. Total U.S. crude oil inventories stood at 481.0 million barrels as of last week, according to press release, which the EIA considered to be “near the upper limit of the average range for this time of year”.
The report also showed that gasoline inventories rose by 2.097 million barrels, compared to expectations for a build of 1.156 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles increased by 4.957 million barrels, compared to forecasts for an increase of 1.336 million.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2016 09:00AM ET</span>",Shell studies green energy deals to prepare for future after oil,"By Karolin Schaps and Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), the world's second-biggest publicly listed oil company, is studying acquisitions in the green energy sector, its CEO told Reuters, as it bows to shareholder demands for a strategy beyond fossil fuels.
Shell, which has a market value of $200 billion, produces two percent of the world's oil and gas but rapid technological change coupled with policies to protect the climate have kick-started a shift in energy markets that has put enormous pressure on oil companies to plan for a time after fossil fuels.
""The idea that you can just be a very clever observer and step in when the moment is right, forget about it,"" Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden told Reuters.
""I am convinced that in this space we will play an active role, a leading role and we will plan acquisitions in it.""
Major investors, including Dutch pension fund PGGM, have criticised Shell's climate change policies in the past, saying the company should do more to mitigate climate change risks.
""We don't just want them to pay lip service and do it because the industry is under pressure,"" said Rohan Murphy, co-manager of Allianz' Global Energy Fund, a Shell shareholder.
""Shell do seem to be taking the issue of a less hydrocarbon dependent world seriously and are looking at it properly rather than just talking about becoming greener,"" Murphy said. 
Shell owns about 500 megawatts (MW) of onshore wind power capacity in the United States and has a growing biofuels business in Brazil which produces ethanol from sugar that is mixed with petrol and diesel to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It also recently bid to build an offshore wind farm in the Netherlands in a consortium with two other Dutch companies.
""Of course we do believe in renewables but probably more in building the utilities and integrating them into our existing operations,"" van Beurden said.
That is where Shell's strategy appears to diverge from French oil company Total, which is often referred to as one of the most progressive oil company when it comes to moving away from fossil fuels.
Earlier this year, Total splashed out $1.1 billion to buy Saft, which makes batteries to store solar energy, and bought a stake in AutoGrid, a startup that has developed a platform to optimize the use of home energy appliances.
Total is also majority shareholder in SunPower, a manufacturer of highly efficient solar panels.
While Total is focusing on investment in green energy technologies, van Beurden hinted that Shell would become an electricity and gas provider, through the integration of utilities. He said there may be value in delivering a service, rather than being the owner of a technology.

In Britain, so-called demand aggregation is already a profitable business model. Aggregators secure commitments from businesses to cut their energy consumption and in return earn a fee from the network operator.

At 7:52 AM ET (12:52GMT), oil was spiking around 7% on Wednesday after various OPEC officials gave an optimistic outlook for an agreement to be reached to cut overall production.
Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said Wednesday that his country was prepared to accept ""a big hit"" on its own production and agree to Iran freezing output at pre-sanctions levels.
Falih noted that discussions were focused on reducing production to the lower range of the September Algiers accord at 32.5 million barrels per day, implying a cut of more than one million barrels, and added that his hopes were for Russian and other non-OPEC countries to reduce by around 600,000 barrels. 
Reports are putting the total cut in production at around 1.4 million barrels and suggesting that the non-OPEC portion of the reduction may be discussed at a gathering of major oil producers on December 8-9. 
Not a done deal
However, the deal has yet to be set in stone with an OPEC communiqué and press conference tentatively scheduled for 10:00AM ET (15:00GMT).
Even Falih himself left room for maneuvering as he stated that the “big hit” that Saudi Arabia would take to production was dependent on making sure that “there is consensus and an agreement to meet all of the principles.""
He repeated earlier remarks that non-OPEC production increases had reversed course and felt that most of the growth in OPEC producer output was in the past. 
“If we can’t come to an agreement, then the other scenario of rolling over and waiting for the market to recover on its own is not a bad outcome,"" Falih explained. 
If current reports coincide with Wednesday’s eventual outcome, it would be most similar to what  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) had identified on Tuesday as a “shock and awe” outcome.
“A surprisingly large cut and non-OPEC cooperation could potentially put the market back in balance in early 2017 and send prices into a new trading range,” these experts said in the prior day’s report, signaling it as an unlikely outcome.
Most analysts had indicated that their base call was a headline agreement to announce a max quota for the entire group in order to buy more time and support prices, even without a concrete plan for execution. 
Apparently largely missed by markets in the buying euphoria on Wednesday, Reuters quoted Russian energy sources that said the requested 400,000 barrel cut for Moscow might be a “bit excessive”. 
The OPEC request for major oil producers to participate in the agreement may well be put on the backburner until the beginning of December.
Venezuelan energy minister Eugenio del Pino told reporters that they were planning a meeting between the cartel and non-OPEC members including Russia for December 8-9, according to news agency EFE. 
The participation could be a key part of the “wait and see stance” as Energy Intelligence Group reported that “an OPEC deal will not be implemented without a non-OPEC cut”. 
Meanwhile, sources told Reuters that as the meeting progressed on Wednesday, OPEC members were still discussing Iraq and that the debate on output cuts was ongoing.
Energy Intelligence Group advised market participants not to rule out a “no deal” as “the meeting is not over.”
With regard to the pending OPEC decision, analysts from Macquarie warned that a “no deal” could send oil prices crashing from current levels. 
“We believe a failed effort will force prices below $40 and perhaps event to the low 30s for a short period of time,” they warned. 
At 7:55AM ET (12:55GMT), U.S. crude futures soared 6.68% to $48.25, while Brent oil jumped 6.70% to $50.49."

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped more than 8 percent on Wednesday to a five-week high as some of the world's largest oil producers gathered in Vienna to try to agree a production cut that could be bigger than expected.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) for delivery in January were up $3.83, or 8.3 percent, at $50.21 a barrel by 1236 GMT (7:36 a.m. ET), recovering from a drop of nearly 4 percent on Tuesday and on course for their biggest one-day move in nine months. Brent crude for delivery in February was up $3.76 at $51.08 a barrel.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were $3.63 higher at $48.86 a barrel, a one-week high.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries started a meeting at 0900 GMT on Wednesday at its Vienna headquarters to discuss terms of a potential deal to cut production in an effort to prop up prices that have fallen by more than half since 2014 due to oversupply.
A source told Reuters that delegates were now discussing a bigger than expected cut in production of 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd).
A preliminary agreement struck in Algiers in September set an output cap at around 32.5-33 million barrels per day compared with the current 33.64 million bpd.
""It does rather look as though OPEC is going to come to an agreement,"" said Colin Smith, director of oil and gas research at Panmure Gordon in London.
Heading into the meeting, Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said the market's fundamentals were moving in the right direction, but he believed the group was ""getting close to a deal"".
""The extent of the (price) move shows no one wants to miss the boat. There must be a general consensus that there will be a cut, whether it's going to be bullish, I don't know, but it's the domino effect,"" PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga said.
An Iraqi delegate said on Wednesday that some form of agreement would be reached and Iran's oil minister also said he was optimistic.
Traders said markets were jittery and prices could swing sharply in either direction depending on developments in Vienna.
Oil fell by nearly 4 percent on Tuesday on reports of disputes between Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq over details of the planned production cut.
Iran and Iraq have been resisting pressure from Saudi Arabia to curtail production, making it harder for the group to reach an agreement on output cuts.

Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), and ANZ said oil prices would quickly fall to the low $40s a barrel if OPEC fails to strike a deal to cut output.

Gold was trading at $1,187.65 a troy ounce by 10:00 GMT.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was up 0.13% at 101.11, holding below the almost 14-year highs of 102.07 reached last Thursday.
Gold is priced in dollars and becomes less attractive to holders of other currencies when the dollar rises.
Demand for the dollar continued to be underpinned after solid U.S. economic reports on Tuesday fed into expectations for a December rate hike by the Federal Reserve.
U.S. third quarter growth was revised up to 3.2%, its strongest rate in two years, according to the Commerce Department.
Separately, the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index rebounded sharply in November after declining in October.
The reports come ahead of key reports later this week on manufacturing and jobs growth.
Also Tuesday, Fed Governor Jerome Powell said the case for raising interest rates has strengthened since the central bank’s meeting earlier this month, lending further credence to the view that the Fed will raise rates next month.
According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, 100% of traders expect the Fed to raise interest rates at its policy meeting in December.
Higher rates typically support the dollar by making the currency more attractive to yield-seeking investors.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
Prices of the yellow metal have fallen around 6.5% so far this month, putting it on course for its biggest monthly decline since June 2013.
Gold has been hard hit by expectations that increased U.S. fiscal spending under a Trump administration will spur economic growth and inflation, which would ultimately lead to an era of higher interest rates.
Elsewhere in metals trading, silver futures were at $16.76 a troy ounce, while copper futures traded at $2.608 a pound.
Copper prices have climbed around 18% this month on hopes that infrastructure plans in top consumers China and the U.S. will bolster demand for the industrial metal.
Palladium rose to $770.67, a level not seen since June 2015. The industrial metal has risen over 24% this month, its best monthly performance since February 2008.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2016 01:40AM ET</span>",Leaner and meaner: U.S. shale greater threat to OPEC after oil price war,"By Catherine Ngai and Ernest Scheyder
NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - In a corner of the prolific Bakken shale play in North Dakota, oil companies can now pump crude at a price almost as low as that enjoyed by OPEC giants Iran and Iraq. 
Until a few years ago it was unprofitable to produce oil from shale in the United States. The steep slide in costs could encourage more U.S. shale output if OPEC members cut supplies, undermining the producer group's ability to boost prices. OPEC ministers meet Wednesday to weigh output cuts to end a two-year glut that has pressured global oil prices. 
In shale fields from Texas to North Dakota, production costs have roughly halved since 2014, when Saudi Arabia signaled an output free-for-all in an attempt to drive higher-cost shale producers out of the market. 
Rather than killing the U.S. shale industry, the ensuing two-year price war made shale a stronger rival, even in the current low-price environment. 
In Dunn County, North Dakota, there are around 2,000 square miles where the cost to produce Bakken shale is $15 a barrel and falling, according to Lynn Helms, head of the state's Department of Mineral Resources.
""The success in Dunn County has been fantastic,"" said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council.
Dunn County's cost is about the same as Iran's, and a little higher than Iraq's. Dunn County produces about 200,000 barrels of oil a day, about a fifth of daily production in the state.
It is North Dakota's sweet spot because it boasts the lowest costs in the state, yet improved technology and drilling techniques have boosted efficiency for the whole state and the entire U.S. oil industry.
The breakeven cost per barrel, on average, to produce Bakken shale at the wellhead has fallen to $29.44 in 2016 from $59.03 in 2014, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. It added that in terms of wellhead prices, Bakken is the most competitive of major U.S. shale plays.
Wood Mackenzie said technology advances should further reduce breakeven points. 
Landlocked Bakken producers still need a substantially higher international price than their breakeven cost to make a profit, since they pay more to transport crude to market than producers in most other U.S. regions. 
International oil prices of $45 a barrel are enough for some Bakken producers to profit, Ness said, and $55 would encourage production growth.
Benchmark Brent prices plummeted from nearly $116 a barrel in mid-2014 to just $27 earlier this year. Prices have since recovered to nearly $46. That is still too low for members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose state budgets depend on petrodollar revenues that plummeted during the price war.
For OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna on Wednesday, a major concern is that an output cut would encourage a quick response from U.S. shale producers, who have slashed costs and have been steadily adding drilling rigs.
""Right now, OPEC understands we're in a push-and-pull experiment with the United States,"" said Michael Tran, director of energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
""Two years ago, we thought prices hovering around $50 to $60 meant that non-OPEC production growth would end. But U.S. production came back stronger.""
In a recent earnings call,  Hess Corp  (NYSE:HES) said it has improved its cost performance in the Bakken, with well costs falling and initial production rates rising, though it did not give more details.
""Everybody is drilling wells faster and completing them better,"" said Mike Breard, an energy stock analyst at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. ""It's not just a Bakken phenomenon.""
Breard said he prefers shale stocks in the Permian basin in Texas, where he is expecting more big gains in production next year. He is eyeing firms such as Parsley Energy Inc, Ring Energy Inc and Matador Resources Co. 
Oil companies are already investing big money to benefit from shale's resurgence.  Tesoro  Corp (NYSE:TSO) recently snapped up Western Refining Inc in a $4 billion deal to bulk up its exposure in Texas.
Separately, trading firm Castleton Commodities International LLC bought more than $1 billion in assets from Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) to increase its stake in East Texas.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) Corp's top executive recently said that company has enjoyed steady improvement in well productivity and lower drilling and completion costs in the Permian Basin.

""Simply put, we can deliver more production with fewer wells,"" Vicki Hollub, the company's president and chief executive, told analysts on a recent call.

CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - North Dakota officials on Tuesday moved to block supplies from reaching oil pipeline protesters at a camp near the construction site, threatening to use hefty fines to keep demonstrators from receiving food, building materials and even portable bathrooms. 
Activists have spent months protesting plans to route the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, saying the project poses a threat to water resources and sacred Native American sites. 
State officials said on Tuesday they would fine anyone bringing prohibited items into the main protest camp following Governor Jack Dalrymple's ""emergency evacuation"" order on Monday. Earlier, officials had warned of a physical blockade, but the governor's office backed away from that.
Law enforcement would take a more ""passive role"" than enforcing a blockade, said Maxine Herr, a spokeswoman for the Morton County Sheriff's Department. 
""The governor is more interested in public safety than setting up a road block and turning people away,"" Herr said by telephone. 
Officers will stop vehicles they believe are headed to the camp and inform drivers they are committing an infraction and could be fined $1,000. 
These penalties should serve as a hindrance, according to Cecily Fong, a spokeswoman for the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services.
""So that effectively is going to block that stuff (supplies), but there is not going to be a hard road block,"" Fong said by telephone.
A spokeswoman from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe was not immediately available for comment.
North Dakota Governor-elect Doug Burgum, a Republican, declined to comment. 
The 1,172-mile (1,885 km) pipeline project, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, is mostly complete except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River.
Thousands of people are protesting at camps located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land, north of the Cannonball River in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. The main protest camp near Cannon Ball is called Oceti Sakowin, the original name of the Sioux, meaning Seven Council Fires.
Protest leaders said state officials and local law enforcement officers were ""bullying"" demonstrators with the threat of fines. 
""It's bogus and I don't know about the legality of it,"" said Kandi Mossett, an organizer with Indigenous Environmental Network. ""We're not afraid. We're moving in and out of the camp at will. So people shouldn't be afraid of coming and supporting the water protectors. They've been bullying us since day one.""
'HARSH WINTER CONDITIONS'
Dalrymple's evacuation order was issued on Monday due to the ""harsh winter conditions."" Snow and wind gusts up to 45 mph (73 kph) were forecast for Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. 
Despite the sub-freezing temperatures, law enforcement on Nov. 21 used water cannons to disperse protesters who had blockaded a highway. 
Demonstrators and law enforcement have clashed over the months since protests began, with demonstrators claiming excessive use of force by law enforcement.
On Tuesday, the National Lawyers Guild filed a class action in U.S. District Court in North Dakota on behalf of injured protesters, claiming local authorities in Morton and Stutsman counties used excessive force. 
The civil rights complaint said there were no orders to disperse or warnings issued before local police turned water cannons and tear gas on the protest. The lawsuit seeks compensatory damages. 
Stutsman County Auditor Casey Bradley said the county sheriff’s office was unaware of the lawsuit and unable to comment on the allegations. 
Officers were justified in using water cannons because of the threat posed by demonstrators, Fong and Herr said. Law enforcement gave numerous warnings for protesters to disperse, they said. 
North Dakota officials have issued several requests for additional help from federal law enforcement in light of the demonstrators. However, the Army Corps said Monday its order to evacuate the primary protest camp by Dec. 5 would not include forcibly removing people from the land.
The Obama administration in September postponed final approval of a Army Corps' permit required to allow tunneling beneath the lake, a move intended to give federal officials more time to consult tribal leaders. 
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a Tuesday news briefing that Obama believes law enforcement has ""an obligation"" to show restraint and protesters have a ""responsibility"" to protest peacefully.

In a related protest, prosecutors suspended charges against Deia Schlosberg, a documentary maker arrested while filming as environmental protesters attempted to shut down the flow of oil through pipelines carrying crude from Canada to the United States in October.

RAS AL-KHAIR, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's King Salman underlined the kingdom's intention to invest heavily in speeding up is diversification away from oil exports with the inauguration on Tuesday of a $35 billion mining and minerals processing complex.
Riyadh has tried to reduce the economy's reliance on oil for decades, but the challenge has become particularly urgent in the past couple of years as low prices have pushed state finances deep into deficit and growth has slowed sharply.
King Salman and his top ministers visited the complex at Ras al-Khair on Saudi Arabia's eastern coast, where energy minister Khalid al-Falih said the government would invest in all available resources to develop strategic industries.
The vast complex showcases the government's ability to use its oil wealth to push big industrial projects, but also shows how dependent the economy remains on state spending in the absence of a dynamic private sector. Most of the $35 billion invested so far was arranged by the government.
Projects include a $5.6 billion phosphate complex which produces fertilizer and chemicals and is operated by Saudi Arabian Mining Co (Ma'aden) (SE:1211) in partnership with petrochemical giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) (SE:2010); both companies are majority state-owned.
A $10.8 billion aluminum facility is operated by Ma’aden and U.S. firm  Alcoa  (N:AA), while the complex also features a 1,400 kilometer (875 mile) railway link, a port, and desalination and power plants.
Economic reform plans announced earlier this year aim to expand the mining sector's contribution to gross domestic product to 240 billion riyals ($64 billion) by 2030 from 64 billion riyals at present.
""Jubail was where the Saudi petrochemicals industry started with SABIC - Ras al-Khair is becoming just that for the mining industry,"" said Fadl al-Bouainain, a prominent Saudi economist.
With its spending constrained by low oil prices, however, the government concedes it will have to rely more in future on private sector investment by local and foreign firms, and it has not yet fully made clear how it hopes to attract that money.
""The key question Saudi Arabia will need to answer is how quickly they want to develop the mining sector, how much they want foreign investors to participate, and the risks and rewards they would offer to investors and retain for the government,"" said Paul Robinson, director at mining consultancy CRU Group.
One of the next big projects planned for Ras al-Khair is the construction of a huge ship repair and shipbuilding complex costing over 20 billion riyals; construction is to start in 2018 and commercial operations in 2022.
State oil giant Saudi Aramco  is leading the project, which is to provide engineering, manufacturing and repair services for offshore rigs and commercial vessels - work that until now has largely been done outside the kingdom.

The project may face heavy competition from existing shipbuilding centers in South Korea and elsewhere, but Aramco estimates that it will create 80,000 jobs directly and indirectly while allowing Saudi Arabia to reduce its imports by $12 billion annually.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran and Iraq are resisting pressure from Saudi Arabia to curtail oil production, making it hard for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to reach a deal to limit output and boost the price of crude when it meets on Wednesday.
OPEC sources told Reuters a meeting of experts in Vienna on Monday failed to bridge differences between OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, and the group's second- and third-largest producers over the mechanics of output cuts.
On Tuesday, tensions rose further after Iran wrote to OPEC saying it wanted Saudi Arabia to cut production by as much as 1 million barrels per day (bpd), much more than Riyadh is willing to offer, OPEC sources who saw the letter told Reuters.
""It is a response to Saudi telling Iran what to produce,"" one of the sources said.
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told reporters upon arrival in Vienna that he was not prepared to reduce output: ""We will leave the level of production (where) we decided in Algeria.""
OPEC, which accounts for a third of global oil production, made a preliminary agreement in Algiers in September to cap output at around 32.5-33 million bpd versus the current 33.64 million bpd to prop up oil prices, which have halved since mid-2014.
OPEC said it would exempt Iran, Libya and Nigeria from cuts as their output has been crimped by unrest and sanctions.
The deal was seen as a victory for Iran. Tehran has long argued it wants to raise production to regain market share lost under Western sanctions, when its political arch-rival Saudi Arabia increased output.
In recent weeks, Riyadh changed its stance and offered to cut its output by 0.5 million bpd, according to OPEC sources, while suggesting Iran limit production at around 3.8 million bpd - in line with or slightly above the country's current output. 
Tehran has sent mixed signals, saying it wanted to produce as much as 4.2 million bpd. Iran's letter to OPEC suggested Saudi Arabia should cut output to 9.5 million bpd.
Iraq has also been pressing for higher output limits, saying it needs more money to fight the militant group Islamic State. Iran and Iraq together produce over 8 million bpd, only slightly behind long-time leader Saudi with 10.5 million bpd.
The argument between Iraq and Saudi Arabia mainly focuses on whether Baghdad should use its own output estimates to limit production or rely on lower figures from OPEC's experts.
As tensions within OPEC mounted, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at the weekend that oil markets would rebalance even without an output-limiting pact. He had previously said Riyadh was keen for a deal.
One of Saudi Arabia's main allies, UAE Energy Minister Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui, said on Tuesday the market would indeed rebalance itself within six months although an output deal would help speed the process.
Falih was not expected to land in Vienna before Tuesday evening, leaving little time for traditional pre-meeting discussions with other ministers.
""The feeling today is mixed,"" Indonesian Energy Minister Ignasius Jonan told reporters on Tuesday when asked about the prospects of a deal. ""I don't know. Let's see.""
GOLDMAN SEES DEFICIT

Some analysts including  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Macquarie have said oil prices will correct sharply if OPEC fails to reach a deal, potentially going as low as $35 per barrel. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), one of the most active banks in oil trading, said it saw prices averaging $45 a barrel until mid-2017 even without any OPEC deal and added the market was likely to move into a deficit in the second half of 2017. 
A year ago, Goldman was saying a global glut would push oil prices to around $20. Prices fell to multi-year lows of $27 per barrel in January 2016.
Besides disagreements with Iran and Iraq, Saudi Arabia has also signaled it was unhappy with Russia's position.
Oil ministers from OPEC members Algeria and Venezuela traveled to Moscow on Tuesday to try to persuade non-OPEC Russia to take part in cuts instead of merely freezing output, which has reached new highs in the past year.

They made no comment as they emerged from their meeting. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said he had no plan to travel to Vienna but could meet OPEC once it reaches a deal.

State news agency Xinhua quoted Hu Zucai, deputy head of the National Development and Reform Commission, China's state planning agency, in a report on the forecasts on Tuesday. Hu said the industry currently employs more than 30 million people.
China is hoping that big outlays in the environmental sector will not only reverse some of the damage done by more than three decades of breakneck economic growth, but will also help diversify the country's heavy industrial economy.
Total investment in pollution prevention is expected to reach 8-10 trillion yuan over the 2016-2020 period, according to analysts with Everbright Securities. Spending stood at 4.3 trillion yuan over the previous five years, amounting to 1.45 percent of GDP, they said.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2016 10:40PM ET</span>","Bargain prices, rising cargo rates lift second-hand ship sales from the shallows","By Keith Wallis
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Sales of second-hand ships used to haul commodities such as iron ore, coal, grain and fertilizer have hit a seven-year high in 2016 as the industry creeps out of an eight-year downturn that has sunk several fleets of shippers.
Seaborne transport, which accounts for 85 percent of global trade, has seen a tentative recovery in the rates shippers charge to carry dry-bulk cargoes, which has encouraged buyers to jump at the bargain prices for second-hand vessels.
Nearly 560 such dry-cargo ships, which as a class make up half the world's merchant fleet, have changed hands in deals worth $4.3 billion up to the end of November, data from shipbroker Clarkson showed, the highest number since 2009.
""We've seen a lot of interest from Asian buyers in 10-15 year old ships, which is partly due to the surge in rates,"" said Ziad Nakhleh, managing director of Greek owner Teo Shipping Corporation.
""Mineral demand from China is one of the bright spots for dry bulk,"" he told Reuters.
Teo Shipping has put a 15-year old 74,107 deadweight tonne (DWT) panamax bulk carrier called the Cretan Wave up for sale at a price tag of $4.65 million, according to the nautisnp.com website.
It is one of thousands of dry cargo ships on the market at traditional and online brokers.
""We believe the sector is approaching a turning point after a long period of depressed rates,"" said Aristides Pittas, chairman and chief executive of dry bulk owner Euroseas (O:ESEA), which has recently agreed to buy the Capetan Tassos, a 16-year old 75,100 DWT bulk carrier for about $4.4 million.
After crashing to its lowest level on record earlier this year, the Baltic Dry Bulk Index (BADI), a basket of freight rates to transport dry raw materials like iron ore, coal and grain, has soared over 300 percent to 1,257 points, albeit still way off its almost 12,000 point peak from 2008.
""It does make more financial sense to buy second-hand at the moment than order new-builds, given the very attractive prices,"" said Ralph Leszczynski, head of research at ship broker Banchero Costa (Bancosta) in Singapore.
A five-year old 180,000 DWT iron ore and coal carrier costs around $24 million now compared with $39 million in 2014. A 10-year-old, 32,000-tonne ship to carry fertilizer, logs or steel products is worth around $6.8 million now against $12.5 million two years ago, according to data from shipping services firm Clarkson.
DEMAND-SUPPLY REBALANCING
The revenues those cheap ships can generate is on the rise. Average rates for large 180,000 DWT ships, known as capesize, had plunged to around $2,800 per day at the end of January, about 60 percent below daily operating costs of $7,200, but have since recovered to around $22,000 per day, ship broker data showed.
While some of the recovery is cyclical - the first quarter is traditionally the weakest for dry bulk cargo, and the fourth quarter the strongest - freight rates have been buoyed by a rebalancing in cargo demand and vessel supply.
The number of new ship orders dropped to its lowest level in more than 35 years in the first eight months of 2016, Clarkson figures show, while the scrapping of older dry cargo ships hit an all-time record in the first half of the year, says Bancosta.
Tougher controls from September 2017 on seawater pumped in and out of ships could see the demolition of up to 2,500 vessels in a global fleet of 9,500 dry bulk ships over 20,000 DWT, according to a report in mid-November by Bancosta.
Brokers and analysts said the cost of upgrading older vessels didn't make financial sense.
Cargo demand, meanwhile, is set to rise 1 percent this year after zero growth last year, Bancosta said.
""There are people thinking ship prices are cheap, and if they hold the vessel for two or three years they may see a serious return,"" said Nick Shaw, head of shipping at law firm Reed Smith in London.
For all that, after a downturn that triggered bankruptcies across the globe, including Korea's Hanjin Shipping, one of the world's biggest container shippers, the industry still has some way to go to return to health.
""Dry-bulk may be off the critical list, but it's still lying on a hospital bed feeling rather sorry for itself,"" said Martin Rowe, managing director of shipbroker Clarksons Platou Asia in Hong Kong.
And though the metrics have improved, the fleet size is still outgrowing the rise in trade, according to Clarkson - a 1.9 percent rise in bulk carrier tonnage versus a 1 percent rise in cargoes this year.

""We need more scrapping, no newbuildings, and expanded trade growth to restore the dry-bulk market to health,"" said Rowe.

1641,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 28, 2016 10:11AM ET</span>",OPEC outcome could mean $5 jump or $12 crash in oil prices - experts,"Investing.com - As headlines around the OPEC technical committee meeting in Vienna and whether oil producers within the cartel will be able to reach an agreement at their official meeting on November 30 caused extreme volatility in oil prices on Monday, experts looked ahead to what a potential deal over limiting crude output could mean both short-term and throughout 2017.
In September, OPEC, which accounts for a third of global oil production, agreed to cap output at around 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day versus the current 33.64 million bpd to prop up oil prices, which have more than halved since mid-2014.
However, no individual quotas were set at that meeting with details promised to be finalized at the official meeting set for Wednesday.
As of Monday, the OPEC technical committee continued to work out those details in Vienna.
A $12 crash or a $5 dollar jump?
JP Morgan put the chances of an agreement on Wednesday at 60%, but warned that a lack of a deal could take prices down to $35 to $40, depending on other factors such as weather or broader financial market stability.
On the other hand, Morgan Stanley warned that, although unlikely, “a strong announcement from OPEC to cut meaningfully (especially towards 32.5 mmb/d) could lift oil $5/bbl or more over the following days (as Algiers did), particularly if supported by strong words from non-OPEC, before focus shifts to execution risk, sustainability and any non-OPEC supply response.”
OPEC deal could set the path for oil prices in 2017
According to JP Morgan, while an agreement on output limits could frame price formation for all of 2017, an OPEC deal is not the only factor that these experts consider for the future price of oil.
Assuming that the cartel delivers on its self-imposed production constraint, JP Morgan predicts that oil could end 2017 in the $45 to $50 range if the new U.S. administration to be run by President-elect Donald Trump prioritizes trade sanctions over stimulus.
“However, the combination of US trade sanctions/weaker growth and the lack of an OPEC agreement risks sending oil prices back to retest the cycle low point as another four quarters of stock builds would weigh significantly on spot crude prices,” they warned.
Along the same lines, Morgan Stanley also believes that OPEC’s actions will determine the path for oil prices in 2017.
“If OPEC can cut production meaningfully, it could bring forward the timing of rebalancing and the next phase of the cycle where investment is incentivized,” these economists said.
Not unlike JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley analysts feel that oil prices show limited downside based on sentiment and position and expect them to continue to trade in the $40 to $55 range for much of 2017.
Ultimately, their 2017 outlook seems to hinge less on the outcome of the November 30 OPEC meeting.
“OPEC’s ability to support materially higher prices for all of 2017 may be limited, given a potential supply response (albeit with a lag), and the group’s poor history of complying with quotas,” these experts explained.
Volatile trade in oil as OPEC headlines fly
Trading on Monday was volatile with prices fluctuating depending on the headlines related to the output deal.
Last Friday, Saudi Arabia cancelled talks with non-OPEC producers such as Russia that were originally set for Monday, because it felt the cartel would need to sort out its differences first.
Over the weekend Saudi Arabia’s oil minister Khalid al-Falih said supply curbs may not be needed, saying prices will stabilize in 2017 without an intervention from OPEC.
The remarks were seen as an indication that an agreement on OPEC’s first production cut in eight years may not be reached in Vienna.
Supporting crude prices, oil ministers from Algeria and Venezuela were reported to travel to Moscow on Monday in a bid to persuade Russia to take part in cuts rather than merely freezing output.
Prices also jumped after Iraqi oil minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi said Monday he is “optimistic” that OPEC will reach an agreement that is acceptable to all this week.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is attempting to get its 14 member states, along with non-OPEC member Russia, to implement coordinated production cuts aimed at reducing a global supply glut that has seen oil prices halve in two years.
In September the producer cartel reached an agreement that would reduce production to between 32.5 million and 33 million barrels per day.
OPEC is to hold a meeting in Vienna on Wednesday, where the deal was expected to be finalized.
But reaching an agreement on a deal to cut output has proved problematic, with some producers reluctant to curb production.
Over the weekend Saudi Arabia’s oil minister Khalid al-Falih said oil prices will stabilize in 2017 without an intervention from OPEC.
The remarks raised fresh doubts over whether an agreement on OPEC’s first production cut in eight years would be reached.
Meanwhile, oil ministers from Algeria and Venezuela were to travel to Moscow on Monday and Tuesday, ahead of Wednesday’s key meeting, in a bid to persuade Russia to take part in cuts rather than merely freezing output.
Most analysts believe that some form of consensus will be reached, but doubts remain over whether it will be enough to support the market.
""An agreement to a large production cut could send oil prices closer to $60 per barrel before year's end, while failure to reach an agreement could cause oil prices to fall back to the low $40 per barrel,"" analysts at Nordea said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Monday, after falling as much as 2 percent in early trading, as the market grappled over the shaky prospect of major producers being able to agree output cuts at a meeting on Wednesday aimed at reining in global oversupply.
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) fell as far as 2 percent before clawing back to trade 29 cents at $47.44 per barrel at 1008 GMT (5:08 ET).
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) also recouped early losses and was trading up 15 cents at $46.21 per barrel.
The choppy trading came after prices tumbled more than 3 percent on Friday as doubts grew over whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would reach agreement to help curb global supply overhang that has more than halved prices since 2014.
On Sunday, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said that he believed the oil market would balance itself in 2017 even if producers did not intervene, and that keeping output at current levels could therefore be justified.
The statement added to simmering disagreement between OPEC and non-OPEC crude exporters such as Russia over who should cut production by how much. 
Analysts said that even if some form of an output restriction is announced after producers meet in Vienna on Wednesday, the details matter greatly.
""Do not take an announcement of a headline cut of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) at face value. It could still imply an OPEC production level considerably in excess of 33 million bpd, depending on developments in Libya and Nigeria and the speed and rigor of compliance,"" David Hufton, managing director of brokerage PVM Oil Associates Ltd. said in a note. 
He added that the stakes of failure are high for producer nations dependent on oil export revenue. 
""But one thing few, if any, analysts will disagree with is that if OPEC do not come up with a credible agreement to cut production on Wednesday oil prices will end the year below $40 bbl and be chasing down $30 bbl early next year,"" Hufton said. 
A meeting scheduled for Monday between OPEC and non-OPEC producers was called off after Saudi Arabia declined to attend, while concerns over the feasibility of a deal pushed the crude oil volatility index (OVX) close to a nine-month high.
Even if a cut is agreed, oversupply may not end soon.

The U.S. oil rig count rose by three last week, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said that ""since its trough on May 27, 2016, producers have added 158 oil rigs (+50 percent) in the U.S."".

Gold for December delivery was trading at $1,192.5 a troy ounce by 0934 GMT, after earlier rising as high as $1,197.00.

The dollar slipped lower on Friday as traders took advantage of the holiday-shortened week to take profits after a powerful rally propelled it to the highest level since April 2003.
Dollar selling resumed on Monday as investors looked ahead to potentially risky events such as Wednesday’s OPEC meeting and Italy’s upcoming constitutional referendum on December 4, which could see the government resign.
Investors were also looking ahead to a raft of U.S. economic data this week, including Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for November.
Gold is priced in dollars and becomes more attractive to holders of other currencies when the dollar falls.
Prices of the yellow metal have fallen around 6% so far this month on expectations that increased U.S. fiscal spending under a Trump administration will spur economic growth and inflation, which would ultimately lead to an era of higher interest rates.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2016 10:09PM ET</span>",Authorities say no plans to forcibly remove North Dakota protesters,"(Reuters) - U.S. authorities said on Sunday they had no plans to forcibly remove activists protesting plans to run an oil pipeline beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota, despite telling them to leave by early December.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the federal land where the main camp protesting the Dakota Access pipeline is located, said last week it would close public access to the area north of the Cannonball River on Dec. 5
On Sunday, the agency said in a statement that it had ""no plans for forcible removal"" of protesters. The statement said anyone who remained would be considered unauthorized and could be subject to various citations. It also said emergency services might not be adequately provided to the area.
""The Army Corps of Engineers is seeking a peaceful and orderly transition to a safer location,"" the statement said. ""This will reduce the risk of harm to people in the encampments caused (by) the harsh North Dakota winter conditions.""
A representative for the agency could not be immediately reached on Sunday to provide further clarification on its plans.
Organizers told a news conference on Saturday at the main protest site where about 5,000 people are camped that they had no intention of moving.
There are smaller camps on land not subject to the planned restrictions, including an area south of the Cannonball River where the Corps said it was establishing a free-speech zone.
Demonstrators have protested for months against the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline, owned by Energy Transfer Partners LP, saying it poses a threat to water resources and sacred Native American sites.
The companies say the pipeline would carry Bakken shale oil more cheaply and safely from North Dakota to Illinois en route to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.
The 1,172-mile (1,885-km) project is mostly complete except for the segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, less than half a mile (0.8 km) north of Standing Rock.
The Obama administration in September postponed final approval of a permit required to allow tunneling beneath the lake, a move intended to give federal officials more time to consult with tribal leaders. The delay also led to escalating tensions over the project.
Last weekend, police used water hoses in subfreezing weather in an attempt to disperse about 400 activists near the proposed tunnel excavation site.

""Libya is in such a dangerous economic situation, there is no way it can participate in OPEC production cuts for the foreseeable future,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla told delegates at the Arab-Austrian Economic Forum in Vienna on Friday, according to an NOC statement. 
Libya has more than doubled its national crude production to around 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) since several previously blockaded oil ports were reopened in September.
But output remains far below the 1.6 million bpd the country was producing before its 2011 uprising, and Libya has been rapidly depleting its foreign exchanged reserves.
Libya had already indicated its reluctance to curtail production, and this week OPEC will debate a proposal to cut production that would exempt Libya and Nigeria, another country where output has been hit by conflict. 

The NOC hopes to raise production to 900,000 bpd by the end of this year and to 1.1 million bpd in 2017, but the increases depend on the lifting of a blockade at pipelines serving the western fields of El Feel and Sharara.

""The proposal of Algerian Energy Minister (Nouredine Bouterfa) on the production of each country was presented today and carefully studied,"" Zanganeh was quoted as saying on Saturday after meeting Bouterfa in Tehran.
Bouterfa said Algeria's proposals called for 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in cuts by OPEC members and decreases totaling 600,000 bpd by non-members, SHANA reported.
""If OPEC members ... agree, oil prices will reach $50 to $55 next year and $60 by the end of the year,"" Bouterfa was quoted as saying.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is moving closer toward finalizing its first deal to limit oil output since 2008 but Iran has been a stumbling block because it wants exemptions as it tries to regain oil market share following the easing of Western sanctions in January. 
""We are to present our views about this proposal at the ... Nov. 30 OPEC meeting,"" Zanganeh said. ""The general trend and public statements suggest that OPEC can reach a viable agreement for its production and market management."" 

""If we can agree, and I am optimistic, (oil) prices will increase and this is also what the world economy demands.""

BISMARCK, N.D. (Reuters) - More than 30 activists protesting plans to run an oil pipeline beneath a lake near a North Dakota Indian reservation were arrested on Friday at a retail mall during a rally timed to coincide with the busiest shopping day of the year.
The rally was held at the main shopping center of North Dakota's capital city on ""Black Friday"" in a bid to draw more attention to a pipeline project that critics say poses a threat to water resources and sacred Native American sites.
The demonstrators, including members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, walked into the Kirkwood Mall in downtown Bismarck and formed a prayer circle just inside the entrance, defying demands by mall management that they leave the premises.
About 100 protesters gathered at the mall at shortly before 1 p.m. and at least 33 people were taken into custody for trespassing on private property after they disregarded repeated orders to disperse, police said.
The incident marked the latest in a string of protests against the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline, being built to carry Bakken shale oil from North Dakota to Illinois en route to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.
The 1,172-mile (1,885-km) project is mostly complete except for an especially controversial segment that is supposed to run under Lake Oahe, formed by a dam on the Missouri River, about a half mile from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation.
The Obama administration in September postponed final approval of a permit required to allow tunneling beneath the lake, a move intended to give federal officials more time to consult with tribal leaders. But the delay also led to escalating tensions over the project.
Confrontations between law enforcement and protesters turned violent again last weekend when police used water hoses in sub-freezing weather in an attempt to disperse about 400 activists near the proposed tunnel excavation site.
To protect the general public from violent confrontations, federal authorities on Dec. 5 will close off land north of the Cannonball River to the public and will set up a free speech zone on the south side of the river, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe officials posted on social media on Friday, citing a letter from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
The land being closed off does not include the Sacred Stone Camp, a point of resistance to the pipeline, south of the river. 

The authenticity of the letter from the Army Corps could not be verified by Reuters. Corps officials were not immediately available for comment.

BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. crude fell nearly 4 percent on Friday, dragged down by uncertainty over whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will reach an output deal, after Saudi Arabia said it will not attend talks on Monday with non-OPEC producers to discuss supply cuts. 
Brent crude futures settled at $47.24 a barrel, down $1.76 or 3.59 percent. U.S. crude futures settled down $1.90 a barrel at $46.06, a 3.96 percent decline. Prices continued to decline in post-settlement trading, dropping as low as $45.88 a barrel.
U.S. crude ended the week up 13 cents a barrel, after trading between $45.77 and $49.20 a barrel. Brent crude rose 20 cents during the week and traded in a range of $46.85 and $49.96 a barrel. 
Overall activity on both contracts was thin after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and ahead of the weekend.
Top OPEC oil exporter Saudi Arabia has told the producer group it will not attend talks on Monday with non-OPEC producers to discuss limiting supply, OPEC sources said, as it wants to focus on having consensus within the organization first.
""I think Saudi's announcement it would not to go to the meeting drove the initial sell-off,"" said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital in New York. ""There has to be a substantial cut and it has to be something that the street will believe.""
Russia still plans to attend lower-tier talks on Nov. 28 in Vienna ahead of the OPEC ministerial meeting on Nov. 30, a Russian source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Reports that state oil giant Saudi Aramco would in January increase oil supplies to some Asian customers also cast a shadow on markets, traders said.
A decline in China's October crude oil imports to their lowest on a daily basis since January added to the bearish tone.
But analysts said fundamentals were little changed - apart from concerns over the fate of next week's deal.
Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst with SEB Bank in Oslo said prices could rebound if the Nov. 30 meeting succeeded in reaching a targeted production cap of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day (bpd), from the 33.64 million bpd the group pumped in October.
On Thursday, the oil minister of non-OPEC nation Azerbaijan said OPEC was also pushing oil producers outside the group to make big cuts in output.
Most analysts expect some form of cut, but it is uncertain whether that would be enough to prop up a market dogged by oversupply since 2014.
""Oil market reaction will hinge on the credibility of the proposed action,"" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said, adding recent output increases to record levels in many countries now required a deep cut to lift prices significantly.
""The surge in OPEC output since August has shifted the market back into oversupply and re-balancing will be deferred until the second half of 2017 without a cut of at least 700,000 barrels per day.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Top OPEC oil exporter Saudi Arabia has told the producer group it will not attend talks on Monday with non-OPEC producers to discuss limiting supply, OPEC sources said, as it wants to focus on having consensus within the organization first.
The meeting was planned to discuss the contribution that producers outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will make to a proposed supply-limiting agreement. OPEC oil ministers meet on Wednesday to finalize the deal. 
""There is an official letter from (Saudi Arabia) saying (it is) not attending the meeting because the ministers should agree to the cut and then present the agreement to non-OPEC countries,"" an OPEC source said. ""This will be more effective‎.""
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is trying to finalize a September agreement that would reduce production to between 32.5 million and 33 million barrels per day. 
It aims to remove a supply glut and prop up oil prices, which at just over $48 a barrel are less than half their level of mid-2014.
The organization also wants non-OPEC producers such as Russia to curb output.
Despite extensive diplomacy since September, the OPEC side of the deal still faces setbacks from Iraq's call for it to be exempt and from Iran, which wants to increase supply because its output has been hit by sanctions.
A meeting of OPEC experts this week made some progress in how to implement the cut, but Iran and Iraq raised conditions for participating, according to sources.
""We have to solve our problems as OPEC first. We have not achieved an agreement within OPEC,"" a Gulf source familiar with Saudi oil thinking said on Friday.

""Before we meet with non-OPEC and ask them to participate in any action, we have to have an‎ agreement that is credible with clear numbers and a system that the market believes.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Thursday as uncertainty ahead of a planned OPEC-led crude production cut and thin liquidity during the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday kept traders from making big new bets.
At 1040 GMT (5:40 a.m. ET), Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were trading at $48.89, down 6 cents from their close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) was down 2 cents at $47.94 per barrel.
Traders said market activity was low due to the U.S. holiday, and there was a reluctance to take on big price bets due to uncertainty about a planned oil production cut, led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
OPEC is due to meet on Nov. 30 to coordinate a cut, potentially together with non-OPEC member Russia.
Russia could revise down its 2017 oil production plans if a global output freeze pact comes into force, effectively cutting output by 200,000-300,000 barrels per day, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday.
OPEC will probably propose other producers cut their oil production by 880,000 barrels per day for six months starting from Jan. 1 2017, Azerbaijan Energy Minister Natig Aliyev wrote in a local newspaper on Thursday.
But an OPEC source told Reuters that OPEC was yet to make a final proposal to non-OPEC countries on joint production cuts, which will be discussed on Nov. 28 in Vienna.
Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro said on Wednesday an OPEC deal to cut output and hike oil prices was ""imminent,"" and dispatched his oil minister to Russia to help bring other producers on board..
Most analysts believe some form of production cut will be agreed, but it is uncertain whether it will be enough to prop up a market that has been dogged by a supply overhang for over two years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
""We expect OPEC will reach an agreement at next week's biannual meeting in Vienna... If OPEC does successfully reach an agreement, prices are likely to test the year high in Brent of $53 per barrel,"" ANZ bank said in a note to clients on Thursday.

IEA Director Fatih Birol told Reuters in Tokyo on Thursday that even if production is cut, prices could soon come back under downward pressure again as the OPEC-led cut would enable U.S. shale oil drillers to massively increase their own output.

U.S. crude oil was up 18 cents or 0.38% at $48.11 a barrel at 1009GMT.
Global benchmark Brent futures were at $49.08 a barrel, up 13 cents or 0.29%.
Market sentiment remained subdued as traders continued to ponder a planned output cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, aimed at reducing a global supply glut and supporting prices.
OPEC is to meet on November 30 to decide on strategy for the first half of next year. The producer cartel is attempting to get its 14 member states along with non-OPEC member Russia to implement coordinated production cuts.
Reaching an agreement on a deal to cut output has proved problematic, with some producers, most notably Iran, reluctant to curb production.
The stronger U.S. dollar, which hit levels last seen in 2003 against a basket of other major currencies on Thursday, also weighed on prices.
A strong dollar, in which oil is traded, makes fuel purchases more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially curbing demand.
Prices found some support after the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday reported a larger-than-expected U.S. oil inventory drawdown last week.
Crude oil inventories fell by 1.25 million barrels last week, the EIA said.
That was compared to forecasts for a stockpile build of 0.67 million barrels after a build of 5.27 million barrels in the previous week.
The report came after the industry group the American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that its data showed a 1.3 million-barrel decrease in crude stocks last week."

Gold for December delivery was trading at $1,187.55 a troy ounce by 0946 GMT, after earlier falling as low as $1,179.75, a level not seen since February 8.
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, was last at 101.67, not far from highs of 102.11, the strongest level since early April 2003.
The dollar rallied after upbeat U.S. data and Wednesday’s Federal Reserve minutes cemented expectations for a rate hike next month.
The minutes from the Fed’s November meeting said an interest-rate increase was possible “relatively soon” if data indicated that the economy is improving. 
Some Fed officials explicitly called for a rate hike in December, the minutes showed.
Separately, data showed that U.S. durable goods orders rose at the fastest rate in a year in October and another report showed that a gauge of U.S. consumer confidence rose strongly in November.
According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, odds for a rate hike at the Fed's December 13-14 meeting are now at 100%.
Gold is priced in dollars and becomes more expensive to holders of other currencies when the dollar strengthens.
Prices of the yellow metal had already come under pressure this month amid the view that increased U.S. fiscal spending under a Trump administration will spur economic growth and inflation, which would ultimately lead to an era of higher interest rates.
Gold is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
Trade was expected remain quiet on Thursday; with U.S. markets closed for the Thanksgiving Day holiday.
Elsewhere in metals trading, silver futures for December delivery were at $16.34 a troy ounce, while copper futures traded at $2.65 a pound.
Copper prices have risen around 20% so far this month on expectations of rising demand from China and an increase in infrastructure spending in the U.S. when Donald Trump becomes president.

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's listed oil companies have slashed oil output by 2.4 percent so far this year during one of the industry's worst downturns as OPEC battles to agree on its first production cut since 2008.
The aggregated production of 109 listed companies that produce more than a third of the world's oil fell in the third quarter of 2016 by 838,000 barrels per day from a year earlier to 33.88 million bpd, data provided by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) showed.
By comparison, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries produced 33.64 million bpd in October. OPEC has struggled to agree on a joint production freeze or cut to support oil prices before its Nov. 30 meeting in Vienna.
In the second quarter of 2016, the companies reduced production by nearly 930,000 bpd, according to Morgan Stanley.
The firms include national oil champions of China, Russia and Brazil, international producers such as  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), as well as U.S. shale oil producers like EOG Resources (N:EOG) and Occidental Petroleum (N:OXY).
The drop in oil companies' output is particularly compelling given the increase in 2015, when third-quarter production rose by some 1.9 million bpd.
""Clearly, we have seen a large swing in the year-on-year trend in production, from strong growth as recent as a year ago, now to steep decline. This is the outcome of the strong cutbacks in investment,"" Morgan Stanley equity analyst Martijn Rats said.
Capital expenditure for the companies combined more than halved from $136 billion in the third quarter of 2014 to $58 billion in the same period this year, according to Rats.
Oil executives and the International Energy Agency have warned that a sharp drop in global investment in oil and gas would result in a supply shortage by the end of the decade.
Large oilfields, such as deepwater developments off the coasts of the United States, Brazil, Africa and Southeast Asia, typically take three to five years and billions in investment to develop.
Cost reductions and increased efficiencies have only partly offset the drop in production as a result of the lower investment. Technological advancements have also helped boost onshore U.S shale production.
""These declines should temporarily soften in 2017 as new fields are coming on-stream in Canada, Brazil, the former Soviet Union and U.S. tight oil probably stabilizes,"" Rats said. 
""Still, unless investment rebounds relatively soon, this steep downward trend is likely to resume in 2018 and beyond.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Investment in new oil production is likely to fall for a third year in 2017 as a global supply glut persists, stoking volatility in crude markets, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday.
""Our analysis shows we are entering a period of greater oil price volatility (partly) as a result of three years in a row of global oil investments in decline: in 2015, 2016 and most likely 2017,"" IEA director general Fatih Birol said, speaking at an energy conference in Tokyo.
""This is the first time in the history of oil that investments are declining three years in a row,"" he said, adding that this would cause ""difficulties"" in global oil markets in a few years.
Oil prices have risen to their highest in nearly a month, as expectations grow among traders and investors that OPEC will agree to cut production, but market watchers reckon a deal may pack less punch than Saudi Arabia and its partners want.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets next week to try to finalize to output curbs.
""Our analysis shows that when prices go to $60, we'll make a big chunk of U.S. shale oil economical and within the nine months to 12 months of time, we may see a response coming from the shale oil and other high-cost areas,"" Birol told Reuters, speaking in an interview on the sidelines of the conference.
""And this may again put downward pressure on the prices.""
Brent crude stood around (LCOc1) $49 a barrel on Thursday.
Birol said that level would be enough for many U.S. shalecompanies to restart stalled production, although it would takearound nine months for the new supply to reach the market.
The IEA director general said it is still early to speculate what Donald Trump's presidency in the United States will have on energy policies.
""Having said that, both U.S. shale oil and U.S. shale gas have a very strong economic momentum behind them,"" Birol said.

""Shale gas has significant economic competitiveness today, and we think it will be so in the next years to come.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices turned positive on Wednesday despite investor doubts that OPEC will agree to a production cut large enough to make a significant dent in the global glut of crude. 
Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will meet next week on Nov. 30 in Vienna to decide on the details of an agreement to cut output that the group has been trying to hammer out since September.
Oil prices were lower in the morning but turned positive after the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude stocks unexpectedly fell 1.3 million barrels last week. [EIA/S]
In the U.S. market, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures (CLc1) rose 8 cents to $48.11 a barrel by 12:35 p.m. EDT (1735 GMT) after trading between $47.40 and $48.43. 
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) were up 5 cents at $49.16 a barrel, also trading in $1-range between $48.56 and $49.50. 
Calendar spreads, the difference in price between one month and the next in the futures market, showed little signs that traders are pricing in a big change in market fundamentals. 
The front to second-month WTI calendar spread  traded at its widest level in seven months on Tuesday, although it narrowed slightly on Wednesday. The one to six-month spread  traded at one of the widest levels since August.
The WTI cash roll, which allows physical traders to roll long positions forward, traded down to negative $1.80 a barrel on Tuesday, the weakest since March.
All are indications that traders expect little change in oversupply in the market in the near term.
""Looking at the forward curve, the spread has gotten substantially weaker on the WTI side ... so that's bearish and pressures the front of the curve,"" said Tariq Zahir, an analyst at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York. 
""There's going to be some cut, but is Saudi Arabia really going to take the lion's share of the cut?"" 
Doubts remain over whether the group will agree to a proposed cut of 4 percent to 4.5 percent that has been discussed. That would imply a supply cut of more than 1.2 million barrels per day, according to Reuters calculations.
Iraq has been one of the more reluctant members to agree to a cut, but Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told reporters on Wednesday in Baghdad that they were willing to lower their output. 

Separately, non-OPEC member Russia has said it would cut production, but domestic oil companies have not worked out details, muddying the outlook for cutting output.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2016 08:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sonangol delays payments as it battles to reform,"By Libby George
LONDON (Reuters) - Angola's state oil company Sonangol has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars in debts and deferred payments to oil majors and contractors while its new chief, Isabel dos Santos, attempts to reform its operations.
Contractors say they have waited months even for small payments from Sonangol, which handles the oil and gas reserves of Africa's second-largest oil exporter.
The delays began following the appointment of dos Santos, the daughter President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, in June to root out waste and corruption at a company that was struggling even before oil prices plunged.
As she worked to unravel the company's myriad debts and repayments, outgoing cheques ground to a halt.
Contractors and sources close to Sonangol said it is months behind in payments to nearly every entity it works with, from cash calls worth hundreds of millions and smaller payments of hundreds of thousands. 
""They haven't paid us, but we are talking to them,"" a source at one contractor told Reuters. ""They're trying to make reforms but there is a cash flow problem."" 
Sources told Reuters that those owed included  Chevron  (N:CVX),  Total  (PA:TOTF),  BP  (L:BP),  ENI  (MI:ENI) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) [EXXO.UL]. Sonangol has asked for a moratorium on other debts until the end of the year, they said. 
This is the most significant effort yet to reform the central pillar of sub-Saharan Africa's third-largest economy and one of the continent's biggest companies.
Sonangol employs some of the Angola's most powerful people and its tentacles spread beyond energy to real estate and railways, and trucking to telecoms.
The appointment of dos Santos was itself controversial. Her father has ruled Angola since 1979 and government critics accuse his family and associates of enriching themselves while doing too little to spread the benefits of Angola's oil wealth to its people. Isabel runs a multinational business empire that has made her Africa's richest woman.
A group of lawyers has filed a lawsuit accusing the president of nepotism and violating Angolan probity by appointing her as head of the state oil firm. The supreme court last month ordered him to respond to the inquiry.
Isabel dos Santos has defended the decision, saying she had been picked for her expertise and competence.
GOVERNMENT COFFERS
At the start of the shake-up, she clipped the wings of the entire Sonangol legal department, barring them from conducting any external negotiations. This may have hindered sorting out payment complications.
She even booted out the hair-dressing and nail-bar salons that had set up shop inside Sonangol's Luanda headquarters to pamper the oil executives in their lunch and coffee breaks, according to one Luanda-based diplomat.
Former chief executive Francisco de Lemos Jose Maria, along with the rest of the board, was replaced in June when dos Santos took over.
Sources close to Sonangol said she had taken away Sonangol's ability to pay its own bills directly. Revenues from oil sales now flow directly to government coffers, where payments must be approved before they go out. 
The delays bubbled to the surface last month, when reports circulated that Chevron was demanding immediate payment of $300 million in unpaid cash calls – the money that Sonangol is required to pay for operations on oil and gas fields. 
Chevron declined to comment, but the talks prompted Sonangol to issue a rare statement about the troubles.
""This perfectly normal situation in the Angolan oil industry is not unique or isolated,"" the company said.
It had reached a plan for some $200 million in payments to Chevron, it added. 
""The difficult situation of the oil industry, marked by oil price fall, implies longer times of analysis and validation of expenses and invoices for costs and investments,"" it said.
Total's Patrick Pouyanne said the company has a strong relationship with Angola and when he met with dos Santos, ""we discussed more about new projects than cash difficulties"".
ExxonMobil declined to comment and ENI did not respond to a request for comment. 
Sonangol said in a statement that measures adopted over the past five months had allowed ""recurring savings of over $240 million per year"". 
HERCULEAN TASK
The troubles are a window into the Herculean task dos Santos faces in turning around Sonangol's fortunes during a prolonged oil price rout, and also of the concerns swirling around Sonangol and the government over a lack of transparency.
Watchdog group Transparency International ranked Angola 163 out of 168 countries in its index of perceived corruption in the public sector, and said it had ""minimal"" budget openness. 
Opposition groups have complained about the absence of any public discussion of the state's dealings, particularly what it said was a failure to shield citizens against the pain of low oil prices that led it to slash fuel subsidies and cut public spending.
Angola also cut off talks over a possible financial rescue package with the International Monetary Fund that would have forced it to diversify the economy and make a variety of reforms.
CHINA DEBT
Sonangol has already borrowed heavily from China, a major investor in Angola, which has limited its own access to oil cargoes to sell each month for more cash.
In January, it has none at all to sell, possibly for the first time. In August, it suspended a planned refinery upgrade and in September, it delayed delivery of two ships it had ordered from South Korea's Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, adding significantly to that firm's financial stress.
""It's right across the value chain,"" IHS analyst Roderick Bruce said. ""They've got money for certain things, clearly not for others.""
A source close to Sonangol defended the company's moves and said it was prudent to delay delivery of the vessels, postpone the refinery upgrade and comb carefully through every single payment to ensure money is spent properly. 
But the government's own financial fate, which is closely entwined with Sonangol, underscores the rough road ahead.
The IMF expects Angola's public debt to exceed 70 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of the year, despite government spending cuts.
""Sonangol has had problems accessing cash, but this is also partly due to a liquidity issue more generally in Angola, tied to access to dollars in particular,"" said Alex Vines, head of the Africa program at Chatham House. ""Add to that bureaucracy and significant debts and the delays that have been reported.""
Still, Vines and others said Sonangol's current struggles will not deter oil majors. Analysts and oil industry figures also believe that dos Santos may be the best hope to fix things.
""The scale of the Sonangol crisis convinced the presidency that deep structural reform was necessary,"" Vines said.

""Only somebody with full political backing such as Isabel dos Santos could ever have a chance at delivering the type of the reforms that are needed.""

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2016 05:53AM ET</span>","As Dakota pipeline saga drags, rancor builds on both sides","By Terray Sylvester
CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - The September decision by the Obama administration to delay final approval for the Dakota Access Pipeline was intended to give federal officials more time to consult with Native American tribes that have faced dispossession from lands for decades. 
But the delays have also caused increased consternation among company officials and led to growing violence between law enforcement and protesters, with both sides decrying the actions of the other in recent days. 
Energy Transfer Partners LP's (N:ETP) $3.7 billion Dakota Access project has drawn steady opposition from environmentalists and Native American activists, led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Their tribal lands are adjacent to the Missouri River, where federal approval is needed to tunnel under a 1-mile (1.6 km) stretch to complete the pipeline. 
The activist movement has grown steadily since the tribe established Sacred Stone Camp in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, in April, a temporary site founded as a point of resistance to the pipeline. The movement has remained strong even as temperatures have turned frigid. 
The most violent clashes took place over this past weekend. Police used water hoses in below-freezing temperatures to keep about 400 protesters at bay, a move criticized by activist groups, the American Civil Liberties Union and elected officials concerned about freedom of expression and the escalation of violence.
""Almost the entire camp was in shock,"" Salim Matt Gras, 64, of Hamilton, Montana, said at the main camp. ""They talk about using non-lethal weapons, but when you're talking about soaking people with freezing water in frigid temperatures, that's life-threatening.""
Morton County has said violent protesters have overshadowed the peaceful action by other activists. Police said they had recovered improvised weapons from the scene of the protest including slingshots and small propane tanks rigged as explosives. 
“We can use whatever force necessary to maintain peace,” said Jason Ziegler, police chief in Mandan, North Dakota, near Cannon Ball, in a statement Monday. He said the use of water is ""less than lethal"" compared with protesters' use of slingshots and burning logs.
Both protesters and law enforcement have released statements this week detailing injuries suffered by police and activists, with each side accusing the other of ratcheting up tensions. 
Sophia Wilansky, 21, of New York City, was struck on her left arm by a crowd-control grenade fired by police on Monday, according to a statement from Standing Rock's Medic and Healer Council. A spokeswoman for Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, where Wilansky was taken, confirmed she was in serious condition.
North Dakota officials said the explosion that injured the woman was still under investigation, but injuries to her arm were not the result of any tools or weapons used by law enforcement. They cited the recovery of three propane canisters at the site of the explosion.
Standing Rock officials disputed that claim, saying grenade fragments were removed from her arm.
THE BLAME GAME
There is still no official timeline for approval of the project. The pipeline, set to run 1,172 miles (1,885 km) from North Dakota to Illinois, was delayed in September so the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers could re-examine permits that would allow construction under the river.
On Nov. 14, final approval was delayed again for additional consultation. That set off executives from Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, which asked a U.S. district court to declare the project had the legal right to move forward and needed no further approvals. It said the delays were part of a ""sham process."" 
While President Barack Obama has said the pipeline could be re-routed, ETP chief executive Kelcy Warren has rejected that possibility, adding he is confident the pipeline will be approved once President-elect Donald Trump, who has been supportive of pipeline projects, takes office in late January. 
Two weeks ago, on Election Day, ETP said it was moving equipment to the edge of the Missouri River, and would ""commence drilling activities"" within two weeks of the move's completion. That, too, was seen as a provocation by protesters.
The delays have alarmed elected officials in North Dakota. Governor Jack Dalrymple has urged federal officials to resolve the permitting process and asked for additional support from federal law enforcement. A spokesman for the governor also blamed federal officials for allowing protesters to camp without a permit on federal property.
""They’re shirking their responsibility here and I don’t believe that they fully appreciate the seriousness of what we’ve got here,” spokesman Jeff Zent said of the federal government.
John DeCarlo, associate professor of criminal justice at the University of New Haven in Connecticut, said the state needs to take a more active stance or the situation could deteriorate.
""They have to stop and realize that this is going to take mediation, not force. There's no good that could come out of police using force against indigenous peoples and others who are protesting,"" said DeCarlo, who is also a former police chief.
Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, has for several months asked activists to refrain from violence. On Monday, he did not denounce their actions entirely, saying he believes law enforcement is trying to escalate violence. 

“Any time you’re backed into a corner, you react,"" he said.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Once at the heart of the global spice trade, Malacca is pumping nearly $3 billion into an ambitious plan to put itself in demand in a different hot commodity - oil.
The Malaysian state is reclaiming land along the Straits of Malacca to build a port that can handle the biggest tankers on the planet. The target: a slice of traffic sailing on to nearby Singapore, the top but congested trading hub in a region with $600 billion in annual oil trade - a third of global oil demand.
Funded largely by Chinese investors, port operator T.A.G. Marine and developer Linggi Base are building the 12.5 billion ringgit ($2.82 billion) Kuala Linggi International Port (KLIP) to offer storage, repair and refueling services. At Singapore, 200 kilometers away, ships can spend costly time just waiting to deliver or take on goods, refuel or undergo maintenance work.
With Singapore's port rules also banning floating storage and ship-to-ship (STS) transfers, the potential for savings and streamlined business is clear for KLIP users like trading company Agritrade Resources (HK:1131). 
""Through our clients who are oil majors and oil traders, we see a competitive edge in locating our floaters (storage facilities) in KLIP resulting from lower costs and less congestion,"" said Ng Xinwei, Chief Executive of Agritrade, which owns three supertankers.
Using 620-acres of reclaimed land, KLIP this month launched construction of a port with 1.5 million cubic meters of oil storage capacity, and dry docks to handle the biggest of oil tankers, hoping for completion within a decade.
KLIP is aware business is now dwarfed by Singapore, which handles well over 100,000 vessel calls a year, compared to KLIP's few thousand per year. KLIP did not provide targets, but analysts estimated it could handle three times current volumes within a decade.
""Many of the shipyards in Singapore have been fully booked for three years,"" said Saifullah Noor, Chief Executive of T.A.G. Marine. ""Given the close proximity, we aren't competing with Singapore, but are actually complementing them.""
PORT SERVICES IN DEMAND
Officials in Singapore did not comment on specific developments in Malaysia, but have previously said that growth in oil markets is strong enough to warrant further investment.
That's a view shared among shipping industry executives, though some also see significance in Malacca's project being backed by Chinese investors. 
""I see this as a mainly China-led real estate investment project, under the 'belt-and-road' umbrella of Chinese economic expansion into south-east Asia,"" said Ralph Leszczynski of shipping brokerage Banchero Costa.
The project is the latest in a string of developments trying to capture a piece of Asia's rising oil demand. But while the waterways along the Straits of Malacca and Straits of Singapore - some of the busiest in the world - have created huge demand for port services, success is not guaranteed.
Malaysia's Asia Petroleum Hub project, to the West of Singapore, launched in 2005 but was wound up in 2012 amid ballooning costs.
GETTING IT RIGHT?
At KLIP, operator T.A.G. Marine remains confident that the early stages of the port development project show a track record of success that can continue. 
KLIP now has one of the region's largest STS cargo transfer and floating oil storage zones, and has already handled some of the world's largest oil supertankers, like the ultra large crude carrier ""TI Europe"" - half a kilometer long.
Singapore clients have been paying attention. 
One future potential KLIP customer is Singapore-based Toyota Tsusho Petroleum, part of Japanese trading company Toyota Tsusho Corp (T:8015). The fuels supplier has signed a memorandum of understanding with T.A.G. Marine to explore bunkering. 
""In KLIP, we have a newly developing port that will allow us to diversify our operations and better deploy our resources,"" said Nobuyuki Iida, Toyota Tsusho Petroleum general manager.
Beyond the infrastructure, industry players say there's a need to streamline some of Malaysia's processes and regulations.
""To get it right, (bunker suppliers) need support from the (Malaysia) government to have proper pricing and support from oil majors for cargoes to be competitive with Singapore,"" said Wan Mohd Fauzi, director of Malaysia-based bunker fuel supplier Alamgala Resources.

1677,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2016 01:11AM ET</span>","For Standing Rock Sioux, new water system may reduce oil leak risk","By Ernest Scheyder
(Reuters) - For months, North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux tribe has been protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline's planned crossing under the Missouri River, adjacent to their lands, in part due to worries about contamination of their primary water source. 
As of early next year, however, the Native American tribe will be gathering their water 70 miles (113 km) downstream of the oil pipeline's location, thanks to a long-awaited water treatment plant.
The reservation, which spans North and South Dakota, currently gets water 20 miles away from the pipeline's planned location.
While the scope of contamination of a future oil leak is difficult to predict, the distance from the pipeline to the new intake could reduce widespread contamination risks, regulators and environmental analysts said.
The Standing Rock Sioux say the new supply point is not enough to ease their concerns over the pipeline. The developer behind the pipeline,  Energy Transfer Partners LP  (N:ETP), has vowed not to reroute the line.
""Just because the new intake is 70 miles away doesn't mean our water is still not threatened,"" said David Archambault, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. 
The project, which has received little attention in the months-long fight over the Dakota Access pipeline, has been a goal for the Sioux for more than a decade. It was first funded in 2009.
The $3.7 billion Dakota Access pipeline is intended to carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico. The tribe and climate activists have been protesting for months; a final decision has yet to be reached. 
COMPLEX RURAL PROJECT
The Sioux received about $30 million from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to build a new water treatment plant, pump station, 5 million-gallon storage tank and several pipelines to feed fresh water to roughly 10,000 reservation residents.
The project has taken years to complete, but federal officials say the timeline was not affected by the Dakota Access controversy.
The existing intake valve is located in a shallow part of the Missouri River near Fort Yates, North Dakota, roughly 20 miles from the planned pipeline river crossing. 
The new valve in Mobridge, South Dakota, 70 miles from the pipeline route, came online earlier this year. Once the pipeline system is completed, it will service the entire reservation, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation.
The Missouri River typically moves at about 5 to 8 miles per hour in the upper Midwest, meaning it would take nine to 14 hours for oil to reach the tribe's new intake valve. 
""The new intake really does effectively reduce the concerns that this oil pipeline could impact the tribe's water supply,"" said Julie Fedorchak, head of North Dakota's Public Service Commission, which gave state approval to the pipeline. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency would not speculate on how a leak could affect the new water system. ""Circumstances related to oil releases can vary significantly,"" said EPA spokesman Richard Mylott.
State officials have repeatedly said they believe the pipeline poses few safety risks. 
Regional and federal regulators look to a recent spill as instructive for Standing Rock. In January 2015, an oil pipeline leaked more than 1,000 barrels into the Yellowstone River near Glendive, Montana, forcing officials to flush the city's water treatment pipes after tests revealed hydrocarbons in the water supply.
That would be ominous for the tribe were the Fort Yates intake value to remain, even though Fedorchak and other regulators note the Dakota line is to be buried 92 feet (28 m) below the riverbed in hard clay. 
Following the Montana leak, water quality tests in Williston, N.D., roughly 80 miles downstream, showed its water supply was not polluted, as it was able to close intake valves quickly.
Tribal officials said the danger remains. They also say the project's construction has already damaged historical sites with religious significance to the tribe, and further construction could cause more destruction. 

""If this pipeline breaks, it's not only going to pollute our drinking water, but destroy the environment,"" Archambault said.

1678,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2016 01:09AM ET</span>","OPEC to debate oil output cut next week but Iraq, Iran hesitate","By Alex Lawler and Rania El Gamal
VIENNA/DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC will debate an oil output cut of 4.0-4.5 percent for all of its members except Libya and Nigeria next week but the deal's success hinges on an agreement from Iraq and Iran, which are far from certain to give full backing.
Three OPEC sources told Reuters a gathering of experts from the oil producer group in Vienna had decided on Tuesday to recommend that a ministerial meeting on Nov. 30 debate a proposal from member Algeria to reduce output by that amount.
Such a cut would bring OPEC's current output down by more than 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), according to Reuters calculations based on the group's October production, and is towards the upper end of market expectations.
But sources also said the representatives of Iran, Iraq and Indonesia had expressed reservations during talks that continued for 11 hours about their level of participation in what would be the group's first supply-limiting deal since 2008.
Brent oil futures were trading slightly up at around $49.2 per barrel at 2010 GMT, having lost most of their earlier gains of around $1 a barrel. 
In September, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to reduce production to between 32.5 million and 33.0 million bpd - an effort to prop up prices - from OPEC's own latest production estimates of 33.64 million bpd.
OPEC's deal faces potential setbacks from Iraq's call for it to be exempt and from Iran, which wants to increase supply because its output has been hit by sanctions.
Iraq's foreign minister said on Tuesday in Budapest that OPEC should allow Iraq to continue raising output with no restrictions.
BIG BARGAIN
Iran and Iraq raised certain conditions for participating in the deal, according to sources, who were not allowed to speak on the record because the experts were meeting behind closed doors.
Sources said Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies have signaled they were prepared to cut close to 1 million bpd of their output.
The Algerian proposal would see all member countries, except Nigeria and Libya, cutting 4-4.5 percent from OPEC's estimates of their October production with the aim of reaching a total output target of 32.5 million bpd, OPEC sources have said. 
That would mean Saudi Arabia alone could cut up to 500,000 bpd, sources said.
OPEC's own estimates, based on what it calls ""secondary sources"", are usually lower than countries' direct submissions to the organization.
Under the Algerian proposal, Iran was asked to cut 4.5 percent from almost 4 million bpd, according to sources. But Tehran has signaled it wants to cut from higher levels of 4.1-4.2 million bpd, one of the sources said.
Iraq was asked to cut about 200,000 bpd. Baghdad is also still debating whether it should cut from the levels of OPEC's estimates or its own, higher, production figures.
""Eighty-five percent of proposed OPEC cuts are from Gulf countries but Iran is still not in favor,"" one source said. 
Non-OPEC producer Russia was also still not agreeing to cut production but favoring a freeze, a senior OPEC delegate said.

""This will make it difficult for OPEC alone to rebalance the market and bring prices up,"" the source said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Tuesday after earlier rising to their highest levels this month as a growing consensus emerged in the market that OPEC would overcome internal disputes and strike a deal to reduce crude output.
But the market remained sensitive to comments from officials attending a technical meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) which was trying to hammer out the details of an agreement before the formal meeting on Nov. 30.
Brent futures (LCOc1) were up 27 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $49.17 a barrel by 10:51 a.m. EST (1551 GMT). U.S. crude (CLc1), meanwhile, were down 6 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $48.18 per barrel. Brent came within 4 cents of $50 earlier in the session, its highest since Oct. 28.
The premium of U.S. futures for the second month  over the front-month  climbed to 91 cents, its highest since April, as OPEC rhetoric boosts later dated crude futures.
After weeks of doubts over the resolve of the 14-member cartel, most oil market participants now believe OPEC would harm its reputation if an output cut deal were not struck next week. 
""It now appears the cartel will patch together a deal designed to reduce production by as much as three-quarters of a million barrels per day,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory Ritterbusch & Associates said in a note, giving the probability of such a deal as 80-90 percent.
Prices on Tuesday were initially boosted by comments from a Nigerian official attending the OPEC technical meeting that it was likely all countries would be ""on board"" by the end of the day.
But they briefly slumped back into negative territory after OPEC sources told Reuters agreement to a 4.0-4.5 percent output cut by all members aside from Libya and Nigeria would still hinge next week on the backing of Iran and Iraq.
OPEC is trying to bring its members and non-OPEC producer Russia to agree on a coordinated cut to prop up the market, beset by a two-year glut in supplies, by bringing production into line with consumption.
It said at the end of September it aimed to cut production to between 32.5 million and 33 million barrels per day compared with its recent record output of around 33.8 million bpd. 
While a ceiling for overall OPEC production may be agreed by Nov. 30, it is unclear whether clear quotas per member state would be set. Some countries, such as Nigeria, Iraq, Libya and Iran, argue they should be exempt because their output has been hit by conflict or sanctions.
""Ultimately, it looks as if Saudi Arabia and its allied Gulf neighbors will reduce production on their own,"" analysts at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
""No ground-breaking agreement on production caps or cuts should be expected from the OPEC meeting. The oil market is likely to remain oversupplied for some time yet even after the OPEC meeting, especially since U.S. oil production will soon start rising again."" 

U.S. crude inventories have been building for three straight weeks but were forecast to have slipped about 300,000 last week, ahead of data from the American Petroleum Institute at 4:30 p.m. (2130 GMT).

VIENNA/DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC experts have made some progress on the first day of a two-day meeting to nail down details of their plan to cut oil output, OPEC sources said on Monday, with some expressing optimism about the prospect of a final deal.
The second meeting of the High-Level Committee began at 0930 GMT (04:30 a.m. ET). The committee is a technical body comprised mainly of OPEC governors and national representatives - officials who report to their respective ministers.
More than seven hours later, the first day's talks had yet to conclude but delegates said they were making headway and the meeting was scheduled to resume on Tuesday at 0900 GMT (04:00 a.m. ET).
""Some progress,"" one of the delegates said. A second delegate said he was optimistic that the 14-country OPEC would reach a final agreement when its oil ministers meet in Vienna on Nov. 30.
Another source said there were ""some concerns"" from Iran, but discussions were ongoing and was confident there would be a deal on Nov. 30.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed in September to reduce production of crude oil to a range of 32.5 million to 33 million barrels per day, its first output cut since 2008, to prop up prices.
The deal faces potential setbacks from Iraq's call for it to be exempt and from countries including Iran, Libya and Nigeria whose output has been hit by sanctions or conflict and who want to raise supply.
A first meeting of the High-Level Committee, held in October, failed to reach agreement. One issue at the talks was the level at which Iran would be expected to freeze its output, sources told Reuters.
But in recent days, ministers and officials have said OPEC was moving closer toward dealing with sticking points and most members were prepared to offer Iran flexibility on production volumes.

The committee does not decide policy and will instead make recommendations to the OPEC ministerial meeting on Nov. 30.

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2016 11:48AM ET</span>",Exclusive: BP ring-fences CEO Dudley from Iran decision-making,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) -  BP  (LON:BP) has created a new executive committee to explore business in Iran which will exclude its American chief executive Bob Dudley in a bid to avoid potential violations of U.S. sanctions still in place.
The new committee is headed by BP's chief financial officer Brian Gilvary, who is a British national. Gilvary will coordinate the oil major's operations in Iran and any discussions with the country's national oil company, according to industry sources.
The move highlights the lengths to which multinationals will go to exploit lucrative new business in Iran, which is only slowly emerging from years of isolation that crippled the OPEC member's energy-reliant economy.
The election of Donald Trump has added to uncertainty over Tehran's push for foreign investment to revive its economy. The republican president-elect has criticized the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that curbed Tehran's nuclear ambitions in return for the lifting of some economic sanctions. 
A lack of clarity over the terms of new production contracts Tehran has yet to finalize, difficulties facing the banking system due to continued U.S. sanctions, and companies' severe budget constraints due to lower oil prices have kept most firms on the sidelines.
Sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran, which prevent U.S. companies from dealing with Iran, remain in place.
Total was the first major western company to sign a deal with Iran earlier this month on further development of the giant South Pars gas field in the Gulf. Norway's DNO has also agreed to study the development of the Changuleh oil field in western Iran.
BP's new executive committee also includes Bernard Looney, upstream chief executive, who is Irish, Dev Sanyal, chief executive of alternative energy and executive vice president, regions, an Indian national, and General Counsel Rupert Bondy, a Briton.
""The separate governance structure does not involve Bob or any other U.S. citizens and was set up for Bob's own protection,"" one source said.
A BP spokesman had no immediate comment.
The London-listed oil major has been working to mend its relations with Washington since the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, and has agreed to pay more than $50 billion in fines and clean up costs. Dudley, who took BP's helm from Tony Hayward shortly after the incident, was instrumental in the process.
BP, which was founded more than a century ago as the Anglo-Persian oil company, has yet to sign any deals with Iran. 
Last month, Dudley said: ""Iran is a large oil and gas province ... We're going to have to be very careful. We don't want to violate any sanctions.""

NIOC has extended the period for international oil companies to submit their pre-qualification documents for Iran's first oil tender until Dec. 4, the state-run firm said on its official website on Monday.

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 21, 2016 11:39AM ET</span>",Oil at three-week high ahead of OPEC decision on output,"By David Gaffen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose over 3 percent to a three-week high on Monday, catching a lift from a weaker dollar, as major oil producing countries appeared to be moving closer to agreeing to limit output.
Brent crude oil has risen 11 percent in a week since Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, started a diplomatic charm offensive to persuade the group's more reluctant members to join its proposed output plan. OPEC members are due to agree a world oil freeze pact with non-OPEC countries on Nov. 30. 
In the last several days, several members of the group, including Iran, along with non-member Russia, have suggested they are likely to agree to a deal to limit output.
""When you’ve got all of the major players on board with a production cut, obviously you're very close to getting a deal done,"" said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. 
""You never know with OPEC - sometimes they go to the last minute and there are a lot of false starts."" 
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) rose $1.67 to $48.53 a barrel by 10:46 a.m. ET (1546 GMT), having touched $48.62, the loftiest level since Nov. 1. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) (CLc1) strengthened by $1.56 to $47.25 a barrel, after climbing as high as $47.33.
The dollar (DXY) also edged lower, easing off last week's 13-1/2-year highs as Treasury yields nudged lower, bolstering oil and the broader commodities complex including copper  and gold <XAU=>.
Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note that the odds of an OPEC cut succeeding have increased, and believe the global oil surplus will shift into a deficit by the middle of next year, which would support prices. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin said he saw no obstacle to freezing oil output, which at more than 11 million barrels per day is at a post-Soviet high. 
OPEC members last week proposed a deal for Iran to cap, rather than cut, output.
Iran has been one of the main hurdles facing any curtailment, as Tehran wants exemptions to try to recapture market share lost under years of Western sanctions.
Libya and Nigeria, whose exports have been hampered by violence, have also asked to be left out of any deal. Nigeria's oil production fell to 1.63 million bpd in the third quarter from 1.69 million in the second quarter.

Hedge funds took a more cautious stance on oil prices amid the flurry of OPEC diplomatic, cutting their combined net long position in the three major Brent and WTI futures and options contracts by just 3 million barrels to 422 million barrels in the week ending Nov. 15.

Two energy industry sources told Reuters earlier on Monday that the meeting, which was expected to discuss possible output curbs, had been delayed until Dec. 19. 

""The commission was postponed as the agenda is still being worked out. Work with Russian oil companies is being regularly carried out by the energy ministry. There are no separate meetings scheduled by the president,"" Peskov said.

1692,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 21, 2016 10:11AM ET</span>",Oil climbs on hopes for OPEC output cut deal,"Investing.com - Oil prices climbed on Tuesday, as market sentiment was boosted by growing expectations that major oil producers will come to a deal to rein in output at a meeting next week.
U.S. crude oil was up $1.34 or 2.87% at $47.66 a barrel at 0950 ET.
Global benchmark Brent futures were at $48.13 as barrel, up $1.27 or 2.69%.
Oil prices were boosted following reports that the energy ministers from Iraq and Iran were backing a proposed OPEC output cut aimed at curbing oversupply that has pressured prices lower for over two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is to meet on November 30 to decide on strategy for the first half of next year.
But many market analysts remain skeptical of the potential deal, amid uncertainty over how any agreement would be implemented.
OPEC reached an agreement to limit production to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day at a meeting in September.
But production by OPEC members hit a record high in October of 33.64 million barrels per day.
Reaching an agreement on a deal to cut output has proved problematic, with some producers, most notably Iran, reluctant to curb production.
Iran has ramped up production in a bid to regain market share after international sanctions against it were lifted last January.
Analysts also warned of potential volatility in the oil market this week, with trading volumes expected to be lower ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday and Friday.

(Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters opposed to a North Dakota oil pipeline project they say threatens water resources and sacred tribal lands clashed with police who fired tear gas at the scene of a similar confrontation last month, officials said.
An estimated 400 protesters mounted the Backwater Bridge and attempted to force their way past police in what the Morton County Sheriff's Department initially described as an ""ongoing riot,"" the latest in a series of demonstrations against the Dakota Access Pipeline.
A statement from the agency said one arrest had been made by 8:30 p.m. local time (0230 GMT Monday), about 2 1/2 hours after the incident began 45 miles (30 miles) south of Bismark, the North Dakota capital. About 100 to 200 protesters remained after midnight.
The Backwater Bridge has been closed since late October, when activists clashed with police in riot gear and set two trucks on fire, prompting authorities to forcibly shut down a protesters encampment nearby.
The Morton County Sheriff's Department said officers on the scene of the latest confrontation were ""describing protesters' actions as very aggressive.""
Demonstrators tried to start about a dozen fires as they attempted to outflank and ""attack"" law enforcement barricades, the sheriff's statement said.
Police said they responded by firing volleys of tear gas at protesters in a bid to prevent them from crossing the bridge.
Activists at the scene reported on Twitter that police were also spraying protesters with water in sub-freezing temperatures and firing rubber bullets, injuring some in the crowd.
Police did not confirm those reports, but later said protesters had hurled rocks, striking one officer, and fired burning logs from slingshots.
The clashes began after protesters removed a truck that had been on the bridge since Oct. 27, police said. The North Dakota Department of Transportation closed the Backwater Bridge due to damage from that incident.
The $3.7 billion Dakota Access project has been drawing steady opposition from Native American and environmental activists since the summer.
Completion of the pipeline, set to run 1,172 miles (1,185 km) from North Dakota to Illinois, was delayed in September so federal authorities could re-examine permits required by the Army Corps of Engineers. 
Plans called for the pipeline to pass under Lake Oahe, a federally owned water source, and to skirt the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation by about half a mile. Most of the construction has otherwise been finished.
The Standing Rock tribe and environmental activists say the project would threaten water supplies and sacred Native American sites and ultimately contribute to climate change. 

Supporters of the pipeline, owned by Energy Transfer Partners, said the project offers the fast and most direct route for bringing Bakken shale oil from North Dakota to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and would be safer than transporting the oil by road or rail.

Brent oil for January delivery on the ICE Futures Exchange in London rallied to an intraday peak of $47.72 a barrel, the most since November 2. It was last at $47.60 by 4:00AM ET (09:00GMT), up 69 cents, or 1.47%.
London-traded Brent futures logged a gain of $2.11, or 4.5%, last week, after posting losses in each of the past four weeks.
Elsewhere, crude oil for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange inched up 69 cents, or 1.49%, to $47.05 a barrel, after touching $47.20 earlier, a level not seen since November 1.
Last week, New York-traded oil futures rose $2.28, or 5%, after three straight weekly declines.
Russian President Vladimir Putin sees a “high probability” that an agreement to curb oil production will be reached at a meeting later this month.
Speaking at a news conference in Lima after an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Sunday, Putin said Russia is willing to freeze its crude oil output at current levels.
Meanwhile, Iraq’s oil minister Jabbar al-Luaibi said late Sunday the country plans to offer three new proposals this week aimed at bolstering the unity of the group.
Additionally, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said it’s “highly probable” members will reach a consensus, according to comments published by the country’s Shana news service.
Speculation that OPEC is moving closer toward finalizing its first deal since 2008 to limit oil output mounted amid reports that member countries proposed Iran cap its oil output at 3.92 million barrels per day (bpd) in a meeting on Friday. Tehran has previously said it would accept a freeze at between 4.0 and 4.2 million bpd.
The oil group reached an agreement to cap output to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held in Algeria in late September. However, OPEC said it won’t finalize details on individual output quotas until its next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.

1698,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 21, 2016 02:34AM ET</span>",Gold ticks up but holds near 6-month low on U.S. rate hike hopes,"Investing.com - Gold prices ticked higher in European hours on Monday, but held near the lowest level since May on expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike and fiscal stimulus by President-elect Donald Trump.
Gold for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange tacked on $6.15, or 0.51%, to $1,214.85 a troy ounce by 3:33AM ET (08:33GMT). It fell to $1,201.30 on Friday, a level not seen since May 30.
Market analysts warned that the outlook for gold remains cloudy in the near-term, given a U.S. interest rate hike in December is now a near-certainty.
According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, odds for a rate hike at the Fed's December 13-14 meeting are at 100%.
Prices of the yellow metal are down more than 7% so far this month amid optimism that increased U.S. fiscal spending under a Trump administration will spur economic growth and inflation, which would ultimately lead to an era of higher interest rates.
The precious metal is sensitive to moves in U.S. rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.
The greenback hovered close to the prior session's 14-year high against a basket of major currencies early on Monday, amid a rally driven by the U.S. presidential election and expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month.
The dollar index was recently at 101.20, after climbing to 101.54 on Friday, a level not seen since April 2003.
A stronger U.S. dollar usually weighs on gold, as it dampens the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Meanwhile, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury was down 0.4 basis points at 2.333% in early trade, pulling back from a 12-month high of 2.364% set late last week.
Also on the Comex, silver futures for December delivery inched up 7.9 cents, or 0.48%, to $16.70 a troy ounce during morning hours in London, after falling to its lowest level since June 8 at $16.43 on Friday.
Elsewhere in metals trading, copper futures rallied 5.2 cents, or 2.11%, to $2.521 a pound, amid expectations that President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to ramp up fiscal spending and cut taxes will spur economic growth and inflation.
The metal is regarded as a leading indicator of the global economy. It is used in the construction of buildings, power generation and transmission and the manufacture of consumer electronics.

On the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil for January delivery tacked on 37 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $46.86 a barrel by close of trade Friday. It rallied to $47.62 the day before, the highest since November 2.
For the week, London-traded Brent futures logged a gain of $2.11, or 4.5%, after posting losses in each of the past four weeks.
Elsewhere, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in December inched up 27 cents, or 0.59%, to end the week at $45.69 a barrel. The contract touched $46.58 on Thursday, a level not seen since November 1.
New York-traded oil futures rose $2.28, or 5%, on the week, after three straight weekly declines. The December contract expires at the end of Monday’s session.
OPEC is moving closer toward finalizing its first deal since 2008 to limit oil output, with most members prepared to offer Iran significant flexibility on production volumes, ministers and sources said on Friday.
Several OPEC oil ministers including Saudi Arabia's Khalid al-Falih met in Doha on the sidelines of a gas forum Friday. Iranian officials attended the gathering although minister Bijan Zanganeh did not come.
At the meeting, OPEC member countries proposed Iran cap its oil output at 3.92 million barrels per day (bpd), according to a source familiar with the proposal.
Iran has previously said it would accept a freeze at between 4.0 and 4.2 million bpd.
The oil group reached an agreement to cap output to a range of 32.5 million to 33.0 million barrels per day in talks held in Algeria in late September. However, OPEC said it won’t finalize details on individual output quotas until its next official meeting in Vienna on November 30.
If OPEC reaches a deal at the end of the month, it may also draw support from non-OPEC members including Russia, which promised to cooperate but so far has refrained from any firm commitment.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak participated in Friday's meeting and said he thought OPEC was moving closer to a deal. If an agreement were reached, Russia was prepared to join and cap output for six months or longer, Novak said.
Oil's gains were capped after oilfield services provider Baker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week rose by 19 to 471, marking the 11th increase in the last 12 weeks.
Prices were also weighed by a broadly stronger U.S. dollar, which climbed to a 14-year high against a basket of other major currencies, amid a rally driven by the U.S. presidential election and expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month.
Dollar-denominated oil futures contracts tend to fall when the dollar rises, as this makes oil more expensive for buyers in other currencies.
In the week ahead, trade volumes are expected to remain light around Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday and Friday's shortened trading session.
Market participants will eye fresh weekly information on U.S. stockpiles of crude and refined products on Tuesday and Wednesday to gauge the strength of demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.
Oil traders will also continue to pay close attention to comments from global oil producers to gauge their readiness on freezing or cutting output.
Ahead of the coming week, Investing.com has compiled a list of these and other significant events likely to affect the markets.
